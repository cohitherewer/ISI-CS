 Different strategy for each bowler: Hussey

 Mike Hussey 
Melbourne: In a veiled warning to Anil Kumble and his men, Michael Hussey said every Aussie batsman will have a separate strategy for each Indian bowler in the Test series starting in Melbourne on Wednesday. 
The left-hander said the hosts had not left any stone unturned in their preparation and would come hard at the Indians. 
We have done quite a bit of preparation  video footage and all. We have faced them before. All guys will have their own plan on how to handle different bowlers, said Hussey, a tower of strength in the middle-order with a Bradmanesque average. 
As for the pitch, Hussey conceded it was more in favour of batsmen these days at the MCG. 
The pitches have changed. I believe it is a bit more batter-friendly. We will just have to wait until we get there to assess the conditions. 
Husseys attention was drawn to the fact that the tourists struggled on Day I of the tour opener and that Rahul Dravid would be opening in Tests. 
Sometimes it is difficult for touring teams to adapt and adjust to the conditions as soon as they get to Australia. 
I dont think I would be reading too much into their first outing... Come Boxing Day, everything will be different. 
As for Dravid, I am not sure if he is going to open in Tests or not. He is a quality player, a world class player, and he has been that for such a long time. For someone of that class, Dravid could bat anywhere in the order. If he opens, he is going to do as good a job as at No. 3, 4, 5, 6 or even 10. 
Hussey also admired the Indians tenacity to keep going after so many matches. 
The amount of cricket they have played in the last one year has been tremendous. They are playing very good cricket and have good momentum going. They also have good form behind them. 
They have a lot of experienced cricketers who have played in Australia and done well. I am expecting one of the toughest challenges we have had in quite some time.

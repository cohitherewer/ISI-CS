 Ones picked bring something very special to the table: Bedi
 - Charismatic former India captain selects his dream Indo-Pak XI LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL Bishan Singh Bedi Calcutta: Bishan Singh Bedi, Indias captain during the first Revival Series (1978-79, in Pakistan), picked his dream Indo-Pak XI for the benefit of The Telegraphs readers. The selection was limited to those who played from the late 1960s, the time Bedi got picked for India. Here goes: On the criterion in selecting his XI Ive picked solid players... Batsmen with that character and authority-stamping bowlers... I havent, for example, selected a wristy artiste like Gundappa Viswanath... Then, Ive wholly been guided by the players value to the team... The ones picked do bring something very special to the table. On his XI (in batting order) SUNIL GAVASKAR: There hasnt been a better batsman to drop anchor and compile runs... In my book, the best. SAEED ANWAR: Given his attacking style, he would complement Gavaskar well... Plus, his selection makes it a left-right combination. That helps. JAVED MIANDAD: I have him at No.3 largely to give him more time to get under the oppositions skin! Ive always rated him very highly. SACHIN TENDULKAR: Just cant think of anybody else in that position... Do I actually need to justify picking him? RAHUL DRAVID: Given his reputation and record, Rahul has to make the XI. But, as Ive explained, not at No.3. INZAMAM-UL HAQ: An attacking batsman who could be counted upon in a crisis. WASIM BARI: Hes the best keeper Ive seen... In fact, even Alan Knott would concede that Bari was better behind the stumps. Bari could bat, but that hasnt been a consideration. Ive selected the best keeper. He rarely dived, rather he would reach the ball. And, so cleanly. IMRAN KHAN: Few people know just how hard he worked at his bowling... He walks into my team. WASIM AKRAM: He had such natural ability and could do anything with the ball. WAQAR YOUNIS: Like Akram, could bowl in all conditions ... His record speaks for itself... Another hard worker. ANIL KUMBLE: Is remarkably consistent... I love his never-say-die attitude and Ive never seen him with shoulders drooping... Whatever the circumstances, his body language remains good. That he hasnt been a big turner and hasnt been an athlete has made no difference to me. On his captain Oh, Imran... A born leader... He made such an impact as captain... If somebody dropped a catch, people wouldnt look at the poor fielder but at Imran, to see how he reacted... He was that kind of a leader... Imran had that aura. On having had to ignore a Kapil Dev (After a pause) Im feeling bad... But, then, the three new-ball bowlers Ive picked were all better in their trade... Ive selected the best for every position and, sadly, Kapil couldnt be there... He would be my 12th man, though... Nobody in India or Pakistan has been a better all-round fielder. On his reserves Viswanath, Erapalli Prasanna and Jawagal Srinath... Abdul Qadir and Sarfraz Nawaz have been unlucky to miss out. On whether his XI could beat Clive Lloyds awesome team of the late Seventies and early Eighties I think so... Both that West Indies side and Ricky Pontings Australians... Its for your readers to judge, but Ive picked a team which could well be called invincible... I would pay to watch them... Finally, on his choice for coach (Laughs) Greg Chappell! Seriously, the XI Ive selected wouldnt need a coach. No cricket manager either.

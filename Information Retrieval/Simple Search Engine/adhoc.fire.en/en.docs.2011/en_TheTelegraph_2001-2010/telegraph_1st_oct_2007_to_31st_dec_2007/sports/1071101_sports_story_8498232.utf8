 WICB asked to probe Samuels
A STAFF REPORTER Marlon Samuels Calcutta: The last has not been heard of the Marlon Samuels controversy vis--vis the Nagpur ODI earlier this year. According to an ICC release on Wednesday, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has been instructed to investigate allegations of inappropriate activity by the right-handed batsman in the first of four ODIs, played at the VCA ground on January 21. This was decided at the two-day ICC Board meeting in Dubai. Samuels made a 60-ball 40 in a high-scoring match which the West Indies lost by 14 runs. A fortnight later, the Nagpur police said they had evidence of the West Indian batsman passing on information to a bookie just before the match. The 26-year-old Samuels was allowed to play in the World Cup in the Caribbean in March-April. The ICC  which received a report from the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit  got it reviewed by the Code of Conduct Commission chairman, Michael Beloff QC. As per Beloffs recommendation, the ICC has asked the WICB to carry out an investigation and then report to an Official Enquiry. The WICB investigation must be completed within three months. The deadline for submitting its findings to the ICC is January 31, 2008. The Official Enquiry will comprise Beloff and two other Code of Conduct Commission members not connected with the WICB. The Official Enquiry will review the findings of the WICB investigation and make recommendations to the Executive Board. It will also judge if a sanction is applied by the WICB, whether it is appropriate given the nature of the conduct under investigation. Provided the members of the Official Enquiry are satisfied that the investigation was carried out in a satisfactory manner, they may either ratify the WICB decision and any sanction imposed, or recommend to the Executive Board that alternative sanctions be imposed, which may be more onerous. It has been alleged that Samuels has breached the following ICC Code of Conduct Regulations: C4 (ix) Received any money, benefit or other reward (whether financial or otherwise) which could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute; and/or C4 (xiv) Has engaged in any conduct which, in the opinion of the (ICC) Executive Board... is prejudicial to the interests of the game of cricket.

 Move to prevent fixing 
Brisbane: Tennis Australia is keen to prevent match-fixing at the Australian Open. Chief Executive Steve Wood said on Wednesday that the association had hired a security consultancy firm and formed a working group to ensure player integrity at the years first Grand Slam in January. These measures are designed to ensure that we address the issue of player integrity generally and illegal gambling specifically, Wood said. He said the security review would address potential vulnerabilities. The working group will liaise with police, examine match-fixing in other sports and prepare a plan to expose instances of illegal conduct. I want to stress that we are continuing to work closely with the governing bodies of world tennis to coordinate a collective and comprehensive approach towards protecting the integrity of our sport, Wood said. While we have never had a reported match-fixing incident in Australia, were taking the situation seriously as its an emerging issue for tennis administrators worldwide.  (REUTERS)

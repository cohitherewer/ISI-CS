 Hamilton crashes out, title for Raikkonen
 - Finns victory opens up a three-way championship race in Brazil  Kimi Raikkonen with the trophy in Shanghai on Sunday. (AP) Shanghai: McLarens Fernando Alonso had prayed for a miracle to stay in the Formula One title chase after crashing out of last weekends Japanese GP and his wish was granted in China on Sunday. But he may still need another, or at least some strange results and some very lucky moves, to be champion for a third year in a row. The Spaniard, 12 points behind teammate Lewis Hamilton at the start of the penultimate race of the season, finished second while the 22-year-old British rookie suffered the first retirement of his 16-race Formula One career. The gap at the top was slashed to just four points, with only the Brazil race remaining, while Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen remained in a three-way title scrap after a victory that left him seven points off the lead. Ferraris Brazilian Felipe Massa third. Hamilton has 107 points, Spaniard Alonso 103 and Raikkonen 100 after taking the 200th win of Ferraris Grand Prix history. This eight points is a help for sure, said Alonso. Hopefully I can do a good race (in Brazil). But for the championship, I still need something really dramatic if I want to win. With a normal race, it will be impossible. I think it will be very difficult in the championship because I know that it will not be easy to take four points off Lewis. The final race of the season is at Sao Paulos Interlagos circuit on October 21 and will see three drivers still in contention for the first time since 1986. Alonso, who won both of his titles with Renault, could never have expected such a turnaround with the race seeming to have Hamiltons name on it from the moment he roared off from pole position in the lead. The Spaniard had qualified fourth, a situation that put him in a black mood on Saturday while McLaren bosses did not attempt to hide their delight in Hamiltons performance. I am very happy now, said Alonso, whose relationship with his team has steadily disintegrated over the season in the face of a spying controversy and the rise of Hamilton as a championship favourite. Yesterday I did not say anything that is not true, he continued, alluding to comments he made to Spanish reporters on Saturday criticising the team for their treatment of him since he joined from Renault. The team has been saying many bad things about me, from Spa onwards especially, so the relationship didnt change too much, he added. He (McLaren boss Ron Dennis) was the first one to say that he was not speaking with me and things like that. From that point, I understood that the championship was not going to be easy for me. Alonso said that even when he saw Hamiltons car stuck in the gravel on the big screen as he was lapping, he had felt little emotion. The Briton skidded into the gravel trap as he pitted for the second time, leaving the car stuck despite the efforts of marshals to push him free. I didnt know if he was retiring or not, said Alonso. At the Nuerburgring I saw on the big screen that he was in the gravel and then he was on the track again with the recovery car, so I didnt know if it was a definite retirement or not. Hamilton started the race with one hand on the crown, needing only to win or finish ahead of Alonso and Raikkonen to become the youngest of champions. Raikkonen, whose cause had looked desperate only a day before, has emerged as a renewed threat to McLarens hopes of a first title since Mika Hakkinen in 1999. Were back in the championship and itll be interesting in the last race, said Raikkonen, who took his career tally of wins to 14 with his fifth of the season. Anything can happen, we just have to try to win the last race and then see. Toro Rossos German Sebastian Vettel finished fourth, his teams best performance by far and also their first points of the season, with Briton Jenson Button a surprisingly strong fifth for struggling Honda. Italian Vitantonio Liuzzi was sixth for Toro Rosso, with Nick Heidfeld seventh for BMW Sauber and David Coulthard taking the final point for Red Bull. CHINESE GP RESULTS 1.

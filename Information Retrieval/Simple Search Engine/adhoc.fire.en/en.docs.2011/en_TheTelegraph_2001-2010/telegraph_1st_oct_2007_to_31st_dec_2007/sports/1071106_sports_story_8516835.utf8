 Stakes high for East Bengal
 - Defence remains a concern for Mohun Bagan
 -  Carlos non-committal on Manju debut A STAFF REPORTER Mohun Bagans Brazilian duo Douglas da Silva (left) and Jose Ramirez Barreto during practice at the club ground on Monday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Alvito DCunha, frowning his eyes and stressing on every word, pointed out that East Bengal would be out to exorcise the ghost of their 3-4 first-leg defeat to Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Their coach (Carlos Roberto Pereira) must be living in a make-belief world if he thinks it would be an encore on Tuesday. Its unwise to predict the outcome of a derby. Dont forget we are the Federation Cup champions We won it by beating all leading teams including Mohun Bagan. I can vividly remember how their coachs face looked like after we beat them in Ludhiana, said Alvito, who is in scintillating form this season and holds the key for East Bengals success against their arch-rivals. Sparks are bound to fly when its derby time anyway, but the playmakers comment is linked to East Bengals need of the hour: a win to queer Mohun Bagans pitch in the title race. As things stand, East Bengal, with 25 points, trail the leaders by two points after 11 matches. Stoking the match-eve fire further, red-and-golds coach Subrata Bhattacharya also made an allusion to their last league defeat against the green-and-maroons. For the fans, a win in this match is more important than the league itself. Last time, East Bengal (under Carloss guidance) won the title, but Mohun Bagan beat them in both derbies. We have lost one and its time to make it 1-1. A few minutes later in the nearby Mohun Bagan tent, Carlos tiptoed around the subject of Tuesdays Sahara CFL Premier Division clash with caution, saying that he would approach the challenge only after knowing how the wind blows. For the veteran Brazilian (Tuesday it will be the 1065th match of my career as coach), hes concerned more about settling his defence than sending another set of verbal volleys. The possibility of N.S. Manjus Maidan debut still hangs in balance as the coach wants to be hundred per cent sure of Indias No.1 defenders fitness. I want to keep options open regarding the Manju issue. If he plays, Ill start with the usual 4-4-2 formation, if not, its going to be a 3-5-2, Carlos said. Bhaichung  hours away from leading for the first time in a derby in Calcutta  was, however, more forthright. We dont need to draw motivation from anyone elses words. It comes from within. Everything depends on how mentally charged the players will remain from 2.45pm Tuesday, he said. If Mohun Bagan fans get doe-eyed at the prospect of a Bhaichung-Jose Ramirez Barreto combination for the first time this season, they also have something more to boast of: Douglas da Silva, who have never lost a high-voltage match in his career. Stakes are therefore higher for Bhattacharya. Despite the triumph in Ludhiana, the former India defender  himself a veteran of 70-odd derbies  knows nothing can be sweeter than making it 1-1 at home. Bhattacharya dwelt the maximum part of Mondays closed-door practice on set-piece moves and crosses from the wings in a move to exploit Mohun Bagan rearguards aerial weakness. It remains to be seen whether Bhaichung and his brigade can stand up to the challenge and burst the Federation Cup champions bubbles.

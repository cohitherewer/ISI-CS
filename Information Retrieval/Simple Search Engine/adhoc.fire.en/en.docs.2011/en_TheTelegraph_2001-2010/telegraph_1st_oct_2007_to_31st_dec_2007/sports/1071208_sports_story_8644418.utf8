 Didnt dream that one day Id be leading India in Bangalore

 - Its going to be a pretty emotional moment when I go for the toss, says Test captain Anil Kumble 
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
Bangalore: Irrespective of the third and final Tests result, it will remain special for Team India captain Anil Kumble. The Chinnaswamy Stadium, after all, is where he honed his skills to emerge Test crickets third most successful bowler. 
On Friday, Kumble had his first formal media interaction as captain on home turf. Briefly, he also spoke to The Telegraph. 
The following are excerpts: 
On captaining on home ground 
Its very special... Ive spent my life playing here and its going to be a pretty emotional moment when I go for the toss... 
On whether he remembers the first time he visited the Stadium 
(Grins) Cant remember when, but I think it was for a Ranji match, probably Karnataka versus Tamil Nadu... The capacity wasnt so much then, but I think it was a full house that day. 
On his first match at the Stadium 
Not sure... Perhaps at the club level... I didnt even dream that, one day, I would be leading India in Bangalore... 
On the job that awaits Team India 
Well, the onus is on us... Weve got to make sure that we win the series. 
On the challenge he expects from Pakistan 
Theyll definitely come hard at us and were ready... Weve got to ensure we play to potential and focus on our strengths... If we do, I dont see why we wont get the result we want. 
On Pakistan having won the last time (2005) here 
This is going to be a new Test. 
[Pakistan, in fact, have won the last two Tests theyve played in Bangalore  the other being in 1987, Sunil Gavaskars last.] 
On whether back-to-back Tests make it difficult for a high degree of intensity to be maintained 
These days, thats the demand of international cricket... Unfortunately, theres little rest between matches and, so, youve got to make the most of the few days that you get off... Its important to switch off, relax and return rejuvenated... 
On the catching not being up to the mark 
Weve got to take the half-chances too and that has been conveyed. 
On the new-ball bowlers in the squad lacking experience 
Yes, its a relatively inexperienced attack, but I look at things positively... Its a great opportunity for the youngsters and theyve got to do well to seal a place... (Irfan) Pathan has done well in Test cricket and (Vikram Rajvir) Singh has played at the highest level... Ishant Sharma as well. 
On Gautam Gambhir having been called as a cover for Sachin Tendulkar 
Thats just in case somebody is unfit on the morning of the Test... We needed a backup. 
On Yuvraj Singh 
Initially, the idea was to rest (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and play Yuvraj... He deserves a chance, but weve got to wait and see things (after the Sachin development). 
On the wicket 
Didnt see it today (Friday), saw it briefly yesterday... 
On the inclement weather 
Its not in my control. 
Finally, on the captaincy drama in the Pakistan camp 
(Laughs) Whats clear is that Ill be going for the toss!

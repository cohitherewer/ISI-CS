 Negi off to a flier
 Parimarjan Negi Yerevan (Armenia): Parimarjan Negi got off to a flier in the World Junior Chess championship, defeating Dagur Arngrimsson of Iceland in the opening round here. Indias latest Grandmaster G. N. Gopal also got off to a fine start accounting for Filip Pancevski in a one-sided affair while three-time Indian junior champion and GM-in-waiting Abhijeet Gupta too had little difficulty in disposing off Martin Zvarik. It also turned out to be an excellent day for top seed and hot favourite Dronavalli Harika in the girls section being played simultaneously. Reigning under-18 girls world champion Harika, who is in reckoning for the title here, is expected to get stiff competition from second seed Elena Tairova of Russia, who also scored a comprehensive victory in the opener against Ghazal Hakimifard of Iran. The Indian girls had a much better day than boys as all of them won their first round games. Women Grandmaster Eesha Karavade, Mary Ann Gomes, Soumya Swaminathan, Padmini Rout and P. Priya ended on the winning side besides Harika.  (PTI)

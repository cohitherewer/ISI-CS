 Analyst: Woolmer tests unclear
Kingston: Toxicology tests on Bob Woolmer showed conflicting results as to whether he had ingested poison, a Jamaican forensic analyst told the inquest into the Pakistan cricket coachs death on Friday. Marcia Dunbar testified that evidence of the pesticide cypermethrin had been found in blood and urine samples. Of three samples of blood taken from Woolmer, Dunbar said one tested for cypermethrin while the others had not. Asked by Jermaine Spence, an attorney representing the International Cricket Council (ICC), if this was unique, Dunbar replied: I am not sure. Woolmer died on March 18 after he was found unconscious in his Jamaica hotel room a day after Pakistan lost to Ireland in the World Cup. When police said they were treating the former England players death as murder, it sparked speculation that the case could be linked to corruption in the game. However, in June, Jamaican authorities said they were no longer treating the death as homicide. Dunbar, who is a 26-year veteran at Jamaicas government forensic science laboratory, said there were traces of the tranquiliser chlorpromazine in samples from Woolmers stomach and that he had some alcohol in his system. She said that an analysis of bile samples did not reveal the presence of dangerous drugs and toxins, but added that urine samples allegedly taken from Woolmers body revealed the presence of cypermethrin. The results from the examinations and analysis of a host of other exhibits, including items such as the sink basin pipe in Woolmers room and beverages found there, showed no signs of cypermethrin. Controversial pathologist Ere Sheshiah, who performed the autopsy on Woolmer and originally concluded that he had died from asphyxia caused by manual strangulation, testified this week that he now believes Woolmer died of asphyxia caused by manual strangulation associated with cypermethrin poisoning. Three overseas pathologists brought in to review the case have testified that they believe Woolmer died of natural causes, probably related to heart disease. The trio have criticised Sheshiahs techniques. The inquest, presided over by coroner Patrick Murphy and 11 jurors, is expected to end on November 9. Testimony continues on Monday.  (AFP)

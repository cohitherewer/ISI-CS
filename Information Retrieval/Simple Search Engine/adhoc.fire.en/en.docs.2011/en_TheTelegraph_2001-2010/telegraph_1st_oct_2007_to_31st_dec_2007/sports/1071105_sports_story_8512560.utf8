 Im fine as long as I dont think of pressure, says Shoaib
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Shoaib Akhtar Guwahati:Shoaib Akhtar may not be the Establishments favourite, but clearly enjoys the maximum following in India. It was evident when Pakistan landed in New Delhi and got reinforced when Shoaib Malik and his men were waiting to board the New Delhi-Guwahati flight on Sunday morning. Sure, some did buttonhole (vice-captain) Younis Khan and Shahid Afridi, but dozens came to where Shoaib was sitting with the rather quiet Mohammed Yousuf. If Srinagars Sohail Umar thanked Shoaib for inspiring him to become a quick, petite Pooja Nanda made him autograph a Rs 500 note. Pehle aap yeh note mujhe de deejiye, Shoaib quipped as the lady blushed. Then, when somebody short and thin introduced himself (rather unnecessarily) as hailing from Gujarat, Shoaib gave him a look-over and said: Accha, but I thought Gujaratis were well-built Chaliye aap hi sahi Shoaib is under pressure to deliver big, but hasnt allowed that to sit on his shoulders. Look, if I become conscious about pressure, then I wont be able to perform Im fine as long as I dont think of pressure, he told The Telegraph. The temperamental 32-year-old added: At this stage of my career, I want to enjoy my bowling Once the enjoyment is there, performances are bound to follow Bus seedhi si baat hai. Shoaib, who will be slapped with a life ban (by the Pakistan Cricket Board) if he features in another act of indiscipline, has been around for a decade. Footnote: Be it at New Delhi airport or on the flight, barring one or two, nobody in the Pakistan squad looked perturbed by the rather dramatic developments back home. Salman Butt, Kamran Akmal and Umar Gul, for example, had iPods for company. For most, gup-shup kept them occupied. Everythings fine, pointed out manager Talat Ali, who has the headmasters look.

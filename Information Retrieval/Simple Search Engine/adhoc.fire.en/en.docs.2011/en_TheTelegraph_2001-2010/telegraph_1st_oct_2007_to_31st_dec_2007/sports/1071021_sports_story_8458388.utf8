 Shoaib, Asif key: Waqar
Karachi: Waqar Younis feels that the fitness of pace spearheads Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif would be crucial to Pakistans chances during their tour of India next month. I think it is important for Asif and Akhtar to be 100 per cent fit. You need completely fit bowlers to play in the tough Indian conditions, the former Pakistan captain said. Waqar said he enjoyed his stint as bowling consultant with the Pakistan team and was open to helping them again if asked. I enjoyed working with the bowlers If they come to me on their own and ask for guidance, I will certainly help them out. I am always available for the players, he assured. Waqar added that he had not accepted a coaching assignment with New South Wales. He clarified that he had been approached, but had to say no because of television commentary commitments. I will be going to India next month for Pakistans tour and have other assignments after that. So taking up any other job is out of question right now, he said. In the near future I will definitely look at coaching assignments because I want to be involved with young players and be on the field. For the moment, though, I am enjoying my television work and looking forward to the India tour, he said.  (PTI)

 Riquelme nets a brace in Argentina win
Buenos Aires: Midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme, an outcast at his club Villarreal, scored from two majestic free-kicks to give Argentina a 2-0 win over Chile in their opening World Cup qualifier on Saturday. Riquelme, who has not played for his Spanish club this season after falling out with coach Manuel Pellegrini, curled his first effort into the top right-hand corner from the edge of the area in the 27th minute. The mercurial midfielder produced an even more impressive shot from around 30m to increase Argentinas lead in the 45th minute and upstage teammate Lionel Messi. Chiles problems increased when defender Cristian Alvarez was sent off in the 54th minute for crashing into Javier Mascherano. I was in luck, Riquelme said. The important thing is that Argentina keep winning. Argentina coach Alfio Basile said he was always confident in Riquelme. People can think what they like about Riquelme, Basile said. When I selected him, I knew he had been training well. A player of his standard is not going to forget how to play football. The match was an unhappy homecoming for Chiles Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa, who was in charge of Argentina from 1998 to 2004. (reuters)

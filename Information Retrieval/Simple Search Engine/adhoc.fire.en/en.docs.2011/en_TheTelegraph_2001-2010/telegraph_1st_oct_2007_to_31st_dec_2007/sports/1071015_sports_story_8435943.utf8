 Sourav: I had to go for shots 
INDRANIL MAJUMDARNagpur: It has been more than four years since Sourav Ganguly got the last of his 22 one-day hundreds. That was in the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Kenya. On Sunday, he came close to getting one but fell 14 runs short when he holed out in the deep to Brad Hodge. Theres nothing much I could do about it The situation demanded that I go for shots and I kept the teams interest in mind, the former Team India captain told The Telegraph after missing a well-deserved century. Was his dismissal was the turning point of the match? No The run rate had climbed to eight an over and it was extremely difficult. India had achieved a similar target in the recently concluded one-day series in England and Sourav cited the difference in the two teams strengths for Sundays loss. Theres a hell of a difference between England and Australia. The quality of bowling is different and theres a lot more variation Dont forget they are the world champions, he pointed out. It feels nice when you have contributed to a winning cause. But today We had reached a stage when we needed to go for runs Singles wouldnt have helped. A target of 318 against Australia is always tough. Had we been able to restrict them to around 280 it would have been more realistic, he said. The series may have been decided but Sourav is staying focused. Theres no reason to take the last match lightly. A victory against Australia always helps you mentally It could be the ideal boost before our series Down Under.

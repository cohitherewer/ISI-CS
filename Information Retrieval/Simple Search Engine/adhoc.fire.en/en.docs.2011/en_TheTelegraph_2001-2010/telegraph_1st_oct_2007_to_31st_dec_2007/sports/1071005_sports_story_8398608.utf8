 Shah sets up 65-run win
 Owais Shah during his knock of 82 on Thursday Dambulla: England batsman Owais Shah scored 82 to set up a 65-run victory as his side levelled the series against Sri Lanka in the second ODI on Thursday. His 92-ball knock guided England to 234 for eight after they had collapsed to 61 for four. The hosts slumped to 126 for nine before a last-wicket stand of 43 between Jehan Mubarak (44 not out) and Dilhara Fernando (20) lent their effort some respectability. Shah shared partnerships of 78 with skipper Paul Collingwood (42) for the fifth wicket and then 70 with Graham Swann (34) to lift the tourists. Ryan Sidebottom removed Upul Tharanga (8) with his second ball and claimed the prized scalp of Sanath Jayasuriya (10), who was playing in his 400th ODI. Jayasuriya increased the lead over Sachin Tendulkar for the number of ODI appearances by three. Kumar Sangakkara was dropped twice early and battled for 54 minutes for his nine before nicking a catch behind off Stuart Broad. Sidebottom, Collingwood, Broad and Swann finished with two wickets apiece.  (REUTERS)

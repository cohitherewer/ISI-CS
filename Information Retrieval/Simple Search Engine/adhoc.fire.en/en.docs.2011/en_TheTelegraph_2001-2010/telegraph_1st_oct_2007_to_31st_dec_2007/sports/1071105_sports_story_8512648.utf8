 Medal scrapes home 
 STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Poor fields, notwithstanding, the seasons opener, on Sunday, managed to produce an entertaining sport in spite of sun playing hide and seek. Even occasional showers, early in the afternoon, failed to dampen the spirit of race-enthusiasts, though favourites were hard-pressed to perform. Four of them managed to strike  including the Javed Khan-trainee, Olympic Medal, in the Compassionate Cup. However, it was jockey C. Alfords skill and power that gained the day on the five-year-old mare. Earlier, the jockey had guided Compliment and Romantic Quest to victory in their respective events.RESULTS				 										1.

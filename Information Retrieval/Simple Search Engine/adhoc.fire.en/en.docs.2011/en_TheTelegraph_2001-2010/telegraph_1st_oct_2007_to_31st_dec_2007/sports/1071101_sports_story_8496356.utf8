 Revamped course may help Shiv
Sentosa: Shiv Kapur will tee off for the $4 million Barclays Singapore Open at the Sentosa Golf Club on Thursday. New bunkers and 120 yards have been added to the course while the club has also designed new greens. Kapur is high on confidence after a solid season on the European Tour and while the revamped course might bother some of his peers, the Indian will be banking on his straight-hitting game to come out with flying colours. He has been paired with Prom Meesawat and Charles Howell III. Other Indians in the fray are Gaurav Ghei, Rahil Gangjee, S.S.P. Chowrasia, Amandeep Johl, Gaganjeet Bhullar, Digvijay Singh, Harmeet Kahlon, Uttam Singh Mundy, Arjun Singh and Gurbaaz Mann. Defending champion Adam Scott will look to become the first to win three titles in a row here. He has had one win on the US Tour this year. Phil Mickelson, making his debut here, could make life difficult for Scott. The world No. 2 has won three titles this season despite a niggling wrist injury.  (PTI)

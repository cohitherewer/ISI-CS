AC Milans Kaka has been crowned Fifas World Player of the Year. Barcelonas Argentina forward Messi came second, and Manchester Uniteds Portugal winger Ronaldo was in third place. 
Already this year Kaka has won the Ballon dOr award for the European Footballer of the Year and FIFPros world player of the year, voted by fellow professionals. 
Kaka collected more points than the combined total of the other two nominees, Fifa said after the ceremony. He won 1,047 votes while Messi won 504 and Ronaldo picked up 426. 
Chelsea and Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba was fourth on 209. Barcelona and Brazil playmaker Ronaldinho, winner of the award in 2004 and 2005, came fifth. 
Kaka has had a great year for AC Milan, helping them to win the Champions League. 
The Brazilian playmaker said at the awards ceremony in Zurich: Tonight is a really special night for me  it was a dream for me just to play for Sao Paulo and one game for Brazil. But the Bible says God can give you more than you even ask for. 
I had always thought about winning this award. But there are always doubts until it is actually confirmed. It is not just this award but the whole year that has been very nice. 
Winning the Champions League and everything that has happened, its just been wonderful. 
All three youngsters were nominated for the first time. 
Kaka, 25, said: It shows that this is a new era in football, a new cycle is starting. They were great players before, but now the new players are starting to make history. 
Kaka received his prize from compatriot and three-time World Cup winner Pele, who himself received the Fifa Presidential Award for his lifetime contribution to the sport. 
Pele said Kakas success with the national team had helped set him apart from the other nominated players. 
Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi have played some great football this year but they are not yet the most prominent players in their national teams, Pele said. 
Kaka has been playing at this level for Brazil for four years now, he helps out in midfield and he is also a great example off the pitch. 
Hes the complete player. 
Compatriot Marta won another award for Brazil when she was named Womens World Player for the second year running.

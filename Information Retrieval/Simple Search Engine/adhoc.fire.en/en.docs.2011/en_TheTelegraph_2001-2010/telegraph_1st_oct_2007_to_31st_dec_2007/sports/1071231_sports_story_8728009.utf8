 Rafael Nadal targets Olympic glory

Chennai: Spaniard Rafael Nadal has targeted the 2008 Beijing Olympics after ending a third consecutive year as world No. 2 behind Swiss maestro Roger Federer. 
The 21-year-old French Open champion is the top seed at the Chennai Open starting Monday where he will also play in the doubles with compatriot Bartolome Salva-Vidal. 
I like doubles a lot, when I can I play a lot of doubles, Nadal told reporters on Sunday. This year there is special significance because of the Olympic Games. 
The Davis Cup is also there, but importantly the Olympics comes one time in four years. It is a special tournament, special motivation. 
Asked about his injuries last year, the Spaniard said: Papers write something which is not 100 per cent true. I feel 100 per cent fine and last month I was on a weeks holiday with my family in Egypt and trained for a week. It (injuries) does not exist at this moment. 
As for the draw for the event, the top seeded Nadal said there were good players this year, including Carlos Moya, Marcos Baghdatis, Mikhail Youzhny and Xavier Malisse. 
It is an interesting tournament. I want to enjoy a very nice week. I dont know who is going to win. 
Nadal said he could still improve his game from 2007 but was unconcerned about Federer. 
Id love to be No. 2 for 50 more years, he said. 
Especially in my situation, 5,600 or 5,700 points, that is a lot, he said, comparing his 5,735 ranking points to Federers 7,180.In a normal moment in the history of tennis, Id have been No. 1. 
The claycourt specialist won six titles in 2007 and pushed Federer to the brink in an epic five-setter on grass at Wimbledon final. However, he was subdued in the hardcourt Grand Slams, losing in the quarter final at Australian Open and in the U.S. Open fourth round. 
It is difficult to play better, Nadal said. I played very well on grass, clay and on indoor too. 
Im not worried about Roger, he is better than the other guys at the moment. But a lot of young guys are coming from behind at the present time. 
Nadal will start his campaign against Mathieu Montcourt of France in the $436,000 meet. 
Nadal and second seed Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus remain favourites to figure in the title clash on January 6. 
The striking feature of the draw was that all the five Spaniards in the fray  Nadal, Carlos Moya, Guilledrmo Garcia-Lopez, Ivan Navarro and wild card Bartolome Salve-Vidal  have been drawn to play in the top half. 
Baghdatis, ranked 16th in the world, is drawn against Robin Hasse (ranked 114) of the Netherlands while former champion and third seed Carlos Moya will take on Russian Teimuraz Gabashvili. 
In the last edition of the Chennai Open, Gabashvili had lost in the first round to Julien Benneteau of France 3-6, 4-6. 
Fourth seed Mikhail Youzhny is pitted against Jiri Vanek (101) and Frenchman Nicolas Mahut (45), who plays German Dennis Gremelmayr (119) in the first round will eventually clash with Youzhny in the pre-quarters. 
Unseeded and defending champion, Xavier Mallise (Belgium), who also won the doubles pairing his compatriot Dick Norman, will clash with Gilles Muller (117) of Luxembourg in the first round. 
With the cut off for the main draw being 124 as compared to last years 114, this years field is one of the strongest ever here and high quality tennis is in the offing. 
On the Indian challenge, it seems to be heading for the same old story of first or second round exits. 
Wild cards Prakash Amritraj and Vishnu Varadan, current national champion in both single and doubles, will have to raise their game to make second round. 
Prakash, who had slid from his career best of 222 ranking to 278, should be happy not to have been drawn against seeded players in the first round. 
He meets a qualifier, while world ranked 944, Vishnu Varadan takes on a highly rated 97th ranked Edouard Roger-Vasselin of France in the first round. 
However, Prakash, a regular feature in Chennai Open for the last six years as a wild card, has a tough task ahead. If Prakash wins his first round match then in the second round he will be meeting the winner of the Moya-Gabashvili match. Prakash had twice lost in the pre-quarters in the tournament. 
Summing up the tournament players field, former India Davis Cup captain Vijay Amritraj and chairman of the organising committee, said at the draw ceremony that the field was the strongest and looks well spread out and each one of them need to play high quality tennis to win their matches. 
There is really absolutely no weak matches in the field. The 32-player field is the strongest in the tournament history and every match has got the potential to go tough, he said.

 Bengal ride twin centuries
 - BENGAL vs BARODA 
 - Visitors notch up 262/2 at the end of Day I A STAFF REPORTER Anustup Majumdar and Arindam Das Calcutta: An unbeaten 117 by Arindam Das and 103 by Anustup Majumdar helped Bengal notch up 262 for two at the end of first days play against hosts Baroda in their group B Ranji Trophy Super League match. At stumps on Day I, Manoj Tiwary (28) was at the crease. Anustup, playing only his third first-class match, posted his maiden century after Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla won the toss and chose to bat. With the Moti Bagh Stadium wicket favouring the bowlers, both Arindam and Anustup adopted a cautious approach as the openers went on to put on 221 runs. Batting on this wicket was difficult early on Its bouncy and was helping both the seamers and the spinners as well, Arindam said from the Vadodara. They were bowling well and we both had to be extra cautious We worked hard and that helped us in building up the partnership, Arindam added. While Anustup took 221 balls to reach 103 runs before being ran out after tea, skipper Shukla failed in his second consecutive innings as a captain when he  again  got out for a first ball a duck. This time, Laxmi, who promoted himself to No.3, was deceived by off spinner Yusuf Pathans guile. Incidentally, against Hyderabad, he was also a victim of an off-spinner (Amol Shinde). Anustup was eventually run-out shortly after reaching his century but Das was undefeated at the end of the day.

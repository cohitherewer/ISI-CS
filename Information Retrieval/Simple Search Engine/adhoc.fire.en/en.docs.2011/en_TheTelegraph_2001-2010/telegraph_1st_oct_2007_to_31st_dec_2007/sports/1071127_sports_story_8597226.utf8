 Australians concerned over security in Pakistan
Sydney: There is increasing concern among Australias cricketers about their planned tour of Pakistan next year. The Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) said they were worried about security arrangements in Pakistan because of the political upheaval since the introduction of emergency rule. ACA president Darren Lehmann told reporters on Monday the tour should be cancelled, or moved to a neutral venue, if there was any risk to player safety. If theres any risk at all then Im presuming the tour might not go ahead, Lehmann said. But if security say its fine then well be going. Australia are due to tour Pakistan next March but Lehmann said the ACA and Cricket Australia were planning to visit the country in January to determine whether it was safe enough. Lehmann said they would present their findings to the players who would make the final decision. We put everything on the table for them and then its a group decision from there, Lehmann said. Pretty much theyre happy to go with the ACA and Cricket Australia what we recommend and thatll be a joint discussion along the way so if we say Look we think its safe to go, theyll go. Meanwhile, Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes short boundaries in grounds such as Adelaide Oval and the MCG are turning them into a graveyard for bowlers. I know there is a minimum safety standard and the rope has to be a certain way away from the fence, Ponting said. But somewhere like Adelaide... The straight boundary there is roped in 30m and I dont think anyone is going to slide that far into the fence. At the MCG sometimes the square boundaries are roped in 30m or 40m as well and I dont think that needs to happen, Ponting said. Ponting expressed his concerns shortly after scoring an unbeaten 111 on the small confines of North Sydney Oval to help guide Tasmania to an easy victory in its Ford Ranger Cup game against NSW. A ground like this. It does create a nice little carnival atmosphere but to tell the truth Id like to see our playing arenas a bit bigger, Ponting said Sunday. If you look at a ground like here its obviously a very, very flat wicket anyway and the ground is very small, so everything is in the batsmans favour.

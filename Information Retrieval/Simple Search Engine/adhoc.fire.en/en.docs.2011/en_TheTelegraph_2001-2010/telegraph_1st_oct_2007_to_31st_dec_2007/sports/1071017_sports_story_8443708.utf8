 Anand wants to keep improving
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Viswanathan Anand at a function in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI) New Delhi: For Viswanathan Anand, winning the World Championship is a fraction of what he wants to get from his sport. Chess is his passion and the biggest motivation in life. Yes, I know I am the world champion and thats the reason I am here to talk to all of you, said Anand very matter-of-factly on Tuesday. Deep inside, I am simply hungry for more chess and the element of curiosity is always there. I dont want to stop here I want to keep improving my results, said the world champion. Anand was given a rousing reception on Tuesday at the IIT campus where he and wife Aruna arrived in a vintage car. Like in the wee hours of Monday, when he touched down in the capital, fans mobbed the Grandmaster yet again. Winning the world title a second time has made Anand more ambitious and he wants to scale higher peaks. So much so, that he doesnt mind renewing his rivalry with Garri Kasparov, once the undisputed king of world chess. If Kasparov is interested, I wont mind playing him, said Anand. That would be an interesting tie and a challenging one for me. There is a match waiting for him if he wants, said Anand, admitting that beating Kasparov would be more satisfying than winning the world title. I can assure him that it will be less dangerous than his current occupation, the Indian ace said, referring to the former world champions involvement with politics. Anand, who was crowned world champion in Mexico City a fortnight ago, won the official Fide World Championship in 2000 when some of the top players didnt take part following a dispute. Both titles are of equal importance to me, Anand said. But I cannot ignore the fact that the status of the World Championship has changed. The 37-year-old chess star said he was in a holiday mood at the moment, but would soon start working with the goal of winning as many titles as he can. I am certainly not complacent. I still make a lot of mistakes and make mental note of them. His immediate challenge would be to emerge on top of the Super Grandmasters tournament in Corus for the sixth time. After a months break, Anand will be playing meets in Wijk Aan Zee, Linares-Morelia and Leon. Anand heaped praise on the young Indians. Players like Sasikiran, Harikrishna and Parimarjan Negi, he predicted, will win many laurels for the country. The Indian women, he said, could also go very far, their main obstacle being the lack of enough tournaments.  I think it is just a matter of participation. The more they participate, the more women GMs we will have in this country, Anand signed off.

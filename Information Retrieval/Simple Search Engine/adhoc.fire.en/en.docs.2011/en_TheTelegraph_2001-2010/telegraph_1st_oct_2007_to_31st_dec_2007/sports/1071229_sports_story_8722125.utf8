 Foreign curator

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will bring in a foreign expert to train its home curators and groundstaff in a bid to make the wickets at first class centres more sporting and bouncy. 
PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said that the concept behind hiring a foreigner was not only to use his expertise to improve the quality of pitches, but also to pass on his knowledge to the Pakistan curators. 
This season we have already had pitches relaid at nine first class venues in a bid to make them more bouncy and sporting,Ashraf said. 
He said the foreign curator would be asked to help devise a formula through which dead pitches in the country could be relaid and made more sporting and result-oriented. 
We dont want a domestic cricket system in which batsmen enjoy themselves on dead tracks or bowlers excel on under-prepared pitches. We want to provide both an equal opportunity. We need to make our domestic competitions more competitive, Ashraf added. 
In the past, Pakistan had hired well known English curator Dennis Atkinson who helped prepare pitches for two major home series. (PTI)

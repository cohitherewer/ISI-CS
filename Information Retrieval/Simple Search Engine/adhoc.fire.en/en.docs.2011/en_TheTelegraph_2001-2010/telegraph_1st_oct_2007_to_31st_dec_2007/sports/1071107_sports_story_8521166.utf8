 Dravid cracks double century
Mumbai: Former India captain Rahul Dravid reminded the national selectors of his value as the middle-order rock with a double century which ensured Karnataka an honourable draw and one point against holders Mumbai in their Super League tie on Tuesday. The former India skipper, dropped for the first two ODIs against Pakistan in the ongoing rubber, was determination personified when he scored 214 after a stay of 437 minutes in Karnakatas second innings tally of 397 for six declared to set Mumbai a target of 256 for an outright victory. It was also the 34-year-old Dravids 50th first class three-figure knock, including in Tests. Dravid said he was happy to have spent considerable time at the wicket and notch up a double century. It always helps to get some runs and spend some time in the middle, said the former India skipper. It does not matter whether theres a big crowd or not. Its not difficult to get motivated to play a big innings whether I play for India or Karnataka. These external factors dont matter, he said adding the innings would have served his team better had it come in the first innings. I would have loved to score (double hundred) in the first innings but full credit to the Mumbai bowlers, who bowled very well on the first day. Ramesh (Powar) and Ajit Agarkar bowled really well. They also batted well, Dravid said. However, Delhi are just three-wicket shy of an imminent win with one more day to go, while a ragged Rajasthan were left to derive consolation from pace spearhead Pankaj Singhs second five-for of the match on the penultimate day of the Super League tie. Having gained a 34-run first innings lead over the visitors, Delhi piled up 387 runs in their second essay before losing all the wickets to set an intimidating 422-run target for the visitors. Chasing the stiff task, Rajasthan crawled to 188 losing seven wickets and Robin Bist (50, 105b, 8x4) and Shailender Gehlot (10) would resume the innings on Wednesday even though the writing seems clear on the wall.

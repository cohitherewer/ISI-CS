 Tait action is fine, says Lee

Melbourne: Australia spearhead Brett Lee sprang to the defence of Shaun Tait and pooh-poohed the allegation that his teammate has a suspect action. 
Taits action has been questioned by the New Zealand team during the ongoing Chappell-Hadlee series, but Lee rubbished the allegations and his fellow pacer a clean chit. 
Ive bowled alongside him a few times now and watched him, and I havent seen anything thats wrong with his action, Lee was quoted as saying in a newspaper. 
Lee said it was but natural for people to question an express bowler like Tait and promised support to him. 
I know with Tait, with people coming out and saying he might have a problem with his action, its always going to be tough for him. But he has not got a problem with his action. He has got the perfect bowling action, I think. 
When a guy bowls at over 150 kmph, there are always going to be questions, but Im always going to back Tait, Lee said. 
Incidentally, Lee too underwent a similar phase early in his career and that maybe one of the reasons why he came out in Taits support. 
That was probably the hardest thing I had to go through early on in my career, when someone said that my action wasnt perfect and they did question my action, Lee recalled. (PTI)

 Shoaib verdict deferred
Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Boards disciplinary panel on Saturday delayed announcement of its findings from a hearing of charges of misconduct against Shoaib Akhtar. One of the charges against the fast bowler was that he hit teammate Mohammed Asif with a bat before the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa last month. Akhtar was sent back from south africa for the brawl. A senior PCB official announced that the disciplinary panel had differed its announcements on the findings because of fresh developments. Shoaib, through his lawyer, has provided us some documents and material pertaining to some of the charges against him These require some more study, PCB chief executive Shafqat Naghmi said. We will not hurry any decision on the charges against Shoaib as we want to give him a fair chance to clear himself. But the decision will come definitely before the one-day series against South Africa, Naghmi said. The committee recorded the statements of Shoaib, Shahid Afridi, Asif and manager Talat Ali. Shoaib has charged Afridi with provoking the row and claims he hit Asif accidentally. Naghmi said the committee may arrive at a decision on the charges against Shoaib by next week, but added it would be taken after a conscientious examination of the incident and charges. He said the penalties under the charges brought against Shoaib included long term bans and heavy fines. The legal counsel for Shoaib said that the supplementary documents submitted by him, pertained to the disciplinary action taken against his client in two cases, including his being sent back from South Africa for having a fight with Mohammed Asif.

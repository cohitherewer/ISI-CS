 SA clinch a thriller
Durban: AB de Villiers, JP Duminy and Mark Boucher powered South Africa to a thrilling two-wicket win over New Zealand in the first one-day International on Sunday. After New Zealand had totalled 248 for six, South Africa reached their target off the last ball of the match with two wickets to spare. De Villiers scored 87 to marshall the first half of the innings, Duminy took charge of much of the chase with his 46, and Bouchers 35 not out completed the job. New Zealand did themselves no favour by dropping De Villiers on 21, Boucher on five, and Andre Nel on nought in the final over. Jamie Hows career best 90 guided New Zealand to their respectable total.  (REUTERS)

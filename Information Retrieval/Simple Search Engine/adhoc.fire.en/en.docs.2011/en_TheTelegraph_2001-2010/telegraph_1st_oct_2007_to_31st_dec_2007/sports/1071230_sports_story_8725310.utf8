 DAY IV HIGHLIGHTS

 Adam Gilchrist (399 dismissals) surpassed fellow Australian keeper Ian Healy (395). Only Mark Boucher of South Africa has more dismissals (406) to his credit. The following are the top 5 wicketkeepers in Tests: 
 406  Mark Boucher (SA) 
399  Adam Gilchrist (Aus) 
395  Ian Healy (Aus) 
355  Rodney Marsh (Aus) 
270  Jeff Dujon (WI) 
 With eight wickets in the first Test, Gilchrist also became second on the list of keepers with most dismissals against India. Gilchrist has 58 (56 caught, 2 stumped). Only Dujon (60) lies ahead of him 
 By carrying out eight dismissals in the match, Gilchrist equalled the record of Rodney Marsh who performed a similar feat against India in Sydney, 1980-81 
 When India reached 33 for one in their second innings, the historic Melbourne Cricket Ground reached a new milestone. In its 130 years of Test cricket, the MCG has now seen 1,00,000-plus runs scored. Only Lords (1,07,324 runs) has seen more runs scored 
 India were bowled out for 200 or less in a Test match in both innings for the 27th time in Test cricket. The last time it occurred was against WI at Kingston (200 amp; 171) in 2006. It is only the second time this has happened in Australia, the first time being in 1947-48, when India were bowled out for 58 and 98 in Brisbane. 
 Australia have now won their 15th Test in a row. The winning streak began against South Africa (second Test) at the MCG in 2005-06. During the course of this winning streak, Australia have beaten South Africa, Bangladesh England, Sri Lanka and now India. They are now one short of equalling their own record of 16 consecutive Test wins which was achieved from Oct. 1999-Mar. 2001. 
 Australia also recorded their ninth consecutive win at the MCG. 
 Indias loss by 337 runs is now their third worst in terms of runs in Test cricket. Indias worst ever was by a margin of 342 runs also against Australia in Nagpur 2004-05. The second heaviest was by a margin of 341 runs against Pakistan in Karachi (2005-06). 
 India have played 10 Tests in 2007. They began the year in South Africa, with a loss in the Cape Town Test and ended the year at Melbourne with another loss. The record in Tests this year reads (Played: 10; Won: 3; Lost: 2; Drew: 5)

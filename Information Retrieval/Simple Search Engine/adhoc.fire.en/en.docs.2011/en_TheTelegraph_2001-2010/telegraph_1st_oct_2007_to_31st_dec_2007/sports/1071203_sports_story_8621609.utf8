 Murali equals Warne record
 Muttiah Muralidharan exults after equalling Shane Warnes world record for most Test wickets on Day II of the first Test against England in Kandy on Sunday. (AP) Kandy: Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralidharan claimed four for 30 to equal Shane Warnes world record for the most Test wickets on the second day of the first Test against England on Sunday. Muralidharan ripped through Englands top order after lunch to reduce the tourists to 186 for six shortly before tea when rain forced an early end to proceedings. Cheered on by home supporters, Muralidharan claimed the four wickets he needed to draw level with the Australian leg-spinner on 708 wickets. Resuming on 49 for one in reply to Sri Lankas 188, England lost the wickets of Michael Vaughan (37) and Ian Bell (83) during the morning session before collapsing in the afternoon. Muralidharan followed up with the wickets of Pietersen (31) and Ravi Bopara (8) in the afternoon to equal Warnes record tally. With England still trailing by two runs, Paul Collingwood was batting on 14 and Ryan Sidebottom was on one when the umpires suspended play. Bell started the morning fluently, quickly reaching his 15th half-century. He added 107 runs for the second wicket with Vaughan. Muralidharan, introduced into the attack after initial bursts from the fast bowlers, finally broke through for Sri Lanka in the second hour. Vaughan was given out caught at bat pad after vociferous appeals, although TV replays indicated he had missed the ball. The off-spinner also snared Bell minutes before the break as Chamara Silva clung on to a diving catch at short mid-wicket. Bell had hit 12 boundaries during his 125-ball innings. Muralidharan continued bowling straight after lunch as Pietersen and Collingwood chipped away at the Sri Lanka lead with a 38-run partnership. He finally broke through as Pietersen tried to pad away a straight delivery and was adjudged lbw. Debutant Bopara fell soon after, well caught down the leg-side by wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardene.  (REUTERS)

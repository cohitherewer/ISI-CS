 India make a bid for AFC meet

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
New Delhi: India have made a bid to host the AFC Challenge Cup in August 2008. This was done at the recently-concluded Asian Football Confederation (AFC) meeting in Kuala Lumpur. 
We have asked the AFC to consider us as the hosts for the Challenge Cup, All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Alberto Colaco said. In January, the AFC team is expected to come to India and inspect the facilities. 
The AFC Challenge Cup was originally scheduled to be played in Chinese Taipei from March 1-16 next year. It was later shifted to Thailand but they too have expressed their inability to host the meet. 
The tournament is played by lower-rated nations in the AFC rankings. Tajikistan lifted the trophy the last time the 16-team meet held, in Bangladesh. 
Colaco said that AFC has decided to introduce qualification rounds this time.

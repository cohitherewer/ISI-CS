 We deserve this defeat: Subrata
- Referee rsquo;s decision sparks protest from East Bengal players
A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengal players and coach Subrata Bhattacharya argue with referee Rathin Mukherjee at the end of their match against Mohammedan Sporting on Saturday. They were protesting against his decision to turn down an appeal for a penalty. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Brazilians call it malandragem while its picardia in Argentina. Loosely meant as a mixture of cunning and naughtiness, its a practice widely prevalent in South American football. Now with more Brazilians coming here to ply their trade, their theatrics are fast becoming a part of the Maidan life. Edmilson at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday portrayed a classic exhibition of such tactics to win a game. With his team trailing by a goal and looking desperately for an equaliser, the Brazilian surged ahead with the ball in the closing minutes and found Mohammedan Sportings V. Prem Kumar in his way. Instead of dodging past the defender, Edmilson resorted to play acting, falling to the ground theatrically. His claims for a penalty went in vain. Referee Rathin Mukherjee rightly waved play-on, much to the chagrin of Edmilson and his teammates. East Bengal eventually lost 1-2 in their CFL Premier Division and, with 22 points from 10 matches, missed the opportunity to overtake Mohun Bagan (24 points) in the provisional leaderboard. However, Mukherjees decision triggered off a protest from East Bengal players and officials. He was hemmed in by them in the middle of the field, with coach Subrata Bhattacharya and his assistant Bikash Panji joining in the skirmish. Mukherjee later was escorted out of the ground under heavy police protection. Fans threw water bottles from the stands as the players left the ground. Bhattacharya later stood by his players, denying any play acting from Edmilson and blaming it on Mukherjee. His handling of the match was there for all to see, he said. The former India defender, however, was quick to accept the reality. We played badly, theres no doubt about it. We deserved to get such a setback, he said, referring to his teams maiden defeat in the CFL Premier Division. It happens sometimes. Even Manchester United lost to Coventry (in the League Cup). My players were suffering from a bit of over-confidence. We needed a jerk to come out of the complacency. This loss may turn out to be a blessing in disguise because now the players will have their feet on the ground, Bhattacharya added. His counterpart, Shabbir Ali, said his boys proved a point  that all was not over even if East Bengal beat them 6-2 in the first leg. Theres no denying the fact that we have not lived up to the fans expectations. But this win will give the players a lot of confidence, Ali maintained. Mike Okoro didnt play, citing lack of practice and watched Mohammedan Sportings fightback from the stands. But according to Ali, the Nigerians arrival will boost his team further.

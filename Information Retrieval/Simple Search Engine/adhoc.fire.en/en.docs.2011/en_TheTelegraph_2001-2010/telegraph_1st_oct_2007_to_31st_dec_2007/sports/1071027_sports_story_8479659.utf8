 Mukansi unlikely to start today
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: East Bengal will look to prove a point and collect three against Peerless on Saturday, when the second phase of the Sahara CFL Premier Division resumes after three weeks. The red-and-golds succumbed to an unexpected 1-2 defeat to Mohammedan Sporting just before the break. Coach Subrata Bhattacharya may not have got over that disappointment, perhaps the reason why he chose not to face media after Fridays two-hour practice session. That defeat meant East Bengal stayed on 22 points (in 10 matches) and prevented them from going past leaders Mohun Bagan (24 points). East Bengal assistant coach Bikash Panji made it clear that they were taking the match with all seriousness. The boys are in good shape and were confident of a win tomorrow, Panji said. East Bengal are likely to stick to Edmilson Marques and Majek Bolaji as their foreign duo. It was learnt that Subrata wont risk fielding South African World Cupper MacDonald Mukansi just yet. The coach could try him out as a substitute if East Bengal are comfortably in front.

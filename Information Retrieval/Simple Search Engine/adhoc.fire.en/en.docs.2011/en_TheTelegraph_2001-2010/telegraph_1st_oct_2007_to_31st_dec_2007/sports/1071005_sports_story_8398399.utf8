 War of words good for the game: Warne 
Melbourne: The growing animosity between India and Australia and its on-field manifestation may have come as a worry for the match officials but spin legend Shane Warne believes the game needs drama like this and it will only spice up the summer of cricket. A showman who hardly needed provocation to get under the skin of the opponents, Warne saw nothing wrong in Sreesanths war of words with Andrew Symonds or Harbhajan Singhs outburst, goaded by the close-in fielders in the second ODI in Kochi. I dont think anything was over the top (in Kochi), so I think its going to add a bit of spice to the summer, Warne was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper. Everyones going to be looking for Sreesanth to do his stuff and it shows with a bit of passion. I think its going to be good for the summer, he said. According to Warne, Sreesanths aggression only underlines his competitive spirit. In his illustrious international career, Warne never allowed anyone to bully or browbeat him but admitted sledging Sachin Tendulkar often proved counter-productive. We tried to go after Sachin in the early 90s and hes reeled off a hundred just about every game he played, so we thought okay, lets have a beer with him and say, youre a great bloke, Sachin, and dont say anything to him on the field, Warne said.

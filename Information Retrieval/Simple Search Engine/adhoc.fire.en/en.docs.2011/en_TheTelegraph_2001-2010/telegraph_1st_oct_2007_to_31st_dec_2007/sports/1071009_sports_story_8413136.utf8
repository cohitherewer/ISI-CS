 No change in senior selection committee
- Snehasish rsquo;s links with Todi not raised because of technicality
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Sparks didnt fly at the CAB working committee meeting on Monday. The ruling group worked overtime to ensure that the contentious issues did not cause further embarrassment to Prasun Muksherjee. Assistant secretary Snehasish Gangulys links with the Todi brothers, Ashok and Pradip, didnt come up for discussion. The CAB president had made it clear at the outset that nothing outside the agenda could be discussed. Mukherjee arrived at the Eden two-and-a-half hours before the start and meticulously planned his strategy. In the end, he and his team managed to walk away unscathed! Snehasishs role has come under the scanner in the light of recent developments related to Rizwanur Rahmans death. Snehasish, a BCCI technical committee member, is a director in Todis company. The police raided their office in 2002 and arrested four persons in connection with a betting racket. A silent candlelit protest was staged by volunteers of Maidan Cricket Lovers outside the Dr B.C. Roy Club House during the meeting. Their mouths were covered with black strips. Former assistant secretary Biswarup Dey, who is leading the protest against Snehasishs continuance in office, said they will write to the BCCI and ICC seeking justice. Mondays meeting lasted for more than an hour and was attended by 38 of the 42 members. Mukherjee gave the media the slip after the meeting, only saying it was peaceful and without any controversy. Snehasish, though, made it clear that he would not resign before making a hasty retreat. There is no question of my resignation, he announced. The composition of the senior selection committee remained unchanged. The members felt a change was not necessary in the light of Bengals commendable performance in the Ranji Trophy and at the under-22 level in the past couple of years. The quartet of Arup Bhattacharjee (chairman), Barun Burman, Saradindu Mukherjee and Kalyan Chowdhury stayed. Raja Venkat, a Prasun Mukherjee confidant, managed a place in the junior selection committee after plans to include him in the senior fold failed. Ramesh Bhatia was the other new entrant. Sagarmoy Sen Sharma will be the chairman. Gautam Shome (sr) kept his place. Sujan Mukherjee had resigned and Barun Ghosh didnt wish to continue because of failing health. The Snehasish issue wasnt raised since it would have meant walking out in protest. We never wanted that Its a moral victory since the senior selection committee remained unchanged, said Dey. Joint secretary Amitava Banerjee refused to be drawn into any controversy. Its sub judice No comments. The womens selection committee, comprising Mithu Mukherjee (chairman), Lopamudra Bhattacharjee, Runa Basu and Banasree Das, was also formed. The move to include Russi Jheejheebhoy as an ordinary member in the womens cricket subcommittee was stalled. Members opposed his inclusion since Jheejheebhoy was a vice-president. Headed by Srinjoy Bose, the other members are Naresh Ojha, Gopal Bose, Srirupa Mukherjee and Sandhya Majumder. Among other issues, M.K. Sen and Himadri Chatterjee were kept out of the tour and cricket committees, respectively, under strong opposition from the members. Their nominations werent according to the rules as Sen wasnt a working committee member and Chatterjee not a Ranji panel umpire.

 Aaqib slams Maliks captaincy
Karachi/Jaipur: Lashing out at Shoaib Malik for his mediocre captaincy, former Pakistan pacer Aaqib Javed said the skipper has been a failure in the ODI series against India. Look when you are the captain either you bat low down or higher up the order as a specialist batsman bowl regularly. Malik is not sure of his own role in the team and his decision to open the innings should have come earlier, Javed said. The former pacer also hit out at Mohammed Yousuf, saying the middle-order mainstay was too slow in his scoring. He suggested that Yousuf should be promoted to the opening slot. Meanwhile, with the dew factor at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium certain to influence the outcome of Sundays fifth and final one-dayer between India and Pakistan, winning the toss could be winning half the battle, feels pitch curator Tapas Chatterjee. Meanwhile, Jaipur police on Friday resorted to mild lathicharge to control the huge rush of students outside the University Campus Gate during sale of tickets for the Sunday ODI. The situation went out of control as around 50,000 students including girls came to purchase tickets but most of them left disappointed.  (PTI)

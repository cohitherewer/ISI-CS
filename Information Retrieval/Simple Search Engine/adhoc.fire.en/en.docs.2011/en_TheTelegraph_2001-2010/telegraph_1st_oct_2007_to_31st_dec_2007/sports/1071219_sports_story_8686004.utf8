 Ramiz pulls out of ICC chief executive race

 Ramiz Raja
 Karachi: Ramiz Raja has missed out on a chance to succeed Malcolm Speed as the chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC) after the cricketer-turned-commentator refused to undergo the selection process.
 Sources close to the former Pakistan captain said he had declined to go through the selection process meant for all prospective candidates for the CEOs post laid out by the ICC.
 The sources said that majority of the ICC executive board members had responded favourably when Ramizs name was spoken about as a possible candidate to replace Speed who steps down in June 2008.
 ICC had sent indirect feelers to Ramiz but he was hesitant about applying for the post, the source said.
 The former captain, who has served as chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, had a very good image in the ICC corridors of power and would have been a strong candidate to take over from Speed, the sources said.
 But Ramiz conveyed that he was happy in his broadcasting career as it allowed him to also relax and work at his own pace, the source said.
 According to the source, Ramiz eventually did convey that if the ICC was interested in having him as a candidate, they should appoint him directly instead of putting him through the normal selection process.
 Obviously this cannot happen in the ICC as every position has to be filled after a proper selection procedure, the source said.
 Speed is set to retire in June and the shortlisting of potential candidates would start when the ICC board meets in Dhaka in March 2008.
 First an attempt would be made to pick an in-house candidate with consensus but if that does not materialise, an eligible candidate would be selected by a four-man selection committee. He will then work with Speed in May and formally take over from June, a source said. (PTI)

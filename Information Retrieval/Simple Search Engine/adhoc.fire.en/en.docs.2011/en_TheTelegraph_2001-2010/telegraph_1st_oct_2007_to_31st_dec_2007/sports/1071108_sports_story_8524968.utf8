 Delhi set to host World Cup
New Delhi: Indian hockey received a shot in the arm with the international hockey federation (FIH) on Wednesday deciding in principle that New Delhi will host the 2010 mens World Cup. It will be after almost three decades that India would host the prestigious biennial event. The last and the only time India hosted the championship was in 1982 in Mumbai. The 2010 hockey World Cup will be a joint venture between the FIH and the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) and is a result of the Project Promoting Indian Hockey. The final decision on allotting the event, however, will be taken in March 2008. It will depend upon the achievement of set targets both in relation to the project and the organisation of the World Cup.  (PTI)

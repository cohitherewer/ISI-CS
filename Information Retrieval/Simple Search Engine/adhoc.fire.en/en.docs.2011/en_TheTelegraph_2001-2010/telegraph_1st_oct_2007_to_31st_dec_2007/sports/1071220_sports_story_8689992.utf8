 Birthday gift for Treta

A STAFF REPORTER
Calcutta: Treta Bhattacharya gave herself a wonderful birthday gift at the South Club. The girl who blew 16 candles on Wednesday won her second-round match easily to advance to the womens singles quarter finals of her maiden National Grass Court Championships. 
I played the junior nationals and lost in the quarters, this is the first time Im competing in the seniors meet, said Treta. 
Having accounted for fourth seed Parul Goswami in a tough first-round encounter, Treta had it much easier in the round of 16. I am playing very well and thats why Im in the quarter finals, said Treta. But before the tournament started, I didnt expect this I was aiming to win one round. 
On Thursday, the Standard X Open school student of Assembly of God Church, will come up against Ragini Vimal. The sixth-seeded Ragini will have the edge because of her experience, but shouldnt make the mistake of underestimating her citymate. 
Another exciting quarter-final contest will pit mens top seed Karan Rastogi against wild card Harsh Mankad. Both won their second-round matches on Wednesday in straight sets. 
He (Karan) is very talented Im happy with the way Im playing, so it should be a good match, said the 29-year-old Mankad, who lives in Minneapolis. 
The knee problem, which bothered him over the last year, hasnt played up this week. I am moving pretty well, no complaints so far.

 FA may consider swift exit for McClaren
HENRY WINTERSteve McClarens fate as England head coach will be decided at an emergency board meeting of the Football Association on November 22 if the team fail to reach the finals of Euro 2008. Englands last game of the qualifying campaign is against Croatia at Wembley on November 21 and the FA must act quickly because McClaren is due to fly to South Africa on November 23 to represent England at the 2010 World Cup draw. If Russia, Englands rivals for the second Group E slot behind Croatia, prevail in Israel on November 17, Englands lingering qualification hopes will be extinguished (unless Russia then defy logic and slip up against Andorra). If events in Tel Aviv thicken the storm clouds over McClaren, the match against Croatia will be played out to mass catcalls. Some at Soho Square want him to continue, even if England fail to qualify, but the FA will take into account the intensity of the vitriol at Wembley. Nothing will happen before the Croatia game but it would be sensible if a quick decision was made afterwards, an FA source said. McClaren is booked to fly to Durban 36 hours after the Wembley game, along with FA chief executive Brian Barwick and Adrian Bevington, the director of communications.  If there is an empty seat in first class it will be because the FA have decided that McClaren is not the man to lead England towards the 2010 World Cup. Discussions about his future are being discouraged in the FA corridors of power with everyone crossing fingers that Israel do England a favour. Its one of the questions nobody wants to ask because we have to assume we can still qualify, another Soho Square source said yesterday. But some tough decisions will have to be made [if England dont qualify]. The pressure will be on to make a statement about Steves future. There are rumblings he could still survive if we lost, but the reaction of the crowd at Wembley could come into play. The FA on Thursday informed members of their official fan club who endured such a grim trip to Moscow on October 17 that they are in line for refunds. The Russian FA overcharged for tickets, and the FA have negotiated reimbursement of up to 20. Fans who experienced sudden downgrades of hotel will also be recompensed.

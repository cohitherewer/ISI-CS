 Dennis to blame for Lewis failure: Bernie
Kevin GarsideIt was Ron who did it, claims Formula One power broker Bernie Ecclestone. The sports commercial rights holder has concluded that McLaren team principal Ron Dennis was at fault in the Brazilian Grand Prix for Lewis Hamiltons failure to capture the world drivers crown. If he hadnt called Hamilton in for that silly low-fuel and soft-tyres stint, he could have won the championship, Ecclestone said. He made no time on the road and lost 25 seconds making the stop. If he had only lost 15 seconds he would have been fourth. I feel sorry for Lewis after his performances this year as a rookie. [Kimi] Raikkonen is champion. I just hope he starts talking more. He is talking more to the Ferrari engineers, according to Ross Brawn, the teams former technical director. Brawn expressed concern at the start of the year about Raikkonens methods and his difficulty in assimilating, but a determined second half of the season eventually yielded an unlikely championship. I was pleased for Kimi because he struggled a little at the beginning to adapt to the new team, car and the tyres, Brawn said. What impressed me was that he worked with his engineers, understood the issues, got on top of the situation and did it in a quiet way within the privacy of the team. Raikkonens manager, David Robertson, believes his man will get even stronger as the relationship with Ferrari develops. If Ferrari have the car next year Kimi will be unbeatable, he said.

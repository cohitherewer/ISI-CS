 Delhi in control vs Mumbai
Mumbai: Medium-pacers Pradeep Sangwan and Ishant Sharma shared six wickets while opener Gautam Gambhir struck an unbeaten 81 to put Delhi on top against holders Mumbai on the Day I of their Ranji Trophy Elite Division Group A match on Friday. Ishant, who had been drafted into the first Test squad, was released to play Ranji as he didnt make the India XI. Choosing to bat, Mumbai stuttered to 67 for five by lunch before suffering another collapse after the interval to be shot out in only 44.3 overs. Barring youngster Prashant Naik, who made a determined 40 and Ajit Agarkar (32), there was little of note in the Mumbai innings. Delhis reply was led by the Gambhir. The left-hander stood like a rock even as he lost partners at the other end. Sehwag, trying hard to get back his Test spot, played sedately after smacking Ramesh Powar for a six over long on. But his stay was cut short when he was caught behind in an attempt to cut Abhishek Nair at 16. Aavishkar Salvi broke the third wicket stand between Gambhir and Kohli at 127 while Mithun Manhas was ran out cheaply. SUMMARISED SCORES  In Chennai: Tamil Nadu 289/5 (H. Gopinath 3 batting, S.

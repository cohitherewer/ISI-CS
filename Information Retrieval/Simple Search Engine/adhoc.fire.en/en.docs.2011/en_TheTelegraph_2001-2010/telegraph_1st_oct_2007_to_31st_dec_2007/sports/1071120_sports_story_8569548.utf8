 Coe boost for Delhi Olympic hopes
New Delhi: The organising committee for the 2012 London Olympics on Monday put its weight behind Indias aspirations to host the event in 2020. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has expressed its desire to bid for the Games and the host city will be named in 2013. London Olympics Organising Committee chairman Sebastian Coe said if New Delhi did bid, there was a good chance it would get it and the successful staging of the 2010 Commonwealth Games would be a big help. Coe said London would be available to share its expertise and experience with New Delhi. We will co-operate very closely on various facets of organisation as well as performance on the field. All host cities should ideally work with each other, he said. London mayor Ken Livingstone also said that Britain would support the bid. Livingstone, Coe and Chelsea football clubs chief executive Peter Kenyon are part of a high-powered delegation in the country that is aiming to develop cultural, business and sporting links between Britain and India. I think Delhi has a good chance of getting the Olympics. It has staged major sporting events in the past and there would be a lot of coherence in their claim. A successful Commonwealth Games would definitely be helpful, Coe said at a press conference. The Commonwealth Youth Games in Pune next year is also an important step in this direction, he said. Granting hosting rights to India would also encourage more developing countries to bid for the chance to host the biggest sporting extravaganza in the world. It will send out a strong message that the Olympics are not a franchise of half a dozen countries, Coe, the 1500m gold medallist at the 1980 Moscow and 1984 Los Angeles Games, said. On the subject of doping, Coe said he wanted offenders to be slapped with a four-year ban. The IAAF imposes a two-year ban on first-time violators, but Coe thinks the punishment is not stringent enough to dissuade potential violators. We have to restore confidence in the public as well as among athletes and I strongly believe a stricter sentence is the need of the hour, Coe said. Delhi is also eager to make the 2010 Commonwealth Games a carbon-neutral event, chief organiser and IOA chief Suresh Kalmadi said on Monday. New Delhis Commonwealth Games in 2010 will seek to be known as the green games, said Kal- madi. He said that his organising panel had tied up with the United Nations Environment Programme to achieve this.  (AGENCIES)

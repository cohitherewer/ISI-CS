 New angle emerges in Woolmer case
 Bob Woolmer Kingston: A Jamaican chambermaid said on Tuesday she found a bloodied bed, an overturned chair and a smell like alcohol and vomit when she stumbled on former Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmers unconscious body in his Kingston hotel room earlier this year, while a UK pathologist said the coach could have had company at the time of his death. Chambermaid Bernice Robinson, the first witness to testify as a long-awaited inquest opened into Woolmers startling death during the World Cup in the Caribbean, said his body lay blocking the bathroom door of room 374 at the Jamaica Pegasus, one of his feet stretched up to the wash basin. I started to look around the room, and noticed that there was a chair that was overturned, she said. There was blood on the pillow and the bed. I continued looking around the room and didnt see him. And then I went into the bathroom. The door was closed, I knocked, got no response, then I tried to open the door but I couldnt open it as something was pressing against it. Robinson said she panicked and shouted, Sir, sir, is everything OK? before running for help. She recalled a smell like vomit and alcohol mixed together and saw vomit on the bathroom floor. Her discovery of Woolmers unconscious body on March 18, a day after Pakistan crashed out of the World Cup following an ignominious defeat to underdogs Ireland, kicked off a maelstrom that gripped the international cricket world for months. Dr Nathaniel Carey, a UK pathologist who examined the autopsy report on Tuesday, confirmed his view that Woolmer had died of natural causes. Based on the photographs that I saw, and the histology results, I came to that conclusion. Mr Woolmer had a heart condition and he had diabetes, plus he was found behind a door as if he had suffered an attack, Carey said. The pathologist said it was possible that someone had been with Woolmer around the time of his death. Would you agree with me there could have been a third party in Mr Woolmers room at the time of his death, director of public prosecutions Kent Pantry asked Carey. Yes, there could have been, Carey said. Coroner Patrick Murphy, who is presiding over the inquest, took notes during the testimony and told a jury of six women and five men the inquest would probably last until November 9. Other witnesses who testified included Imogene Douglas, the waitress who served Woolmer three days prior to his death. More than 50 witnesses, including chief investigation officer and deputy superintendence of police will testify in the hearing. The PCB on Wednesday said it had got no request to send any players or officials to testify at the Woolmer inquest, says a report from Karachi.  We see the inquest as a routine matter of the Jamaican police. If their coroner sends us a request to send players or officials to testify we will then take a decision, PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi said. (AGENCIES)

 Salgaocar hold Mahindra

Margao: Salgaocar held Mahindra United goalless in the sixth round of the ONGC I-League on Wednesday. 
Salgaocar, who dominated the first half, created more scoring opportunities but poor finishing denied them. They were also unlucky in the dying minutes when Agnelo Barettos header hit the post. 
Mahindra, who were defensive in the first period, created more chances in the second but their strikers were wayward and rival keeper Milagrio Medeira brought off some good saves. 
With four draws and a win, Mahindra United have seven points from six matches while Salgaocar, who have three draws and three defeats, have three points. 
Mahindra defender Harpreet Singh was declared MoM. 
Salgaocar went on the offensive from the start and had the better exchanges, but foreign strikers Felix Chimaokwu and Boniface Ambani failed to take advantage. (PTI)

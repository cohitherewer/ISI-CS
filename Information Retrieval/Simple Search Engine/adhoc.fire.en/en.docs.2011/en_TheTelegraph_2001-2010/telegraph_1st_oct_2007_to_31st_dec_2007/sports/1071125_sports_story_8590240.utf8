 Indians tied 19th
 Colin Montgomerie in Dongguan on Saturday. (AFP ) Dongguan (China): Jyoti Randhawa and Gaurav Ghei forced their way back into the reckoning for a decent finish in the Omega Mission Hills World Cup with a brilliant seven-under 65 in the third-round four balls to jump to tied 19th spot here Saturday. Ghei and Randhawa have a total of seven-under 205 and are determined to end with a flourish Sunday, but Ghei has admitted he is not in the best of form and has so far relied on Randhawas aggressive play. Jyoti had a great day, he played really well. I gave him just one birdie. Im not happy with how Im playing. I need to sort something out before tomorrow. Jyoti put us in a good position with six birdies, said Ghei. The Delhi golfer said the long season had taken a toll and complained of a niggling neck problem but remained confident about putting up a fine show in Sundays foursomes at the Mission Hills Golf Club. Im not playing at my best and it puts pressure on the team. I just have to go out and make a few better shots and a few better putts. Im not hitting it well, not putting well. I cant figure it out. Its been a long year and Im just not in the best physical shape right now. My neck has been bothering me and its coming at the wrong week. We both want to finish strong. In the World Cup, you are either contending or it doesnt matter where you finish. Well try to go out there and shoot a good final round, Ghei said. At the top, overnight leaders Boo Weekley and Heath Slocum of the United States held on to their one-stroke lead after firing a 66 to take their total to 196. The French pair of Rapahel Jacquelin and Gregory Havret and the Scottish duo of Colin Montgomerie and Marc Warren were tied for the second spot after returning 62 and 66, respectively. Third place was shared by South Africans Retief Goosen and Trevor Immelman (66) and the English team of Justin Rose and Ian Poulter (67) with a total of 198. Among other Asian hopefuls, Thai stars Thongchai Jaidee and Prayad Marksaeng shot a nine-under 63 in the third round and will enter the last day six shots behind the leaders. (PTI)

 Dutta pulls up referee 
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: No goals. No true efforts from the players to put up a good show, but still Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) coach Amal Dutta singled out referee Barun Saha and launched verbal attack on him. What has he done, wasnt it a goal? he asked scribes and few team officials present. Dutta, in his same old manner, blamed the referee for disallowing the only goal of the match. I can show the rule book where it is clearly written that even if 14 players come from behind, it is not an off-side, but the referee cancelled itI cannot believe this, Dutta said in the same vein after the match. On the other hand, Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali blamed his side for sharing points with the CPT. We have missed a lot of chances Had we capitalised on any of those chances, we would have won, Ali said. Nigerian Mike Okoro was also not satisfied with his show and vowed to do better.

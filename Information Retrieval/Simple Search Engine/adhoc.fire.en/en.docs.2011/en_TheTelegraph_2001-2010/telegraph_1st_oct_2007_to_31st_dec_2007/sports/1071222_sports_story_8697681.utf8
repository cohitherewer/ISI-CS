 Sharan catches Karan napping

A STAFF REPORTER
 Shalini Sahoo in action against Treta Bhattacharya at the South Club on Friday. Sahoo won 6-0, 6-0. A Telegraph picture 
Calcutta: Eighth seed Shalini Sahoos win over local girl Treta Bhattacharya in the semi-final of the IndianOil Servo National Grass Court Championships was not unexpected. What surprised everyone was the 6-0, 6-0 scoreline. The 16-year-old, who had impressed one and all in her maiden senior nationals, simply surrendered at the South Club on Friday. 
Shalini thus set up a title clash with top seed and favourite Rushmi Chakravarthy, who prevailed 6-3, 6-3 over Karnatakas Pooja Shree Venkatesh. 
Mens fourth seed Divij Sharan produced the upset of the day by outclassing top seed and Davis Cupper Karan Rastogi 6-3, 6-3. 
Sharan was more agile on court than his higher ranked rival. Rastogi looked off colour, with his favourite shot  the double-fisted backhand  not working well. 
Sharan will take on J. Vishnu Vardhan of Andhra Pradesh in the title showdown. Vishnu took 75 minutes to beat unseeded V.M. Ranjeet of Tamil Nadu 6-4, 6-2. Vardhan, incidentally, made the doubles final partnering Vinod Sridhar. The duo will face Sriram Balaji Narayanswamy and Ranjeet. 
Treta had many cheering for her, but that didnt help. Shalini was in good nick and gave her inexperienced opponent no opening. 
Sharan didnt try anything special, just concentrated on solid net play. Sharan broke Rastogi thrice, and fired eight aces against Rastogis three. 
The ladies doubles title went to Geeta Manohar and Archana Venkataraman, who beat top seeds Rushmi and Sonal Phadke 6-3, 6-4.

 Tiwary, Saha lord it over Hyderabad on Day II
A STAFF REPORTER Manoj Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha on Day II of Bengals Ranji Trophy Super League match against Hyderabad at Eden Gardens on Monday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary has spiked hair with a slight golden-dyed look. The 21-year-old Bengal star is brand conscious too  he flaunts Calvin Kleins unapologetically. He also brandishes a hip caller tune. Wriddhiman Saha, however, has dishevelled unkempt hair. Little does the unassuming 23-year-old know about being brand conscious  forget Calvin Klein. The Siliguri lad does not even have a caller tune. However much they are different off the field, the duos on-field chemistry is exceptional. Having known each other since their under-19 days, Tiwary and Saha, batting on full flow, is a treat. If Sunday, the Day I of Bengal-Hyderabad Group B Ranji Trophy Super League match, provided a glimpse of the Tiwary-Saha partnership, Monday underlined their co-ordination as the duo waltzed together for a 177-run sixth wicket partnership. In the process, Tiwary got his second double century (203), while Saha became the 15th Bengal batsmen to notch a century in his Ranji debut. Saha remained undefeated for 111 as Bengal made 461 in their first innings. Sahas unbeaten century, by the way, came while batting at No.7. The king of Eden, VVS Laxman, had a forgettable outing as he disappointed with a duck, having lasted eight balls. He was one of the five batsmen to have fallen as Hyderabad struggled for 65 for five after 25 overs at stumps. Only Ravi Teja could get to double figures as Bengal ruled the roost  in both batting and bowling. It was a prize scalp for Shib Shankar Paul who was making a Ranji comeback. Paul (2/15) was the most impressive among Bengal bowlers. Another comeback man, Murtaza Lodhgar also was impressive. The match saw a delayed start  45 minutes  due to rain in the morning. It, however, had no bearing on the overnight batsmen Tiwary and Saha who carried on from where they left Sunday.

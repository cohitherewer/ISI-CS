 Im committed to ICL, says Lara
 Brian Lara at a press conference in Mumbai on Sunday. (PTI) Mumbai: Brian Lara finally touched down in India as the most high-profile recruit of the Indian Cricket League here on Sunday and proclaimed he was committed to play in the rebel tournament since June. I could not come earlier because of some personal things which needed to be sorted out, but have always been committed to play in the ICL after signing up in June, the West Indian great said at the Western Railway Stadium. Laras arrival has given a shot in the arm for the promoters of the rebel event which starts from Friday in Chandigarh. Lara said he was looking forward to playing alongside and against young Indian talents. I am looking forward to playing in the League with the Mumbai Champs team. I would love to play alongside the young players from India who may not otherwise have had the opportunity to play with me and other international players, he said. Lara hoped that some time in the future the ICL would get the nod from cricket establishments around the world, similar to the West Indies Cricket Boards recognition of the private league floated by Texas billionaire Alan Stanford. The reaction from the established cricket bodies was on expected lines but still I was disappointed, Lara said. The problems faced by the ICL are similar to those faced by Stanford when he came up with this idea in the West Indies which has now been accepted by the West Indies Cricket Board. The intentions are quite honourable and i hope down the line people will understand what this league is about and accept it, he said. Lara said he had nothing at present to do with the West Indies cricket establishment but did not rule out playing a role in his home regions cricket development. I am no longer connected with the West Indies Cricket Board. I joined the ICL as I wanted to play cricket. But in future I want to give back my knowledge to West Indies cricket, he said. Lara welcomed the Twenty20 format of the game. I dont generally watch cricket on television but was glued to the TV in the morning at home when I watched India take on Pakistan in the World Twenty20 final, he said. Its a very exciting game and is fun. It has given the authorities a chance to take the game to places not familiar with cricket. However, to me, and to players like Sachin Tendulkar, Test cricket is the ultimate form of the game and I only hope it is not unduly affected (by the Twenty20 game), he added.  (PTI)

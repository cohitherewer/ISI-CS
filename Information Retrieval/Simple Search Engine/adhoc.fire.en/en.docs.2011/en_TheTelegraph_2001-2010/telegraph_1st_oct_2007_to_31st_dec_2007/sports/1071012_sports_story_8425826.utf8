 Jhulan set to lead Bengal
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Bengals women cricketers, playing for the first time under the CAB banner, will kick off their season Saturday. The East Zone Senior Womens League and One-Day Tournament begin on October 23 in Kalyani, and the Bengal women cricketers will have their selection trials from Saturday. The Bengal women selectors have shortlisted around 40 players for the two selection trial matches, selection committee chairman Mithu Mukherjee said. The 15-member Bengal squad will be announced on October 17, the chief selector said. It is almost certain that ICC Womens Cricketer of the Year Jhulan Goswami will lead the side. She (Jhulan) is after all the India vice-captain, Mithu said. The shortlisted cricketers, including Jhulan, will leave for Kalyani on Friday. Im really excited to represent Bengal this time... Im looking forward to the competition, Jhulan, who missed out on the meet last season because of technical reasons, said. Two teams from a total of six (Tripura, Orissa, Assam, Jharkhand, Sikkim and Bengal) will make the knockout stage. The two-day knock-out meet will take place from November 20-30, while the one-day competition will be from November 12-18. The two-day format will have 90 overs per innings, while the one-day competition will be 50-overs a side. Thrilled that Bengal are competing after the CABs approval of the womens wing, the Womens Cricket Association of India (WCAI) secretary Shubhangi Kulkarni said: Its great to see Bengal in the competition. With Jhulan (Goswami) there, Im expecting a healthy competition this time, Kulkarni told The Telegraph from Pune. Kulkarni added that the South Zone meet has already got over with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka making the knock-out stage. The Central Zone meet has begun Wednesday, while in the North Zone it will kick off on Tuesday. The West Zone competition will begin on October 18, she added.

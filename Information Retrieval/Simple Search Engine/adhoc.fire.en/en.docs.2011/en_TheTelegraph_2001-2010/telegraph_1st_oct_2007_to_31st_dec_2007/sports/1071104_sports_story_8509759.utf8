 Jyoti up to tied 3rd, Jeev slips
Sotogrande: Defending champion Jeev Milkha Singhs title defence is as good as over after he carded a three-over 74 to slide to tied 35th after the second round of the Volvo Masters on Friday. Jyoti Randhawa, however, fired a 70 to soar to tied third. The 2004 Volvo Masters of Asia champion produced yet another solid round for a two-day total of one-over 143 to join Miguel Angel Jimenez (70), Soren Kjeldsen (70) and Graeme McDowell (75) in third place after the halfway stage. Jeev, who has an aggregate of eight-over 150, struggled to find the greens and was uncomfortable against the strong wind. Meanwhile, Arjun Atwals 2008 PGA Tour card hopes lay in tatters after the Orlando-based Indian shot himself in the foot with a horrendous second round of four-over 75 in the nation-wide tour championship at Barona Creek in Lakeside, USA. In Sentosa, Shiv Kapur continues to shine brighter with every round and fired two-under 69 and leapfrog to seventh spot after the penultimate round in the $4 million Barclays Singapore Open here on Saturday.

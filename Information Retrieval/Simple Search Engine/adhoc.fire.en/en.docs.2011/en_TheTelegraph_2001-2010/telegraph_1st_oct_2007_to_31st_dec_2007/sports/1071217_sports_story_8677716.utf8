 At least 25 spots for Indian players

New Delhi: The impasse over berth-sharing is finally over and next years Indian Masters, the first European Tour event to be held in the country, will have a strong Indian presence when the $2.5 million event tees off at the Delhi Golf Course on February 7. 
The Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) and Golf in Dubai, the event promoters and organisers, on Sunday decided that a minimum of 25 spots would be allocated to Indian players in the 120-strong field. 
Of the 120 players, eight spots have been reserved for sponsors, two for amateurs and the remaining 110 places have been divided equally between the European Tour and Asian Tour players. 
The Asian tour players will include a minimum of 25 Indian players as the event brings the European Tour, the Asian Tour and the PGTI together in this tri-sanctioned event. 
Golf in Dubai CEO Mohammed Juma Buamaim and PGTI president Gautam Thapar held a press conference in Dubai to announce the end of the deadlock. 
About the star attractions, Buamaim said that, Ernie Els will be joined by most of the Golf in Dubai ambassadors which include Mark Meara, Lee Westwood, Thomas Bjorn, Jeev Milkha Singh, Colin Montgomerie and Ross Bain. We will confirm the players in the coming weeks. 
 The tournament was first announced in June as an event sanctioned only by the European Tour and the Indian Golf Union, a governing body for amateur golf in India. 
Asian Tour chairman Kyi Hla Han protested its exclusion and accused the European Tour of an invasion into (Asian) territory. 
Some of the leading Indian players also threatened to boycott the tournament, which they said challenged the authority of their own body  the PGTI. 
This is now just perfect and meets our twin objectives of having a quality tournament with a strong representation of Indian players, Buamaim said. (AGENCIES)

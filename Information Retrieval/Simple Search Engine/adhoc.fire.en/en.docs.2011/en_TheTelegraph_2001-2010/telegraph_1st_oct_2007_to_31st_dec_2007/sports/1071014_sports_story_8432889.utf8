 Dont care what others think: Sreesanth
INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Sreesanth at nets in Nagpur on Saturday, the eve of the sixth ODI versus Australia. (AFP) Nagpur: Sreesanth may have made news for all the wrong reasons in this series, but he is not repenting his attitude against the world champions. The Australians have targeted him for his show of aggression but he remains unfazed. Aggression comes naturally to me. I dont care what others think. This is the way I play my cricket and cant change overnight for the sake of others, Sreesanth said on Saturday. The Australians are complaining about me, but they should look at themselves. They have been doing this for years When others do that they start complaining, he added. After Andrew Symonds, Ricky Ponting has labelled fresh charges against him after the fourth one-dayer in Chandigarh. Though the pacer was not part of the playing XI, the Australian captain alleged that his taunting from the boundary lines had unsettled them. I having been playing like this since my childhood I enjoy the competition. People say a lot about my antics, but I cant change only for the sake of changing. I have to change it for the better. Its true that I get charged up very quickly, but I am learning to control it. I didnt do anything during the Hyderabad ODI, he said. Sreesanths eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with the batsmen has irked the Australians no end. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had to step in to prevent things from turning ugly during the Kochi ODI. Aggression boosts me. Whatever I say has to be backed up by performance. In other words, I am always helped by my aggressive attitude, he said. Sreesanth is aware of his responsibilities. I know my responsibilities and I never want to let down my captain and team. They have a lot of faith in me I play aggressively and enjoy it. We dont have to be afraid of the Australians. I play my game aggressively and will continue doing so. I have my own expectations and dont want to let myself down. I always try to enjoy my game on the field, he said. Sreesanth, who made his ODI and Test debut in Nagpur, is looking forward to another inspirational performance here. He may make the team after being ignored for the last match in Vadodara. But he will have to keep a check on his aggression if he is to avoid the wrath of the Match Referee.

 Shoaib a distraction and a burden
- Jaffer rsquo;s was probably the best innings I rsquo;ve seen an Indian opener play against us 
 Ramiz at Eden  Shoaib Akhtar at the Eden on Friday. Picture by Gautam Bose It was a real privilege to watch Jaffers innings at the Eden on Friday. It was just as disappointing to see a half-fit Shoaib Akhtar in the XI and the Pakistanis make laughing stock of themselves with a flat performance on the field. Thats the first day of the second Test in a nutshell. Lets dwell on the positives first. Everyone was talking about the quality of Jaffers unbeaten 192, it was quite outstanding. What many missed out was the pace of the innings. To come so close to notching up a double hundred on the opening day of a Test is no childs play. His strike rate was an amazing 75, which helped India take substantial control of the match. Even if they suffer a collapse on the second day, India would still end up in the vicinity of 450 and have enough time to push for victory. It wouldnt have been so rosy for the home team had they managed something like 280 for three instead of 352 for three. The only way Pakistan can survive is to bat for very long periods in both innings. And that wont be a straightforward task, even if the pitch remains flat sans any venom or bite over the next few days. The huge total that would be staring at them would put a lot of pressure on the Pakistan batsmen. Coming back to Jaffer, he killed Pakistani aspirations by dominating Kaneria from the outset. By getting to the pitch of the ball and flicking against the spin, the opener minimised the leggies effectiveness. His treatment of Kaneria was so Laxman-like. Jaffer didnt just do it in patches, he lorded over the Pakistan attack throughout the day. This was probably the best innings Ive seen an Indian opener play against Pakistan. The only hole in his game, if one can call it that, is the tendency to be a bit lazy while playing across the line. It could land him in trouble against express pace. My advice to him would be to play a bit straighter  more in the mid-on to mid-wicket region than mid-wicket and square leg. Jaffers effort ensured that the batsmen at the other end could play their natural game. Dravid was his usual solid self before getting a poor decision. Sachin played another classy knock till he misread Kanerias wrong un. The number of times hes getting out within striking distance of three figures is not funny. I hope its not getting to be a mental block, because the more he thinks about it, the worse it will get. I dont want to take anything away from Jaffer and Sachins quality of strokeplay, but the fact remains that the Pakistan attack looked very ordinary. To begin with, Pakistan took a big gamble with Shoaib  perhaps hoping that Younis will win the toss and opt for first strike, thus giving the pace spearhead another day to rest and regain fitness. Thats not the way to approach a Test and no wonder the move backfired. I would have played Yasir Arafat  so what he reached the ground minutes before the match started  or even left-arm spinner Abdur Rehman in Shoaibs place, because the fast bowler was more a distraction and a burden than an advantage. Distraction because captain Younis had to nurse him all day when he should have been focusing on other things and burden owing to the fact that he was unfit. I would even question the wisdom of playing Faisal Iqbal. They should have taken an extra bowler in Maliks place, knowing that Shoaib would struggle to bowl too many overs. The standard of fielding didnt help matters. Ive never seen such a lacklustre and dispirited Pakistan side on the field. On a day they had to come hard at the opposition, the Pakistanis were pathetic  not just in one session but in all three. The aggro and the attitude you associate with a Pakistan team facing India were conspicuous by their absence.

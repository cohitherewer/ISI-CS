 Nadal rubbishes Murray theory
Madrid: World No. 2 Rafael Nadal said he had seen no evidence to back up Andy Murrays claims that corruption was rife in tennis. I think hes gone overboard, I dont think anything like that happens, Nadal was quoted as saying in the Spanish media on Thursday. Im the number two in the world, Ive been in all the meetings, I see what goes on in the circuit just like him and Im not so stupid as to not know what is going on. I doubt very much that he (Murray) knows more than anyone else. I think that everyone gives it 100 per cent and that there are no fixed games. Murray said on Tuesday that players were aware matches on the ATP Tour were being thrown. (Reuters)

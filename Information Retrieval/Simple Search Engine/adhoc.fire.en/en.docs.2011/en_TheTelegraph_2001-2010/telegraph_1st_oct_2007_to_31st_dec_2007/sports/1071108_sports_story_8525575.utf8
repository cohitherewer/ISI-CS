 Kumble throws hat in ring but Dhoni is set for promotion
 - Vengsarkar amp; Co. meet in Mohali today to appoint Indias Test captain LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHICalcutta: Less than three years after his debut, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is all set to become Indias 30th Test captain. As first reported by The Telegraph on Tuesday, Dhoni became the frontrunner after No.1 choice (of the selectors and the Board) Sachin Tendulkar decided against a third innings. Theres no change in the script, so to say Dhoni is the one who is going to be appointed on Thursday, a well-placed source confirmed late on Wednesday. The selectors (Dilip Vengsarkar, Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal) will be meeting in Mohali, in all probability during the break in the second Indo-Pak ODI. Its not confirmed, but Dhoni could get the job for the Tests at home versus Pakistan and in Australia  a total of seven matches. Hes already the ODI and Twenty20 captain and, so, there wont be any break in continuity. Nor is there going to be uncertainty/confusion, of any kind, in the dressing room. Dhonis advantage is that hes young (26) and has been able to carry the team with him. Indeed, he hasnt been intimidated by the presence of former captains. As important, Dhonis own performance hasnt suffered and hes respected by opponents (and, of course, teammates) for being courageous. A stopgap scenario is never healthy, but veteran Anil Kumble  the dark horse  stands to gain if Vengsarkar and Co. decide not to look that far ahead. Thats not expected, though. In whats unusual for Indian cricket, Kumble has expressed a desire (through a portal) for the top job. Generally, aspirants dont go beyond no comments. But, then, Kumble has never been your run of the mill type.NOT INTERESTED SACHIN TENDULKAR The buzz is that Sachin initially agreed (in principle) to become the Test captain, but had second thoughts as little would be gained by inviting so much more pressure. Tackling Shoaib Akhtar and Brett Lee is in itself a big enough challenge. Theres also talk that some in the BCCI arent exactly disappointed with the turn of events, for it wont now be an all-West Zone or all-Mumbai line-up. Forget the cricket manager (Lalchand Rajput), even Team Indias masseur, Ramesh Mane, is a Mumbaikar! The BCCI president (Sharad Pawar) and chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar are from Mumbai as well.DARK HORSEANIL KUMBLE Is an absolute certainty in crickets longest version and is respected across the fraternity for being competitive with a capital C. In fact, privately, former coach John Wright had favoured him (and not Rahul Dravid) to succeed Sourav Ganguly, but the Bangalorean has only led in a single ODI (successfully, versus England at the Chepauk, in January 2002). Stands to gain if, at the last minute, the selectors have a rethink and decide on a stopgap captain  three Tests against Pakistan and four versus Australia. Doesnt at all appear likely, but in the lead-up, Kumble is pretty much the dark horse.Interestingly, he has actually thrown his hat in the ring.IGNOREDSOURAV GANGULY Indias most successful Test captain hasnt quite got the credit he deserves for injecting passion and steel in his players. Has been consistent since his comeback, 11 months ago, and was the best Indian batsman on view in the last Test series  in England. However, many with influence in the BCCI dont seem to trust Sourav and just about everybody is convinced its time to look ahead. Has the hunger to play and, perhaps, even captain. Unfortunately, the selectors arent looking at him even as a stopgap option.LPS

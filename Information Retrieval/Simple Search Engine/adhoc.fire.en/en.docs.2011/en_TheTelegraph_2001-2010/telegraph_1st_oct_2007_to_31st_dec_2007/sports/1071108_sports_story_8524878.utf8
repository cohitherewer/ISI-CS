 Liverpool scale new heights
	 - Benitezs side hands 8-0 thrashing to Besiktas Henry Winter in Liverpool Liverpools Yossi Benayoun (bottom) celebrates his hattrick against Besiktas with Alvaro Arbeloa during their Champions League group A match at Anfield on Tuesday. (Reuters) Liverpool received planning permission for the new Anfield on Tuesday afternoon and promptly celebrated with a demolition job at their present abode, taking a wrecking ball time and again to Besiktas. On a night of goalscoring stars here, of a hattrick for Yossi Benayoun and doubles for Peter Crouch and Ryan Babel, plus a gem from Steven Gerrard, the shining light in driving Liverpool back into European contention was Javier Mascherano, an unsung hero who deserves his own hymn from the Kop. The Argentinean provided the grit that created this pearl of a performance. And what a performance! Liverpool fans, at their ironic best, chanted attack, attack, attack as the goal count mounted; as if Crouch and company needed any prompting. Rafa Benitezs boys were merciless, though they must still vanquish Porto and Marseille to guarantee qualification from group A. With Mascherano in this majestic form, and goals flowing from assorted quarters, Liverpool will believe the great escape is on. Tuesday nights display was like an adrenalin shot of confidence into Liverpools system, and possibly their season. On the night when Liverpool had all the answers, the only question was how on earth Benitezs side had failed in Istanbul a fortnight ago. Benitez loves a stat and he will certainly enjoy the ones thrown up by his 50th Champions League tie in charge: Liverpools victory, their biggest under Benitez, not only set a Champions League record but was the clubs largest in Europe since overcoming the Finnish part-timers, Oulu, 27 years ago. The club record-keepers worked overtime. Liverpools second goal (Benayouns first) was the clubs 500th in Europe. The Israelis fine contribution was the 16th hattrick by a Liverpool player in Europe. Still the stats rolled: Gerrard is now within a goal of Michael Owens club record of 22 European goals. Another record was probably set by the visiting coach, Ertugrul Saglam, for the shortest post-match press conference at Anfield: under a minute and that included the interpreters reply. As Saglam was apologising and leaving, Liverpool fans were disappearing into the night, chattering excitedly about the penalty-box feats of Benayoun, Crouch, Babel and Gerrard. Back inside Anfield, it was little surprise to see Liverpools chief executive, Rick Parry, chatting intently to Mascheranos owner, Kia Joorabchian. Having paid a fee of 1.5 million for an 18-month rental period of Mascherano, Liverpool will need to pay Joorabchian 17 million to make the deal permanent. The little Argentinian was magnificent, patrolling in front of the back-four, nicking the ball off enemy feet and sliding short passes left, right and centre. With Mascherano dictating the tempo, the wall of noise predicted by Gerrard soon emerged from 10,000 throats on the Kop. They tore into Besiktas, seizing the lead after 19 minutes. Andrei Voronin, busy all night, began the move, cutting in from the left before drilling the ball in towards Crouch. Just as the England striker was about to claim possession, Edouard Cisse slid in and deflected the ball through the middle. Crouch reacted quickest, unleashing a left-foot shot that Hakan Arikan managed to save. Anfield stood in anticipation. Crouch was sharpest to the loose ball, which he turned in impressively from a narrowing angle: 1-0. A roar of joy erupted. Now Liverpool were really in the mood, and they went for the jugular again. Riises powerful header was cleared off the line by Ibrahim Uzulmez. Refusing to allow any frustration to distract him, Riise then set the scene for Liverpools second. The German official, Markus Merk, played a part, gifting Liverpool a throw that was really Besiktas. Riise took it swiftly, sending Voronin down the left. When it comes to passing, the Ukrainian occasionally selects the wrong option, but he chose well here, pausing for Benayoun to arrive in the box before delivering. Benayouns first touch tamed the ball, and his second sent it flying past Arikan: 2-0. The same Liverpool players combined for the third six minutes into the second half. Again Voronin was prominent, cutting in from the left and finding Riise, whose shot was palmed out by Arikan. Benayoun rolled in the loose ball: 3-0. He was not finished for the night. Three minutes later Gerrards thunderous free-kick was pushed out by Arikan and there was Benayoun again, playing the poacher: 4-0. Rather than easing off, Liverpool flicked at the accelerator again and again. Mascherano played the architect for Liverpools next, guiding Gerrard through the middle with a magical pass. Gerrard charged forward, took a flicked return pass from Voronin before burying the ball past poor Arikan: 5-0. Benayoun then crossed from the right for the substitute Babel to score with a wonderful back-heel: 6-0. A clearance then rebounded in off Babel: 7-0. The rout was concluded by Crouchs strong header: 8-0. Astonishing. Liverpool certainly built for the future on Tuesday.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 ...Keen to start with Pervez
 - Rameez to host political show... LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Rameez Raja Mumbai: Former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja will soon be seen in a new avatar  that of a political show host. Its to be telecast on Geo, Pakistans premier private channel. Im quite excited as Ive been wanting to diversify, not restrict myself to cricket commentary, Rameez, also a one-time chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), told The Telegraph. Rameez, who is in India till Saturdays Twenty20 match against Australia, is going to start recording as early as next week. Ive asked the producers to see if President Pervez Musharraf will agree to appearing in the first episode... Of course, I dont know whether thats going to materialise, he said. The show will actually feature two politicians, but Rameez isnt keen on getting President Musharraf and fiery foe Imran Khan together. Then, it wont be a political show and Im going to end up hosting a boxing match, he quipped. Rameez knows both personally. While Imran was his captain, he got acquainted with President Musharraf during his PCB days. The countrys President is the PCBs chief patron.

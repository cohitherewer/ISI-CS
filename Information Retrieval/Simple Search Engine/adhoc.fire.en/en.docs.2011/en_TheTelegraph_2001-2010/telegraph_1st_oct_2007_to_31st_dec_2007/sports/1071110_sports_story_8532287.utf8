(AP) Johannesburg: Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbroken century stand to put South Africa in control of the first Test with a lead of 287 runs against New Zealand on Friday. South Africa reached the close on 179 for two on the second day of play. Amla, who was dropped on two, was 85 not out with Kallis on 76 in a partnership of 159. Fast bowler Dale Steyn tilted the match in South Africas favour when he claimed a career-best five for 34 to help dismiss New Zealand for 118 in their first innings, which they scored in reply to hostss 226. Steyns previous best was the five for 47 he took against New Zealand at Centurion in 2005-06. New Zealand resumed on 41 for two, and they were dismissed 21 balls after lunch. Steyn struck in the fifth over when he bowled nightwatchman Shane Bond for one. Five overs after that, Stephen Fleming pushed at a delivery from paceman Makhaya Ntini and was caught by AB de Villiers at third slip for 40. New Zealand lost their next three wickets for five runs and all of the dismissals involved Kallis. Scott Styris, who scored 11, played an uncertain drive to a Kallis delivery and was caught by Graeme Smith at first slip. In the next over Kallis was at second slip when he took the catch that enabled Steyn to dismiss Jacob Oram for one. Kallis struck again in his next over when he had Ross Taylor caught in the gully by Herschelle Gibbs for 15. Steyn completed his fourth five-wicket haul after lunch when he trapped Brendon McCullum in front for nine before having Chris Martin caught at mid-on by Paul Harris for nought. South Africa were 20 for two in the eighth over of their second innings after fast bowler Bond had Gibbs caught by Michael Papps at third slip for eight and medium-pacer Martin bowled Smith for nine. Bond would have had two wickets had wicketkeeper McCullum not dropped a catch offered by Amla on two. Instead, the New Zealanders toiled without reward in the final session as Kallis and Amla built South Africas lead.  (REUTERS)

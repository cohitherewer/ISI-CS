 NZ to stick with injured Fleming
 Stephen Fleming Johannesburg: Stephen Flemings dislocated thumb will not stop him trying to steady New Zealands shaky batting in the first Test against South Africa starting on Thursday. The injury forced the former captain out of the 85-run defeat by South Africa A at the weekend. The only thing that will make me not select him is if he doesnt pitch up, New Zealand coach John Bracewell told a news conference. New Zealand were dismissed in all four innings in their two warm-up matches, only once scoring more than 300. South Africa this month became just the third team from outside the Asian sub-continent to win both a Test and one-day series in Pakistan. South Africa coach Mickey Arthur also wants his players to look forward. Weve been playing in foreign conditions and were coming straight out of Pakistan while theyve been here, Arthur said. TEAMS South Africa (from): Graeme Smith (captain), Hashim Amla, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, Herschelle Gibbs, Paul Harris, Jacques Kallis, Andre Nel, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Ashwell Prince, Dale Steyn. New Zealand (from): Daniel Vettori (captain), Shane Bond, Craig Cumming, Stephen Fleming, Mark Gillespie, Brendon McCullum, Chris Martin, Michael Mason, Iain Brien, Jacob Oram, Michael Papps, Jeetan Patel, Scott Styris, Ross Taylor, Lou Vincent.

 Sehwag in frame for 2nd Test

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
Melbourne: The circumstances-driven experiment of opening with former captain Rahul Dravid may not continue in the second Test, at the SCG, from Wednesday. 
According to The Telegraphs sources, Virender Sehwag is very much in the frame and, if it comes to that, Yuvraj Singh will be dropped. 
That wont be necessary if, unfortunately, Sourav Ganguly doesnt recover from his illness. If he cant play, then a vacancy opens on its own. 
Meanwhile, cricket manager (or acting coach) Lalchand Rajput has promised that the team will come back strong and that the Australians are known to score on the mind games front. 
Speaking on Sunday, he admitted that the fielding lacked intensity in the first Test. Also, that more self-belief was needed. 
The Australians, as expected, have retained their XII for Sydney.

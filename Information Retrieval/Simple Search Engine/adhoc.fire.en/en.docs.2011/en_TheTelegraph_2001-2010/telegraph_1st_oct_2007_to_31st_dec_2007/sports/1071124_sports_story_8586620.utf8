 Dont blame foreigners: Beckham 
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  David Beckham with school children on the second anniversary of the David Beckham Academy in London. (Reuters) London: David Beckham has said the influx of foreign players into the Premier League is not to blame for Englands failure to reach the Euro 2008 finals. A 2-3 defeat by Croatia at Wembley meant England failed to qualify for a major tournament for the first time since the 1994 World Cup, and resulted in the sack for Steve McClaren after just 15 months in the job. Some have pointed to the invasion of foreign stars into the Premier League as having a detrimental effect on the development of English talent, but Beckham has been quick to dismiss such suggestions. He said: I think its just an excuse, personally. Because we got knocked out of the Euros, people are going to look for certain excuses and one of them that was thrown at me was are there too many foreigners in the game? For me, foreigners coming into the Premier League and into our country has lifted the profile of the game, it has lifted the quality of the game. If you look at statistics, in 74 and 78 when we didnt qualify for the World Cup, there was probably 90 per cent of the English league that was English players. Foreign managers, like Arsene have come in and made our game a lot more interesting. Youve got to get the balance right, theres no point in turning round and having the easy option and saying its because weve got too many foreigners in the game. Beckham won his 99th cap as England lost on Wednesday, but the 32-year-old says he still has a future with the national team. Ill still be available and hopefully Ill still be playing, and playing well enough, to be in the England squad in 2010 but who knows? he said. Everything can change and Ive seen that in the last 12 months. I said at the start of my career Id always want to play for my country and Id never retire from playing for my country. Obviously that could be taken out of my hands but I want to reach my 100 caps, I want to reach the milestone and to get 100 caps would be a dream come true for me.

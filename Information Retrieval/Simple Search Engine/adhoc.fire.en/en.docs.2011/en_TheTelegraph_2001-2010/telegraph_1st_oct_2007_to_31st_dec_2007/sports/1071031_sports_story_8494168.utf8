 President, PM bowl over players
 New Delhi: More than a month after their ICC World Twenty20 triumph in South Africa sent the entire nation into a frenzy, Indias cricket stars on Tuesday received a rare honour of being felicitated by the President and the Prime Minister. It turned out to be a red-letter day for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his bravehearts as they first got an audience with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and were then felicitated by President Pratibha Patil at the majestic Darbar Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The Indian hockey team, which won the Asia Cup recently, also had their moment of glory with the President along with the cricketers at a simple ceremony lasting for about half an hour. It was a moment to cherish for the cricketers as they interacted with the Prime Minister and his wife Gursharan Kaur for close to 15 minutes. The Prime Minister personally congratulated each of the players and presented them with mementoes. The President also hosted a High Tea at the Banquet Hall for the two squads who were dressed in formal navy blue blazers. Virender Sehwag was absent. Dhoni presented a bat to the President signed by all players of the winning squad. Hockey captain Prabodh Tirkey gifted a replica of the Asia Cup as the President posed with the team. It is heartening to know that it has been a successful year for Indian sport. I congratulate the victorious teams for their hard work. The President also appreciated the football teams feat of winning the Nehru Cup although Baichung Bhutias men missed the ceremony because of their World Cup qualifier against Lebanon. It is really very overwhelming to be at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. We also met the Prime Minister in the morning, said Venkatesh Prasad, bowling coach of the cricket team. Yuvraj Singh was also very excited at meeting the First Lady and the Prime Minister. She appreciated our triumph while the Prime Minister fondly recalled his childhood days in Punjab. An excited Sreesanth said, this is one of a kind experience for me. The President said well done. This is something I never expected. Tirkey said, It is a grand occasion for us and we are happy to be here.  (PTI)

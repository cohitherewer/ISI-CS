 Murder theory rubbished
 Bob Woolmer Kingston: South African pathologist Lorna Martin told the inquest into the death of Bob Woolmer that the former Pakistan coach apparently died of natural causes and mistakes were made in his autopsy. Woolmer died in Jamaica on March 18, hours after he was found unconscious in his hotel room the day after Pakistans upset loss to Ireland in the World Cup. Martin thus became the third pathologist to criticise the post-mortem procedures of Jamaican government pathologist Ere Sheshiah, who reported that the former England player died of manual strangulation. When authorities said they were treating the death as murder, it sparked feverish speculation that the case was somehow linked to match-fixing in cricket. However, three months later, police said the murder investigation had been closed and that Woolmer died of natural causes. British pathologist Nathaniel Carey and his Canadian counterpart Michael Pollanen, like Martin, reviewed the post-mortem procedures and findings and concluded that Woolmer wasnt strangled. They said the findings indicated the 58-year-old died of natural causes related to heart disease. It doesnt appear that the international practice was followed in the examination of the neck, Martin testified on Tuesday. I am of the opinion that he died of natural causes. Martin, who signed the cremation certificate for Woolmers body after it arrived in his home of South Africa, said she reached that conclusion after viewing a video of Sheshiahs autopsy. Like Pollanen on Monday, Martin was asked about her knowledge of a toxin that was found in Woolmers body, and whether it could have been used to weaken him before strangling him.  (AFP)

 Gangjee shares 14th spot
Hanoi: Rahil Gangjees sedate final round of 70 earned him a share of the 14th slot, while fellow Calcutta pro S.S.P. Chowrasia carded his best round of the week, a four-under 68, to finish tied 23rd in the inaugural Hana Bank Vietnam Masters here Sunday. Among other Indians in the fray, Gurbaaz Mann came tied 26th, ahead of Arjun Singh (tied 29th), Gaganjeet Bhullar (tied 31), Digvijay Singh(tied 35) and Harmeet Kahlon (tied 53). Thailands Chapchai Nirat claimed a two-shot victory after firing a closing five-under 67 to finish ahead of Simon Griffiths of England and compatriot Chawalit Plaphol. By picking up the winners cheque of $ 79,250, Chapchai also stayed in the hunt for the prestigious Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit crown where he has now moved up to third place and is the only player who can deny current leader Liang Wen-Chong of China the merit title.

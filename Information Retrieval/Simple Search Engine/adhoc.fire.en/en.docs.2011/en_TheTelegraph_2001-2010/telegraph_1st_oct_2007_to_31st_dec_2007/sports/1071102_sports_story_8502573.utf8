 Lampard future still uncertain
VICKI HODGES Chelsea coach Avram Grant has refused to be drawn into whether Frank Lampard will sign a new contract as the England internationals future at Stamford Bridge remains in balance. Lampard has 18 months left to run on his current deal but is yet to sit down to discuss new terms, sparking fears he is set to leave the club he joined in 2001. The 29-year-old came to Chelseas rescue on Wednesday night by scoring a hattrick, including a last-gasp winner in their comeback 4-3 Carling Cup success over Leicester to book them a place in the last eight. It follows his outstanding performance in their 6-0 drubbing of Manchester City at the weekend and, while coach Grant is delighted with the midfielders current run of good form, he has said he will not get involved in contract negotiations with the player. The Israeli coach said: Frank is very important for the team. He likes to do things to a high level that is his target and our target. I am not involved in the money situation. They are negotiating and at the end of the day they will find a solution. Frank wants to stay at Chelsea and Chelsea want Frank.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

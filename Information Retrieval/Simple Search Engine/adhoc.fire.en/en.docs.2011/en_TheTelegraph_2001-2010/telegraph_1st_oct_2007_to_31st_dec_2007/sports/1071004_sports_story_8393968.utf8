 Boucher: I grew up watching Healy on TV
Karachi: South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher said victory over Pakistan in the first Test would be more important than his own feat of passing Ian Healys world record for dismissals. Boucher made two stumpings in his 103rd Test off left-arm spinner Paul Harris to break Australian Healys mark of 395 dismissals on Day III of the first Test versus Pakistan. Obviously it is a great feeling for me to break such a good wicketkeepers record. But the bottom line for me is if we can pull off a win in this Test. It will be probably be the cherry on top, Boucher said. The feat helped dismiss the hosts for 291 before South Africa forged ahead to 76 for three to carve an overall lead of 235 runs with two days remaining. Healy is someone who I used to watch on TV and loved the way he kept. So it is also sad to break such a good keepers record. But I have played enough Tests so this had to come along, said Boucher. Boucher said he had never been a person for statistics but breaking Healys record was probably the best milestone he had got. Boucher also praised Harris and said his second stumping was not actually a stumping. It was an edge but we leave it as a stumping. Harry bowled really well he dried up one end for us in the day and bowled lot of pressure balls. It is great for South African cricket to have a spinner do that. The difference between Paul and other spinners is he is tall and gets bounce and consistently puts the ball in the right areas. The lead of 160 runs is like gold at the moment, Boucher said. If we can get another 100 runs, say a lead around 320, its something competitive to bowl at. Butt had recovered from abdominal pains that prevented him opening Pakistans first innings Tuesday and forced him to hospital for around 11 hours. If we get 300-run lead, it will be difficult on this wicket to chase and it will be a true test of my skills in the second innings, Harris said.  (AGENCIES)

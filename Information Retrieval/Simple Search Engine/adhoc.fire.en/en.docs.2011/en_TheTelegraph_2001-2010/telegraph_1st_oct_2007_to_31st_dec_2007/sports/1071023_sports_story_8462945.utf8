 Ric Charlesworths utility questioned
Hyderabad: Former World Cupper Charles Cornelius said that the Indian mens hockey team was doing well under coach Joaquim Carvalho and did not need the assistance of Australian legend Ric Charlesworth. He cannot do wonders in one or two months time (before the Olympic qualifiers). The fitness level of our boys is at the optimum level. The present coaching staffs are doing a wonderful job. We do not need Ric at this stage, Cornelius said. Cornelius, a member of the World Cup sides that bagged a bronze and a silver in 1971 and 1973, respectively, expressed confidence that the Indian team would make the cut for the Beijing Olympics. Joaquim has his own inputs and has implemented them well. He, as an Indian, will have greater responsibility than a foreigner. If one goes by the boys performance in the Asia Cup, India should be in the 2008 Olympics. I am not in favour of Rics appointment. Maybe, he can work with the womens and junior teams and show the results before being allowed to handle the seniors, he said. Meanwhile, former India coach Vasudevan Baskaran was of the opinion that the appointment of Charlesworth as technical advisor will put undue pressure on the present coaching staff. If Charlesworth is coming only in an advisory capacity, he is definitely being present during the training venues. His presence itself, I am saying this as a former coach of the team and from my experience, will put tremendous pressure on the entire coaching staff. I am sure he will not be able to achieve anything in such a short time when it comes to the qualifying event and then in the Olympics, Baskaran said in an interview. Baskaran also felt that the Charlesworths role needs to be defined properly. The job entrusted to him is not very clear. It is to be seen whether he is going to discuss coaching aspects with M. M. Sommaiya and Joaquim Carvalho. These two have their own plans and schemes as to take India to the Olympics, former India coach said. (PTI)

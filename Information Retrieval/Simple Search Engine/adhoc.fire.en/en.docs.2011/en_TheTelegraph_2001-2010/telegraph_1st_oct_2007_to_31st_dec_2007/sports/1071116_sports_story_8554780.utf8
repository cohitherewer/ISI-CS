 AFC scraps Delhi project for a year 
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: The AIFFs much publicised Vision India venture received a severe jolt when the AFC scraped its Delhi project for a year earlier this week. According to a source, the project, which was supposed to kick start on November 19 in the capital, would have brought a substantial grant from English football giants Chelsea, one of the sponsors for AFCs project. The vision project was scheduled to start with the Elite City League in Delhi, said the source. Two top Chelsea officials along with the London mayor were expected to attend the opening day function. It would have been a big boost for the game in India but poor handling of things by the AIFF and the Delhi Soccer Association (DSA) has marred the entire project.The AFC, which had been urging the AIFF to pull up its socks on the project since Fifa president Sepp Blatters visit to India, wanted the Delhi Elite League to be played with 10 teams, strictly on round robin format. As the DSA couldnt finalise on 10 teams, a senior functionary of the AIFF suggested the league be played with 16 teams divided into two groups. An upset AFC shot down the proposal immediately and decided to postpone the league by a year. Projects of similar kinds are in the pipeline in Manipur, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and there is apprehension that these also may go the Delhi way.

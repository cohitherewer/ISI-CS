 FIA okays Spyker name change 
Paris: Spykers request to change its name to the Force India Formula One next season has been accepted by the FIA, the world body said on Wednesday. The teams new owner, Indian billionaire Vijay Mallya, who bought the team this month with Dutch businessman Michiel Mol, had his request granted at a meeting of the FIAs World Motor Sport Council in Paris. The name change will be the third for the team since 2005, when Silverstone-based Jordan was sold to Midland. Midland became Spyker last year after being taken over by the ailing Dutch luxury sportscar maker. (Reuters)

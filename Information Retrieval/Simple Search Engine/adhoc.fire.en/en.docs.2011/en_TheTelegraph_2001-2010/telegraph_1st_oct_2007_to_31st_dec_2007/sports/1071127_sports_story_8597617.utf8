 Malik twists ankle
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES Shoaib Malik at the Kotla on Monday New Delhi/ Karachi: Under-fire Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik suffered an injury scare on Monday when he twisted his left ankle during a practice session. He was playing football with his teammates. Malik was rushed to a local hospital where he underwent an MRI scan and the injury was found to be a minor one. Malik should be completely fit in a couple of days time, a team official said. The young captain has come under fire for his uninspiring captaincy and his own form after Pakistan lost the one-day series to India and also the first Test in Delhi Monday. According to sources in Karachi, Malik is losing his popularity in the side as, of late, he has distanced himself from senior players and started taking unilateral decisions. The source said Malik had stopped consulting senior players and was taking most of the decisions himself. He is only close to manager Talat Ali whom he consults about everything, a source said. A source in the team disclosed that when Malik first became captain, he used to consult and seek advice from his senior players. He used to take the entire team along with him in all decisions and had created a good atmosphere in the dressing room. But of late he has changed. He is now more individualistic and aloof and hardly consults the seniors, the source claimed. The source said his own inconsistent form with bat and ball had also only added pressure on the 25-year old.

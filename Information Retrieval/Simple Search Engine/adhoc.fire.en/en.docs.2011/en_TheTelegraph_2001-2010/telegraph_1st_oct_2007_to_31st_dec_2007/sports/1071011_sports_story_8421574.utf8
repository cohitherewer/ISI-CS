 Murray gets summons from ATP
 MARK HODGKINSON Andy Murray Andy Murray has been called to an urgent meeting with the Association of Tennis Professionals after he alleged on Tuesday that players had been taking bribes to throw matches. Murray is set to speak to ATP investigators during next weeks Madrid Masters. The British No. 1, who is competing in Moscow this week, has suggested that lesser players on the circuit are the most likely to be tempted to lose matches deliberately for money. Its pretty disappointing for all the players, but everyone knows that it goes on, Murray said. It doesnt surprise me. Some guys come to tournaments like this every single week and the first round losers cheque is sort of 2,500 euros. Theyve got to pay for their air fares and its only a 10 or 12 year career, so you have to make all your money while you are still playing. The 20-year-old also indicated that the ATP, the governing body of mens tennis, would struggle to prove that players had thrown matches. Such was the explosive effect of Murrays allegations that his agent, Patricio Apey, was quickly contacted by the ATP. Apey said on Tuesday that he expected the meeting with Murray to take place in Madrid. A spokesman for the ATP confirmed: We have asked Andy Murray, through his agent, for a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the claims made public. Nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport and the ATP has shown that it will act where it has information which requires investigation. Our anti-corruption programme has stringent procedures in place to deal with any suspected corruption. The ATP is also planning to bring in a rule giving players 48 hours to tell the authorities if they have been approached to throw a match. They will risk disciplinary action if they fail to do so. In addition, ATP executive chairman Etienne de Villiers has disclosed that his association, the organisers of the grand slam tournaments, the International Tennis Federation and the WTA Tour would all meet on Friday to discuss setting up a dedicated anti-corruption unit. A dedicated global tennis integrity unit is a key priority for the sport and plans to create one are well-advanced, the South African said.  The Daily Telegraph

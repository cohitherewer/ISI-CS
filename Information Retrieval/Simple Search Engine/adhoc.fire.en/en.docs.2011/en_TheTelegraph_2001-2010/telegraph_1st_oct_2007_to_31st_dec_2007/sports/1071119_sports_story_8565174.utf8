 Pak win by 31 runs, make it 2-3
JAYDEEP BASU MoM Shoaib Malik after completing his fifty in Jaipur on Sunday. (PTI) Related reports, scorecard: Page 18 Jaipur: Pakistan finally came good when it was too late. The visitors dished out a good allround performance to beat India by 31 runs in the fifth and final ODI for the IndianOil Cup on Sunday. A capacity crowd turned out at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium expecting an Indian victory. They must have gone home a tad disappointed after Pakistan, who had already surrendered the series in Gwalior, came out comfortable winners. Pakistan enjoyed the upper hand throughout the encounter. After Sohaib Malik (89) and Mohammed Yousuf (74) shared a 168-run fourth wicket partnership to take their team to a challenging 306 for six, their bowlers showed great discipline and accuracy to restrict India to 275 in 49.5 overs. Both teams made four changes to their playing XI. Sourav Ganguly was rested along with Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and Rudra Pratap Singh. Pakistan also gave their youngsters a chance in place of Shoaib Akhtar, Shahid Afridi, Younis Khan and Kamran Akmal. Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni opted to field after winning the toss as the dew was expected to make things difficult for the team bowling second. It didnt help as India lost their way in as early as the 12th over. They lost four wickets for just 62 runs, three of them going to Sohail Tanveer. The Indian batsmen failed to apply themselves and the pacer bowled intelligently. Except for Sachin Tendulkar (30) none in the top-order looked good for the chase. Tanveer ended with impressive figures of four for 53. Rohit Sharma  playing his first match of the series like pacer Praveen Kumar  was also impressive. The Mumbai batsman hit 52, striking three fours and one six off Rao Iftikhar in a fluent innings that lasted 61 balls. Much was expected from Dhoni, who scored a fabulous 183 against Sri Lanka at this venue two years ago. On Sunday, he was stopped at 24 off 32 deliveries. In between, he slipped and injured his ankle and Sehwag had to be called in as runner. Man of the Series Yuvraj Singh scored yet another 50 but departed caught behind off Umar Gul. He felt he never played the ball and left only after giving umpire Suresh Shastri a long hard stare. The Pakistan innings revolved around Malik and Yousuf. Pakistan had slumped to 77 for three by the 17th over before the captain walked in to rescue the visitors. Malik, who failed in the earlier four matches of the series, played a responsible knock of 89 off 82 deliveries that remained the backbone of Pakistan innings. He was named Man of the Match. For India, Sreesanth was the most successful bowler with three wickets. But given the hard work put in by Praveen, he should have been among wickets. He opened the bowling and impressed with his ability to maintain a perfect line and length. In 10 overs he conceded only 50 runs. His performance inspired Dhoni to allow him to bowl the last over of the innings. The youngster didnt disappoint his captain and gave away only seven runs.

 Patil, Manjrekar want Pawar to intervene
Mumbai: The dropping of former captain Rahul Dravid continued to evoke sharp criticism with two former players slamming chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar and demanding BCCI chief Sharad Pawars intervention. Sandeep Patil and Sanjay Manjrekar said Dravid got a raw deal from the selectors, who showed scant respect for his contribution to Indian cricket. I had earlier supported the idea that Sharad Pawar, as BCCI president, should not interfere in selection matters. I would revise my decision now and recall how once N.K.P. Salve, as then BCCI president, had intervened and influenced the selectors to include Sunil Gavaskar after he had been dropped, Patil said. Patil said the latest development was perhaps linked to Dravid relinquishing the captaincy without any reason after a successful England tour. He also looked out of sorts during the recent ODI series against Australia. The national selectors have played a planned game. The manner in which they have dumped a devoted cricketer like Dravid only reflects the degeneration that has come to dominate Indian cricket on and off the field, Patil said. I feel very sad at the treatment given to Rahul. Captain of the team a few months ago, he relinquished the responsibility for reasons he has not disclosed, but it is not difficult to understand, he was quoted as saying by a site. Now I can understand why Rahul appeared so different during the series against Australia. He was under tremendous pressure and I suspect he is a victim of a conspiracy, Patil said. What is worse is that this ugly episode involves a dear friend of mine. I fail to understand how come a batsman who always played with a straight bat is now indulging in cross-batted stuff. It will be wrong to blame Dilip alone for the decision because four others also have agreed to this illogical step, he added. Manjrekar said it was unfortunate that a selfless cricketer like Dravid had been given such a raw deal when he needed the support most. If Dravid has indeed been dropped, it is unfortunate. Dravid has been the most selfless Indian cricketer that I have seen for the last ten years, he wrote for a website. If anybody deserved a life jacket in troubled waters it was Dravid. But if his exclusion is part of a process with a clear vision, then it will make some sense, for it is critical that the process must continue without compromise. Otherwise, Dravid would have got a very raw deal he least deserved, he said. Manjrekar also flayed the selectors for not showing the courage to accept that they had dropped the senior batsman, and not rested him. (PTI)

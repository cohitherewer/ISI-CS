 Dhoni, Yuvraj put India 1-0 ahead
UMANAND JAISWALGuwahati: The opening tie of the IndianOil Cup between India and Pakistan on Monday was not exactly the cracker of a match fans were hoping for ahead of Diwali. At the end of 97 overs, the last few played in fading light with Shoaib Akhtar going full pelt, India ensured that the visitors would have to do all the catching up when they face each other again in Mohali on Thursday. Chasing 240, India reached 242 for five to go one up in the five-match series at the Nehru Stadium, but it was not as easy as it appeared to be. For one, the wicket was demanding and that required grafting rather than the slam-bang stuff India dished out in the ICC World Twenty20 final against the same opposition. A collective effort by the hosts was what won the day, though it had started on a different note with Mahendra Singh Dhoni losing the toss and Pakistan opting to bat on what had then looked to be a good wicket. With opener Salman Butt leading the charge with a 50, Dhoni had more reason to worry. But the departure of Kamran Akmal, the seasoned Younis Khans failure to find his groove  he scratched around for a 25 off 57 balls  and Butts run-out off a smart piece of fielding by Yuvraj Singh saw Pakistan lose their way. Probing spells by Rudra Pratap Singh, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Murali Kartik and Sachin Tendulkar never really allowed Pakistan to take off. Had Mohammed Yousuf (83) not survived on nine  Sourav Ganguly dropped a skier  and Misbah-ul Haq not stepped up the tempo with a 27, Pakistan would have struggled even more. India may have won with ease in the end, but the start was anything but perfect with Shoaib trapping Tendulkar leg-before wicket for four in his second over. Sourav (39) and Gautam Gambhir (44), however, steadied the boat by stitching together an 82-run partnership. Dhoni and Yuvraj then put on 105 off 133 balls for the fourth wicket to take India to 218 for four. After their departure, Robin Uthappa and Irfan saw the Indians home with some sensible batting. Dhoni complimented his bowlers and batsmen for a job well done. But Team India know that they have to keep up the good work if they want to take this momentum into the Mohali match and further. Cricket manager Lalchand Rajput said: The first match is always important and it is nice to go one up. We hope to maintain the momentum. The boys played according to plan and all credit goes to them. Since the wicket was slow and turning, the plan was to bat sensibly and build partnerships, and that was what they did. We had a good game and we need to keep going. The fans were disciplined too, and there was no repetition of the trouble that had led to the India-England ODI being abandoned in 2006.

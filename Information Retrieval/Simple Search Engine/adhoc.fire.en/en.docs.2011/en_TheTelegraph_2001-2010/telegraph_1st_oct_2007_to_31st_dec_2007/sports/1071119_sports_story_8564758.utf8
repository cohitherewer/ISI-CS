 Horses breezed for Tuesday sales 
 STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Fifteen horses were breezed on Sunday at the RCTC raceground, in preparations for Tuesdays auction sales. Twelve of the total lots have been bought by RCTC, from the western and southern turf centres, and all of them are learnt to be sound. Three lots listed in the catalogues belong to a local owner.

 Lebanon to miss Antar
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi: Left with a mountain to climb against mighty Lebanon, India were still gladdened by a piece of good news emanating from the Lebanon camp. The visitors arrived in Chennai on Friday without their star midfielder Roda Antar. Antar, who was the architect of Lebanons 4-1 win over India, has since returned to Germany to resume duty for FC Cologne. The Bundesliga star, according to Lebanon team management, is unlikely to make an appearance for the World Cup qualifier in Chennai on Sunday. The Lebanese side, however, got down to business no sooner they arrived in Chennai. The visitors straightaway headed to a local school ground for a full-fledged practice session. Placed comfortably against India, the visitors were more worried about the weather than Roda Antars absence. It has been raining in Chennai for the past few days though the organisers are hoping to have a clear sky on Sunday. Because of continuous rainfall, the pitch at the Nehru Stadium is still very soft, said a member of the organising committee. We might be forced to cancel the practice session for both the teams at the ground (on Saturday). Under Fifa rules, both teams must get an opportunity to practice at the venue for at least 45 minutes before the match. The Indians, who arrived in Chennai in the evening, have left behind four players who were in the Goa camp. They are Anwar, Karanjit Singh, Arindam Bhattacharya and Bungo Singh, who are yet to recover from injuries. National coach Bob Houghton is hopeful that two of his key players  Rennedy Singh (left ankle injury) and NS Manju (fever)  would recover before the crucial encounter.

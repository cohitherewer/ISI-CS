The secretary of the Karachi City Cricket Association, Siraj-ul-Islam Bukhari said on Monday that Ibrahim, who ran his own business in Karachis posh locality of Pechs till few years back, died after a prolonged illness. He was out of touch with cricket for some years now. But in the 60s and 70s used to come to watch the matches, Bukhari said.

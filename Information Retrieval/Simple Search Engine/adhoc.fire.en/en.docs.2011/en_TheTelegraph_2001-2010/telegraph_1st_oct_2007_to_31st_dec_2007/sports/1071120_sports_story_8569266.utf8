 Yuvraj Singh fined for showing dissent
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Yuvraj Singh has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICCs Code of Conduct during the fifth and final ODI against Pakistan in Jaipur on Sunday. The punishment was announced by ICC Match Referee Roshan Mahanama following a hearing after the match, according to an ICC release on Monday. Yuvraj was charged under clause 2.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct which refers to showing serious dissent at an umpires decision. The charge was laid by on-field umpires Billy Doctrove and Suresh Shastri, as well as third umpire Amish Saheba. It related to Yuvrajs dismissal, caught behind by Sarfraz Ahmed off Umar Gul while attempting a hook shot. After umpire Shastri raised the finger, the southpaw stood his ground and then appeared to indicate that the ball hit his shoulder rather than the bat before starting to leave the crease. At the hearing, Yuvraj pleaded not guilty and also apologised for any offence he might have caused. Mahanama took into account the apology and also the fact that it was the players first appearance at a Code of Conduct hearing in eight years at the international level and downgraded the charge to Level 1.3. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and India team manager Lalchand Rajput were also present during the hearing.

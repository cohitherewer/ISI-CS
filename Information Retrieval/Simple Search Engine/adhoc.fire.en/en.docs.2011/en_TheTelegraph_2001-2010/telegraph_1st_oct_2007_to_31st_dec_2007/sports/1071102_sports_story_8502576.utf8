 Baghdatis packs off Davydenko
 Marcos Baghdatis after beating Nikolay Davydenko in Paris on Thursday. (Reuters) Paris: Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis packed off defending champion Nikolay Davydenko with an impressive 6-2, 6-2 win in the third round of the Paris Masters Series on Thursday. Baghdatis offered a near faultless display to set up a quarter final against Spains Tommy Robredo or Argentine Guillermo Canas and keep alive his slender hopes of making the season-finale Masters Cup featuring the worlds top eight. British No.1 Andy Murray moved closer to a Masters Cup spot by crushing Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-4, 6-2 to reach the quarter finals on Thursday. Earlier, Roger Federer struggled to tame Croat Ivo Karlovic for the second time in five days when he beat him 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 in the second round on Wednesday.  (AGENCIES)

 Romania crush Albania 6-1 to top group 
 Dica exults after scoring one of his goals against Albania Bucharest: Nicolae Dica and Daniel Niculae scored twice as Romania capped a fine Euro 2008 qualifying campaign by thrashing Albania 6-1 to seal top spot in group G on Wednesday. Steaua Bucharest forward Dica opened the scoring after 21 minutes to give the hosts a 1-0 halftime lead, and converted a penalty in the second half. Niculae scored his double in just two minutes midway through the second half. The other goals came from Gabriel Tamas, who scored with a 30-metre free-kick eight minutes after the break, and from Ciprian Marica who converted Romanias second penalty in the second half. Albania finished with nine men after defender Debatik Curri was sent off on the hour and fellow centre back Nevil Dede followed 11 minutes later. Substitute Edmond Kapllani notched Albanias only goal in between Niculaes quick-fire double. In Nicosia, Daniel Pudil and Jan Koller scored a goal each Wednesday to give the Czech Republic a 2-0 victory over Cyprus. The Czech Republic had already qualified for next years tournament from group D along with Germany. Pudil beat Cyprus goalkeeper Antonis Georgallides with a curling shot in the 11th minute, and Koller headed the ball in from a corner in the 74th. In Tbilisi, Audrius Ksanavicius scored two goals to help Lithuania beat Georgia 2-0. Ksanavicius scored in the 52nd minute with a powerful drive into the left corner from 21 meters. He added his second goal by shooting into the right corner six minutes into injury time.  (AGENCIES)

 Dravid wont be missed, suggests captain
OUR CORRESPONDENTGuwahati: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is faced with a dilemma  whom to choose between Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. We are yet to decide whom to play. Both are batting well. Sehwag was in good nick at the nets. Gautam too is in good form and improving, he said at the press conference. A confident Dhoni said they were up for the series when asked whether there was any pressure playing against Pakistan. It is another series and you have to give your hundred percent, he said. Asked whether the middle-order will be fragile in the absence of Rahul Dravid, Dhoni asked: Why do you think so? Arent the others reliable ... We are a good batting side. But we need to improve our fielding and running between the wickets, he said. Dhoni went on to add that though it was difficult to replace the likes Dravid, Ganguly and Tendulkar, it was also a chance for youngsters to prove their mettle. Dhoni observed that the pitch appeared flat and the spinners will struggle a bit. It is a worrying factor, but we have to adapt, he said, adding that he was glad the team was improving in the death overs. In the last couple of games we have been improving in the death overs. Hope we keep on improving. The India captain rated the Pakistan pace attack highly. They have a strong pace attack with Shoaib Akhtar back in action. Both sides appear similar in many ways. Both have lot of options, he added, hinting at players who can both bat and ball. Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik said that while the absence of Mohammed Asif will be felt, it was good to have Akhtar back in the side. Like Dhoni, Malik, too, did not feel that short boundary will help any one team. We are looking forward to a good series. We have come to play good cricket, he said.

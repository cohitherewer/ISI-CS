 CCTV to monitor CCI crowd 
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: CCTV cameras will be in use during the one-off Twenty20 International between India and Australia at the CCI on Saturday. In addition to the Mumbai Police, who will keep a strict vigil, the cameras will monitor the crowd behaviour, according to information received here. Meanwhile, ICC CEO Malcolm Speed has urged members to stick to the zero tolerance approach towards racism as mentioned in the ICCs Anti-Racism Code. Speaking in the wake of reports of racist behaviour by sections of the crowd during Wednesdays ODI between India and Australia in Mumbai, Speed said: Traditionally racism has not been a significant issue for cricket. To make sure it (the issue of racism) stays that way I would urge our members to enact the terms of the code as firmly as possible, according to an ICC release. If people are seen or heard behaving in a racist way then our message to the ground authorities and host boards is clear: find the culprits, throw them out and keep them out because racism has no place in our sport, Speed said.

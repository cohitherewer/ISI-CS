 CRICKET BRIEFS 
						 Eight top Lankans				 for IPL						
							 New Delhi: The Indian Premier League on Monday announced the signing of eight current Sri Lankan cricketers, including captain Mahela Jayawardene and Muthiah Muralidharan, for its inaugural edition. The others are: Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Zoysa, Fervez Mahroof and Dilhara Fernando.
				 The IPL has already signed the likes of Shane Warne, Stephen Fleming and Glenn McGrath for the Twenty20 tournament, seen as a counter to the breakaway ICL. 					
	 SA body differs with CSA					
	 Durban: Cricket South Africa (CSA) and the South African Cricketers rsquo; Association (SACA) are headed for confrontation over the breakaway Indian Cricket League (ICL).					
	 The chief executive of CSA, Gerald Majola, told a newspaper that those South Africans who play in the planned 20-over competition will be banned from the game in their country.						
	 ldquo;...Once they play even one game in the ICL tournament, it rsquo;ll be over and they will never be allowed to play in South Africa again, rdquo; the paper quoted Majola as saying.
						 Tony Irish, the chief executive of SACA, said the body was concerned over CSA rsquo;s stand.
 ldquo;We rsquo;re not happy with a blanket ban on players, and I rsquo;ll be taking that up with the CSA, rdquo; Irish said on Monday. 						
	 Darrell Hair revelation					
	 London: Umpire Darrell Hair claims his life has been made ldquo;hell rdquo; since the forfeited Oval Test match between England and Pakistan last year.					
	 Hair claimed racial discrimination and harassment as reasons for the International Cricket Council (ICC) dropping him from the elite panel of umpires.						
	 The Australian had penalised Pakistan five runs on charges of ball tampering which precipitated one of the biggest crises in the history of the game when Pakistan eventually forfeited the test.						
	 Hair was barred from officiating major international matches following his actions in that game. ldquo;My life has been turned upside down, but I make no apologies, rdquo; he told BBC.				 						
	Inzamam snubbed 						
	 Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq is coming to terms with the fickle nature of fame that goes hand in hand with international cricket in the subcontinent.
				 Inzamam came to Karachi and stayed in the same hotel as the team. However, his former teammates totally ignored him and even current skipper Shoaib Malik did not come over to meet him, sources in the hotel said.

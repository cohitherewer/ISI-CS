 Langur checks in at Eden
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Dunston checked in at the Eden on Saturday. Just as the Indian players were winding up around noon on the final day of the conditioning camp, a langur did a quick round of the area adjoining the nets and then decided to park himself on the top tier of the B block. He stayed put for more than an hour, unconcerned by the attention his arrival evoked. While most of the players had trooped into the dressing room by that time, Gautam Gambhir was the lone batsman slugging it out at the nets. The opener was nonplussed by the langur that hovered nearby. How did you enjoy having a special guest over? As much as you did, cricket manager Lalchand Rajput quipped later. The langur again decided to make an appearance when the Bengal Ranji Trophy team began their practice session and this led to a half-hour stoppage. Deciding not to take a risk, the CAB informed the forest department. Seeming to sense trouble, the langur fled before their arrival. The forest officials will also be present on Sunday  the opening day of the Ranji match.

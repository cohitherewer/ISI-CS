 England clinch historic win
 Alastair Cook in action during his knock of 80 on Wednesday Colombo: Opener Alastair Cook scored 80 to guide England to a five-wicket win and their first one-day series victory in Sri Lanka on Wednesday. A lacklustre display by Sri Lankas top order meant they were restricted to a modest 211 for nine after winning the toss and England surpassed this with 19 balls remaining. It was Englands first series win on the sub-continent since 1987. They have an unassailable 3-1 lead with one match remaining. Visibly confident after two successive wins in Dambulla, England started their run chase positively with Phil Mustard (19) smashing early boundaries before Lasith Malinga grabbed a breakthrough with a cleverly disguised slower ball. Cook and Ian Bell (25) settled down to compile 54 runs for the second wicket, laying the foundations for victory with a workmanlike partnership. Sri Lanka were briefly buoyed by the fall of Bell, who mistimed a lofted drive to mid-off from leg spinner Kaushal Lokuarachchi, before a short rain interruption.  (REUTERS)

 Jyoti ready for USPGA
 Jyoti Randhawa New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa says he is finally ready to enter the USPGA Tour and is confident that his ranking will take him to the worlds toughest pro tour circuit. Randhawa, 35, retained the Indian Open Asian Tour event at the weekend to equal the record of three wins by Australias Peter Thomson, a five-time British Open champion. I guess Im ready for the USPGA, Randhawa said after his win. It is just a matter of time, whenever I do it. Im just going to focus on playing in Europe and my world ranking will get me to the US Tour. Randhawa says he is now confident he can win at any level. Im really putting in the effort this year, and hopefully in one or two years the results should show, he said.Im very pleased with the way Ive played in Europe. Im a much more mature, sensible player now. I can handle the pressure much better. Hopefully, (if) I can carry on like this I wont be very far from doing well. (Reuters)

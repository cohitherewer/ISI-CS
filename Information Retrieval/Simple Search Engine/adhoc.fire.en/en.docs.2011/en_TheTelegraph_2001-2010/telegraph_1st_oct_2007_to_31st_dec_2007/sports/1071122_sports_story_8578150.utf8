A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Wednesdays widespread acts of violence on the streets of Calcutta, following a protest by a minority organisation, shook the City of Joy like never before. As the city struggled to accept the fact that the army had to be summoned to restore normalcy, there were many disturbing thoughts haunting the common man. One of them concerned the second India-Pakistan Test, which the Eden is to host from November 30. Will it be possible to stage the match? Yes, it will be held on schedule, the organisers said in the evening. The situation should be under control by tomorrow (Thursday) Im sure police would provide adequate security for the teams. There shouldnt be any problem holding the Test, said CAB joint secretary Samar Paul. Alarm bells werent ringing in the BCCI either. There are still ten days to go We havent heard anything from the staging association. As of now, theres no chance of the second Test being rescheduled, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said over phone. The apprehension stemmed from the fact that Pakistan were involved in the match. But a CAB official argued that Calcutta was the safest place to hold an India versus Pakistan Test.

 Azhar to attend Eden Test
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: Former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin is all set to attend the Eden Test against Pakistan starting on Friday. The BCCI has said that there is no bar on inviting Azharuddin and so we have invited him and he will arrive here on Thursday, a CAB official said Saturday. Among other former captains, Sunil Gavaskars availability will be known on Monday. The likes of Asif Iqbal, Gundappa Viswanath, Chandu Borde and Dilip Vengsarkar have already confirmed their presence on Friday. Meanwhile, fewer seats may be available at the Eden for security reasons. According to sources, 15 per cent of the tickets, earlier earmarked for the public, will instead be distributed among plainclothes policemen in a move to maintain law and order in the gallery.

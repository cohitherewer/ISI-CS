 Theres a zing to my career now, says Anil Kumble
 - Indias newest Test captain spells out his agenda LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL Anil Kumble Calcutta: I dont carry a hype... Im (just) pretty clinical, is how Anil Jumbo Kumble assessed himself during a one-on-one with The Telegraph. That was at the Pearl Continental in Lahore, some 22 months ago, on the eve of the last Test series versus Pakistan. Now, of course, the hype has begun to build around him  whether Kumble, who values privacy, likes it or not. Early on Friday, a few hours after his appointment as Indias newest Test captain, he spoke exclusively from his residence in Bangalore. The following are excerpts Q Having announced you were ready to captain, were you tense for much of Thursday? A (Laughs) It was Diwali for us and, in the evening especially, I was busy with the kids... It was time for crackers and stuff like that... Of course, I was conscious that the selectors would be taking a decision... The captaincy was definitely there at the back of my mind. Who gave you the good news? I got a call from the selectors... (Venkatapathi) Raju and Dilip (Vengsarkar)... They didnt say much, though. Your first reaction? Felt proud... Im the 30th Test captain and the list has so many distinguished names... It was a proud moment when I got the call and I see the captaincy as the crowning glory... For 17 years, Ive served Indian cricket to the best of my ability and Ive now got the chance to serve in a different capacity. How did the family celebrate? It was so late at night and I kept getting calls... There was no time to actually do something... My wife and I intend taking the kids out today (Friday)... I suppose there will be some kind of celebration. Youre 37, an age by when most cricketers have called it a day. So, are you now going to be that much more motivated? The captaincy has, indeed, come as a shot in the arm... Theres a zing to my career now... As in the past, Ill put my best foot forward and help Indian cricket get the results it deserves... We do need to move forward... But arent you disappointed that the captaincy has come so late? (Laughs again) Well, better late than never... I got many calls even before the selectors had made their decision and everybody said I deserved to be captain. That touched me and I hope to live up to their and my expectations. Our cricket has a rich history, has tradition and Im happy with the new role. Still, are you somewhat apprehensive that the split captaincy (Mahendra Singh Dhoni is captain in ODIs and the Twenty20 format) could lead to confusion/uncertainty in the dressing room? No way... I believe Dhoni and I are going to complement each other... Wouldnt you have been happier had the appointment also been for the four-Test series in Australia? As you know, I take one thing at a time... Never look too far ahead... Im only thinking of the upcoming three Tests. Have you looked up to any one captain? Ive tried to take bits and pieces from the captains Ive played under and against, but Id like to do things my way... Perhaps, do things a bit differently... Sure, Ive admired a few captains, but Id rather not make that public. Whats the type of captain youd like to be? One who ensures that his players are prepared in the best possible manner and one who allows them to play their natural game... I want that 100 per cent from every player, thats it... (After a pause) Besides consistency, Im looking forward to building a team ethic. Today, whats your biggest challenge or priority No. 1? Having been around for 17 years, I know whats required to be done... Weve got to go forward and that can be achieved by being consistent. Personally, Im at my best when Im really intense and would like a high level of intensity from the team as well... The Test series isnt far away and the matches are back-to-back, so theres little time to think too much. Your debut will be at the Kotla... (Interrupting) Oh, the Kotla has always been special... I scored a hundred at the U-19 level, then I made my India comeback (1992-93 tour of South Africa) after doing well in the Irani Trophy there... Ive also got 10 wickets in a Test innings (10 for 74 and match figures of 14 for 149 versus Pakistan, in 1999)... It really is a special ground and Im happy that my debut as Test captain is going to be there. How do you rate Pakistan? Very highly... A quality side and they seem to do particularly well in India. I have respect for the visitors and realise weve got a tough Test series on our hands. Is there a message for the players? Not really... I know some have been playing without a break... The ones whove had a break need to quickly get back into groove. Anything for the fans, who tend to react in extremes? Theyve been quite supportive and affectionate... Id like them to continue showing affection and backing us. Will you at least be there for the last ODI, in Jaipur? Right now, Im not sure... But, yes, Im looking forward to interacting with the selectors, getting to know what they have in mind... Within a day or two, I expect to hear from the Board. The last one: Having scored an unbeaten 110 in your last Test (Brit Oval), are you going to promote yourself? (Laughs once more) No... No... Id rather that the specialist batsmen got hundreds! Moving up in the batting order isnt on my agenda.

 Sasikiran draws with Russian GM
Khanty-Mansiysk (Russia): Krishnan Sasikiran split point in the first game of his second-round match against Russian GM Vadim Zvjaginsev to continue moving ahead in the Chess World Cup here. Sasikiran was playing with black pieces in the first game of the two-game match and equalised easily in the Alapin variation against the Sicilian defence. The position was of a closed nature and the players agreed to a draw on the 21st move in a dynamically balanced middle game. Third seed Teimour Radjabovs loss to Polish GM Bartlomiej Macieja was the big surprise of the day. Top seed Vassily Ivanchuk drew his game against Russian Grandmaster Alexander Galkin. Second seed Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan played brilliantly to beat Croatian GM Zdenko Kozul. Armenian GM Levon Aronian outplayed GM J Gustaffson to win in 37 moves. (PTI)

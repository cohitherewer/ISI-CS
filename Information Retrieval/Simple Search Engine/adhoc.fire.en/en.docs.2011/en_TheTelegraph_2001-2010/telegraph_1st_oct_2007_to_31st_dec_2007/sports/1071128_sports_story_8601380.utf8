 Mouthful for Platini
PATRICK NATHANSON AMP; AGENCIESLondon: The Premier League has dismissed Michel Platinis criticism of English football, telling the Uefa president to mind his own business. Platini has complained that the Premier League is being overrun by foreign players, managers and owners and said that English football, still reeling from the national teams failure to qualify for Euro 2008, is too open at the moment. However, Premier League spokesman Dan Johnson said there was little wrong with the structure at elite level and told Platini to keep out of their affairs. He should really mind his own business. Uefa should look after the Champions League, Uefa Cup and the European Championships, he said. We run the Premier League and we run it successfully, which is beneficial to the English game and that is our business and not Platinis business. Johnson said that the Premier Leagues ability to attract some of the worlds finest talents had actually enhanced the abilities of English-born players. I think the foreign influence on the Premier League has pushed it to the very highest level, he said. The Daily Telegraph

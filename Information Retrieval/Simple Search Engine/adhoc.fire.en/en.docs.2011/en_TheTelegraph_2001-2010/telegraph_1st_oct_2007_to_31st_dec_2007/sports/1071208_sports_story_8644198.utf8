 WI sweep series

Harare: Half-centuries by Runako Morton and Marlon Samuels guided West Indies to a one-day series win over Zimbabwe at Bulawayo on Friday. 
West Indies won the fourth match by five wickets to take an unbeatable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. 
Zimbabwe scored 232 for nine after being put in to bat, and the West Indies replied with 234 for five to win with three overs to spare. 
Morton scored 79 while Samuels made 62, and they shared 105 runs for the third wicket. 
Vusi Sibanda and Hamilton Masakadza put on 167, Zimbabwes biggest opening stand in one-day matches. 
The previous record of 161 was set by the Flower brothers, Grant and Andy, against Bangladesh in 1997. 
West Indies had an opportunity to end the partnership at 15 in the seventh over when Sibanda, on eight, was dropped by Dwayne Bravo at first slip off fast bowler Daren Powell. 
Instead, Sibanda and Masakadza kept the runs flowing until the 37th over, when leg-spinner Rawl Lewis had Masakadza stumped by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin for 80. 
Bravo eventually made amends in the 43rd over, when his throw from cover to the non-strikers end ran out Sibanda for 96.

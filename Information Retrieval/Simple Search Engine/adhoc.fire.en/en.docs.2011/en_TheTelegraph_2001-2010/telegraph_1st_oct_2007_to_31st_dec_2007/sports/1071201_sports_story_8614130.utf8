 ECB asks Azhar to advise English team
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: The ECB has requested Mohammed Azharuddin to advise an English team during its tour of India next week. The English team is scheduled to play a couple of matches in Chennai with local teams. They have asked me to go to Chennai to give some tips to the English players I will be with the team for two days (December 7 and 8), said Azhar, who was in the city as a special invitee of the CAB. Asked whether this could be the first step towards a full-fledged coaching career, Azhar quipped: Those with coaching degrees are in demand these days, I dont have. But if I am asked to help out by any individual or any Board, I will definitely take up the assignment and try my best, Azhar said. He was disappointed with Pakistans pathetic performance at the Eden on Friday. I feel this is the weakest Pakistan team ever to tour India. They shouldnt have kept out experienced campaigners like Shahid Afridi, Imran Nazir, Azhar said. Azhar felt that Shoaib Akhtar shouldnt have been in the XI. He did, however, back Shoaib Malik. He looked quite good at the Kotla If hes given some time, he could be develop into a good captain, said Azhar.

 Joe Cole hits winner

(Reuters) London: Chelsea beat West Ham 1-0 on Saturday to overhaul Manchester United and go second in the Premier League behind unbeaten leaders Arsenal. England midfielder Joe Cole sank his former club, rounding Robert Green in the 76th minute to chip right-footed into the top of the net. Chelsea, now unbeaten in 70 home league games at Stamford Bridge in a run stretching back to February 2004, have 31 points from 15 matches. Sven-Goran Erikssons Manchester City failed to make the most of their city rivals absence, needing a win to go back ahead of Chelsea but instead being held 1-1 at struggling Wigan Athletic. City remain fourth, level with United on 30 points but behind on goal difference. Fifth placed Liverpool are at home to Bolton Wanderers on Sunday. Steve Bruces return to the JJB Stadium as Wigan manager started in the worst possible fashion, with Brazilian Geovanni putting City ahead in the first minute before Paul Scharner equalised with a diving header in the 25th. Paul Jewell, who kept Wigan up at the end of last season, started his reign at bottom placed Derby County with an agonising 0-1 defeat at Sunderland. Anthony Stokes scored the 90th minute winner with an overhead kick from the right side of the box that lifted Sunderland out of the bottom three and up to 14th place. Middlesbrough replaced them in the relegation zone after a 1-1 draw at Reading. Everton, who thrashed Sunderland 7-1 last week, were unable to repeat their heroics and drew 0-0 at Portsmouth, while Blackburn Rovers hammered suffering Newcastle United 3-1 at Ewood Park. Chelsea kicked off the days programme with the London Derby at Stamford Bridge but there was little entertainment in the first half of the London derby. The result was a match of few chances, but plenty of tough tackles and a flurry of yellow cards for tough challenges. Chelsea ended the match with five cautions, to West Hams three. It was just a case of being patient and giving a little bit more, striker Didier Drogba said. It was a physical game.  (AGENCIES)

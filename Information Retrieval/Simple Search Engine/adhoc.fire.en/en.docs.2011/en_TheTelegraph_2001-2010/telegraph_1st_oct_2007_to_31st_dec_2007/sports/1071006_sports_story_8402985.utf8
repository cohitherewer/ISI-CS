 Kartik recalled
OUR CORRESPONDENT  Murali Kartik Hyderabad: Murali Kartik will replace Ramesh Powar in the 15-man squad for the fourth and fifth ODIs in Chandigarh and Vadodara. The national selectors, who met during the lunch break on Friday, decided not to rest the seniors as per the rotation policy. The Indians are down 0-2 in the series. Kartik played for Middlesex during the 2007 season and took 51 wickets in 12 championship matches, including nine for 73 in an innings victory against Glamorgan at Lords. He played his last ODI against Pakistan in Peshawar on February 6, 2006. A left-arm spinner is always helpful in Indian conditions, said Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Since Kartik is also experienced, I am sure he will be of immense help to the side.Theres good logic behind his inclusion. The selectors also retained the side that won the ICC World Twenty20 for the Twenty20 match against Australia in Mumbai. Piyush Chawla, who is recovering from an injury, was not considered. SQUAD Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Yuvraj Singh, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Robin Uthappa, Rohit Sharma, Dinesh Karthik, Harbhajan Singh, Murali Kartik, Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan, Rudra Pratap Singh and Sreesanth.

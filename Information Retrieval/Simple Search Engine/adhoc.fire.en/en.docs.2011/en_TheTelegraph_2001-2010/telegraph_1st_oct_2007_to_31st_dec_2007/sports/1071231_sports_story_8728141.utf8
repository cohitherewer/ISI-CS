 I back myself... Ive learnt it from McGrath: Mitchell Johnson

 - Early days in my career, says Australian speedster 
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
		Mitchell Johnson
Melbourne: Left-arm quick Mitchell Johnson, clearly, is set for real big times. The 26-year-old, whose motto is be yourself, believe yourself, spoke to the media in general on Sunday and also had a brief one-on-one with The Telegraph. 
The following are excerpts 
On getting to play Test cricket too, instead of just ODIs 
Im enjoying it... It was great to share the new ball with Brett Lee in a Boxing Day Test... It was a proud moment... I havent been thinking of too many things, just backing my ability. 
On his bowling (none for 25 and three for 21) in the Boxing Day Test 
Probably one of my best efforts... I was happy with the rhythm and landed in the right areas... Having Brett and Stuart Clark around made it easier... Its a matter of pride that I got the Tests last wicket (Rudra Pratap Singhs)... Hopefully, the Indians are talking about me now. 
On having gone wicketless in the first innings, despite bowling so well 
It was one of those things... There was more reverse swing in the second innings... 
On the MCG wicket having had the subcontinental look and behaviour 
It wasnt much of an issue with me... It was nice when the ball began to reverse. 
On Rahul Dravid, who usually bats at No.3, having opened 
We had to be patient with him because hes himself so patient... We stuck to our plans and made it difficult to score. 
On Indias defensive approach 
It all came down to the way we bowled... We tied them down... Also, it was hard to score on that wicket. 
On whether he expects the Indians to come back hard 
Yes... Sachin Tendulkar and Dravid are such great batsmen... 
On whether the reputation of batsmen comes into play 
A bit, yes, but I back myself... Thats what I learnt from Glenn McGrath during the DLF Cup in Kuala Lumpur last year. 
On tips from McGrath 
Basically that Ive got to keep backing myself and to believe that Im in the team because I deserve to be there. That I could be in the same dressing room as Glenn for a period of time taught me a lot... Taught me, for example, how the top bowlers prepare. That came as a bonus. 
On his idol 
Dennis Lillee. 
On the work put in by Australias bowling coach, Troy Cooley 
Hes of help... In fact, we had a chat after the first innings, when I didnt swing the ball much... He suggested a change in the wrist and seam position and, in the second innings, I did try and get my wrist up straight. 
On whether the likes of Lee and he are intent on creating a dynasty on the lines of what McGrath and the other great quicks have done 
We just want to be ourselves... That (dynasty bit) would be nice, though... 
On not having played in the ODIs versus New Zealand, which preceded the Test series 
It was a bit of a concern, yes, but (Shaun) Tait deserved a place because hed been bowling very well... I tried to focus on the right things and worked hard at nets. 
On whether hes secure about his place in the Test XI 
Not at all... My approach is to go out there and be the best I can be... These are early days in my career, lets see how the journey goes. 
On the wicket at the SCG, which hosts the second Test 
Hopefully, it will have more bounce and carry. 
On whether he has reservations about touring Pakistan 
Weve got to trust Cricket Australia... The tour is still some way off and a security team will be visiting Pakistan... 
On the buzz that he wanted to move from Brisbane (Queensland) to Perth (Western Australia) 
Id been thinking about it, for personal reasons... 
[While Perth is where idol Lillee is based, the top personal reason is that Mitchells girlfriend, Jessica, is from there.] 
Finally, on being regarded as Australian crickets newest pin-up boy 
(Laughs) Is it? I thought that label was all Bretts!

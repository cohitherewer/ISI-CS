 Fish tames Tursunov
Paris: Mardy Fish of the US used 19 aces to beat Dmitry Tursunov 7-6 (7), 6-4 on Monday and advance to the second round of the Paris Masters. Fish saved three break points in the first set, and then saved a set point at 6-5 in the tie-breaker with an ace. In the second set, Fish managed the only break of the match to take control. The American will next play fifth-seeded David Ferrer of Spain. Andreas Seppi of Italy rallied to beat Sam Querry of the US 5-7, 6-1, 6-3, and Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina defeated Feliciano Lopez of Spain 6-4, 6-3. Querry broke Seppi in the first game of the deciding set, but Seppi broke back in the sixth and again to make it 5-3. The Italian will next face Guillermo Canas of Argentina. Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland beat Nicolas Kiefer 7-5, 6-3; Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia downed Vincent Spadea 7-6 (9), 7-6 (2); and Mikhail Youzhny topped Arnaud Clement 6-4, 6-3. Roger Federer has a first-round bye at the indoor event and opens against either Fernando Verdasco or Ivo Karlovic, who play on Tuesday. Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Nikolay Davydenko, Andy Roddick and Ferrer have qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai. Two more spots are still available. Seventh-place Fernando Gonzalez (380 points) has a 51-point lead on eighth-place Tommy Haas. Following close behind are Tommy Robredo (328), James Blake (327), Andy Murray (326), Tomas Berdych (322) and Richard Gasquet (321). Meanwhile, the threat of possible match-fixing is being taken very seriously at the Paris Masters, French Tennis Federation president Christian Bimes said on Monday. We consider this a serious problem, Bimes said. It is a dreadful disease which is a threat for tennis worldwide, Bimes added. We have to act straightaway and be as severe with this as we are with doping. Betting on matches at the Paris event was being watched for anything suspicious, said FFT general director Jean-Francois Vilotte. Matches were also being recorded and analysed by former players and ATP supervisors while players were banned from betting at the venue, he added. Tennis came under the spotlight in August when a match between Russias Nikolay Davydenko and lowly ranked Argentine Martin Vassallo Arguello in Poland was voided by British online betting exchange Betfair because of unusual betting patterns.

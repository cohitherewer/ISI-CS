Bangalore shot ahead in the 23rd minute. A raid from the middle saw Cheyanna send in a short cross from the top of the circle to Arjun Halappa on the left. Arjun took a fierce shot and just in front of the rival goalkeeper, Bangalores Korean import You Hyo-Sik deflected the ball into the goal. (PTI)

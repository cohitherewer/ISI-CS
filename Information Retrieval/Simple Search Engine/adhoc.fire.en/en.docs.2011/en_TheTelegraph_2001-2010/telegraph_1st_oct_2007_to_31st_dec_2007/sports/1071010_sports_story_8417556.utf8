 Lazio coach in a soup
Rome: Lazio coach Delio Rossi has been charged with trying to influence the performance of an opposing team in April 2006, the Italian Soccer Federation (FIGC) said on Tuesday. The federation alleged that Rossi, who took over at the Rome club in 2005, attempted to ask club president Claudio Lotito to contact Lecce officials and discuss their tactics ahead of their match, which Lazio won 1-0. FIGC gave few details in a statement but did say that Rossis attempts had been unsuccessful. The coach Delio Rossi, has been charged with trying to ask, without success, the Lazio president Lotito to start talks with Lecce directors in a bid to affect the technical performance of the squad ahead of a match on April 30, 2006, a statement on the FIGC said. Lazio, as the responsible club, have also been charged and were not immediately available for comment. A disciplinary commission will now decide if Rossi is guilty and deserves punishment. Media reports said the case had come to light because of phone tap evidence. Lazio finished sixth in the 2005-06 season and a Uefa Cup spot while Lecce were relegated. However, Lazio were later deducted 30 points and placed in 16th place as punishment for their part in a match-fixing probe. (AP)

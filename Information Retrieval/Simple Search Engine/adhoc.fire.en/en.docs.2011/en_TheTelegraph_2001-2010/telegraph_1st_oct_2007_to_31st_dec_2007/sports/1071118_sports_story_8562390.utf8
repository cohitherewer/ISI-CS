 CRICKET BRIEFS
						Atapattu to lead Delhi Jets									 New Delhi: With speculation rife that he would retire after the Test series against Australia, veteran Sri Lankan batsman Maravan Atapattu was named captain of Indian Cricket League rsquo;s (ICL) Delhi Jets team for the Twenty20 championship starting November 30 in Panchkula. Delhi Jets coach Madan Lal said Atapattu would lead the side after Sri Lanka rsquo;s two-Test series against Australia ends next week.
				 ldquo;Atapattu will lead the side. After finishing his commitments Down Under with the Sri Lankan team, he will take charge of the Delhi Jets, rdquo; Lal said.
				 Atapattu may also settle down to play club cricket in Sydney, according to reports published in Hobert. Atapattu is embroiled in a stand-off with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials following his criticism of national selectors during the first Test against Australia in Brisbane.
				 Meanwhile, New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns believes the ICL is a golden opportunity for youngsters to play alongside great players and should not be seen as a rebel body.				 Ashraf to meet BCCI officials				 Jaipur: PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf reached Jaipur on Saturday on the eve of fifth ODI between India and Pakistan, adds Our Special Correspondent.
			 He is likely to meet Indian cricket officials to discuss the future of Asia Cup and the Pakistan version of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has asked for a postponement of Asia Cup slated for April next year. The BCCI is planning to hold the inaugural edition of the IPL around that time. Pakistan, it was learnt, also wants to organise a tournament on the lines of the IPL in September/October next year.				 Daljit on Eden				 Calcutta: Chairman of the BCCI Pitch Committee Daljit Singh on Saturday said they were giving their best to make a result-oriented pitch at the Eden for the second Test against Pakistan (November 30-December 4), says a Staff Reporter. Happy after his first round of inspection, Singh said: ldquo;Despite the rainfall and delay in preparation the progress made is commedable. rdquo; Hinting a slow and spin-friendly wicket, he added: ldquo;We can rsquo;t do much about the wet soil underneath. So you can rsquo;t expect much bounce. rdquo;

 Board defends late-night party
INDRANIL MAJUMDARGwalior: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is only a step away from his first ODI series victory, but the preparations leading to the fourth one-dayer has hardly been inspiring. The cricketers, however, are not at fault. The Board will have to shoulder the bulk of the blame for agreeing to a sponsors party in Lucknow on Monday evening. The party continued till late into the night, attended among others by Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor, and delayed the teams arrival here. No one is willing to go on record but not many have taken this well. Are we playing against Zimbabwe? What happens if we lose focus? Why did it have to happen in the middle of a series? asked an Indian cricketer. The players have often complained about too much cricket. Rest is a rare phenomenon, given the amount of travelling that is involved, especially in one-day cricket. The current series against Pakistan is no different as players of both teams have been moving from one corner of the country to another. Board secretary Niranjan Shah, however, didnt find anything wrong. This was agreed to by the Board in advance. It was a party organised by the sponsors and we have a commitment to keep. I dont see anything wrong, Shah told The Telegraph. Wouldnt it have been better had the players utilised the time on the field? I dont think this will lead to any loss in concentration Its not that the players are out of practice. They have been playing matches. There are three days between the Kanpur and Gwalior ODIs. Players have a day in hand for their preparations before Thursday, Shah added. Things were slightly different before the third ODI. The team stayed back in Chandigarh because of security reasons and arrived in Kanpur only in the evening on the eve of the match. Aware of their responsibilities, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Shoaib Malik did not take a chance. On their arrival from Lucknow by a chartered flight on Tuesday evening, both rushed to the ground straight from the airport to have a look at the pitch. They were accompanied by cricket manager Lalchand Rajput and coach Geoff Lawson. It is likely that Virender Sehwag will replace Murali Kartik in the playing XI, given the hard nature of the pitch. There is not much grass though. It is expected to have bounce and carry. If the visitors manage to level the series here, questions will surely be raised about the logic behind such off-field activities. The Board will then have much answering to do.

 Mary Ann loses again
Antalya (Turkey): Asian junior girls champion Mary Ann Gomes lost her second game on the trot, bowing to Yildiz Cemre Betul of Turkey in the eighth round of the under-18 section of World Youth Girls Chess championships here. Mary Ann had raced to 6 points from her first six games and had a full point lead, but the double blow has hit her badly. Playing the black side of a French defence, Mary showed good opening preparation but she lost control when Yildiz came up with a relatively new idea in the middle game. An error-filled plan saw Mary losing an exchange in quick time and the Turkish girl later sacrificed her extra material to create threats against Marys king. Ivana Furtado raised visions of an Indian gold in the under-8 section after she outplayed Buse Vatansever of Turkey from the white side of a catalan opening. Ivanas strength lies in holding her position together with healthy moves and it again came handy as Buse was at sea in the middle game. Ivana won a pawn and never looked back. Ivana is now half a point adrift of championship leader Nguyen Thanh Thuy Tien of Vietnam who dented the hopes of another Indian medal aspirant Ch Meghana. Among other Indians in fray, Shalmali Gagare reached six points at the expense of I. Purgar of Croatia in the under-14 section while national junior girls champion Bhakti Kulkarni went down to Olga Ivanenko of Ukraine. In boys event, Indias Vidit Gujrathi stole eighth round honours with a hard-fought victory over Russian star Sanan Sjugiro. (PTI)

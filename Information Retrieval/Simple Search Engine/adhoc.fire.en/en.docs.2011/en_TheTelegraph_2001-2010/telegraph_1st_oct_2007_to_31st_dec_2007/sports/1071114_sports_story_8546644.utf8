According to the format, each team will have five foreigners in their ranks. The players from six teams  Chandigarh Lions, Mumbai Champs, Calcutta Tigers, Delhi Jets, Chennai Superstars and Hyderabad Heroes  are going to have conditioning camps in their respective zones from Friday till November 22. From November 23 to 27 we will have some practice matches in Mumbai and from there the players will head for Panchkula, Chandigarh, for the November 30-December 16 tournament, the source said. As things stand now, Delhi Jets will be coached by former India allrounder Madanlal with former BCCI selector and Indian middle-order batsman Ashok Malhotra likely to be his deputy. Former India coach and swashbuckling batsman Sandeep Patil is set to take charge of Mumbai Champs while former Test opener and one-time national selector Pranab Roy may assist Cullinan in the Calcutta Tigers side. Among the five foreign players in each team, one will lead the side, except for Delhi Jets, which may be captained by Dinesh Mongia. The league, seen as a rebel establishment to the Indian cricket board, has also roped in retired international stars like former West Indies skipper Brian Lara, ex-Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq and former New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns, apart from several youngsters from the Indian domestic circuit. The camp for the Calcutta Tigers will be held at the CC amp;FC, unless the Cricket Association of Bengal queers their pitch at the eleventh hour. The CC amp;FC and CAB are believed to have reached a consensus in which the former will host only ICL-organised camp and not any matches. CAB president Prasun Mukherjee said he had already spoken to CC amp;FC management and got the assurance that no match would be held there.

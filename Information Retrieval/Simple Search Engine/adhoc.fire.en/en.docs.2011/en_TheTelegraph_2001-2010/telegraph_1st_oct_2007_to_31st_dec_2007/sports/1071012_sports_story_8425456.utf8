 Richardson wants to keep Sydney bronze
New York: One of Marion Joness relay teammates wants to keep the bronze medal she earned with the disgraced sprinter at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. I competed fairly, so I should not have to suffer the consequences for someone elses bad decisions and choices, Passion Richardson said on a TV show. Jones returned her five Sydney medals on Monday after admitting she took steroids. Now the IOC must consider whether her relay teammates should lose their medals, too. The IOC executive board next meets in December. Im not happy with the fact that my character will now come into question as to whether or not I was using steroids because I wasnt, Richardson said. Jones won gold medals in the 100m, 200m and the 4 x 400 relay in Sydney, as well as bronze medals in the 4 x 100 relay and long jump. Richardson, Chryste Gaines, Torri Edwards and Nanceen Perry competed with Jones on the 400-meter relay team. Both Edwards and Gaines have served doping bans since the 2000 Olympics. IAAF rules state that all relay team members should be disqualified. However, its not clear whether that rule was in force during the Sydney Games. US Olympic chairman Peter Ueberroth said Monday the relays were tainted because of Joness presence and all the medals should be returned.  (AP)

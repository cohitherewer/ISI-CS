 Day III highlights

Phil Jaques got to 500 runs in Test cricket in only his 5th Test match. He has joined an illustrious list of 6 other Australians (that includes Don Bradman, Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey) who have also achieved 500 plus Test runs in less than 5 matches. H.L. Collins, however, took just 4 Tests to reach 515 runs and is the quickest Australian to reach 500 Test runs. 
Phil Jaques (when on 24) went past 11,000 first-class runs. He also became the 13th Australian to register a half-century in each innings against India. 
Mathew Hayden (when on 44) completed 8000 runs in Test cricket. He became the fifth Australian and 18th overall to achieve this milestone. 
Harbhajan, when he dismissed Ricky Ponting, completed 250 Test dismissals. He is the 29th bowler over all and 4th Indian to take 250 wickets in Tests. He is only the third Indian spinner to take 250-plus wickets in Tests after Anil Kumble (591) and Bishan Singh Bedi (266). 
Harbhajan has now dismissed Ponting 6 times in Test cricket. The bowlers who have dismissed Ponting most times are: D. Gough  8 times; A. Kumble  7; C. Vaas 6; Harbhajan  6. 
Apart from Ponting, Harbhajan has also dismissed Gilchrist, Gillespie and Hayden six times. 
The last time Ponting was dismissed for less than 10 runs in both innings of the match was also against India in Calcutta in 2001. Then he was dismissed for 6 amp; 0 
Jacques scored his 6th 50-plus score in a row. He needs one more fifty in the next match to equal the world record, which is 7 in a row, by E. Weekes, A. Flower and S Chanderpaul. 
Kumble, when he dismissed Jacques caught and bowled, equalled Muttiah Muralidharans record for the most C amp;B dismissals in Test cricket. Both have 31 such dismissals. 
Kumble now has 49 wickets in the year 2007 in 10 Test matches. He now equals Muralidharan who also has 49 wickets this year in 8 Tests. For the record, Kumbles best year was 2004 when he claimed 74 wickets 24.84 in 12 Tests.

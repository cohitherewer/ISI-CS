 Let local coaches work with Ric
Stickwork Gurbux Singh The Professional Hockey League is once again on the horizon with new format and promise. Although the foreign players are yet to be identified, we have selected 20 youngsters in the pool, hoping to see the next generation of Indian hockey take shape ahead of next years challenges. Indias hockey season has already set in, with Punjab and northern India hosting a number of local tournaments. Some of the youngsters have potential to make the national cut. But I believe the upcoming PHL  to be held in Chandigarh from December 20-January 11  will throw up a few new names who may then be groomed as the future of India. Its not that the players currently doing national duty have past their prime, but we need to keep the evolution process going so that any void at the national level can easily be filled up. Unfortunately, Bengal will once again miss the PHL bus, thanks to the lack of astroturf in the state. Although the IHF and Laser Sports, a sports management company, are exploring the idea of setting up an astroturf, it only reflects the plight in which Bengal hockey exists now. Going back to the national scenario, Ric Charlesworth is to take charge of Indian hockey as a technical advisor from next month. The Australians rich experience and expertise will surely benefit our hockey. I fully agree with Kapil Dev who has recently said Indian cricket doesnt need a coach but a manager. Similarly, Charlesworths role here can be treated and accepted from a managers perspective. Management and communication skills are essential much as good techniques in surviving the pressure of modern game. If the seven coaches  who will take the hot seats of seven PHL teams are all Indians  learn some tricks of the business and especially how to manage it then it will help Indian hockey in the long run. Technically our coaches are quite good, but most of them lack proper management skills. Their association with Charlesworth may open a new window for them to understand the game from a different standpoint. All this is necessary because we are going through a very critical period. We have been successful in international tournaments of late, Asia Cup triumph being a good example of the potential Joaquim Carvalhos side promises to have. The big task now is the Olympic qualifiers in Chile in January.

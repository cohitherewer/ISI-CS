 Chandhok earns F1 break
A STAFF REPORTER Karun Chandhok Calcutta: After Narain Karthikeyan, Karun Chandhok became the second Indian to earn a Formula One call-up. The Chennai lad took a giant leap forward towards achieving his F1 dream after landing a test driving opportunity with Red Bull Racing. Chandhok will test for the UK-based Formula One outfit at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona on November 13 and 14, according to information received here on Tuesday. Chandhok has enjoyed the backing by Red Bull, the energy drink giant, since the beginning of this year and had a successful first season in the GP2 series, including a first win for an Indian at the daunting Spa Circuit in Belgium. It also made him the only Red Bull-backed driver to have won a race in this years GP2 series. It really is a dream come true for me. Since I was four, Ive always dreamt of being behind the wheel of a Formula One car This is a day that not just myself, but my family and everyone who has supported me over the years has thought of for a long time. The year has been a very good one for me in GP2 in that I was able to re-establish myself in Europe To be called up by a strong mid-field team for my first F1 test is the icing on the cake, he said. Christian Horner, Red Bull Racing team principal, sounded impressed. Chandhoks progress in GP2 this year has been clearly evident, culminating in a win at Spa, he said. Barcelona presents a good opportunity to put him in one of the cars as our regular test driver Sebastien Buemi will be competing in the Macau F3 race, Horner said. Red Bull have finished fifth in the constructors world championship this year and have two established drivers, Mark Webber and David Coulthard, besides a strong technical line up including ace aerodynamicist Adrian Newey and Geoffrey Willis. With a strong engine partner in Renault, the team has been a regular in the mid-field this year with a season-best third place for Webber at Nurburgring in Germany. The test session will be held over three days in Barcelona and is the first of the winter test sessions held in preparation for the 2008 Formula One season.The other 10 teams are also expected to attend the session which means Chandhok would have august company as he makes his debut in a Formula One car. Prior to the test, the Chennai lad will spend some time at the teams factory in the UK, getting acquainted with the personnel and use the teams simulator which will allow him a chance to understand the controls and electronics on board a F1 car. Ive raced on this circuit this year in GP2 At least that is one less thing to learn. These early tests are mainly about getting things reliable for next year with the new regulations, so rather than ultimate lap times, it will be important for me to be able to assist the team with information for their development of the new car and electronics. There is a lot to take on board but the team has been very helpful and Im quite confident that we can have a productive test together, Karun said.

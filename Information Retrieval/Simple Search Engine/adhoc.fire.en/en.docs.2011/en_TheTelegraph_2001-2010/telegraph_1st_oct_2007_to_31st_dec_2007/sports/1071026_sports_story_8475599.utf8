 Bjorn Borg enjoys the perfect life
MARK HODGKINSON in EINDHOVEN  Bjorn Borg When Bjorn Borg comes back to London, he doesnt just think of the green grass of Wimbledons Centre Court, of those five golden trophies, and of that extraordinary 18-16 tie-break he lost to John McEnroe in the 1980 final. He also remembers the girls, the girls, the girls. Borg was the first rock star of tennis, or lawn tennis as it was quaintly called back then, and so he could probably tell you stories that would make even Jilly Cooper blush. When I first played at Wimbledon, in 1973, it was crazy. I was this young Swedish guy with long hair, and suddenly it went mad and there were girls everywhere. There were girls on the way to the practice court, girls by the match court, and girls waiting in the lobby of my hotel, recalled the old Viking prince of the All England Club, who will be back competing in the land of the groupies in December. The girls had found out where I was staying and so when I went into the lobby there were hundreds of them waiting for me. They were screaming and they wanted my autograph, they wanted to talk to me and they wanted to get close to me. It was like I was a pop star. Tennis had never seen anything like it before. I think it was good for the sport, but it was also good for me. It was strange and it was new, but I really enjoyed the craziness. When I came back the next year I had to get more security. I tried to concentrate on my tennis after that first year. And concentrate he plainly did, for he went on to win five successive Wimbledon titles from 1976 to 1980. I sometimes look back to those days with all the girls, but I have a great family life now and I prefer that, staying at home with the family, he added. This is my third marriage. Patricia and I have been together now for seven years and Im so happy. It feels as though I have found the right woman and Im now living the way I want to live. I have the perfect life now and I wouldnt change a thing. Borgs home is now with Patricia and their son outside Stockholm but this year he has been reacquainting himself with the city where his life was once more Mick Jagger than Cliff Richard. In July, on only his second visit to Wimbledon since losing the 1981 final, he sat in the Royal Box watching Federer emulate his record by also winning his fifth straight title. And in December, he will be across town at the Royal Albert Hall for the finale of the BlackRock Tour of Champions. It will be his first appearance there since 2000. My relationship with the British public goes way into the past, the Swede added. London almost feels like home for me, it is a special place. When I went back to Wimbledon this summer, I had a great reaction. People came up to me and said, We missed you, Bjorn or You belong here, I remember all your matches. People still respect me as a tennis player, maybe still see me as an enigma. I will definitely be back next year. I realise now that I was missing something all those years by not being there. Playing at the Albert Hall will be special too. Whatever the opposite of a mid-life crisis is called, its what Borg, now 51, is going through at the moment. You could say that Borg had his mid-life crisis early  he was just 26 when he decided that he had had enough of tennis and quit the circuit. And his late twenties, thirties and forties were hardly straightforward either with failed relationships, failed businesses and failed comebacks. So perfectly in control on the court, the Ice Man, or Ice Borg, struggled to keep it together. But a quarter of a century on from his early retirement, Borg at last appears to be content. He has a thriving underwear business with one infamous advert imploring the Swedish public, through the pages of their national press, to F*** for the Future. It was difficult after I retired, Borg said. I had been concentrating on tennis all my life, and then suddenly I had to quickly learn about other things in life. That was not always easy as people judged your tennis against everything else in your life. They would say, Look, hes not as successful now as he was as a tennis player. That was hard. Borgs marriage to his childhood sweetheart, tennis player Mariana Simionescu, ended in divorce. Borg fathered a child with Jannike Bjorling, a teenager he met while judging a wet T-shirt competition (she was a contestant). That also did not last and Borg was married for a second time, to Loredana Berte, an Italian glamour model and rock star who used to appear semi-naked and doused in glitter on the cover of her albums. Her signature song was Non sono una signora (I am not a lady). In 1989, Borg was taken to a Milan hospital where he had to have his stomach pumped. But Borg has always maintained it was not a suicide attempt. The tale of Borg allegedly trying to kill himself clearly still irks him, so much so that he brought the subject up himself. There is this ridiculous story that I wanted to kill myself, he said. That was disappointing and upsetting. OK, my business wasnt going so well, but that is no reason to kill yourself. I had my whole life ahead of me, so why would I want to kill myself? I realise now that the most important thing isnt what other people are saying. What matters is that you wake up in the morning and know what you want to achieve in life. And that is easier for me now because I wake up with such a great family around me.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

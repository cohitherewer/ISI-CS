 ACA steps for trouble-free tie
OUR CORRESPONDENTGuwahati: While the Maliks and Dhonis will be fighting for a head start to the five-match one-day series starting at the Nehru Stadium here on Monday, Guwahati is engaged in a different kind of battle  overcoming the demons within to play the perfect host. Having seen its sporting reputation shattered in one hour of madness when the India-England tie was abandoned on April 9, 2006, the hosts Assam Cricket Association, the district administration and the police have been working earnestly to ensure everything goes off smoothly. ACAs concern is understandable since another crowd trouble could see the city being dropped as an international venue. Even the Match Referee, Roshan Mahanama, sources claimed, told the hosts that all possible steps have to be taken ensure a good game, the stress on preventing racist conduct and effective security. Having been the Match Referee during the abandoned tie, he is not taking any chances. More so after the ICC reminded its member-countries to follow a zero-tolerance policy towards racism. Though Mahanama said he was hoping for a good game and was happy to be back again in the city, according to sources, he would like to have posters within the stadium urging fans not to indulge in any kind of racism and an effective public address system to keep them posted. As of now though, Mahanama, match observer Vikram Patel, umpires Amish Saheba and Ian Gould are happy with they have seen so far, indicated sources. Mahanama will be meeting the umpires, the announcers and police officers for another update. The match has generated unprecedented hype. Tickets are sold out in the 22,000-capacity stadium. Sniffer dogs have also been pressed into service on Saturday morning. We cannot take any chance Given the threat from jehadi and subversive elements, a police officer said.Prabir Mukherjee, ex-pitch consultant from East Zone, said the pitch appeared sporting. The outfield is good despite the ACA starting work only in August, he said, adding that the pre-scheduled 8.30am start was a must for a 100-over match as light becomes poor after 4pm.

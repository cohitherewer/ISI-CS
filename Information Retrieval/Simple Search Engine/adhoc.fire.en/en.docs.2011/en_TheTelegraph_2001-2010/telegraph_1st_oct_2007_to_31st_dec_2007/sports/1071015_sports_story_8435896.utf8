A STAFF REPORTER Paul Collingwood with the one-day series trophy in Colombo on Sunday. (AFP) Calcutta: Ottis Gibson is Englands new fast bowling coach. The appointment of the 38-year-old West Indian follows Englands 3-2 win over Sri Lanka in the recently-concluded five-match ODI series. Gibson was Durhams leading wicket-taker this season with 80 wickets and is the current PCA player of the year. Gibson, who has been involved in the ECB fast bowling programme at the National Cricket Performance Centre for the four past years, has most recently been working with the England squad during the five-match ODI series in Sri Lanka. In an ECB statement on Sunday, Gibson said: I am delighted to be a part of the England team in a full time capacity as bowling coach. Ive thoroughly enjoyed working with the team over the past few weeks in what has been a successful ODI tour of Sri Lanka. Ive been involved with the ECB fast bowling programme for a number of years now and as a level four qualified coach whos worked with both the senior England bowlers and several younger England bowlers, I feel Im well equipped to take up the position as fast bowling coach. With the future looking so bright for Englands bowling stocks, Im extremely excited by the prospect of working alongside Kevin Shine with such a talented group of bowlers in both the Test and one-day arenas. Managing Director of England cricket, Hugh Morris, said: The appointment of Ottis (Gibson) as England bowling coach is the culmination of several years hard work with Englands elite bowlers across a number of levels.

 Guidelines remain unchanged

Calcutta/Mumbai: While chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar came out happy after his meeting with Board chief Sharad Pawar and president-elect Shashank Manohar, he had no immediate reason to smile at the end of Sundays working committee meeting in Mumbai. 
If the Boards treasurer and spokesman N. Srinivasan is to be believed, no decision was taken on compensating anyone As of now the guidelines stand. 
While the seven-guidelines for the selectors will continue unchanged, the working committee has left it to the office-bearers to make any changes if needed. 
The office bearers had laid down the guidelines. The Board felt that if there are any issues the office-bearers should deal with them, Srinivasan told a press conference. 
According to the Boards guidelines, the selectors shall not write any column for any newspaper nor shall they appear in the electronic media as an expert. 
They should watch more domestic matches, particularly the Ranji (both Super League and Plate Division), and that they should decide the matches to be seen at the beginning of the season in consultation with the Board secretary. The selectors shall not sit in the dressing room when a Test or ODI is in progress. 
The Boards diktat also bars the selectors from witnessing overseas matches when the Indian side is on tour. The Boards constitution clearly defines that the selection committee  when the squad is playing abroad  will comprise the captain, vice-captain and coach, and that the selection meetings will be convened by the manager of the team. 
The guidelines, particularly the one which has prevented the selectors from writing columns or interacting with the media, irked Vengsarkar. 
The former India captain even threatened to quit the post before relenting when Pawar said the Board would look into the issue. The duo had a meeting here on Saturday which went off very well, according to Vengsarkar. 
On Sunday, besides the issue of selectors being paid, Vengsarkar may have raised the point of two being on the tour of Team India at any given point in time.

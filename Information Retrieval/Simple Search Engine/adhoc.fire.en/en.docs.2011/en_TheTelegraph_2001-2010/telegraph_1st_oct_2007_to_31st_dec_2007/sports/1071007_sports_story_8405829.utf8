 Vengsarkar talks tough
New Delhi: Dilip Vengsarkar on Saturday issued a stern warning to seniors, saying that performance alone will grant them a place in the side. In a strong message to non-performers, the chief selector said many young players are waiting in the wings and nobody could take their place for granted. The threshold has definitely reduced. There are many players such as S. Badrinath and Suresh Raina who are performing with the India A side. These guys are waiting for their chance and you cannot ignore them, Vengsarkar said. Its a professional set-up and nobody can take anything for granted, he was quoted as saying by a Mumbai daily on Saturday. Although Vengsarkar didnt take names, he was apparently referring to the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid  who have not yet made significant contributions with the bat in the ongoing one-day series against Australia. While Tendulkar has scores of 0, 16 and 43, former captain Dravid has managed only 31 and 0. Vengsarkar also came down heavily on Mumbai off-spinner Ramesh Powar. If you are picked as a frontline bowler, then you have to bowl 10 overs, Vengsarkar said. Plus, if your fielding is found wanting and you do not contribute with the bat, the team is obviously at a disadvantage. Ramesh has to get fitter and field better. He also has to improve his bowling, the former captain said. We are not a great fielding side anyway. In the Hyderabad ODI, Australia saved about 25 runs on the field. If we had fielded that way, the game would have been much closer, the chief selector added. On preferring left-arm spinner Murali Kartik ahead of Pragyan Ojha, he said: Ojha is very young Just 21. It is not fair to unleash him against a side like Australia. We need to groom the youngsters. Kartik is experienced enough and offers us better variation. (PTI)

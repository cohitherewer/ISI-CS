 Gambhir slams century as Delhi hold Mumbai
		Gautam GambhirMumbai: Opener Gautam Gambhir enhanced his chances of a recall to the Indian Test squad with an unbeaten hundred as Delhi drew their four-day Ranji Trophy Super League tie against Mumbai here Monday. The left-handed Gambhir, in fine form this season in Twenty20 Internationals, slammed 137 not out in Delhis score of 252 for three in 96 overs while chasing a target of 387 set by the home team. Gambhir and his opening partner Aakash Chopra, who made 81, pursued victory when they resumed at the overnight score of 59 for no loss. They compiled 188 at just under three an over to set the chase up but a triple strike by Mumbai in the space of 11 balls put the skids. Mumbai pacer Avishkar Salvi dismissed Chopra and Delhi captain Virender Sehwag (0), both lbws, off successive balls and then Abhishek Nair sent back Virat Kohli (0) in the next over to undermine Delhis aspirations. At close, Gambhir and Mithun Manhas (16) were unbeaten. Delhi picked up three points from the tie by virtue of their first innings lead. SUMMARISED SCORES  In Chennai: Tamil Nadu 421 amp; 237/9 dec.

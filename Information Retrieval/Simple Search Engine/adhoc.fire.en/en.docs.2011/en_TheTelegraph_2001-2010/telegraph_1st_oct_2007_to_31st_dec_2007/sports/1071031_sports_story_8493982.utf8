 Sevilla accuse Spurs of deceit 
 Juande Ramos London: Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido has accused Tottenham Hotspur of treachery after coach Juande Ramos quit to move to the Premier League club. Ramos was confirmed as Martin Jols replacement on Saturday after the Dutchman was sacked following a terrible start to the season. Sevilla, who won back-to-back Uefa Cups under Ramos, have accused Tottenham of approaching him without their permission. I can assure you that we at Sevilla will pour all our energy and all our force into making sure that Tottenham pay the consequences of this situation, a situation they have illegitimately provoked, Del Nido told a British newspaper on Tuesday. Here in Spain, we are not used to treachery existing between clubs. Nowhere in European football has something like this happened before with the season under way. I will leave it to Spurs and their fans to take a look at themselves and define their behaviour. Ramoss arrival at Tottenham came after news of an August meeting between him and Tottenhams former vice-chairman Paul Kemsley in a Seville hotel leaked out. At the time Ramos said he had received a dizzying offer from Spurs but there was no possibility he would leave. Ramos, who will take charge of his first game on Wednesday against Blackpool in the League Cup, has been warned off taking any of his former players to Tottenham. Responding to reports that he would try to bring full-back Daniel Alves and striker Freddie Kanoute to London, Del Nido said: I doubt very much whether Tottenham will have the money to buy them. Tottenham will get the responses from Sevilla that they deserve.  (REUTERS)

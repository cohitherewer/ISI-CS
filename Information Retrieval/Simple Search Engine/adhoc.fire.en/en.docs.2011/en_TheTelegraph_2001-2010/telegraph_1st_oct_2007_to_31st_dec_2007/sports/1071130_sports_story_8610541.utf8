 Stage set for gala ICL opening 
GAJINDER SINGH  Brian Lara Panchkula: Cheerleaders, tattoo and mehndi artists, face painters, Karaoke singers, magicians, stick-walkers and drummers will all be there to mark the inauguration of the Indian Cricket League (ICL)-organised Twenty20 tournament, beginning at the picturesque Tau Devi Lal Sports Complex Stadium on Friday. The Essel Group, promoters of the breakaway league, will spend $20-25 million to host the 20-day extravaganza. Announcing this on Thursday, an official said the team winning the event would pocket Rs 3.9 crore. Every team will be awarded cash incentives for winning each match. The runners-up will get Rs 1.9 crore. The team finishing last will get Rs 85 lakh, he said. The inaugural ceremony will be attended by Union railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, industrialists Anil Ambani and Shashi Ruia. The event will also witness special performances by several Bollywood stars, including Kareena Kapoor, Yana Gupta, Aamir Khan and Akshay Kumar. There is abundant talent in the boys and I have no doubt it will be successful. The tournament can throw up another Sachin or Dravid, former South African cricketer Lance Klusener said while practising with his team Calcutta Tigers. Apart from Calcutta Tigers, Mumbai Champs, Hyderabad Heroes, Chandigarh Lions, Delhi Jets and Chennai Superstars are in the fray. We faced a number of glitches after the announcement for the tournament was made. There were comments on the players. But we have proved everybody wrong. Two hundred and fifty players, including top international stars have enrolled with us despite pressure not to do so, an ICL official said without naming any organisation. Tomorrow, the world will witness a new beginning for the world of cricket, he added. International stars like Brian Lara, Inzamam-ul Haq, Klusener, Craig McMillan and Merv Dillon are participating in the tournament. The media was kept away from Lara at the stadium and at the hotel. Strict security marked the West Indians entry and exit from the stadium after the nets. We want to shield him from any controversies, an official remarked.

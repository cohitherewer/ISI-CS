 Biswal to watch Ranadeb

A STAFF REPORTER
Calcutta: The CAB as well as the Bengal selectors have not taken well to Ranadeb Boses missing out on a berth for the third Test against Pakistan. This despite injuries to Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth, Rudra Pratap Singh and Munaf Patel. The issue has sparked criticism from all quarters. The Bengal pacers selection among the 24-member probables for the tour Down Under is being seen as a consolation. 
The CABs pressure tactics has now forced the BCCI to send national selector Ranjib Biswal to witness the Bengal-Orissa Ranji Trophy Super League match at the Kanchenjungha Stadium in Siliguri from Sunday. Biswal will reach Siliguri tomorrow After Ranadeb failed to make the cut, we asked the BCCI to send a selector for the match and they have agreed, CAB joint secretary Samar Paul said on Friday. 
The cricketing fraternity was peeved after the national selectors ignored Ranadeb and included VRV Singh, who failed miserably against Bengal in Siliguri, for the third Test. Ranandeb claimed six wickets in the match. 
Bengal chief selector Arup Bhattacharya and his colleague Barun Burman flayed Biswal. How can VRV be there and not Ranadeb Its shocking to see VRV in the national side at the cost of someone who has achieved success. This only proves that the East Zone selector is not eligible for the post, Bhattacharya said. 
It seems that our East Zone selector has no say at selection meetings and so the players from this region are being ignored, he said. I am sure Ranadeb will not be taken to Australia... Being among the 24-member probables is a consolation. 
For the record, VRV was smacked all over the ground for 97 runs in the last Ranji match and got only one wicket. 
Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who didnt want to be drawn into any controversy, felt that Ranadeb should have been there in the national side for the third Test. I dont know who is there and who is not, but I firmly believe that Ranadeb should have been made his Test debut this time, Shukla felt.

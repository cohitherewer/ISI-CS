 Russian blow to England hopes
 Russian Roman Pavlyuchenkos joy knows no bounds after scoring the winner against England during their Euro 2008 group E qualifier in Moscow on Wednesday.

(AP) Moscow: Substitute Roman Pavlyuchenko scored twice as Russia came from behind to beat England 2-1 in a tense Euro 2008 qualifier on Wednesday after Wayne Rooney had put the visitors in front and then conceded a penalty. Rooneys superb volley gave England a 29th-minute lead, and a scoreline that would have put them into next years finals. But Pavlyuchenko came off the bench to convert a 69th-minute penalty after Rooney tripped Konstantin Zyryanov on the edge of the area. He prodded home another four minutes later after keeper Paul Robinson could only parry Alexei Berezutskys shot. Russias victory puts their qualifying campaign firmly back on track, though England can also still reach the finals, along with favourites Croatia, from group E. England coach Steve McClaren pointed to the spot-kick as the decisive moment of the game, played on an artificial surface at the Luzhniki Stadium, after England had looked in control. We had it, he told a television channel. It was in our grasp and weve ended up losing it. Ive just seen the penalty again and its an absolute disgrace  its outside the box. That just turned the game, he said of the penalty. It was a mad four minutes after that and unfortunately we conceded a second, but I cant fault the players for the game plan, the way they endeavoured to work, the commitment. England made a bright enough start, with Rooney stunning the home crowd with a brilliant goal. Strike partner Michael Owen headed a high ball forward and Rooney chested it down before crashing a superb dipping volley over Russia keeper Vladimir Gabulov. The turning point came when Rooneys rash challenge on the edge of the area was judged to have been just inside and Pavlyuchenko smashed home from the penalty spot. He followed up with a poachers goal minutes later, nipping in between Englands defenders to get the first touch after Robinson failed to hold Berezutskys fierce swerving shot. The result means Russias qualifying hopes are now in their own hands but England are no longer masters of their own destiny. Croatia are top with 26 points from 10 games and two more to play, England are second on 23 points with one match left against Croatia at Wembley and Russia are third with 21 points from 10 matches. Russia, who have Israel and Andorra away, will qualify if they win both matches. Croatia need just a point from their next game against Macedonia or in their final game against England to qualify. England need to beat Croatia and hope Russia drop points against Israel on November 17, given the unlikelihood of Guus Hiddinks side failing to beat Andorra four days later.  (REUTERS)

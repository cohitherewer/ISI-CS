 Jeev tied 7th
Miyazaki: Jeev Milkha Singh turned in an even-par 70 in Round III to join defending champion Padraig Harrington at the tied seventh spot of the $1.7 million Dunlop Phoenix Golf Tournament here on Saturday. Jeevs 70, which included a second successive 18th-hole eagle, took his total to four-under 206 at the par-70 Phoenix Country Club. The Indian had a tumultuous day as he opened with a sixth hole bogey before drawing even with a birdie on the eighth. (PTI)

 Dhoni: It was a 300-plus wicket 
OUR CORRESPONDENTHyderabad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni acknowledged that Fridays loss would make things tough for Team India in the remaining matches of the series. It will be tough for us I always felt this was a 300-plus wicket. The batsmen are to be blamed but the responsibility lies with the entire team, the captain said. Dhoni didnt wish to show the disappointment at the news conference, and tried to remain as relaxed as possible. There were certain improvements from the match in Kochi. But we still need a good start. Keeping wickets in hand will be the key and we have failed on this count. We never got the partnerships going and paid for it. This wicket was different compared to Bangalore and Kochi. It got slower Our bowlers did well despite a few loose deliveries. The part time bowlers were superb. This helped us in the middle overs, he said. Dhoni felt not forging enough partnerships was proving to be a major obstacle. Not getting enough partnerships has been a problem. Its not that we havent done it in the past. But the problem is it leads to immense pressure in the middle order. He defended Gautam Gambhir who has failed to be among the runs in the three matches. Its unfair to blame Gautam He has done well in the recent past and got runs when needed. We shouldnt do injustice to him. Praising Yuvrajs 121, Dhoni said: He is disappointed despite the brilliant innings. The teams performance counts most We needed to chip in today but failed. He also agreed with cricket manager that playing for almost four months at a stretch was proving to be too demanding. Its quite tough Ricky Ponting was not willing to take things for granted. The next four games are equally important We cant afford to sit back and relax Theres always scope for improvement and we will always strive for that. The Australian captain felt chasing was always tough on this wicket. Ponting also felt having the ball changed in the 35th over as per the new rules has its pros and cons for both the fielding and batting sides.

 Argentina pay for Tevez expulsion

(AP) Rio de Janeiro: Argentina lost their unbeaten record in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday as Colombia took advantage of Carlos Tevezs first-half expulsion to win 2-1. Dayro Moreno scored an 83rd-minute winner for Colombia in Bogota after Manchester United forward Tevez was dismissed in the 25th minute for a petulant kick at Ruben Dario Bustos. Elsewhere, Venezuela won 5-3 in a dramatic clash with Bolivia. The Venezuelans clawed their way back thrice to level with the visiting team and then scored twice in the last two minutes following an injury to goalkeeper Carlos Arias. The results opened up the single South American group, a marathon two-year contest in which each team plays 18 games. Argentina stayed top with nine points from four games, while Colombia went second with eight and Venezuela moved on to six. Bolivia, already struggling, have only one point. The top four teams qualify directly for South Africa in 2010 and the fifth plays off against a team from the Concacaf zone. Despite Tevezs dismissal, Argentina went ahead in the 37th minute with an individual effort from Lionel Messi, who slipped past three defenders before flicking the ball past Agustin Julio. Messi came close again in the 51st minute before Colombia hit back when Bustos, for the second game in a row, scored with a brilliant free-kick and Moreno finished off a break. Both scorers were booked for shirtless celebrations. Venezuela and Bolivia shared four goals in the first half in San Cristobal as Marcelo Martins and Juan Carlos Arce twice put Bolivia ahead and Daniel Arismendi replied for the hosts. Martins regained the lead for Bolivia in the 78th minute, putting them on the brink of winning a World Cup qualifier away from home for the first time in 14 years, but Alejandro Guerra pounced on poor defending to equalise in the 83rd minute. Bolivia keeper Arias then appeared to pull a muscle but, with his team having made three substitutions, carried on even though he could barely walk. In the 89th minute, Giancarlo Maldonado latched on to a chipped ball forward and headed the ball over Arias, who was slow off his line. Arias then went off and was replaced in goal by left-back Luis Gutierrez, who was caught off his line as Maldonado scored with a 30-metre chip in injury time. Meanwhile, a disgruntled Mario Regueiro walked out on the Uruguay team on the eve of their qualifier away to Brazil. Regueiro, who plays for Real Murcia in Spain, said he was unhappy at being given few chances in the team and did not travel to Brazil. A lot of people may say its not the right time to do this... But my head and my heart told me the opposite, he told Uruguayan television before the team left for Sao Paulo. I did not feel well. When you know that you are not going to wear the sky blue shirt, which is what I want most, you feel bitter and sad. Regueiro, who has 29 caps, has made only one appearance this year for Uruguay, coming on as a substitute in the 5-0 win over Bolivia last month. Uruguay, who failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, have four points from three games.  (REUTERS)

 Salman Butt cautioned 
Lahore: Pakistan vice-captain Salman Butt has got a dressing down from the team management for criticising the bowlers at a press conference during the second Test against South Africa here last week. Sources in the team revealed that Butt was forced to apologise to the bowlers and other teammates, who rounded on him. Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria as well as the pacers were not happy when they read Butts comments and confronted him, sources said. Butt had tried to play down the issue by blaming the media for blowing up his comments and claiming that he had been misquoted. But when the team management also pulled him up and warned him to be careful with his choice of words, Butt apologised to other players, the source said. The team manager and captain advised him that he would only create problems in the side if he was not careful with his words and attitude, he added. The left-hander was also fined 50 per cent of his fees by match referee Alan Hurst for criticising some umpiring decisions in the Test. Pakistan pace bowler Mohammed Asif has been ruled out of the first ODI against South Africa on Thursday due to an elbow injury. He is required to have more rest to regain full fitness, manager Talat Ali told reporters.  (PTI)

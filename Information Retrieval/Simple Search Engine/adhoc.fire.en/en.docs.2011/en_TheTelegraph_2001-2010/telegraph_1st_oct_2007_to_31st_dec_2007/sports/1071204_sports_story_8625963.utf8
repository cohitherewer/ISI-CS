 Jaffer hits 56 as India take 301-run lead
 - Misbah, Sami help Pakistan avoid follow-on INDRANIL MAJUMDARCalcutta: If you wish to witness some sizzling action and edge-of-the-seat excitement, be at the Eden from Tuesday morning. After an eventful fourth day, India have put themselves in a position from where they could win the Test and the IndianOil Cup. Pakistan will have to display the mental and technical fortitude needed to overcome hungry opponents poised for the kill. India are 301 runs in front, thanks to another fluent innings from Wasim Jaffer (56). The Indians, enjoying a 160-run lead, made their intentions clear by sending Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sourav Ganguly up the order. They are likely to bat for 45 minutes on the final day before declaring. Anil Kumbles experience and Harbhajan Singhs wizardry will hold the key on this low and slow pitch. The footmarks on both ends of the wicket will be a cause of concern for the batsmen. As Mahendra Singh Dhoni said, the game can change very quickly on a fifth day wicket in subcontinent conditions. Chasing a target in excess of 300 is going to be tough. The deciding factor could be the time of declaration. The sooner it comes, the better it will be for the hosts. The morning, however, did not go well for India as Mohammed Sami and Misbah-ul Haq defied the attack for nearly three hours. A 91-run partnership for the seventh wicket ensured that the follow-on was saved. As Sami (38) rode his luck  Dravid dropped a fairly simple chance at slip off Kumble and then he survived a close bat-pad appeal  the stand flourished and the Indians frustration grew by the minute. Kumble turned to V.V.S. Laxman in desperation and it worked. A miscued drive landed in the hands of Jaffer at mid-off. The wicket brought renewed vigour and the spinners took just 12 balls to run through the tail. Indian hopes came alive again as Harbhajan bagged his 20th five-wicket haul (fifth at the Eden). Misbah remained unconquered on 161. What stood out during the 523-minute effort was his unflappable temperament and fighting qualities. Not without reason has he turned out to be Pakistans best batsman on this tour despite the presence of the two Ys  Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan. At 33 and only in his eighth Test, the composure and the assurance he brings to the crease is unmatchable. Be it Twenty20, one-dayers or Tests, he is turning out to be a vital element in the balance of this team. Importantly, he doesnt carry the influence of the shorter versions of the game to the five-day format, a problem that has been partly responsible for Pakistans top-order failure. No one will ever be able to fill the void created by Inzamam-ul Haq, but Misbahs presence has helped in tiding over the crisis to some extent. There is no grace or flamboyance about his batting, only the attitude of the committed. Comfortable playing long innings, he continued his unfinished job on Monday. He concentrated on playing session by session, and avoided loose shot. A six off Harbhajan in the days fifth over came as a surprise, but he soon settled into the groove of pushing and prodding. If Pakistan harbour any hopes of saving this Test, Misbahs abilities will again be put to the severest of tests.

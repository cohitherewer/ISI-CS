 Haile sets mark 
Berlin: Ethiopias Haile Gebrselassie shattered a marathon world record on Sunday in Berlin that had been set four years ago by his great rival Paul Tergat of Kenya. Gebrselassie was clocked in an official time of two hours, four minutes and 26 seconds, eclipsing the previous mark of 2:04.55 his friend Tergat set on the same flat and fast Berlin course in 2003. Gebrselassie, 34, swept through the streets of the German capital in ideal weather, urged on by enthusiastic crowds of more than a million spectators that lined the 42-kilometres course to cheer him and the 40,000 competitors. Its my record now, Gebrselassie told a news conference, adding it was his most important record in his long career. (Reuters)

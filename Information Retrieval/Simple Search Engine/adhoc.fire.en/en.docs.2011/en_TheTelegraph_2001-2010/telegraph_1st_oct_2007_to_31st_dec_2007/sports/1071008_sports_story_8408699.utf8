 Parthiv, Manoj lead fightback
 Parthiv Patel is batting on 161 Rajkot: An unbeaten century by opener Parthiv Patel and his 142-run partnership with Manoj Tiwary helped Rest of India fight back in their Irani Trophy match against Mumbai here on Sunday. After Mumbai were all out for 453, Rest of India had a poor start losing top three wickets cheaply before Patel did the rescue work partnering S. Badrinath (29 runs, 52balls, 4x4, 1x6) and then with Tiwary to take his team to 292 for four at stumps on Day II. Opener Aakash Chopra failed to open his account as he fell to Rajesh Verma. Skipper Mohammed Kaif 18 (30b, 1x4) and Suresh Raina 17 (20b, 3x4) also got out cheaply to Ajit Agarkar and Verma, respectively, as Rest of India were tottering at 64 for three. Patel and Badrinath then added 86 runs for the fourth wicket. Later, Patel got useful support from Tiwary. The wicketkeeper completed his century off 120 balls with the help of 18 fours and was unbeaten on 161 (204b) at close of play. Tiwary consumed 104 balls for his unbeaten 56, which included six fours and two towering sixes. Rest of India still trail by 161 with six wickets in hand. For Mumbai, medium-pacer Verma took two wickets conceding 49 runs, while Agarkar and Iqbal Abdullah got a wicket each. Ramesh Powar failed to impress and gave away 68 runs off his 12 overs without getting a wicket. Earlier, resuming at their overnight score of 385 for eight, Mumbai batsmen Powar and Abdullah continued to frustrate Rest of India bowlers. Powar 45 (50b, 6x4, 1x6) was first man to be dismissed followed by Verma 9. Abdullah remained unbeaten on 56 with seven fours and two sixes. Ishant Sharma and Ranadeb Bose captured three wickets each for Rest of India giving away 63 runs and 106 runs respectively, while Ojha got two for 114 runs.  (PTI)

 The inside story of Aussie cricket
Sydney: Australias cricketers rediscovered sportsmanship after a barrage of callers complaining about their behaviour reduced Cricket Australias (CA) receptionist to tears, a new official history says. Authors Gideon Haigh and David Frith were given complete access to CAs archives for the book Inside Story: Unlocking Australian Crickets Archives and the governing body told them to produce a warts-and-all account of its activities. We ask the cricketers who wear the baggy green to play hard but fair and it was only logical to ask our historians to do the same, chairman Creagh Connor said. The book gives insights into events that have shaped the game here since 1905, using both the archives of CA  formerly the Australian Cricket Board (ACB)  and interviews with players and officials. It recounts the controversial Bodyline Series against England in 1932-33, crickets move to commercialism in the 1970s and confirms that Shane Warnes off-field behaviour was the reason he never captained the Australian Test team. The book also details how in 2003 a humble receptionist shamed Australias all-conquering cricketers into becoming better sports. Undisputed masters of the cricketing world, the Australian Test team in the early years of the millennium alienated even some of its own fans through a mixture of excessive sledging and boorish behaviour. While successful Australian teams of the past had been lauded as the invincibles and unbeatables, this one was dubbed the unloveables because of its snarling attitude and strutting manner. The 2003 World Cup win was overshadowed by Warnes drugs ban, Darren Lehmann was suspended for five games for yelling a racist term after being run out against Sri Lanka and other players were reprimanded for abuse and dissent. The flashpoint came in the West Indies in May 2003, when paceman Glenn McGrath baited Ramnaresh Sarwan with a lewd taunt. (AFP)

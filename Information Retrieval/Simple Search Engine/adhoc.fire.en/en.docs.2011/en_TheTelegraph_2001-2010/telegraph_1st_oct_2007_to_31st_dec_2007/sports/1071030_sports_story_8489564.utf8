 World Cup not to be rotated
Zurich: Fifas executive committee has voted unanimously to end its policy of rotating the hosting of World Cups through its six continental confederations. Executive committee vice president Chung Mong-joon told reporters on Monday that the rotation policy had been dropped with effect from the 2018 World Cup. Chung said all associations would be free to apply to host future World Cup tournaments, providing they did not belong to confederations that had hosted the two preceding editions. The executive committees decision was confirmed by Englands Fifa vice president Geoff Thompson, who said England would now consider mounting a formal bid to stage the 2018 event. We welcome the decision made by the Fifa executive committee and will now consider our position, Thompson said. The English FA chairman said the matter would be discussed at the associations next board meeting on Wednesday. Fifas change of heart means that the 2018 World Cup will be open to bids from all countries except those in Africa and South America. South Africa was the first beneficiary of the shortlived rotation policy and is set to stage the next edition of the World Cup in 2010. Brazil are the only candidate bidding to stage the 2014 World Cup in South America and are due to have their host status rubber-stamped by the executive committee on Tuesday. Following the decision, Belgium and the Netherlands confirmed they would formally bid to host the 2018 World Cup, while English officials are likely to follow suit.  (REUTERS)

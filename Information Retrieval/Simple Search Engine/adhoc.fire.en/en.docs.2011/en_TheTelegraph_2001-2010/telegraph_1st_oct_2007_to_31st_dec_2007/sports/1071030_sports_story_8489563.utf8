 Real ride late goals
Madrid: Leaders Real Madrid scored two late goals to secure a 3-1 home win over Deportivo la Coruna in the Primera Liga on Sunday. Deportivo took a second-minute lead through Xisco at the Bernabeu, though Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly levelled from the penalty spot. Real improved after a poor first half but it was not until the 79th minute that substitute Raul put the champions in front. Robinho added a third at the end. Real are top with 22 points from nine games, two ahead of arch-rivals Barcelona who moved up to second after they comfortably saw off promoted Almeria 2-0 in the Nou Camp. France striker Thierry Henry poached his fourth league goal just before the break. Argentinas Lionel Messi came off the bench to convert a penalty nine minutes from time as Barcelona raised their game towards the end. Valencia are fourth with 18 points, the same as Villarreal, after they fell 0-3 away to a Sevilla side motivated to give new coach Manuel Jimenez a winning start. The outcome of Valencias loss was the sacking of coach Quique Sanchez Flores in the early hours of Monday morning. (REUTERS)

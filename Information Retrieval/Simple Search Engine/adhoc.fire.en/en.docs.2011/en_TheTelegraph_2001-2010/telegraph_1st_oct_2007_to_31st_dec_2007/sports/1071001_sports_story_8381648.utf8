 Anands truly a hero: Sachin
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sachin Tendulkar Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkar, a champion in his own right, has (through The Telegraph) warmly congratulated the peerless Viswanathan Anand. Anand has done India proud again... Its a terrific achievement and one cant praise him enough... My message is simple  well done and keep the India flag flying... I rejoice when any Indian achieves anything on the world stage and Anands truly a hero, a delighted Sachin said on Sunday afternoon. Both, indeed, have much in common. For example, theyve remained absolutely humble and have always been perfect ambassadors for the country. Speaking exclusively at the Grand Ashok, Sachin added: Ive met Anand only once and, so, cant claim to know him very well... However, just one meeting in Mumbai made it obvious that hes such a thorough gentleman... Im aware hes an inspiration to many and I hope this second world title will inspire many more. That shouldnt be in doubt. Asked if he was into chess, Sachin replied laughing: Once in a while, I do play with my son (Arjun), thats it... He seems quite fond of the game... Incidentally, despite Sunday being a day off cricket for Team India, Sachin chose to have nets. Clearly, after the blob on Saturday, hes more keen to quickly get a big one against the Australians. Thats determination, a quality Anand also oozes in abundance.

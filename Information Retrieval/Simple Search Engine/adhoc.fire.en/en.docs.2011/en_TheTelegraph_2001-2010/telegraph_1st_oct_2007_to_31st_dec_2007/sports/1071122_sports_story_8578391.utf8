 Malik stays optimistic
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Shoaib Malik New Delhi: Pakistan havent lost a Test series in India in the last 28 years and Shoaib Malik has promised to keep the record intact. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, the Pakistan captain said he was under no pressure on the eve of the first Test despite losing the five-match one-day series. That we havent lost a series in so many years here gives me extra confidence and motivation. The soft-spoken Pakistan captain dismissed talk that this side lacked aggression when compared to the previous ones. All these talks come from results If you win, the team will be hailed as a great side. There will be negative remarks when you lose. We have enough aggression, said Malik. Because we lost the series, people have been talking like this. A victory will overshadow our faults. Malik warned that Pakistan would perform much better in the Test series than it did in the one-dayers. The victory in Jaipur has come as a morale booster. Our new found confidence will be reflected in the Test series. Malik is immensely confident that Shoaib Akhtar will prove to be Indias nemesis. He has been bowling really fast. In one-dayers, I asked him to bowl with shorter run ups to save time. It will be a different ball game from tomorrow, he said. At 25, Malik is much younger in age and experience than his Indian counterpart but that doesnt bother the Pakistan captain. (Anil) Kumble is a great player. He has played more than 100 Test matches. But in cricket, you get to learn every day. I am also going through that and learning how to deal with things. Age doesnt really matter.

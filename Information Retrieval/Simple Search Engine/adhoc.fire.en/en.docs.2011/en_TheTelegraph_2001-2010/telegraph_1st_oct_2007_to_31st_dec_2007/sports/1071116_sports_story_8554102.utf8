 Jeev off to a decent start
Miyazaki: Jeev Milkha Singh got off to a decent start by firing a sedate opening round of two-under 68 for the tied 10th place in the Dunlop Phoenix tournament here on Thursday. The highest ranked Indian golfer parred the first seven holes for a cautious start and followed it with back to back birdies to round off his front stretch at two-under at the par-70 Phoenix Country Club. His back stretch saw a remarkable string of nine par shots as Jeev went on to complete his round without any blemish in the card and join 11 others players including defending champion Padraig Harrington at the 10th slot. At the top of the table, the trio of Ian Poulter, Kyung-Tae Kim and Toshinori Muto returned identical rounds of five-under 65 to share the top slot, one stroke ahead of the Gonzales Fdez Castano-Chris Campbell duo.

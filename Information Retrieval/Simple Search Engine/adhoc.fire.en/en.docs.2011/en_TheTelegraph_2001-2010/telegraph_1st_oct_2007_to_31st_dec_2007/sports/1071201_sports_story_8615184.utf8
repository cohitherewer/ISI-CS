 Jaffer reigns supreme
 - Sachin, Dravid add to Pakistans agony INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Sachin Tendulkar en route to his 82 at the Eden on Friday. (AFP) Calcutta: However hard we marvel at sporting excellence, it is the show of courage that sends the adrenaline rushing. Shoaib Akhtar provided one such opportunity to his teammates on Friday, but it hardly proved to be inspirational. Younis Khan, leading Pakistan after Shoaib Malik was ruled out, had gambled with Shoaib as he tried to get a psychological edge over India. May be he had not considered the possibility of losing the toss and having to bowl a half-fit Shoaib straightaway! The Indians did not let the opportunity go waste in the second match of the IndianOil Cup. Wasim Jaffer showed the way with an unbeaten 192, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar joined the party to help India notch up 352 for three before bad light stopped play. Shoaib went into the match without a proper warm-up session and it showed. He tried to go flat out from the start, bowling at nearly 140 kmph, but lacked direction and penetration. The mind willed him on, not his body. The fitness test was limited to a few stretching exercises and some shadow bowling  twice to be precise  at nets. Nothing more was possible as Shoaib was out of breath and coughing. Geoff Lawson and the physio spoke to him for around 15 minutes after which Shoaibs participation was okayed. The entire exercise lasted around 25 minutes. Even as he walked back to the dressing room, Shoaib appeared weak and exhausted. Little did he know then that he would have to take the field within a few minutes. After a four-over opening spell, he returned post-lunch with a two-over spell, followed by two more overs just after tea. The final spell  a solitary over with the second new ball just before stumps  was an apology as he ended the day with 9-1-29-0. It was Sohail Tanveers chance to make his mark. He started encouragingly, finding the edge of Dinesh Karthiks bat with his very first ball. Younis completed a fine low catch at slip. Thereafter, the young left-arm pacers inexperience came to the fore. Despite troubling the Indians with the natural angle he generated against the right-handers, he didnt have any further success. Jaffer sorted Tanveer out well, hitting him for four boundaries in the first over his second spell, all timed to perfection. Another hattrick of fours followed after lunch. None of the bowlers could disturb his concentration as Jaffer reigned supreme to notch up his fifth Test hundred. His penchant for long innings and hunger for runs showed at the Eden. His compact defence, solid technique and graceful style were all on display. Even Dravid and Sachin paled in comparison on Friday. The beauty of Jaffers back foot punches through covers and the overall fluency of his strokeplay stood out. Jaffer added 136 for the second wicket with Dravid (50) and another 175 with Sachin (82). Till Sachin was bowled by a Danish Kaneria googly, it looked like a century was there for his taking. The ball wasnt rising above knee height on this two-paced track. It was to Jaffers liking as the limitations of the Pakistan attack was exposed. Mohammed Sami wasnt at his best either, and it was left to Kaneria to wage a lone battle. Pakistan felt the absence of a second spinner as the Indians went on the rampage. Tanveer was forced to send down three overs of left-arm spin. Pakistans body language was hardly encouraging. There were drooping shoulders all round and it looked like they were just content with going through the motions. Their fielding often reached comical levels, as players competed with each other to let the side down. A run out (of Dravid) was missed and a catch (of Sachin) dropped. The Indians will obviously not want to bat a second time in this Test. Jaffer and Sourav Ganguly will have to contend with the 2.3-over old second new ball on the second morning. If they can go through the first session unscathed, Pakistan will have to bat out of their skins to prevent Anil Kumble and his men from sealing the series with a game to spare.

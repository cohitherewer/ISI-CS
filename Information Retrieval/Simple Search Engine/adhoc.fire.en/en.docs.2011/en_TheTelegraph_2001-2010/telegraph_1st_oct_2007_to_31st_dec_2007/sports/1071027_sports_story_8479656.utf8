 Randhawa in tied 13th spot
Mallorca: Jyoti Randhawa returned a steady two-under 68 to share the tied 13th spot after the first round of the euro 200,000 Mallorca Classic tournament at the Pula Golf course here. Back in action after giving last weeks Portugal Masters a miss, Randhawa sank in five birdies against a bogey and a double bogey to share the 13th spot with 12 others in a crowded leaderboard. Playing his back nine first, the three-time Indian Open champion made the perfect start by gaining a shot on the 11th but was soon pulled back by a double bogey on the 14th. Randhawa, however, struck birdies on the 15th and 18th to make the turn at one-under. His front nine also started well as he birdied the first hole but immediately stumbled to a bogey on the third before gaining a shot on the fifth to round off a fine day in the penultimate counting event on the 2007 European Tour Order of Merit. Swede Niclas Fasth held the sole lead with a blemish-free card of 65, that was studded with five birdies including a hattrick on the front nine. South African Andrew McLardy along with five others shared the second spot a shot behind Fasth. (PTI)

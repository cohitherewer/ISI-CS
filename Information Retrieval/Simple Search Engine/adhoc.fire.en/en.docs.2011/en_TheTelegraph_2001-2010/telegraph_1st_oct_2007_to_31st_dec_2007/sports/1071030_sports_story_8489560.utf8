 Chopra breaks PGA jinx

(AFP) Miami: Big-hitting Swede Daniel Chopra shrugged off a fitful nights sleep to claim his first victory on the PGA Tour at the rain-hit Ginn sur Mer Classic in Port St Lucie, Florida, on Monday. Feeling more relaxed than he had expected, the 33-year-old covered his last three holes in one-under par to edge out compatriot Fredrik Jacobson and Japans Shigeki Maruyama by a shot. Jacobson and Maruyama both parred their last two holes for closing 69s to share second place at 18-under, two ahead of American Dicky Pride, who signed off with a 64. Last night I fell asleep just like a baby, Chopra told reporters after becoming the fifth Swede to triumph on the PGA Tour, emulating Gabriel Hjertstedt, Jesper Parnevik, Carl Pettersson and Henrik Stenson. I thought Id have a hard time sleeping. Then from probably 12:30, I was wide awake and until three in the morning, I was tossing and turning. I was wound up pretty tight last night but amazingly this morning I felt much more relaxed. I let it all kind of sink in and put things into perspective. Tied for the overnight lead with Jacobson and Maruyama at 18-under, Chopra had three holes remaining when play resumed at a sodden Tesoro Club on Monday morning. All night, I was playing those holes over and over in my mind, said the Stockholm native, who joined the PGA Tour in 2004. Never once did I play them the way I played them today. Chopra, who had relinquished a four-stroke lead midway through the final round before play was suspended in fading light on Sunday, effectively sealed the title when he birdied his first hole on Monday. He rolled in a nine-footer at the par-five 16th and then parred the 17 and 18 to clinch his breakthrough victory in his 133rd PGA Tour start. It is something Ive dreamed about for a long time, said the globetrotting Chopra, who moved to India at the age of seven to be raised by his grandparents. Its not meant to be easy. I just didnt realise it was going to be that tough, he added with a smile. I guess once you win five or six, then it becomes easier. But the first ones are hard and its meant to be that way because thats the way you get to enjoy it more and treasure it. Born to a Swedish mother and Indian father, Chopra celebrates both sides of his ancestry. Im equally proud of both, he said. I consider myself half and half. I feel maybe more Swedish when Im in Sweden and more Indian when Im in India. I love both cultures and I grew up in India, so maybe my thinking might be a little bit more Indian. But Im very proud of the fact that I have two great nationalities that follow me and are behind me and support me. Chopra regained control of the tournament when he birdied his first hole of the morning.  (REUTERS)

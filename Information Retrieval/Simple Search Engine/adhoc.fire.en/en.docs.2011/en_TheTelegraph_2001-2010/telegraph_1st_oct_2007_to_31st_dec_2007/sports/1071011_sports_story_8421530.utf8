 Injury to keep Asif out 
Lahore: Fast bowler Mohammed Asif on Wednesday suffered an elbow injury, which might keep him off the field for a while. The pacer will undergo a MRI scan to assess the seriousness of the injury. Pakistan manager Talat Ali said Asif, who bowled 34 overs in the South African first innings in the second Test at the Gaddafi had suffered the elbow injury after bowling just four overs in the second innings Wednesday. We dont know how serious the injury is. That is why we have are having the MRI scan tomorrow morning. But he could be out for a while by look of things, he said. Asif had also missed this years World Cup and some matches of the England tour last year due to the same injury. Asif has been Pakistans main spearhead in the absence of Shoaib Akhtar, who is serving an indefinite ban after being sent home from South Africa last month after having a brawl with Asif before the World Twenty20. Pakistan are due to tour India from November 1 to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals and if Asifs injury is serious he is unlikely to have enough time to recover properly.  (PTI)

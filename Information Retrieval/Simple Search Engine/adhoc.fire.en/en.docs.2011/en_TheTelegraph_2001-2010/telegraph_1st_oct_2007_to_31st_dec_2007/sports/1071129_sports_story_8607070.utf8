 Dilip asked to pick squad over phone
		Dilip VengsarkarNew Delhi: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has reportedly been directed to pick the squad for the third Test against Pakistan after discussion with his colleagues over telephone. No one from the BCCI on Wednesday was willing to confirm or deny the reports about this directive to Vengsarkar, who was quoted by a TV channel as saying that he felt humiliated by it. No comment, was all BCCI secretary Niranajn Shah had to say when asked about the development. The third Test is scheduled from December 8 in Bangalore. The apparent reason for the BCCIs move was that the selectors would end up missing the ongoing Ranji matches if they gathered for the selection committee meeting in Bangalore. The BCCI had earlier issued a seven-point guideline to the selectors which not only barred them from writing columns but also sitting in the Indian dressing room during international matches. According to the guidelines, only one selector is allowed to witness an international match while others have been asked to watch the domestic matches. The latest development is another twist in the ongoing tussle between Vengsarkar and the BCCI. Just a week ago the BCCI and Vengsarkar resolved the issue over the latters writing in columns for newspapers. The former Indian captain gave categorical assurance that he would stop. The BCCI, which had been ready to serve a showcause notice on Vengsarkar for continuing to write his columns, decided not to take any action after his climb down.  (PTI)

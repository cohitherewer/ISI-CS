 A captains confession
			Ricky Ponting on arrival in Sydney on Monday. (AFP)		Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting confessed on Monday that his team did not take Twenty20 cricket seriously and needed to learn the nuances of the game to lift its modest international record in the shortest format. I dont think there was any need for it to be taken ultra-seriously before the World Twenty20. The games that were played before (World Twenty20) were almost played as exhibition-type matches  to promote the other forms of the game, Ponting said on returning home. I think that was the way it was used by most boards around the world, but now its pretty clear and apparent to us that well be playing a lot more. When theres a World Cup event in any form of the game, you want to make sure you understand the game well and you play the game well, he was quoted as saying by an Australian agency. Our international records not great, weve probably only got a 50-50 win-loss record  and thats something were going to improve on over the next couple of years, he added. Ponting admitted his team was still being educated in the nuances of the game. We probably learnt a little bit through the World Twenty20 about the format of the game. Going there we were all pretty new to it, pretty inexperienced in Twenty20 cricket, he said. The Australian captain said with the Indians winning the World Twenty20 and talks of star-studded Twenty20 leagues the game was sure to get further popular in the sub-continent. Meanwhile, Ponting does not believe in a tit-for-tat policy and urged the fans here to treat the Indian team with respect when they tour Down Under later in the summer. Id like to see the Australian fans and public treat the Indian team the same way they would any other team, Ponting said on his arrival from India. Ponting made it clear that he was hurt by the monkey chants hurled at Symonds by the hostile Indian fans and he also had a veiled warning for team India players like Sreesanth, whose frequent run-in with the Australians was one of the highlights of the ill-tempered series. As far as Im concerned this whole racism stuff is completely unacceptable in any walk of life, let alone on a sporting field, Ponting said, adding Im sure that at different times Sreesanth and a few of the guys will cop a hard time from the Australian fans.

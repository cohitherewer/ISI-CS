 Weve got to have a leader as captain, says Wasim Akram

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 Former skipper reflects on the state of Pakistan cricket 
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
Melbourne: The Pakistan cricket teams recent performances have, to say the least, been disappointing. On Saturday afternoon, former captain Wasim Akram (one of the all-time great quicks) gave his views in a one-on-one with The Telegraph. Hes in Australia as a TV commentator for the ongoing series. 
The following are excerpts: 
On the state of Pakistans cricket 
Its in a shambles. 
On the No.1 reason for this state 
Were short of a leader Weve got a captain (Shoaib Malik) who doesnt deserve a place in the Test XI and the guy (Younis Khan) who should be captain doesnt want the job Its a strange situation. 
On the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) having retained Malik till the end of 2008 
Thats even more strange Dont know why. In my time the appointments, I think, were series by series. Malik hasnt done anything to keep his place (in the Test team), forget keeping the captaincy. 
On the other reasons for the dismal state of affairs 
Our domestic structure Nowadays, the institutional teams are playing with the provincial sides and theres no competition because the institutional teams attract the top players Another reason could be the frequent changes in the PCB Indirectly, getting foreign coaches has also played a part because they need time to settle down. 
On the way forward 
Weve got to have a leader as captain, thats the first thing which needs to be done. 
On the drama involving Younis 
Dont know what his problem is and what I really cant understand is why he accepts the vice-captaincy if hes not interested in the captaincy Hes said no quite a few times now Hes a nice guy and a good cricketer, I dont know what gets into his head Younis must understand that if the country needs him, hes got to put his hand up And, if he has a problem with the selection or non-selection of some players, then he should sort it out with the selectors. Surely, theres a way out. 
On the one best suited to lead after Younis 
Mohammed Yousuf Hes a calm person, a quality batsman and is respected by teammates Id pick him, but the PCB isnt keen The ones who matter probably dont like his beard! 
On Misbah-ul Haq as an option 
I dont have reservations, plus hes been performing so well. Yousuf, however, is my first choice because experience is important and seniority does matter Dont forget a captain is under so much pressure. 
On how he handled pressure 
It took me time With experience, I handled the pressures much better I tried to be calm and was open to ideas from teammates, both on and off the field. 
On whether Shoaib Akhtar is actually a liability 
(Grins) The way he played the last series (in India), hes definitely a liability I like the guy, hes a friend, but he ruined Pakistans chances in India Its a simple thing, if you arent fit, dont play Shoaib has to lose weight and become lean like Brett Lee, otherwise Hes got to remember that if he gets injured again, the PCB wont wait for him 
On few potential stars being produced by Pakistan 
Frankly, I dont know why The biggest reason, I assume, is that our first-class structure isnt strong One needs quality across the board and, clearly, restructuring is needed. 
On whether Inzamam-ul Haqs farewell ought to have been put on hold till after the tour of India 
No Inzys time was over He needed to move on and the team needed to move on 
On the PCB setting a welcome precedent by giving Inzy a farewell 
(Smiles) The present chairman (Dr Nasim Ashraf) is a nice guy, but the next could stop this practice Weve had chairmen like General Tauqir Zia, who hated players. 
On coaches from overseas 
Both India and Pakistan have former cricketers capable of doing the job, but I dont have an issue with a foreigner getting appointed Bob Woolmer did a good job, but his death left a void Bob had a reputation and came across as a perfect gentleman Its too early to judge Geoff Lawson, youve got to give him a year before really forming an opinion. 
On Dr Ashraf 
Except for the Malik decision, hes done fine Lets see what happens in the next six months. 
On the PCB now having paid selectors 
The move can make a difference, yes. 
On whether the PCB gets him to work with emerging quicks 
I was invited to a camp in Lahore some six months ago, thats it Im hardly in Pakistan and am enjoying life Ab koi pressure nahin hai. 
Finally, his message for fans who must be quite disillusioned with Pakistans recent performances 
Be patient Wait for the PCB to get the right players and, more important, the right captain.

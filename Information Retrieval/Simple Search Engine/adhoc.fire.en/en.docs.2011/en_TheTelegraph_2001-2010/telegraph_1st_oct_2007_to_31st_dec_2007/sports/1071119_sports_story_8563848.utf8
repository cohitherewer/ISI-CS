 Jeev ends 7th 
Miyazaki: Jeev Milkha Singh struck back-to-back birdies in the last two holes to return an even-par 70 and sign off tied seventh in the $1.7m Phoenix Golf tournament here on Sunday. Jeevs total of four-under 276 left him seven shots behind champion Ian Poulter of Britain, who carded a one-under 69 in the final round. Poulter, who took home a purse of $364,250, finished three strokes ahead of Spaniard Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano (68). Jeev was off to a sedate start, parring the first seven holes before stumbling to a bogey on the eighth at the par-70 Phoenix Country Club. Defending champion Padraig Harrington of Ireland had to be content with a tied fifth finish after carding a 68 to total five-under 275.  (PTI)

 Off-field commitments keep Irfan busy 
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTVadodara: Given the tough time Irfan Pathan has been having in organising complimentary passes for Thursday, making a Team India comeback was probably easier. Its really tough whenever theres a match in Vadodara... Everybody expects a complimentary pass from me, Irfan told The Telegraph on Wednesday. Having worked out on Tuesday, Irfan was given a day off ahead of the fifth ODI, but he had to drop in at the team hotel to collect complimentary passes from teammates. I cant ask the seniors as, over the years, theyve got to know some of the locals very well... And, so, Ive had to request the younger players to help out, Irfan said grinning. He added: Thankfully, my brother (and World Twenty20 teammate) Yusuf is around to take some of the pressure off me... I leave the distribution (of complimentary passes) to him... Irfan was in a hurry to get home for there was much to oversee before teammates arrived for iftar.

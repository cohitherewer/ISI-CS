 Boycott tears into Fletcher
A STAFF REPORTER Duncan Fletcher Calcutta: Geoffrey Boycott has accused Duncan Fletcher of trying to deliberately abuse big names of English cricket to sell his autobiography. A day after a British newspaper published excerpts from Fletchers autobiography where the former England coach accused the opener of spreading a litany of scornful stuff through his columns, Boycott on Wednesday responded by saying Fletcher is an absolute hypocrite. In his column for The Daily Telegraph, the former England captain wrote: I am not in the least bit surprised by the news that Fletcher has directed a stream of invective at me in his new book. He knows he wont sell many copies without mentioning the big names of English cricket. I was expecting to be on his hit list, alongside a bunch of other people  Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison  who are far better known than Fletcher will ever be. And I can tell you, I wont be losing any sleep. To Boycott, Fletcher never understood the role played by media. He never understood the medias role. Reporters and commentators are not there to be your best friend or supporter. Neither are we there to be your enemy. Our job is to give opinions and inform our readers, radio listeners or television viewers. Its not our job to please anyone. When I rang Fletcher to congratulate him after the 2005 Ashes series, he accused me of lacking loyalty to the team. I said: Fine if I was in your job I would support the team every time. But you cant expect the media to be your cheerleader. Thats not our role, he wrote. The former England opener tore Fletcher apart for criticising Flintoff. The allegations levelled at Flintoff are seriously damaging. If they are true, then Fletcher fell down on his duty. After choosing Flintoff as captain, Fletcher owed him some support. During the Ashes and the World Cup, it seemed that everything that could go wrong did go wrong, especially when the drinking escapades surfaced in St Lucia. Yet Fletcher gave an impression of detached indifference. Perhaps he thought that because of the 2005 Ashes success, he was untouchable. If so, he forgot the most important motto in sport  you are only as good as your last performance. Boycott said it was Fletchers job to see to it that off-field antics dont end up harming a player. In Australia, it was Fletchers job to help Flintoff. Whats the point of being a coach if you dont deal with those situations? The off-field environment is the one thing you can control. I have never heard of a coach scoring runs and taking wickets, which is why I think the whole idea of coaches is overrated. Captains make a bigger difference, along with the quality of the players. I have no problem with cricket people writing books, telling the truth, and making some money. I have done it myself But it seems a bit rich coming from someone who has made such a big deal about not talking out of school. Fletcher is a hypocrite and he should be ashamed of himself.

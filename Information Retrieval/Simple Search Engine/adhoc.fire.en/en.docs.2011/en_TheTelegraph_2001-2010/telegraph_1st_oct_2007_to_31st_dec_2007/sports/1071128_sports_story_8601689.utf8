 Aleem Dar replaces Koertzen
 Aleem Dar Colombo: South African umpire Rudi Koertzen, who wrongly adjudged Kumar Sangakkara out when he was on the verge of completing a double century against Australia, has been replaced by Pakistans Aleem Dar for Sri Lankas upcoming Test series against England. Koertzen, a veteran of 86 Test matches and 182 one-day Internationals, gave the controversial decision during the second Test between Sri Lanka and Australia in Hobart recently. He apologised to Sangakkara for the mistake which prevented the batsman from reaching a seventh double hundred, while destroying the slim chance that Sri Lanka had of levelling the series. Sangakkara scored 192 in the second innings of the crucial Test. South Africa umpire Rudi Koertzen has been replaced by Aleem Dar for the Test series against England beginning in Kandy on Saturday, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) spokesman Samantha Algama said. The home umpires, who will stand in the three-Test series starting December 1 are Asoka De Silva, T.H. Wijewardena, Gamini Silva, Gamini Dissanayake, R.D. Kottachchi and D. Gunawardhana. Sangakkara, meanwhile, praised Koertzen. International umpires are not required to come and apologise when they make a mistake. I thought it was a nice gesture on Rudis part, Sangakkara told a local newspaper.  (PTI)

 Laxmans ego undid him: Arun
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: V. V. S. Laxman, who scored 281 against Australia at the Eden in 2001, said he was eyeing another big knock in his favourite ground to boost his confidence ahead of the three-Test series against Pakistan. But with scores of 0 and 18, it turned out to be a forgettable outing for Laxman in their Ranji Trophy Super League match versus Bengal. The skipper neither faced the media nor did he take any call. Visibly disappointed, he disappeared soon after the days play. Later at a public function in the evening, Laxman could not avoid the mediamen. But he only replied: I dont want to talk about the match. Obviously for somebody averaging 71.45 from seven Tests at the Eden including his best 281, his lacklustre performance against Bengal attack was difficult to explain. Bengal coach Bharat Arun has a take to it. The experienced Laxman loves to dominate the attack, and especially when its Eden Gardens. Its the ego (of having scored so many runs here) that takes over We knew that while chalking out a special strategy for him. We attacked him with a short mid-wicket and no deep mid-wicket, knowing that he loves to play in that area It was a kind of gamble, which worked of us. It just clicked at the right time, Arun said.

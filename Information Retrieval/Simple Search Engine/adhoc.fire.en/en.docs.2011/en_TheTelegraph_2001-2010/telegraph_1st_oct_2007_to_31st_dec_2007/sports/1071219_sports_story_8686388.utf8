 CRICKET BRIEFS 

Schedule may hurt India, feels Healy 
Melbourne: Former Australian keeper Ian Healy feels that the BCCI may just have scuttled Indias chances of winning a landmark Test series in Australia by agreeing to a cramped itinerary which will not give them enough time to acclimatise. They didnt give it sufficient thought. But they have gone along with it for some reason and left themselves short for a series that should be extremely important, Healy was quoted as saying by a newspaper.
It could be the last time we see three of their legends. The other thing is they know how precious a victory is to their country and it seems to me their administrators havent given themselves a fair chance, he added.
Pak board warning
 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sent a strong warning to the players, saying they may miss a contract and a place in the national side because of their lack of discipline and commitment to domestic cricket. I dont care how influential or important a player is to the team, he will not be selected again if he does not adhere to discipline and the teams code of conduct, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said. We will see which player has his focus on domestic cricket and how much time he gives to it when not required for national duty.
Legal aid for Yousuf
 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has vowed to provide all possible legal help to senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf after an Indian arbitration panel barred him from playing in next years Indian Premier League (IPL). Legal experts will be consulted to finalise a strategy to help Yousuf, who initially signed up for the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL), PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi said.
PCB clarifies on Rudi
 Karachi: Pakistan accepted Rudi Koertzen as an umpire during the Test series in India only after the South African denied ever calling their players cheats  as claimed by controversial Australian Darrell Hair. The Pakistan Cricket Board had written to the International Cricket Council to inquire Hairs claims  made during the tribunal hearing in London in the racial discrimination case against ICC  and Koertzen said that he did not make any such comments.
IPL tender
 New Delhi: The Indian Premier League (IPL) started the global tendering process on Tuesday for official franchises in the eight city leagues by unveiling its prospectus. The franchisee prospectus outlines the details and structure of the each team, underlining that each franchisee squad would consist of 16 players, four international, four under-21 players and four players from the franchises catchment area. In a seperate incident, the IPL assured the cricket boards on Tuesday that it would not contract cricketers for two years after their retirement to allay concerns that players would cut short their careers to link with the Twenty20 competition.

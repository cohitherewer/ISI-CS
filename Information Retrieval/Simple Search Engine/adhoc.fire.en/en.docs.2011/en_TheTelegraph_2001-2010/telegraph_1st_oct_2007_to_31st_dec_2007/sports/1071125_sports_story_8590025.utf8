 ICL is here to stay: Players
Hyderabad: The Pakistan players, including former captain Inzamam-ul Haq, have strongly backed the Indian Cricket League (ICL), saying its concept is here to say. Rebuffing a warning issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board Against players turning out for the ICL, Inzamam insisted on Saturday that he had full confidence in the leagues success. Speaking the same language, another former Pakistan captain Moin Khan has seen the league as a great break for the youngsters to play with the some of the former greats and hone their skills. Their compatriot Abdul Razzaq also admitted that he had problems with his board and the ICL-like league compensated him well. Its a great opportunity for young players to showcase their talent, added the veteran allrounder. Veteran left-arm spinner from South Africa Nicky Boje and former New Zealand allrounder Chris Harris think the upcoming tournament is also good for the promotion of the game. Regarding Brian Laras availability, ICL executive board chairman Kapil Dev said: He has left the West Indies and we all will know only once he reaches here. Kapil said some new rules would be introduced in the tournament. To effect more run-outs, we have decided to do away with over-throws that are normally given if the ball gets deflected off the stumps, he said. Meanwhile, the ICL has roped in six former cricketers  including Tony Greig and Dean Jones  as commentators for the tournament. The others on the experts panel are South African Pat Symcox, former Australian pacers Jeffery Thomson and Mike Whitney as well as Kapil. In a practice match in Mumbai, Calcutta Tigers beat Mumbai Champs by 10 runs on Saturday. Abshishek Jhunjhunwala cracked 58 off 35 balls to power his team to 145 for five before Calcutta Tigers bowlers restricted the home team to 135 for seven.  (PTI)

 Becks close to Galaxy return
VICKI HODGES David Beckham is on course to make his return to competitive action for Los Angeles Galaxy against the New York Red Bulls next week. The England midfielder is continuing his recovery from a knee injury suffered in late August, but is just days after from making his comeback, according to club president Alexi Lalas. Beckham returned to light training this week but Saturdays Major League Soccer match with Toronto has come too soon for the former Real Madrid midfielder. Lalas said: The good news is that he is training and doing everything that all the other players are doing. We are still assessing not just his training but his recovery from the training because its been a while since hes done this. I doubt he will play a role in the game this weekend but we will certainly look to have him play a part in the game on Thursday (against New York), if he continues to train and things go well. The Galaxy need to win their final three games of the season to advance into the play-offs. Despite their poor start to the campaign, the Galaxy have kept their play-off hopes alive with a run of four wins in their last four MLS encounters despite Beckhams absence. Its been exciting, not just for us but for our fans despite what has been a uniquely challenging year to find a way to still be in the running for the play-offs and to have control of that for the next three games, Lalas said. Its wonderful but it shouldnt mask what has so far been a sub-par year.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

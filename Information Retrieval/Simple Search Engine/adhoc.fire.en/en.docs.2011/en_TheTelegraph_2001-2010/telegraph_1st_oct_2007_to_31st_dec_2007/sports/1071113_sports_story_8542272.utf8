				 																																																				London: Arsene Wenger has told the FA it would be a mistake to sack Steve McClaren if England fail to qualify for Euro 2008. 				 																																																				If Russia win their final two Euro 2008 qualifying matches, Englands game against Croatia at Wembley on November 21 will have no bearing on the final places. 				 																																																				However, Wenger said: Patience has always been short at national level. I dont think it would be a good reason to sack Steve McClaren.				 																																																				The press and media has always been very strong and unfortunately at many times they have won the battle to get the manager out. I hope not. 				 																																																				He has only been in charge for 18 months and you would like him to at least have four years. 				 																																																				To make his point, Wenger highlighted Englands failure to qualify for the 1984 European Championship under Bobby Robson, which did not result in a sacking, after which two good World Cup campaigns followed. 				 																																																				Minneapolis: Thousands of fans went to the Metrodome to see David Beckham do something exciting. He gave them what they wanted.

It was the Galaxys only regulation goal in a 1-1 draw Sunday. The Galaxy went on to beat the United Soccer Leagues Minnesota Thunder in a penalty shootout.				 																																																				Obviously if I can see those balls and play those balls, I know we have the players up front that can score goals, Beckham said.				 																																																				Beckham handled the Galaxys free, penalty and goal kicking duties in his 73 minutes on the field, before exiting to a thundering ovation. 				 																																																				London: Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho is to have a back scan after becoming the latest in a long line of players to join the clubs injury list.				 																																																				The Portugal international came off during the first half of Chelseas 1-1 draw with Everton at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, adding to manager Avram Grants injury concerns.				 																																																				Grant is already without first choice goalkeeper Peter Cech, plus defenders John Terry, Ashley Cole and Paulo Ferreira.				 																																																				Berlin: German tennis player Philipp Kohlschreiber, accused of match-fixing by an unnamed source in a German newspaper, has insisted he has nothing to hide and only plays to win.				 																																																				The papers source claims about 30 players are involved in match-fixing for internet betting sites, including Russians, Italians and Argentinians, and also Germans, citing Philipp Kohlschreiber as the worst.				 																																																				The paper said two recent matches in which Kohlschreiber played were the subject of an abnormal volume of bets. But the 24-year-old, ranked 32nd in the world, was incensed by the allegations.				 																																																				I am shocked, these unfair and scandalous accusations are a slur on my name and reputation as a player, Kohlschreiber said. I am a professional sportsman and I always play to win.

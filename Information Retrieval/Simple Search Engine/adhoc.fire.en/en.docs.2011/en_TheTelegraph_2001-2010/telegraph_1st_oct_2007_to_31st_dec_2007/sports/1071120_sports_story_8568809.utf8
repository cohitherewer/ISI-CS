 McClarens warning
HENRY WINTER McClaren doesnt want complacency to come in Steve McClaren on Sunday warned his players against complacency following Englands weekend reprieve in qualifying for Euro 2008. He also appealed to fans to leave agendas aside and make Wembley an intimidating venue for Croatia on Wednesday. Having been handed a lifeline by Russias defeat in Israel on Saturday, McClaren wants to make sure there are no slip-ups. England only need a point against Croatia to ensure qualification. McClaren is so determined to create the right mood at Wembley that he has invited all his missing players, including the suspended Rio Ferdinand and the injured trio of John Terry, Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen, to the stadium. We need them in the dressing room, together with us, McClaren said. That would be grand. Were going to contact them. Ive spoken to Rooney. Aware that many supporters still harbour reservations about him, McClaren launched a charm offensive. These fans are phenomenal, he said. More than 4,000 went to Vienna on Friday and some even went to Tel Aviv. So lets make it a great night in the seats. Weve got to make Wembley intimidating for the opposition. If everybody gets behind this team  people in the street and people at Wembley  that is going to be absolutely key. So put all other agendas away and get behind this team. McClaren is considering starting Owen Hargreaves as the anchorman in a 4-1-4-1 formation, with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard raiding forward to support Peter Crouch. Hargreaves missed the friendly in Austria as he returned to Manchester United to manage his knee injury. United said he couldnt play two games in five days but we have got him for this game, and that is the one that counts, McClaren said. Englands head coach has options in midfield, with Shaun Wright-Phillips fit and David Bentley and Ashley Young impressing in Vienna. He may omit Beckham, who patently lacked match sharpness. Beckham needed a run-out, McClaren said. It was good to have a look at him. There is competition for places; the likes of Gareth Barry and Shaun Wright-Phillips have created competition.

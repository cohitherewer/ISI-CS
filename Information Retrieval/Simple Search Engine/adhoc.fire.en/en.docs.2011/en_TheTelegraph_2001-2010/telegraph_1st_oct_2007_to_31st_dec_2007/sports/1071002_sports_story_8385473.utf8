(Reuters) Dambulla: Allrounder Fervez Mahroof grabbed four wickets to propel Sri Lanka to an emphatic 119-run victory over England in the first ODI on Monday. Mahroof ripped through the top order after a positive start by Englands batsmen, claiming the key wickets of Phil Mustard (27), Ian Bell (nought), Kevin Pietersen (one) and Alastair Cook (46), finishing with four for 31 from 10 overs. Sri Lankas victory platform was set-up earlier in the afternoon as skipper Mahela Jayawardene top scored with 66 to guide his team to a competitive 269 for seven on a sluggish pitch. Jayawardene was well-supported by this fellow top order batsmen with Sanath Jayasuriua (41), Upul Tharanga (40), Kumar Sangakkara (38) and Chamara Silva (33) all chipping in. Mahroof, who played ahead of a specialist spinner, also starred briefly with the bat, clubbing three boundaries in his 22 from 12 balls near the end. England captain Paul Collingwood was the tourists most effective bowler, claiming two for 44 from his 10 overs. Graeme Swann, a surprise choice ahead of frontline left-arm spinner Monty Panesar, returned one for 47 from his 10 overs. England started their reply confidently with debutante Mustard racing to 27 from 17 balls with three fours and a six, adding 43 with Cook for the first wicket. But Mahroofs entry into the attack swung the game decisively Sri Lankas way as Mustard chipped to mid off. Maintaining a tight line and length and nipping the ball off the seam, Mahroof then found the outside edges of both Bell and Pietersen. Collingwood was the next to depart, deceived by a well-disguised slower ball from Dilhara Fernando.  (REUTERS)

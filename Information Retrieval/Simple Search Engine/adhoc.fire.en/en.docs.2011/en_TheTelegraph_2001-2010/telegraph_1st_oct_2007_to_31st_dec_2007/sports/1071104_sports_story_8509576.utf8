 Inzy: Dhonis positive and clear in the mind
 - Former Pakistan captain opens up as he prepares to start a new innings LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Inzamam-ul Haq in New Delhi on Saturday New Delhi: Former captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who recently retired from international cricket, has told The Telegraph that hed been mentally preparing to leave well before the Pakistan selectors actually left him with little choice. Adjusting to life without cricket hasnt been very tough... Id been mentally preparing kyunki mera Board ke saath masla chalta rehta tha, Inzamam said after an interaction with the media on Saturday afternoon. Inzamam, who stepped down as captain after a disastrous World Cup, made his last appearance in the Lahore Test versus South Africa  his only game in the Pakistan colours after the sports showpiece event. He managed just 14 and 3, falling 2 short of Javed Miandads Pakistan record (8,832 runs). Inzamams in India for the start of a new innings  as host of Zees Junoon 2007 show during the upcoming five ODIs and three Tests  and, well, hes excited. The following are excerpts from his 45-minute Q amp;A: On taking guard in a different field Im excited... For 16 years or so, people (in the media) tore me to pieces, ab mere pas mauka aaya hai! Like when I was playing for Pakistan, its going to be a full-time job. On the Pakistan players freely admitting that he will be missed on this tour This is part of life... One day, those who play have to leave the stage... I thank those whove been remembering me. On having failed to better Miandads record Mere kismat mein nahin likha tha... I was upset initially, not now... If Id broken Javedbhais record, then somebody would one day break mine... On whether he should have batted up the order more regularly Perhaps, but I acted in the interest of the team. On the allegation that he introduced too much of religion in the dressing room The players are continuing to offer namaaz, which is the farz of every Muslim... Isnt it? I dont think I did anything special. On controversies (Grins) Hamare log jyada garam hote hain! On his favourite captains Imran Khan, Salim Malik and Wasim Akram... I didnt play much under Imranbhai, but he was special... Malik was a technical captain, a keen student... Akram too was very good. On whether external factors influence the appointment of captains in Pakistan No. On Shoaib Malik as captain He has started well, but could feel the pressure during the Tests in India... Hes cool on the field and has a good temperament. I was captain for four years and I hope hes there for longer. On Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni I like two things about him  hes positive and doesnt mind taking a chance in difficult situations... Also, hes clear in the mind... Indeed, Dhoni backs whatever decision he takes... These are fine qualities. On the present Pakistan team being short on experience But the same thing was said when I brought the team in 2005 and we drew the Test series and won the ODIs... I dont think experience is everything... In the World Twenty20, for example, both India and Pakistan had new captains and quite a few young players, but that didnt stop both from making the final... The Indians are, of course, more experienced... Handling pressure is the key to doing well in Indo-Pak matches. Woh sabse important hai. On Mohammed Asif nursing an elbow injury Asif zabardaast bowler hai, but weve got others to make up for his absence. On whether Shoaib Akhtar could make the biggest difference (Grins again) If he plays! On Rahul Dravid being left out of the (for now) first two ODIs Came as a surprise... On the ones who could be the key players over the next few weeks If Ive got to pick one from each team, then its Sachin Tendulkar and Shahid Afridi. On whether the mandatory ball change in ODIs after the 34th over is going to result in less of reverse swing No, not in the subcontinent. On whether the fairly regular face-offs have helped reduce the pressure on the players Probably, yes... India aur Pakistan ka mazboot competition hota hai... On why teams from the subcontinent struggle in Australia and South Africa Look, the players arent magicians... For our performances there to change, youve got to improve the quality of pitches offered for domestic cricket. On Boards in the subcontinent having a fondness for coaches from overseas One reason could be that there arent enough qualified coaches within the country... My opinion is that the captain should have the biggest say in the coachs appointment, after all, he has to work the closest with him. In fact, not only the captain, the entire team has to feel comfortable. On the late Bob Woolmer He was a very experienced coach and one learnt a lot from him. On last years Brit Oval fiasco It started because Darrell Hair slapped a five-run penalty without informing me, something the umpire was obliged to do... On whether match officials tend to discriminate against teams from the subcontinent Yes, on all matters... I think they are much too firm when it comes to players from this region.  On the seasoned versus youngsters debate in some quarters in India I dont think Sachin, Sourav (Ganguly) and Dravid have reached the age where theyve got to quit... I retired at the age of 37... When to leave is something that has to be decided by the individual alone. Performance is important, as is fitness. On the burnout issue Too much of one-day cricket, because of all the travelling, will affect careers. Finally, on being aggressive Aggression mein hi maza hai, but it should be within limits... Theres no harm in both teams being aggressive, provided they dont cross the line.

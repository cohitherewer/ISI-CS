 CRICKET BRIEFS 
						
	We rsquo;re not invincible, says Clarke 					
	 Melbourne: Their recent losses to India seem to have dented the Australian cricketers rsquo; confidence. Middle-order batsman Michael Clarke made it clear to the home crowd that the new-look team was not invincible and fans should not have ldquo;unrealistic rdquo; expectations from the young Test side.						
	 ldquo;I think the Australian public has taken our form for granted because we have had so many great players and they have performed so good for 10-15 years, rdquo; Clarke said.
 ldquo;I think it is unrealistic now and I think that has shown recently. We didn rsquo;t win the World Twenty20. We only won 4-2 in the one-dayers versus India and that was a tough series, rdquo; he was quoted as saying by a daily.						
	 ldquo;I hope we win every game we play, but the reality is it can rsquo;t happen. rdquo; 						
	 Muralidharan disclosure						
	 Colombo: Sri Lanka rsquo;s talismanic off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan has disclosed that he decided to tour Down Under this time because Australia Prime Minister John Howard refrained from making unpleasant remarks about him. ldquo;The last time (2004) the Prime Minister made comments that put me off. This time I have nothing to worry, rdquo; Muralidharan was quoted as saying in a local newspaper.					
	 Three years ago, Howard stepped into a controversy over the legality of Muralidharan rsquo;s action after an Australian laboratory declared that he was bending his arm more than the stipulated margin.						
	 Chucker taunts 						
	 Melbourne: Even before Sri Lanka rsquo;s series against Australia gets underway later this week, spin wizard Muralidharan has encountered first sledging remarks from local fans and passers-by on the streets of Adelaide. ldquo;Some people have just asked for autographs and have been nice, but there have been one or two people who have shouted lsquo;chucker rsquo; in the street and during the game in Adelaide, rdquo; he said.						
	 ECB warning						
	 London: The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has threatened counties with exclusion if they allow their players to join the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). 						
	 The ECB is supporting the BCCI, which has outlawed the ICL and established its own Twenty20 competition, the Indian Premier League, which is scheduled to get underway next spring. The ECB has already warned English players that they could jeopardise their chances of playing for England if they sign up to play in the ICL.					
	 ICL website				 
	 Mumbai: The ICL on Monday said it had launched its website, indiancricketleague.in, developed by Microsoft. ldquo;Our website has been launched from today, rdquo; ICL executive board chairman Kapil Dev told reporters here. The website will have live broadcast of matches, highlights, scoreboard, statistics and charts.

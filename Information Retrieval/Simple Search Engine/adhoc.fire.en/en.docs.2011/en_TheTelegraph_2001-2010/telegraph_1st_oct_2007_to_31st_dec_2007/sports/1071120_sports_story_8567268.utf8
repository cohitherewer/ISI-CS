 Richest meet in Dubai 
Dubai: The European Tour is to host the worlds richest event after announcing plans on Monday for a $10 million season-ending tournament in Dubai from 2009. Offering $1.66 million to the winner, the first Dubai World Championship will take place from November 19-22 as a climax to the season, replacing the current Order of Merit with The Race to Dubai. Another $10 million will be handed out in bonuses to the top 15 players in The Race to Dubai, which will start in November 2008, with the No. 1 player receiving $2 million. This is so much more than a tournament sponsorship. It is a long-term partnership which will see the European Tour and Dubai joining together to significantly enhance the game world-wide and take golf to a new level for spectators everywhere, said George Grady, chief executive of the European Tour, after announcing a five-year deal with Leisurecorp, owned by the Dubai royal family. The European PGA Tour said there was an option to extend the agreement by a further five years and while the Tour will keep its main headquarters at Wentworth, it plans to establish an international HQ at Jumeirah Golf Estates, where the Dubai World Championship will take place. The Volvo Masters has been the traditional end to the Tours year, with the top 60 players rounding off the season and will continue to be a similar elite tournament next year. Grady insisted the tournament, held at Valderrama and Montecastillo in Spain since 1988, would not disappear from the schedule but might move from its current November date. The Tours chief admitted that the multi-million dollar deal had been inspired by the US Tours Fedex Cup playoffs, which have encouraged a burgeoning list of European Tour players to try their luck in America. The tournament was not designed to attract world No. 1 Tiger Woods to the European Tour, Grady said. This isnt to get the best players in the world, its for players who make commitments to the European Tour, he said. If Tiger Woods says he wants to join (the European Tour) and promises to play a minimum of 11 events and pay his $500 joining fee, then he would qualify.  (Reuters)

 Enjoyed bowling, says Sourav
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Misbah-ul Haq en route to his unbeaten 71 at the Kotla on Thursday. (AFP) New Delhi: It was a busy Thursday for Sourav Ganguly. After a hard days work at the Kotla, the former India captain walked in for the post-match conference, much to the delight of the waiting media. Fluent and articulate as always in fielding a battery of questions, Sourav said he had a great day on the field. I enjoyed my bowling. This is one department where there is no pressure on me. There was a bit of movement early in the day. There was moisture in the air and the ball moved. The misty conditions helped us pick early wickets, said Sourav. He admitted that India could have finished Day I in a stronger position after reducing Pakistan to 142 for eight. It would have been better had we dismissed them below 200, Sourav said. But then, there was not much help after tea. It was a flat wicket. In these situations, one partnership always develops. But you have to give credit to Misbah-ul Haq and (Mohammed) Sami. Both batted very well. Asked whether Pakistan could cross 300, Sourav said: We have to put up a very bad show (on Friday) to help them score 300. Picking Munaf Patel for special praise, Sourav said he was very happy with the pacemans effort. Making a comeback is never easy and he did it well. I liked his attitude. Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson said he would be happy to see his team post 250 in the first innings. Asked if this Test will go the distance, Lawson replied: I dont know. The history of this pitch suggests it comes apart. If we can make 250 in the first innings, I think it would be nice. The former Aussie paceman pulled up the batsmen for throwing their wickets. Id probably have felt better if we had not been reduced to 142 for eight at tea. But the pitch is not that easy. We played some shots we should never have. Some of the shots were played as if they had one-day cricket at the back of their minds. Misbah and Sami fought well. The others should learn from them. Sami was given some instructions when he went to bat and he followed those perfectly, said Lawson.

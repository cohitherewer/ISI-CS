 Roaring start by Dempo
Margao: Dempo SC launched their defence campaign in style and defeated Salgaocar with a convincing 3-0 margin in the lung opener of the first ONGC I-League at Nehru Stadium Saturday. Playing with three forwards, Dempo went on attacking from the start and had the match under control throughout with Ranty Martins and Edeh Chidi giving the rival defenders a harrowing time. Dempo opened their account early when Salgaocar defender Nicholau Celaco delayed in clearing the ball, which Martins intercepted and sent across for Chidi who tapped in from close. Chidi then had a clear chance to increase the lead but his header from close went out. After mounting pressure on the Salgaocar defenders, Dempo scored another goal in the 24th minute. A miss pass by Nicholas Rodrigues just outside the box saw the ball going to Dempos Nicholas Borges who quickly released it to well placed Chidi whose firm right footer found the net. Dempo continued to hold sway after the interval with Martins and Chidi breathing down the rivals neck with forays and increased the tally in the 68th minute. A move from the right saw Anthony Pereira releasing the ball to Martins who made no mistake in finding the net.Dempos defender Mahesh Gawli was adjudged Man of the Match. Meanwhile, Mahindra United will start their I-League campaign against Air India at the Cooperage on Sunday. (PTI)

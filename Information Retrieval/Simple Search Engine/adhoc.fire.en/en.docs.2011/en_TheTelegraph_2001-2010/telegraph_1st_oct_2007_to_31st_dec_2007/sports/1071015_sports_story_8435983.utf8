 Mentally stronger now: Hamilton
Simon Arron Hamilton Lewis Hamilton insists his failure to clinch the Formula One world title in Shanghai last Sunday will not alter his approach as he prepares for next weekends season finale in Brazil. The 22-year-old Englishman was poised to become the sports first rookie world champion when he dominated the opening stages of the Chinese Grand Prix, but his determination to win, rather than settle for a healthy points finish, ultimately proved costly. With his rear tyres worn to the canvas, he slid into a gravel trap as he entered the pit lane and his race was run. I knew the car was vibrating quite badly, he said, but I had no idea how badly my rear tyres were worn  my mirrors were caked in mud because of the dirty, wet conditions at the start. It was his first retirement in an extraordinary debut season that has yielded four wins and 12 podium finishes from 16 starts. He travels to Brazil with a four-point championship lead over McLaren-Mercedes teammate Fernando Alonso and seven separating him from Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen. If Hamilton finishes level with either, the title will be settled on a tie-break, with individual results being taken into account. Raikkonen has five victories to his name, one more than either McLaren driver, while Hamilton has scored the greatest number of second places: he has five to Alonsos four and Raikkonens two. It is the first three-way title showdown since the 1986 Australian GP, when Nigel Mansell lost the championship when a tyre blew with 19 of 82 laps left. Alain Prost, the outsider for McLaren then as Raikkonen is now for Ferrari, came through to win the race and the crown. Hamilton has spent the past few days training near his Hertfordshire home. I felt quite good after last weekend, he said. When you come back you think about what you could have done better and you learn from your mistakes, so if anything Im mentally stronger. I will have to change my training regime a little, though. I need to make it a bit more intense and exercise the other side of my neck, because Interlagos is an anti-clockwise circuit. Interlagos is the seventh circuit of the season on which Hamilton has no prior experience  a statistic that doesnt worry him. Its not an issue, he said. As weve seen all year, Ive been quite strong on circuits that are new to me. Indeed, he has notched three of his wins on alien terrain. McLaren have scored 11 Brazilian GP victories since the race was added to the world championship calendar in 1973, while Ferrari have recorded eight. Neither of Hamiltons title rivals has won at Interlagos, although Raikkonen has three times finished second and Alonso clinched the title there in each of the past two seasons. Hamilton isnt worried about the past, though: hes focusing on the next seven days. I now know what it feels like to lose a title opportunity, he says, and it is not something I want to experience again. I am going to do everything in my power to pull it off.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

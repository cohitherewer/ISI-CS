 Inzaghi equals Mullers record 
Donetsk (Ukraine): Striker Filippo Inzaghi came off the bench to score a two goals and line up the other as holders AC Milan beat Shakhtar Donetsk 3-0 on Tuesday to stay on course for the last 16 of the Champions League. The Italians two goals bring his European club football score to 62 goals, putting him level with record-holder Gerd Muller, Germanys veteran 1970s footballer. Inzaghi provided his trademark poachers finish to a through ball from Andrea Pirlo in the 66th minute and then laid the ball off for Brazil playmaker Kaka to drive home the second in the 72nd minute. Kaka returned the favour deep in stoppage time, bearing down on goal on the break and slipping the ball to Inzaghi for a simple finish from close range. The victory put the defending champions top of group D, with a three-point lead. Some 25,000 mostly Ukrainian fans braved temperatures of -3 degrees celsius in the eastern industrial town. Elsewhere, Chelsea stayed on course to reach the knockout stages after a 0-0 draw at Schalke 04 in group B while Celtic also remained in the hunt in group D with a 1-0 win over Benfica after 21-year-old midfielder Aiden McGeady rifled in a deflected long-range winner on the stroke of halftime. Chelseas seven-game winning streak under Avram Grant ended in Gelsenkirchen but the stalemate left them a point ahead of Rosenborg, who registered their second 2-0 win over Valencia in as many weeks thanks to a Steffen Iversen double. The former Tottenham Hotspur striker gave the Norwegian side a 31st minute lead with a low shot that went in off the post and sealed the win shortly before the hour when he was left unmarked at the far post to nod the ball home. Real Madrid lead group C on eight points after a goalless draw at Olympiakos Piraeus, who have five points along with Lazio following a 2-1 home win over Werder Bremen.  (AGENCIES)

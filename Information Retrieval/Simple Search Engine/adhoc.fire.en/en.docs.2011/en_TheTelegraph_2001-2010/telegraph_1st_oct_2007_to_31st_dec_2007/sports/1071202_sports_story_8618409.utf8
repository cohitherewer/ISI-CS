 Waits over for Dona, Sana too
TAPAN K. MOHANTA Ecstatic fans after Sourav Ganguly struck his 14th century, his maiden at Eden Gardens, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture Calcutta: When Sourav Ganguly jumped in the air after completing his century at the Eden, at the CAB special enclosure there was an encore  a small jump by the six-year-old Sana. It was obviously a special occasion for wife Dona and little Sana, watching Sourav achieve his long-awaited maiden century on home turf. The moment Sourav took a single off Danish Kaneria in the fourth ball of the 127th over from the pavilion end, Sana erupted in joy. She went on singing: Baba century korlo and her claps would never end. In fact, Dona and Sana just managed to reach Eden two runs before the former captains 14th century. Both rushed to the enclosure as Sourav hit a four off Salman Butt to reach 97. Having hit the four, Sourav retained the strike with a single. Another single pushed him to 99 with the mother-daughter duo watching closely. The moment finally came as everybody at the enclosure gave the Prince of Calcutta a standing ovation. In the very next over, Sourav fell to Butt much to the disappointment of Sana, a standard one student of Loreto House. Tea was taken 11 overs after Sourav got out. And he did not miss the opportunity to spend some time with Sana. When Sourav came upstairs to meet wife and daughter during the tea break, the first to congratulate him were chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar and former Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin. Sourav nodded, seeming relieved. Sana gave her baba a hug. They sat together for nearly 10 minutes before she surprised a few by her cricketing acumen. Any moment the team can declare now you go back to the match, she told Sourav. Dona said: Everybody wanted him to score a hundred here and he showed it today The whole crowd enjoyed and so did we We have every reason to celebrate. Snehashish Ganguly: Its great that he got a century at the Eden. It was a great innings He played some brilliant shots en route to the 102. We enjoyed a lot seeing him in full flow. There was hardly any pressure on him he was quite cool and did not have any sleepless night yesterday, even as he had to wait for another to reach the magical figure.

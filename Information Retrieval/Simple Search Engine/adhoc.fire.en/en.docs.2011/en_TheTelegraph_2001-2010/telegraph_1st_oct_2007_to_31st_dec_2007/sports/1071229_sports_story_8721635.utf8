 Feel bad for Bengal: Paras

A STAFF REPORTER
 Mhambrey 
Calcutta: Paras Mhambreys new team Baroda may be on a high, having made the Ranji Trophy semi-finals after finishing second in group B Super League but the coach is a little disappointed. Not for his team but for his former team  Bengal. 
Bengals ignominious relegation to the Plate division made Mhambrey upset. Having coached Bengal to two successive Ranji finals, their fall was also unexpected for the 35-year-old. 
You really did not expect it to happen from a team like Bengal. Personally, I feel for Bengal, having associated with them for the past two seasons. I also feel bad for the talented players like Manoj Tiwary and Ranadeb Bose who are knocking on the India doors. In the Plate, they really have to work hard to come up, Mhambrey told The Telegraph from Baroda on Friday. 
In their last-round Super League match, Baroda conceded first innings lead against Orissa to finish second with 19 points from the group. Uttar Pradesh (also 19 points) topped on a better quotient. 
The former Indian medium-pacer felt that Bengal missed Deep Dasgupta, Rohan Gavaskar and Abhishek Jhunjhunwala badly. They missed the trio badly. There void was hard to fill. 
That was one aspect. But the youngsters who were given a chance to show their talent, disappointed... Its clear that the batting struggled. Bengal were over-dependent on Tiwary. Bowling however was not that bad, he said. 
The former Mumbai player added that its time for Bengal to introspect. Not all is lost for Bengal it has been just one bad season. They need to learn from their mistakes. They should look forward now  there is Duleep Trophy, one-day tournament, Deodhar Trophy 
But for Mhambrey himself its time to do an encore  this time taking Baroda to the final.

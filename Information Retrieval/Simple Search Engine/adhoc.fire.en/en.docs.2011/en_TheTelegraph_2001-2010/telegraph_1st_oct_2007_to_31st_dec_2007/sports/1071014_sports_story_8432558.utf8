 Pennetta stuns Venus
Bangkok: Italys Flavia Pennetta stunned Wimbledon champion Venus Williams with a 6-4, 7-6 win to reach the Bangkok Open final on Saturday. Pennetta held her nerve as the second-seeded American launched a determined fightback, the Italian emerging victorious in a marathon second set tie-break to end her opponents hopes of reaching a third straight WTA final. The loss leaves Venus facing an anxious wait to see if she will get one of the eight spots at the season-ending championships in Madrid. She is currently eighth in the WTA Champions Race with the first four berths already assured. In Moscow, Serena Williams overpowered top seed Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-6, 6-1 to reach her first Kremlin Cup final. The fourth-seeded American will play another Russian, Elena Dementieva who crushed compatriot Dinara Safina 6-1, 6-0, in Sundays final. In the mens draw, top seed and defending champion Nikolay Davydenko reached his first final of the year after seeing off unseeded Serbian Janko Tipsarevic 7-6, 6-1. On Sunday, the Russian world No. 4 will face fourth-seeded Frenchman and 2002 winner Paul-Henri Mathieu.  (REUTERS)

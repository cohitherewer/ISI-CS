 Sourav, Laxman were a treat
 - Realistically, I dont see an escape route for Pakistan  Ramiz at Eden There was immense pressure on Sourav and Laxman prior to the Kotla Test, with ODI Player of the Series Yuvraj breathing down their neck. How well they have coped with it! Both got runs at the Kotla, but if some still had doubts, the experienced duo chose to silence them with a century apiece at the Eden. Both played bravely and with great determination. The way they handled potential danger man Kaneria was a visual treat. There was something in the pitch for the leg-spinner and it was important for the Indians to bludgeon him and carry Jaffers initiative forward. It was a treat to watch Sourav and Laxman play difficult shots consistently. Sourav drove through the off, while the wristy Laxman played beautifully on the on side. The class of the two men came through in no uncertain terms. The day couldnt have been better for Sourav. Thousands turned up just to see him bat and go for his maiden Test century at home. Every time he played an elegant shot, the crowd played with him. The chemistry was very special indeed. Sourav was caught off guard by short balls a couple of times, which led someone to comment that he will be exposed on the pacy and bouncy tracks Down Under. I just dont understand why such talks crop up whenever a bouncer is hurled at him. Sourav may not look as confident as a Sachin while tackling short pitched deliveries, but the important thing is that he has worked his way through. Steve Waugh had a similar problem, but he survived. Thats the bottomline. Both Sourav and Laxman are mentally very strong. They threw down the gauntlet to the opposition and stitched together a mammoth partnership. Their success means Yuvrajs bad luck continues. He would have walked into any team other than India and Australia. He must not lose hope and form. Playing domestic cricket, whenever he gets a chance, would be the right way to go about it. Pakistan put up an improved show on Saturday. There was more energy, some smiles and a better fielding effort, but the results werent forthcoming. Shoaib bowled a few more overs and tried a few things, but couldnt generate his normal pace. If the pace drops for someone such as Shoaib, he becomes friendlier for batsmen to handle. Sami and Tanveer didnt show much variation. By not bowling the off- cutter, they missed a trick on this pitch. With Kaneria being well handled, Pakistan attack held no threat for this classy Indian batting line-up. I expect Zaheer and even Munaf to bowl better. Of course, Indian spinners will hold the key. The surface is tailor-made for Kumble and Harbhajan, as the top looks crusty and uncertain. The game is perfectly poised for India. For Pakistan to salvage pride, Younis Khan and the other seniors will have to put in a lion-hearted effort. They cant afford to get bogged down and be buried under the mountain of runs India have put on the board. Three days remain in this match and Pakistan have 19 wickets in hand. Realistically, though, I dont see an escape route for them. Ill be delighted if proved wrong.Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja is writing exclusively for The Telegraph on all days of the Eden Test

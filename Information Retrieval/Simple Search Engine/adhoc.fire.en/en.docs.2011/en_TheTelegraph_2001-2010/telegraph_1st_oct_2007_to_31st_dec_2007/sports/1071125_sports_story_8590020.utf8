 Watekar blows away Orissa
 Barodas Irfan Pathan took 4/71 against Hyderabad Cuttack: After being bowled out for 179 in their first innings, Andhra on Day II bowled out Orissa for 140 in their Ranji Trophy Elite group B match at the Barabati Stadium here on Saturday. Andhra spinner Hemal Watekar, who was introduced as a part-time bowler by skipper M.S.K. Prasad, claimed five wickets for 32. In their second essay, Andhra were 67 for two stablishing an overall lead of 106 runs with eight wickets still intact when stumps were drawn for the day. Prasad and A.S.K. Verma were batting at 15 and 20 runs respectively after Hemanl Watekar (19) and L.N.P. Reddy (6) got out early. The hosts, who resumed at their overnight score of 21 without loss, were unable to withstand the opposition attack from the beginning and were in dire straits. Orissa opener Bakis Pati failed to read a delivery of Gnaneswara Rao and caught plumb adding only one run to his overnight score of five with the team scoreboard reading 23. Batsmen fell like a pack of cards and except former skipper Niranjan Behera (31) and wicket keeper Haldhar Das (30) no other player were able to build a partnership. Meanwhile, an unbeaten 91 by Connor Williams helped Baroda score 191 for two in reply to Hyderabads 261 on the Day II of the Ranji Trophy Super League match at Hyderabad on Saturday. Williams was assisted by Azharuddin Bilakhia (68). Rakesh Solanki (6) was when the stumps were drawn. Earlier, the hosts resuming at 220 for four, lost six wickets in quick succession for 41 runs. Baroda bowlers put up an impressive performance with Irfan Pathan claiming four wickets for 71 runs, while Sumit Singh shone with three for 39.

 Hyderabad forced to skip nets
A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengals (CAB) inefficiency came to the fore on Friday when they struggled to find Hyderabad team a practice venue on arrival. As a result Hyderabad players were forced to skip their first practice session in Calcutta. Hyderabad are to play hosts Bengal in their first Ranji Trophy match of the season from Sunday. That was not all. On their arrival in the morning at the airport, the team members and the coach were stranded for almost an hour before they could find the team bus, a senior member of the team revealed. Apparently, there was no local manager which led to confusion. In the afternoon, when the team left for CC amp;FC ground they were told not to go there, though it was their official practice venue, Hyderabad coach Vivek Jaiswal said. When we boarded the bus somebody told us that CC amp;FC ground was not available so the next option was the Jadavpur University ground in Salt Lake. But when we reached there, the ground was soggy and unfit for practice. So eventually we had to cancel our practice and come back. The team, however, will practice at the Eden at 12 noon on Saturday, the coach added. Asked about the confusion, the CAB joint secretary Samar Paul said: They (Hyderabad) never informed us that they were going to practice today. We would definitely have done something had they informed us However Jaiswal pleaded that lets not create this an issue. Though, in a sarcastic vein, he went on to add: Till now we knew CAB for their well professionalism and organising skills.

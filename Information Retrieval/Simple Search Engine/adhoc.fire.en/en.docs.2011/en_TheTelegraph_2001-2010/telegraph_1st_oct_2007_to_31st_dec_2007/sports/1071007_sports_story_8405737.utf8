 Davs yes to NCA
 - Ravi wants it to become a real finishing school, says Aussie LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Ravi Shastri and Dav Whatmore Calcutta: The 1996 World Cup-winning coach, Dav Whatmore, has accepted the Boards offer to join the Bangalore-located National Cricket Academy (NCA) as its first director of operations. The offer had been made through former India captain and cricket manager Ravi Shastri who, last week, got appointed as the NCA chairman. Shastri is the talismanic Kapil Devs full-time successor. The 1983 World Cup-winning captain got sacked in August for his involvement with the Indian Cricket League. Ive agreed, but the announcement should come from the Board I dont wish to break protocol, Whatmore told The Telegraph from Bittern, some 65 km from Melbourne. Speaking on Saturday evening, Whatmore added: The contract is for three years and Ill be in Bangalore by the end of this month. Given that the Boards Team India coach-appointing committee didnt even call him for an interview four months ago, did he think hard before accepting the offer for an entirely different position? Not really It didnt take me long to realise theres value in being associated with the NCA Plus, I can give something I know Ravis on the coach-appointing committee, but I didnt bring up what happened in June, Whatmore replied. The 53-year-old Australian had thrown his hat in the ring after compatriot Greg Chappell decided not to seek an extension of his contract. Incidentally, the hunt for Chappells successor continues. Its largely because Sharad Pawar and Co. gave Whatmore the cold shoulder that the Pakistan Cricket Board (wary of being seen as hiring an India reject) also left him high and dry. That after having wooed Whatmore for the coachs post, which fell vacant following Bob Woolmers mysterious death during the World Cup. Whatmore, though, didnt wish to look back. Id rather talk of the NCA Im excited and Ravi wants it to become a real finishing school In fact, Id like players from overseas too to graduate from there, he said. Established in 2000, the NCA only functions for a few months every year, but Whatmore pointed out thats going to change. Just as well. The specifics have to be worked out, but I expect the NCA to be operational for 8-10 months Eventually, one would like Indian coaches to impart all the training but, if needed, one may call specialists from overseas However, one doesnt have to cross that bridge right now. Whatmore, who has coached Sri Lanka (twice) and Bangladesh, remarked that he was looking forward to working with Shastri. Ive known Ravi for a number of years We understand each other well and Im looking forward to a formal association with him Asked if hed followed Indias World Twenty20 campaign, Whatmore replied: With a lot of interest, yes, very closely The young team, with such limited exposure to Twenty20, performed brilliantly. Having once worn the Australia colours, Whatmore is keeping track of the ongoing ODIs between India and Ricky Pontings men as well. The Indians are down 0-2, but I think its a matter of one win Of course, dont forget the (Mahendra Singh) Dhonis are up against such a good team The Australians have hit the ground hard straightaway. But when will that one win materialise? Footnote: The Bangalore-based Brijesh Patel, secretary of the Karnataka State Cricket Association, must be very pleased. For, back in April 2003 (as the then NCA director), hed been negotiating with Whatmore to come on board. Talks fizzled out after the Jagmohan Dalmiya regime had second thoughts.

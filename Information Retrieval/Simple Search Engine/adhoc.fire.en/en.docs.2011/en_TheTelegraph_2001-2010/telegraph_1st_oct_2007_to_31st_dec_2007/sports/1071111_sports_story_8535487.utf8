 Randhawa, Ghei suffer a bad day in office
 Phil Mickelson stretches before teeing off on the sixth during the third round of the HSBC Champions meet in Shanghai on Saturday. (AP) Shanghai: Jyoti Randhawa and Gaurav Ghei had a disappointing day as both of them slumped to tied 54th and tied 62nd spots, respectively, after the third round of the $5 million HSBC Champions here on Saturday. Randhawa, who w\as at tied 31st after the second round, totalled six over 222 to slide further. Ghei, at tied 37th on Friday, was even worse in his performance to record 10 over 226 to rest at the bottom. With a round to go on Sunday, both of them will try to resurrect their fortune and improve their positions in the final list. Meanwhile, world No. 2 Phil Mickelson will take a two-stroke lead into the final day after another strong finish that gave him a four-under-par 68 in the third round. The 37-year-old American mixed three birdies with a couple of bogeys on the front nine but picked up three more shots after the turn to finish on 14-under for the tournament. Britains Ross Fisher carded a third successive 68 for sole possession of second spot, a shot ahead of compatriot Paul Casey, who hit a barnstorming 66 to finish on 11-under. Overnight leader Kevin Stadler had a 73 but remains in contention a shot behind Casey in fourth. Towards the end I steadied it a little bit and had some good birdies coming in, Mickelson said. It was a good way to finish. Mickelson got off to a good start with a birdie at the second and topped the leaderboard for the first time this week when Stadler found a bunker for his second bogey of the day at the third. But it was after the turn that the American, who sank four birdies in the last five holes on Friday, really hit his stride and a 30-foot birdie putt at the 15th put him clear. (Agencies)

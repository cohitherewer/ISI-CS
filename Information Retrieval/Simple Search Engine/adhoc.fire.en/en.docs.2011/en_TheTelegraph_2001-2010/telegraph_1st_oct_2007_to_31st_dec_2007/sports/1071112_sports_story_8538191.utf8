 Malik rues Yuvi miss
 - Trick lies in the ability to regroup quickly, says Pakistan captain OUR CORRESPONDENT Salman Butt on way to his 129 on Sunday. (AFP) Kanpur: Pakistan are not reading much into Sundays 46-run loss and hope to bounce back in the remaining two matches. You lose some and win some. There isnt much to think about it. The trick lies in the ability to regroup quickly and prepare for the battle ahead There are two more matches to go and we can still win the series, Shoaib Malik said. Malik felt Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhonis partnership made the difference.  We spilled Yuvrajs catch early on in the innings and that proved costly. He didnt look back after that and his partnership with Dhoni was the turning point, said the Pakistan captain. The Pakistan captain said he chose to field keeping in mind the early moisture and slightly gloomy conditions at the start. Dhoni said he would have also bowled on this surface. So dont really know where I went wrong. The moisture helped us in getting some movement in the early stages. In subcontinent conditions, the advantage with the fielding side lies only in the first 10-15 overs. That is the period our pacers dominated with catches flying over and in between slips. We were expecting to limit India to 250 and that would have been gettable. He felt a fourth seamer wouldnt have made a big difference to the side. Malik defended Kamran Akmal who has been having a bad time with both the bat and gloves on this tour. All this crops up only when the team loses. Catches can be dropped any time He has been going through a bad patch and it can happen to anyone. It is only a matter of time before he gets back into form.

 Atapattu rejects SLC overture
Colombo: Former Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu wont make an international comeback during next months tour of Australia after refusing to meet chairman of selectors Ashantha de Mel. Earlier on Wednesday, De Mel had announced that the selectors wanted Atapattu to play against Australia and that a meeting had been scheduled to discuss his future. Wed like him to play in Australia where we feel his skill and huge experience will be vital, De Mel had said. Atapattu skipped the meeting. I got an email from the CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), inviting me for a discussion at 5 pm, Atapattu said. The email said the selectors were going to be there too and I replied that I did not want to waste my time with a selection committee headed by De Mel, he said. After Atapattu failed to show up, De Mel said that Sanath Jayasuriya would now be selected. (REUTERS)

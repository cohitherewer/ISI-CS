 PCB chief backs Malik
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi : Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Nasim Ashraf is confident Shoaib Malik will soon turn out to be a great captain. I sometimes wonder why people say that Malik doesnt have enough aggression, said Ashraf during the Pakistan teams practice session at the Kotla on Wednesday. In the Twenty20 World Cup and against South Africa Malik led from the front, said Ashraf. After being appointed captain, his overall performance has gone up by a few notches. He has been doing a wonderful job. Ashraf, who said that the Asia Cup will be held in Pakistan in June, also gave a clean chit to Shoaib Akhtar. We have no complaints against him he is an asset to the team, said the PCB supremo. The Rawalpindi Express also earned praise from the board chief for his charity work. To say he has been doing it for publicity wont be fair. He has genuine concerns for such things and he does it regularly in Pakistan too. Ashraf said the Test series would be contested on equal terms. In 2005 also we were labelled as a weak side. The results showed how wrong the assessment was, he added. Also present at the nets was Pakistan s chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed. A former Test cricketer, he is the brother of Congress leader Mohsina Kidwai.

 Bhutia: We can do it
Mumbai: India, having lost 1-4 in Beirut, face a massive challenge in the home leg of their World Cup qualifier against Lebanon, but Bhaichung Bhutia doesnt think its beyond his team. India need a 3-0 win over their west Asian opponents in Chennai on Sunday to ensure a passage to the second round. It will be a very difficult game but we are confident of scoring three goals. If everything goes perfectly, its definitely possible. There is pressure on us to win by a 3-0 margin, but weve got to play our natural game and see what happens. The preparation has been good, the Indian captain said in a radio interview. We will have to play a more attacking game, but at the same time we dont want to concede a goal because it will be impossible to get back into the match. Well bring in a few more attacking players but our strategy and formation will be the same. An early goal is going to help us in a big way. The Indians did not play as badly in Lebanon as the scoreline suggested. (PTI)

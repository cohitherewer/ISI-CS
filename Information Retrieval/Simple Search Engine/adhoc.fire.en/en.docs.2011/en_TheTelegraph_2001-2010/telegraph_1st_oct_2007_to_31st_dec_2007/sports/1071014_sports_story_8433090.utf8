 Shoaibs counsellor will need counselling, says Rameez
 - Former Pakistan captain is disappointed with the punishment handed out to temperamental quick LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Rameez Raja Calcutta: Former captain and one-time chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Rameez Raja, was one of the first to call for a life ban on Shoaib Akhtar after he struck Mohammed Asif. Understandably, then, hes quite disappointed with the action taken against him. A 13-match ban sounds impressive, but in reality the ban is about to end... The public may have been taken in by the number, but the punishment is far short of what Shoaib deserved, Rameez told The Telegraph on Saturday. A member of the 1992 World Cup-winning XI, Rameez is currently in India on a TV assignment. Besides the ban, conveniently calculated with retrospective effect, the PCB slapped a $57,000 fine on the temperamental speedster. As the ban came into effect from the start of Pakistans World Twenty20 campaign, Shoaib is eligible for selection from the last ODI versus South Africa  in Karachi on October 29. Whats much more significant is that hes available for the tour of India, which begins on November 2. I dont know how the PCB decided that the ban would be for exactly 13 matches... Obviously, the impression one gets is that the tour of India was kept in mind... However, Ive always maintained that indiscipline in any form shouldnt be condoned and Shoaib has got away lightly... The monetary punishment will pinch, yes, but thats about it, Rameez said. Back in April 2004, as the then PCB chief executive, Rameez made Shoaib undergo a series of tests as thered been a suspicion that hed faked a rib injury during the series-deciding Rawalpindi Test against India. As Ive told you earlier, Ive never trusted Shoaib... Im not sure how welcome hes going to be in the dressing room and, given that he self-destructs, I wont be surprised if Shoaib does something else in the next two-three months... We havent, Im sure, seen the last of his misdeeds, Rameez added. Rameez laughed when asked to comment on counselling being mandatory for Shoaib. Ive heard and read about it... If you ask me, Shoaibs counsellor will need counselling! Its okay for the PCB to make it mandatory, but who is going to spend time with him? Having made his debut (1984) when the Pakistan dressing room had such greats as Imran Khan, Javed Miandad and Zaheer Abbas, Rameez signed off saying: I played in an era when we had real big stars... Some of the biggest in the history of cricket, but nobody behaved like Shoaib... Its painful that he has given Pakistan such a bad name... Indeed, one wonders whether Shoaib (who, at 32, isnt getting any younger) wouldve got away had one Bob Woolmer still been the coach.

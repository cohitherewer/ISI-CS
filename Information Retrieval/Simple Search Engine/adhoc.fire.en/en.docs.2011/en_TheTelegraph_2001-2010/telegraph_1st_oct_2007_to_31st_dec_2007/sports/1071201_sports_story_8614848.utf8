 CRICKET BRIEFS 
Boycott suggests day-night Tests London: Former England opener Geoffrey Boycott has urged cricket administrators to revamp the long format of the game by reducing it to four days and introducing day-nighters.Citing the small crowds in the ongoing India-Pakistan Test series, Boycott said, (years ago) an India-Pakistan Test would be sold out twice over and you would not be able to get a seat. But people today have jobs and they do not want a Test match to last five days. First of all, I would recommend four-day Tests. I would try to increase the over rate, because people want to pack more into life, and I would play day-night Tests, he suggested. Boycott felt India would be the ideal place to try out day-night Tests because of its forward-looking board and passionate fans.

 Poor show by Jyoti 
Mallorca: Jyoti Randhawa turned in his worst card of the week to slide to tied 49th, before bad light dropped early curtains on Day III of the Mallorca Open golf tournament. After rounds of 68 and 69, Randhawa went into the third round hoping to put in yet another sedate show to hang around for a good finish but the benign par-70 Pula Golf Club played hostile. Just two birdies  against five bogeys and a double bogey too  were all Randhawa had to show as he stuttered to a three-day total of two-over 212. Meanwhile, in Miami, Arjun Atwal dropped a final hole bogey to miss the cut in the Miccosukee Championship, the final event of the Nationwide tour. (PTI)

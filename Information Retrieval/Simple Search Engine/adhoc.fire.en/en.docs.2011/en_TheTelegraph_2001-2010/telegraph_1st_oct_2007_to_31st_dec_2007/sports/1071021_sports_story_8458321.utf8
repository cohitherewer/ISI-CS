 In India, anything more than 5 minutes is long term: Barry
 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
 - Iconic South African on the system in Australia and what exists here LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI			Barry RichardsFor almost a decade, legendary South African Barry Richards has been respected as a commentator who isnt shy of calling a spade a spade. That he remains one of the most gifted batsmen of all time is well known too. Whats probably not is that the Perth-based Barry has also been an administrator. Indeed, he was Queenslands CEO from 1989 to 1997. The 62-year-old, therefore, has worn three hats. The other day, among other things, Barry spoke to The Telegraph in Mumbai on the system in Australia (which has led to absolute dominance in the two established forms of cricket) and what exists in India. The following are excerpts On the Australian systems USP Commitment and planning... Its commitment to a process and planning long term... In India, anything more than five minutes is long term! Thats definitely not so in Australia, where they plan for five, seven or ten years. The Australians, clearly, have a system which allows players to express themselves. On commitment The most important aspect is getting the right people in the right place, people with a cricket background or sound knowledge of the game. The Indian Board, I must say, has made a good move by giving the National Cricket Academy chairmanship to Ravi (Shastri)... The other point about commitment is the attitude and approach of the states  they play to win, yes, but the larger goal of each state is to help improve Australias standing in world cricket. This commitment is extraordinary, which is why its quality versus quality in domestic cricket... Its embraced right from the school level to club cricket. On professionalism (Grins) In India, anybody who gets paid is seen as a professional. But thats not how it should be... You could be paying an X number of people, but are they really accountable? Are they doing their job? Bottomline is that you need good governance and that includes a high degree of accountability... Im sure a lot of people get paid (in India), but that doesnt make them pros. On his experience as Queenslands CEO We pushed for an elected board, rather than a body of representatives and we once ended up with three people from the same club... That was fine, as they were seen as best suited to serve Queensland cricket... The difference was that instead of representing a certain constituency, people got elected to take Queensland forward... On his impressions, as an outsider, of the Indian system Do you have a strategic plan? Ive never heard of one being discussed... If you dont know where youll be in the next ten years, or where you want to be, youre always going to keep going around in circles... Does the Indian Board have a plan till 2017? All the stakeholders need to get involved and theres got to be a focus, otherwise people with vested interests could call the shots... The power brokers... On why cant the Australian system be replicated For one, there are too many teams (27) playing first-class cricket in India, in Australia its just six... But, then, the Indian Board doesnt have to copy everything thats done in Australia... A strategic plan, tailored for the Indian environment, should do. It will, at least, be a starting point. Once thats in place, then a cricket person is going to know what has to be done and done in a systematic manner. Otherwise, people will work in different ways and things are simply going to tick over from one season to the next. (After a pause) Im surprised that the Indian players get so little from the Board, but earn so much from endorsements... And, because of this arrangement, they need to give time to the companies whose products they endorse. This needs to be regulated as the players focus has to be on cricket alone. On why, despite a system being in place, England isnt a force Thats because there are too many (18) Counties... Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire are so close to each other that they could all be part of one County... That wont happen, though... Domestic cricket has to be a contest between teams of equal strength, or else its no good. Another reason is that schools have a long vacation when its time to play cricket... The boys go off and thats it... To an extent, the weather is a factor... Also, if I may add, cricket isnt the most favoured sport in England. Its not in Australia either, its only in the subcontinent that its No. 1. On whether theres an ideal cricket environment If there are enough people with commitment and enough players with talent... There must be continuity as well, particularly in administration, to allow for the vision to be carried forward... Australias dominance isnt because of an accident, but by design... They began working on a strategic plan 25-30 years ago... Today, for example, chief selector Andrew Hilditch isnt just looking to the next series, but four-five years ahead. Youve got to plan, but a good player will be good in any environment, only he could do better in a stable one  like what exists in Australia. Had Rahul Dravid been an Australian, he wouldnt have had to face the scrutiny of the past few weeks. How many more runs does he have to score to prove himself? Finally, on when is Australias dominance in Tests and ODIs going to end Theyll struggle when the Matthew Haydens and Adam Gilchrists also retire, but whats disappointing is that the Australians will then come back to the pack instead of the pack catching up with them... Personally, Id like the pack going to Australia instead of whats set to happen.

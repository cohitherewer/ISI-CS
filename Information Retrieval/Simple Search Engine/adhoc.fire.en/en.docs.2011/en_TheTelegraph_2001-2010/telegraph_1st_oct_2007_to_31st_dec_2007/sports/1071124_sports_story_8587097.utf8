 Match evenly balanced, says Danish Kaneria 
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Sohail Tanveer in action at the Kotla on Friday. A Telegraph picture New Delhi: Injured pace bowler Umar Gul is still experiencing pain in his back and doctors in Pakistan will examine the report on his scan, according to team manager Talat Ali. We have faxed Guls scan report to his personal surgeon in Pakistan, said the manager. An evaluation would be done in the next couple of days before we can take a decision, he said. Asked why Misbah-ul-Haq didnt field during Indias innings, the manager said: He has a sore throat and is also running temperature. So we decided to rest him. Pakistan spinner Danish Kaneria, who broke the crucial sixth-wicket partnership between Dhoni and Laxman felt the match could tilt towards Pakistan. At the moment the match looks evenly balanced but India will have to bat in the last innings. And if we give a good total to India then it would be tough. I think a target of 290-300 will be tough for India to chase, he said. The wicket, Kaneria said, would play a vital role over the next three days. It is not breaking but the ball is keeping low. It wont be an easy pitch to play. Kaneria felt the turning point was getting Sachin Tendulkar run out. That was a great effort from Mohammed Yousuf. At that time we really got back into the match. All the fast bowlers were simply superb. Sohails (Tanveer) performance was also good as he picked two very important wickets of the Indian batting line-up (Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid). This will give him confidence in his future, said Kaneria.

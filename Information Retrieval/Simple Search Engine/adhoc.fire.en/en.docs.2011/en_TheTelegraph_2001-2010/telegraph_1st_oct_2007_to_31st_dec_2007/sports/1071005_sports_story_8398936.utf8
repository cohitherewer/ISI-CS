 DOUBLE DELIGHT
When Jacques Kallis made an unbeaten 100 in Karachi on Thursday, he became only the fourth South African batsman and 51st overall to score two centuries in a Test match. This was his 26th career hundred. The following is a peek into some of those with two centuries in the same match: When Kallis (155 amp; 100*) scored a century in each innings of the ongoing Test against Pakistan in Karachi, it was the 63rd time this feat had been achieved in Test history. He, however, became the 51st batsman to do so. The first batsman to achieve this feat was Australian Warren Bardsley, against England at The Oval way back in 1909. The last player to do so was Pakistans Mohammed Yousuf (102 amp; 124), against the West Indies also in Karachi last November. Indias Sunil Gavaskar and Australian Ricky Ponting have achieved this feat a record three times. Before Kallis, the other South African to have achieved the feat are  Alan Melville (189 amp; 104*, vs Eng in Nottingham in 1947); Bruce Mitchell (120 amp; 189, vs Eng at The Oval in 1947) and Gary Kirsten (102 amp; 133, vs India in Calcutta in 1996-97).

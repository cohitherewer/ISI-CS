Past winners include Tiger Woods, Nick Faldo, Greg Norman, Fred Couples, Ernie Els, Ian Woosnam and Retief Goosen. I am looking forward to playing the event, said Scott. I have heard so much about India and how golf is growing there but Ive never been there, so it will be exciting to be in Delhi. In 2004, the 27-year-old Scot became the youngest winner of the Players Championship on the US PGA Tour. This year, the Australian has had fine season with a second-place finish at the Mercedes-Benz Championship and a win at the Shell Houston Classic on the US Tour, giving him a total of 13 career victories. Poulter has won five European Tour titles since turning pro in 1994. Though he has not won anything this season, a second place in the British Masters and a number of solid performances on the US Tour has seen the 31-year-old rise to No. 29 in the world rankings. Montgomerie, on the other hand, has had a prolific career spanning 20 years. He has topped the European Tour Order of Merit a record eight times and won 40 tournaments. Former world No. 1 Vijai, having notched up over 50 tour victories around the world, now wants to fulfil yet another dream  of winning a title in India, his ancestral home. I would love to go and win the Johnnie Walker Classic, said the three-time major winner in a statement. It is a big event on a great golf course I like very much and I would like to go out there and show the Indian people what I can do. Hopefully I will pull it off. The former No.1 also hailed the growth of the Asian players on the worlds golfing stage and predicted an intense battle for silverware. (AGENCIES)

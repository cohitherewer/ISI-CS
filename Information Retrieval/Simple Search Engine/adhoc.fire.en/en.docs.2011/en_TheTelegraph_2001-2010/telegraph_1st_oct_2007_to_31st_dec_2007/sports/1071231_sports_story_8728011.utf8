 Sourav Ganguly down with high fever

 - Im feeling quite weak, says former captain 
LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
 Sourav Ganguly 
Melbourne: The in-form Sourav Ganguly, the only Indian batsman to score at least 40 in each innings of the disastrous first Test (his 100th), has been laid low with high fever. 
With the second Test, in Sydney, scheduled from Wednesday, the former Team India captains illness is a cause for much concern. 
Sourav, whod felt unwell while batting in the second innings on Saturday, developed fever soon after returning to the hotel (The Langham). 
He has a sore throat too. 
In fact, given the amount of cricket being played, players are bound to fall ill as theres no recovery time between matches. 
Looking pale, Sourav was being massaged by masseur Ramesh Kaka Mane on the floor of his room when one met him on Sunday. 
Im feeling quite weak... The fever subsides when I have the medicine, but shoots up again... The he- at was a bit too much yesterday... In India, one sweats, not in these parts, Sourav told The Telegraph. 
Getting up was an effort, all because of the fever-induced weakness. And, when Sourav did, it was to switch channels. 
(Daughter) Sana and the rest of us can take a break from her favourite Cartoon Network... For a change, lets watch some news, he said, settling on Sky, as wife Dona prepared to make something warm. 
Depending on how Sourav feels on Monday morning, a blood test could be done before the team leaves for Sydney at noon. 
Sourav, by the way, has finished behind South Africas Jacques Kallis in the top Test run-getters list for 2007  his full-fledged comeback year. 
It definitely feels good... Its a reward for the hard work Ive put in, Sourav remarked, smiling for the only time during our interaction. 
While Kallis finished with 1,210 runs (average of 86.43), Sourav totalled 1,106 (61.44).

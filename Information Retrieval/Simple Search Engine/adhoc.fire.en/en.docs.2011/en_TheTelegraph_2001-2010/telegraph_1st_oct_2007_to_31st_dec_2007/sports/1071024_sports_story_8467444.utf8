 Ricky dares Men in Blue 
 - DOWN UNDER, BIG BOYS BEGIN TO THUNDER  Ricky Ponting Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting has dared Team India to sustain their newly acquired aggression on the tour Down Under later this summer. Ponting  just back from the ill-tempered one-day series against Mahendra Singh Dhonis men  said the Indians played aggressively, quite out of character for them, and it would be interesting to see if they could sustain it in Australia. They made it pretty clear right from the start that they were going to fight fire with fire but for us we know thats generally not the way they play their cricket, Ponting was quoted as saying in an Australian newspaper. Weve got a lot of cricket against them in the next few months so it will be interesting to see just how long that aggression lasts, he said. After the home series against Pakistan, India arrive here for four Tests against the hosts, followed by a one-day tri-series also involving Sri Lanka. Leg-spinner Stuart MacGill parroted Pontings line and warned India that pretending to be aggressive could backfire. If you believe in yourself and youre convinced the way youre playing is the right way then it doesnt really matter how you carry yourself, he said. Its always a danger if youre trying to become someone youre not because youve got to concentrate on a whole lot of things out on the field, not just bowling. I try and keep it as simple as I can because bowling to (Sachin) Tendulkar is hard enough, said the spinner. He believes its easy to be aggressive on home turf with thousands of spectators throwing their weight behind the team but its a different proposition abroad. Its always easier when youve got a lot of support at home to ride your emotions. They only need to look around and know theyve got a billion countrymen supporting them. I think youll find it doesnt work for them if youre pretending. Ponting also had a word or two to say about Sreesanths run-ins with them. He generally does have a bit more aggression about him, a bit more body language than some of their other players do, he said. The Australian captain also said his side would have a clear edge over India in the forthcoming series. I think thats always been their greatest challenge when they come to Australia, bowling us out twice, he said. Theyll bring a couple of spinners. Harbhajan (Singh) and (Murali) Kartik have been bowling really well and (Anil) Kumble will be in their Test squad. Glenn McGrath also had an opinion on Sreesanth, the former fast bowler saying that the Indian needed to back up his aggression with performance. McGrath keenly followed the one-day series in India and said it was high time the youngster delivered the goods with the ball. At the end of the day youve got to be able to back it up. You can talk the talk but if you cant go out there and perform then youre not going to be around for very long, McGrath was quoted as saying in another Australian newspaper. He too doubts that Sreesanths on-field aggression was natural. Ive chatted with him a few times and it doesnt seem to be in his character. Hes trying to be aggressive and its a little bit unusual. McGrath warned the Indian team to expect hostility. The Indians really dont like the quicker or bouncier wickets so well wait and see what happens. Im sure theyll come and try to be aggressive but I think no one does it better than the Australian team. Coach Tim Nielsen said the new-found aggression from the Indian team backfired on the hosts as it only spurred on the Australians to outclass the opposition on the field. The Indians were trying to get under the Australians skin, but Nielsen felt the tactic actually helped Australia. The most pleasing thing was that we were able to cop it and keep performing whereas they werent able to do that and we won games because of it, Nielsen said. The coach said his team was prepared if the Indians carry on in the same vein during their tour. (PTI)

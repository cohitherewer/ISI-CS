 Becks season ends on a low
VICKI HODGES AMP; AGENCIES David Beckham in an aerial duel with Chris Armas of Chicago Fire on Sunday. Chicago Fire won 1-0 David Beckham has said he will keep himself active through the winter months after the Los Angeles Galaxys season came to a premature end following their 0-1 loss against Chicago Fire. The Galaxy needed to win to claim a Major League Soccer play-off but former Manchester United trainee John Thorrington scored a 93rd-minute goal for the hosts as they snatched the final play-off berth. The defeat ends the Galaxys season and leaves Beckham facing a long winter before the new campaign gets under way next April. LA Galaxy insist they will not allow him out on loan during the break. Beckhams hopes of competitive action now rest on earning a place in the England squad for their friendly with Austria and final Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia on Nov 21. Im a person who likes to train and work every day, said Beckham. Thats the way its been through my whole career for the last 15 years. Ive never had more than three weeks off in the summer. Im not going to know what to do with myself. Ill be keeping on training and keeping fit no matter what. Beckhams move to America has been disrupted by ankle and knee injuries that have limited the midfielder to a handful of games. Against Chicago Fire, Beckham was a 58th-minute substitute and had one chance to put the Galaxy ahead with a trademark free-kick with a minute remaining in normal time, but missed the target. Galaxy coach Frank Yallop was pleased with Beckhams performance under the circumstances. We spoke before the game, said Yallop. He looked tired before the end of this game and he only played 32 minutes. Its tough not being in a game for seven weeks. Once he got into the game, he made some good passes. His free kicks are always dangerous. A good off-season and he will be really good next season.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Windies 359 runs ahead 

Port Elizabeth: The West Indies took a commanding 359-run lead over South Africa on Friday despite a late collapse on the third day of the first Test. 
At the close, the West Indies were 146 for 8 in their second innings after dismissing South Africa for 195 with medium-pacer Dwayne Bravo taking four for 24. The West Indies made 408 in their first innings. AB de Villiers top-scored for South Africa with a gritty 59 in more than three hours in which he faced 127 balls and struck nine fours. 
South Africa slipped to 129 for 6 with the 16th ball of the days play, when Mark Boucher (20) hooked into the hands of Daren Powell at fine-leg to secure fast bowler Jerome Taylors third wicket. 
De Villiers and Paul Harris stood firm for 18.1 overs in a stand of 43. The partnership was ended when De Villiers was squared up by a delivery from Bravo which went on to uproot his off-stump.

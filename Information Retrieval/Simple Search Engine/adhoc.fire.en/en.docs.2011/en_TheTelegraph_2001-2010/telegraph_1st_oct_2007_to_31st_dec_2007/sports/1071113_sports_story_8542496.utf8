 Italian league faces ban after riots
Milan: Italian soccer could be suspended for a number of weeks under a government proposal on Monday after widespread fan violence was sparked by the shooting of a Lazio supporter by a police officer on Sunday. The Italian soccer federation (FIGC) was meeting later on Monday to decide what to do and could halt league action for the second time in a year because of hooliganism. I have asked the soccer authorities if there is the possibility of a strong gesture, in particular the suspension of the championships for the next few weeks, Sports Minister Giovanna Melandri said. Italys Gazzetta dello Sport website (www.gazzetta.it) said that the national anti-hooligan body had also proposed the banning of away supporters at all grounds. Riots hit Rome on Sunday, with fans attacking a police barracks as well as the Olympic Stadium and causing extensive damage to the headquarters of the Italian Olympic Committee next door. At least 40 police were hurt in Rome alone, officials said. A top-flight game between Atalanta and AC Milan in Bergamo was also abandoned after seven minutes when fans tried to break down a glass barrier keeping them from the pitch. Italy play in Scotland in a crunch Euro 2008 qualifier on Saturday, meaning there is no top-flight action next weekend, but lower league action could be curtailed sooner. The world champions would be in serious danger of missing next years finals in Austria and Switzerland if they lost in Glasgow.  (REUTERS)

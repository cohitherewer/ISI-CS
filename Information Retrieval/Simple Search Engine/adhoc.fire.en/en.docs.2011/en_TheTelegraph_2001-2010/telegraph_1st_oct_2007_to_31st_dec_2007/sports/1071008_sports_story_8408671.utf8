 Prasun, Gautam on AIFF radar
	 - Glorious Past revisited A STAFF REPORTER Gautam Sarkar tries an old trick or two as former India teammates (from left) Prasun Banerjee, Samaresh Chowdhury and Sudhir Karmakar watch during the inauguration of Hindustan Motors Football Academy in Uttarpara on Sunday. Picture by Gautam Bose Calcutta: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has offered Prasun Banerjee and Gautam Sarkar the job of spotting talents for its proposed academy. The process of setting up the academy is still at a nascent stage, but the former midfield greats have already been sounded out. The federation officials have informed me about the project and the way they want it to function. Ill be honoured to serve the country in whichever way I can, Sarkar, a former junior India coach, said on Sunday. Banerjee is also ready. We have hardly attended to talents in the grassroots in a scientific way. But if football is to develop, the process has to start from scratch, added the former national captain. The AIFF plans to set up its central academy in Gurgaon with four regional wings across the country. While Bangalore, Goa and New Delhi are tipped to host the zonal academies, the site for the East wing is yet to be finalised. The federation has already had a few recce missions in and around Calcutta, including Howrah and Barasat. Banerjee and Sarkar are expected to recommend talents for the East wing. The process has been set in motion following Fifa president Sepp Blatters visit to India early this year. The Asian Football Federation is providing financial assistance. India are doing well under Bob Houghton. But we must make our next generation ready so that the evolution process goes on uninterrupted, maintained Sarkar, who on Sunday took charge as chief coach of the newly formed Hindustan Motors Football Academy at Uttarpara, Hooghly. Hindustan Motors, the first Indian car company to start production in the country, will provide its own football ground, gymnasium and hospital facilities for 40 students between the age of 14 and 16. Sarkars former teammates  Samaresh Chowdhury, Sudhir Karmakar, Prasun Banerjee and Subrata Bhattacharya were present on the occasion. Training session has been scheduled four days a week, but well come up with other plans as time goes on, Sarkar said. Will he quit the job once the AIFF comes calling? No way, Im emotionally attached to it, pat came his reply.

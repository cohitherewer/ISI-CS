 Chelsea hammer City; United win
London: Manchester United stormed to the top of the Premier League on Saturday with a 4-1 thumping of Middlesbrough, while Chelsea stole the limelight with a 6-0 hammering of third-placed Manchester City. Carlos Tevez scored twice as United notched an eighth successive league victory and hit four goals in a match for the fourth time in a row. The champions could lose first place on Sunday when Arsenal  on a high after a 7-0 romp over Slavia Prague on Tuesday  travel to Liverpool looking for a 13th consecutive victory in all competitions. Didier Drogba bagged two goals against hapless City as Chelsea more than doubled their home goals tally this season in 90 scintillating minutes at Stamford Bridge. Andriy Shevchenko also got into the act after coming on as a substitute. After a poor start to the season and the traumatic parting of the ways with former coach Jose Mourinho, Chelsea are now back in the top four with Frank Lampard pulling the strings. Fulham were denied a first away victory of the season when Kenwyne Jones scored late for Sunderland in a 1-1 draw. Improving Reading beat Newcastle United 2-1, while Birmingham City twice came from behind to defeat Wigan Athletic 3-2 at home. Portsmouths Benjani Mwaruwari had a stoppage-time penalty saved in a 0-0 home draw with West Ham United. United included midfielder Owen Hargreaves in their starting line-up for only the fourth time since he joined from Bayern Munich and were in front after three minutes. Nani took possession in the Boro half, moved forward and ripped a 30-metre shot past Mark Schwarzer. Old Trafford was still buzzing when Jeremie Aliadiere headed Boro level minutes later, but a mistake from England midfielder Stewart Downing gifted Wayne Rooney a goal to put United back in front before half-time. A superb move between Rooney and Tevez resulted in the Argentine putting United 3-1 up in the 56th minute before Tevez struck again with a deflected shot. United play Arsenal next week. Manchester City fans have been pinching themselves after their best start in the top flight for more than 30 years, but Sven Goran Erikssons side was given a hiding by Chelsea. Lampard looked back to his best after toe and thigh injuries this season, laying on first-half goals for Michael Essien and Drogba. Chelsea, who never won by a six-goal margin under Mourinho in the league, went on the rampage after the break with Drogba, Joe Cole, Salomon Kalou and Shevchenko demolishing Citys defence. United have 26 points from 11 games, with Arsenal on 25 from nine. City remain third on 22 with Chelsea on 21.  (REUTERS)

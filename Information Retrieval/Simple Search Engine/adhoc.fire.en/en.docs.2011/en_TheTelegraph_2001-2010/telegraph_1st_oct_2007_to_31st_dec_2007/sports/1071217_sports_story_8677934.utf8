Calcutta: On a wicket that promises lots of runs  at least in the initial stages  one can expect the bowlers to toil when Bengal take on Uttar Pradesh in a Ranji Trophy Super League match at the Eden from Monday. 
Both teams want to assure three points first and then go for the kill. 
Its always ideal to win outright but we want to assure a first-inning lead UP captain Mohammed Kaif said on Sunday. 
His Bengal counterpart, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, had said that a day earlier. The match will be interesting as both sides have a lot of promising youngsters, Shukla said on Sunday. 
Bengal, who lost their last match against Orissa by six wickets, are still hopeful of making it to the last four. We can still reach the semi-finals, Shukla insisted, echoing Kaifs sentiments. The presence of Kaif, Suresh Raina, Ravikant Shukla, Piyush Chawla, Praveen Kumar and Sudeep Tyagi make UP appear a better side than the depleted hosts. 
Bengal will depend heavily on Manoj Tiwary and to some extent on Arindam Das to bat the opponents out of the match. Others such as Wriddhiman Saha, Anustup Majumdar, Soham Ghosh, Kamal Hasan Mondal have lacked consistency in recent matches. 
UP, though, will have their task cut out. Raina, who has 447 runs from four matches in his kitty with two centuries including a double (203), is slightly ahead of Tiwarys 395 with two centuries (including a double  203). Captain Kaif is not far behind with 334 runs, followed by Tanmay Srivastava, Ravikant and others who have also done pretty of late. 
Each team is expected to field three seamers. For UP, Tyagi is likely to share the new ball with Praveen while Mohammed Abid Khan will be the third quick. Tyagi has performed really well this season. He bagged 23 wickets in four matches. 
Bengal are expected to leave out Ashok Dinda and include off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri. Shib Shankar Paul is fit to play alongside last seasons highest wicket-taker Ranadeb Bose. Sourav Sarkar will be the third seamer. 
Now with lot of pressure to move forward, Bengal need a combined effort (batting and bowling) to overcome the UP hurdle and move up the table. Only Baroda have assured a place from group B with 17 points from four matches. Bengal and UP are on eight points each from four outings. 
Bengal coach Bharat Arun sought the opportunity to inspire the boys by advising them to enjoy the pressure. They will have to enjoy the pressure, only then the desired result is possible, Arun said.

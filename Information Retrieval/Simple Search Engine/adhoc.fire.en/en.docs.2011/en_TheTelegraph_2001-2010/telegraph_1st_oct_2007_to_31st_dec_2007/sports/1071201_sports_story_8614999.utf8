 Lions beat Jets in ICL opener
GAJINDER SINGHPanchkula: Daryl Tuffey took three wickets to help Chandigarh Lions beat Delhi Jets by eight runs in the inaugural Indian Cricket League (ICL) Twenty20 match on Friday. Electing to field, Maravan Attapatu-led Jets bundled out Chris Cairns-led Lions for 134. In reply, the Jets were restricted for 126 for six with Tuffey (three for 16) and Andrew Hall (two for 26) doing the maximum damage. Tuffey was adjudged the Man of the Match. The crowd erupted every time a boundary was struck. The cheerleaders, flown in from the UK, danced to foot-tapping music. Delhi Jets needed 34 runs from the last three overs after a late flourish from J.P. Yadav and S. Abbas Ali, but it was a crucial over from experienced former South Africa allrounder Andrew Hall that swung the match back in the Lions favour. It went down to the wire with the Jets needing 16 off the last over. Atapattu (29) stroked four crisp boundaries and looked in complete command before top-edging a Tuffey delivery to Reetinder Singh Sodhi at mid-off. Hall got rid of the dangerous Taufiq Umar in the very first over with an almost unplayable late swinging delivery for a duck. Mishra and Atapattu stitched a 28-run stand before Tuffey got into the act. The first of his three wickets came in the sixth over when Mishra was out caught behind by wicket-keeper Sarabjit Singh. Earlier, the Chandigarh Lions were bundled out for just 134 after they were cruising on 88 for two at one stage but a late resurgence from the Atapttu-led Jets triggered the Lions collapse. Ali Murtaza (3/16) and Abishek Sharma (3/16) were the pick of the bowlers for Jets  claiming five wickets within the space of 15 deliveries. JP Yadav (2/26) provided the initial breakthroughs  snapping the two New Zealanders in the Lions outfit Hamish Marshall (23) and Tuffey (0).

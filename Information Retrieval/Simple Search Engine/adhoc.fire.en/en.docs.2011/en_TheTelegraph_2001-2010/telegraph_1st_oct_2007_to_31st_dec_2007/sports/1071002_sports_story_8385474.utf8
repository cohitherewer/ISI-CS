 Kallis hits 118 n.o.
 - Pak pay for missed chances after getting a jolt before match  Jacques Kallis after reaching his century on Day I of the first Test as Shoaib Malik applauds in Karachi on Monday. (AFP) Karachi: Allrounder Jacques Kallis made Pakistan pay for dropping him twice by scoring a brilliant unbeaten century to help South Africa make a solid start to the first Test here on Monday. The 31-year-old scored an unbeaten 118 for his 25th Test hundred as South Africa reached 294 for three at close on the first day after winning the toss on a dry and well-prepared pitch at the National Stadium. Kallis, in the news for wrong reasons after quitting the vice-captaincy over his omission from the World Twenty20 squad last month, shared a third-wicket stand of 170 with a resolute Hashim Amla, who made 71. Kallis hit 15 boundaries during his 224-minute stay at the crease. He should have been out on 36 when he edged leg-spinner Danish Kaneria only for wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal to drop a regulation catch. Salman Butt then grassed a pull off Mohammed Hafeez when Kallis was on 61. Kalli, who took 91 deliveries to score fifty, reached his second half-century off just 56 balls, hitting 11 boundaries to reach his ton, his second against Pakistan. Amla hit six boundaries and a six during his 225-minute knock. He was also let off on one when Misbah-ul Haq spilled a catch off skipper Shoaib Malik. The lapses allowed Kallis and Amla to continue untroubled before paceman Mohammed Asif bowled Amla in the second over with the new ball. Earlier, South Africa were given a solid opening start of 87 by Herschelle Gibbs (54) and Graeme Smith (42). Gibbs, without a hundred for 37 innings, looked set for a big score as he drove and cut with confidence to reach his half-century in two hours 15 minutes, hitting seven boundaries. But he fell to a low catch in the slips by Hafeez off Umar Gul. Gibbs fell three short of reaching 6,000 Test runs. Pakistan had been forced to rely on the only two available seamer in Asif and Gul but they failed to achieve an early breakthrouh, forcing Malik to introduce Kaneria in the tenth over. Kaneria did turn the ball but it was batting allrounder Hafeez who claimed first wicket when he trapped Smith leg-before in his second over. Smith hit five boundaries in his 105-minue stay at the crease. The home team received a jolt before the start of the match when prolific batsman Mohammed Yousuf pulled out, citing lack of match practice and form. Pakistan included Faisal Iqbal in Yousufs place and gave a debut to left-arm spinner Abdul Rehman. South Africa preferred paceman Andre Nel over veteran allrounder Shaun Pollock after rookie paceman Morne Morkel failed to regain fitness following a leg injury.  Meanwhile, South Africa on Monday handed over the Test vice-captaincy to Ashwell Prince for the rest of the summer, while Justin Kemp was appointed Graeme Smiths deputy for the one-day series against Pakistan here this month. South Africas media manager Owen Smith said Prince would take over the post after it was left vacant by senior batsman Jacques Kallis, who resigned to protest his omission from the ICC World Twenty20 squad in South Africa. Prince will be vice-captain for the rest of the summer that includes series against New Zealand, the West Indies and a tour of India and Bangladesh until March-April 2008, Smith said.  (AFP)

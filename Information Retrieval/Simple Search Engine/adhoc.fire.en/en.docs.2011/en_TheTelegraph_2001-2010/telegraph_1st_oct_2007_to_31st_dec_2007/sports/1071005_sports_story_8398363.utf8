 Joy for Celtic, Marseille 
Milan: AC Milans season went from bad to worse on Wednesday after a last-minute goal by Scott McDonald condemned the holders to a 1-2 Champions League defeat at Celtic where goalkeeper Dida was hit on the face by a fan. Milan have made a poor start to their Serie A season but their fortunes took a dramatic turn in injury time when the supporter ran on to the pitch and hit the Brazilian. However, Milan do not want a replay or the points. We will not appeal. It is a decision that I have agreed to with the president (Silvio Berlusconi), Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani said. It is a decision we have taken because we are the European champions and must behave like that. Last seasons beaten finalists and 2005 winners Liverpool suffered a surprise 0-1 defeat at home to Marseille in group A, with Mathieu Valbuena netting a classy goal after 77 minutes. Goran Pandev scored a superb brace to cancel out Ruud van Nistelrooys two goals in Lazios 2-2 draw with Real Madrid. Ricardo Quaresma grabbed the winner deep into stoppage time as 2004 champions Porto won 1-0 at Besiktas. Werder Bremen, who battered Arminia Bielefeld 8-1 in the Bundesliga during the weekend, looked to be cruising at home before Olympiakos stormed back to win the group C clash 3-1. Germany did have a winner though with Jermaine Jones and Kevin Kuranyi scoring second-half goals to give Schalke a 2-0 win at Norways Rosenborg Trondheim. Benfica, beaten 1-2 at AC Milan two weeks ago, lost 0-1 at home to Ukraines Shakhtar Donetsk with Jadson grabbing the goal just before the interval in their group D match. Scottish champions Celtic are likely to face a Uefa probe after a fan got on the pitch and hit Dida, who gave chase before dramatically collapsing and being carried off on a stretcher. The Brazilian was struck by a flare in the Champions League quarter final second leg tie with Inter Milan in 2005. On that occasion the match was abandoned and handed to the Italians, who were 3-0 up on aggregate at the time. On Wednesday, Milan equalised through Kakas penalty after Stephen McManuss 62nd-minute opener before McDonalds dramatic late winner sparked the fans attack on Dida. Spanish champions Real took the lead in the ninth minute when Dutch striker Van Nistelrooy exploited some loose Lazio marking to divert compatriot Wesley Sneijders free-kick past 43-year-old keeper Marco Ballotta. Lazios Pandev levelled with a sweet left-footed volley before Van Nistlerooy struck again in the second half when he was released by Raul only for Pandev to score again with a perfectly-placed equaliser.

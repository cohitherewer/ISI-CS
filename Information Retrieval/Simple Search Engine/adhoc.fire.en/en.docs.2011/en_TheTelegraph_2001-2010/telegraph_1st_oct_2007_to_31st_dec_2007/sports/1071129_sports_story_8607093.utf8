 Question mark still over Malik, Shoaib
 - Pakistan pace spearhead discharged A STAFF REPORTER Shoaib Akhtar arrives at the team hotel after being discharged from hospital on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: A visibly worn-out and exhausted Shoaib Akhtar was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday evening. However, uncertainty over the fast bowler and captain Shoaib Maliks availability for the Eden Test remained on Wednesday. The second Test of the three-match series begins on Friday. Shoaib had been admitted to the hospital on Tuesday with viral fever and fatigue. He is much better... The fever has subsided. The infection is very much under control. The soreness in the throat has also gone. He had a long rest and did not come out of his cabin, said a hospital official. It was at 7 pm that the doctors took the decision to discharge him. The Pakistan spearhead left the hospital around 8 pm. The Pakistan team management is still hopeful, but it is highly unlikely that Shoaib will be in a position to play the Eden Test. His weakness is a matter of major concern. The physio faces a race against time to get Shoaib fit for the match. Shoaib is on medication. Hopefully he should be fit by tomorrow (Thursday), said manager Talat Ali. Asked about his availability for the second Test, Ali added: I cant say If he feels good tomorrow morning, he will definitely go to the ground We dont want to risk him in a five-day game. Captain Maliks sore ankle hasnt healed yet. He went to the Eden with a heavy strapping on Wednesday, but skipped practice. Malik, who sprained his ankle while playing football during the Kotla Test, will undergo a fitness test on Thursday along with Misbah-ul Haq. According to the scan report, Malik has a Grade 1 problem in his right ankle. This type of injury takes a bit of time to heal, Ali said. In case he fails to make it, Younis Khan will lead Pakistan. The good news was that Misbah and Salman Butt have recovered significantly and should be available. Misbah and Butt have recovered very well We are hopeful Ali said. Misbah had a virus while Butt was down with a sore throat. Butt practised with his teammates in the afternoon. Umar Gul, who missed the Delhi Test because of a back niggle, bowled at full throttle. Gul will have to play the lead pacers role if Shoaib fails to make the cut. Mohammed Sami, who had a forgettable match at the Kotla, had a day off.

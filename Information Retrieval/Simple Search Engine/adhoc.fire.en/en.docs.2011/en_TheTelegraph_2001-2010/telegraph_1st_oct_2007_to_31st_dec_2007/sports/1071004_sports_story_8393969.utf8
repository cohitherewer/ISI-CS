 Sania makes quarters
		Sania MirzaTokyo: Second seed Sania Mirza survived a scare from Australian Casey Dellacqua before beating her in a keenly-contested three-setter to make the quarter finals of $175,000 Japan Open on Wednesday. Sania came through 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 after a few nervous moments in her second-round match of the Tier III event. After splitting the first two sets, Sania and Dellacqua played out an engrossing decider in which the Indian ace came out trumps to advance to the last-eight. However, the world No. 29 Sania had to stave off stiff resistance from the 84th-ranked Australian in the final set. The 20-year-old Hyderabadi rallied from being two service breaks down  in the first and fifth game  to go 4-3 up with a couple of fiery aces. Dellacqua held her serve to make it 4-4 but lost the plot from there on and was broken in the 10th game as Sania clinched the contest after the Australian hit a forehand out. Sania said her experience of playing at the top helped her turn the tide in her favour in the tense battle. Its about making those points when it really counts. Probably she didnt make them the whole match, but I made them at 4-4 and I made them at 5-4. I think that counted at the end, she said. In the final set, I played much better than I did in the first couple of sets. I think whats important is that you come through, she added. Wimbledon champion Venus Williams also made quarters, drubbing fellow American Vania King 6-0, 6-4. Former world no. 1 Venus, who won the Korea Open title at the weekend, cooled off after a red-hot start but still had too much power for King, winning in just 66 minutes. It was top seed Venuss 17th victory in 19 matches since winning her sixth Grand Slam singles crown at Wimbledon and kept her on course for the womens season-closer in Madrid. In the mens event, top seed David Ferrer beat South African Wesley Moodie 7-6, 6-2 to reach the last 16. Ferrer, the mens top seed following the late withdrawal of world no. 1 Roger Federer, overcame a sluggish start to see off Moodie in 92 minutes. Im not thinking about Roger Federer  just of me, said the US Open semi-finalist Ferrer, yet to clinch his place at next months season-ending Tennis Masters Cup. Ferrer, lying sixth in the ATP Champions Race, takes on Vincent Spadea next after the American knocked out 14th-seeded Argentine Sergio Roitman with a 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 win. Former champion Lleyton Hewitt breezed past Slovenias Luka Gregorc 6-3, 6-3.  (AGENCIES)

 Jaffer rues bad shot
- Batting against Shoaib is always a challenge, says Team India opener
OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Teammates congratulate Sourav Ganguly for dismissing Misbah-ul Haq at the Kotla on Sunday. (Reuters) New Delhi: Indian opener Wasim Jaffer on Sunday said a victory in the first Test would provide India the required momentum. At 171 for three, India require another 32 runs on Monday to take a 1-0 lead in the three-Test series. In such a close series, a victory in the first Test would give an added momentum, Jaffer said. It would be a hard-fought win. The match was quite intense. The opener said the partnerships between him and Rahul Dravid and between Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly have placed India on an advantageous position. Pakistan bowled very well Especially Shoaib Akhtar. Batting against him is always a challenge. We planned to lay him and then go for runs. Jaffer, who top scored with 53 in the second innings so far, said he could have got more but for a bad shot. My shot selection was improper. Perhaps I should have hit it a little higher to evade the fielder. But Salman Butt took a fine catch. On Dinesh Karthiks failure to get runs in both innings, Jaffer said it is part of the game. The job of an opener is always difficult. Karthik has played some wonderful innings for India. To run him down would be unfair. Pakistan pace bowler Sohail Tanveer said he tried his best to get Sachin and Sourav but didnt receive any help from the pitch. I concentrated on containing the batsmen as much as possible. The target for India is low, Tanveer said. A target of around 300 would have been more competitive. However, they still have to score those 32 runs. We are not going to allow them to score it easily. Tanveer hoped Pakistan would hit back in Calcutta. It will be a new match. We will go all out.

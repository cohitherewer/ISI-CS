 Ric must be given enough leeway 
Stickwork Guxbux Singh 		Carvalho sent a strong message 
		 to Sandeep SinghThe news that Ric Charlesworth is going to be associated with Indian hockey is as cheering as the ongoing festive season. The plan, with government backing, to bring him in had been in place for quite some time. And finally he is coming as an adviser for both the men and womens hockey teams at a time when we are basking in a feel-good chak de atmosphere. Rics knowledge of the game, his experience and track record may just stir Indian hockey to more action. But all this will lead to zilch if he does not get the co-operation he needs, and from all quarters. We need the Australians expertise and he must be given enough leeway to share it in a proper and professional way. The worlds focus is on India at present since the FIH wants us to reclaim lost ground. Rics arrival is a timely step in that direction. However, I totally agree with Joaquim Carvalho in that Ric should not get involved with the senior team rightaway. The Asia Cup triumph under Joaquim is a strong indication that we are on the right track to qualify for the Olympics, which is our main objective right now. Of course, the coach can ask the Australian great for advice and use it if it suits the team but I feel Joaquim, as things stand now, should be allowed to use his own vision to prepare his wards for the upcoming challenges. One such step was the exclusion of Sandeep Singh from the camp for Januarys Olympic qualifiers in Chile. The move may have created a bit of a flutter, but for Joaquim a players dedication is fundamental. Sandeep may be technically strong, he may be creating news in the German league with some exceptional goals, but he failed to earn the coachs support because of his lack of seriousness during the camp. However great a player you are, you should never behave like a prima donna or someone too important to be part of a unit. By showing Sandeep the door, Joaquim has sent a strong message about the value and pride of wearing the national jersey. We have been lucky to get a comparatively easy draw in Chile. We have mainly Great Britain and Egypt to negotiate in our bid to qualify for the Beijing Games. What appeared nearly impossible a few months ago now seems well within our reach.  Since 1928 we have never missed the Olympics bus and Joaquims boys have the resources and determination to confirm their tickets to Beijing. Across the border, however, its a different story. Pakistan do not have to worry about qualifying for the Olympics, but their federation has taken strong exception to their recent spate of poor performances. For a third time in little over a year, they have forced veterans Sohail Abbas (record goal scorer) and Wasim Ahmed (former captain) out of retirement. These two have been joined by two more veterans, Dilawar Hussain and Gazznafar Ali, in the national camp. Theres no denying that the reshuffle was compounded by Pakistans disastrous show in the Asia Cup, but what is worse is that the young guns have failed to convince the management that they are good enough to replace the oldies. The quicker that happens, the better for hockey in the sub-continent as a whole.

 Hamilton on the road to record riches
Kevin Garside Lewis Hamilton after winning the Japanese Grand Prix The calculators are in meltdown. Lewis Hamiltons value to McLaren is taking the guesstimators to the limits of the imagination. According to some, the world champion-elect is about to bank upwards of 250m over the next five years. Europes biggest-selling daily ran a piece last week claiming that an improved offer from McLaren was awaiting Hamiltons signature. The paper valued the five-year deal at a relatively modest 50 million, excluding commercial spin-offs. Hamilton Inc is in the hands of Anthony Hamilton, Lewiss father. Though new to the sporting superstar business, Hamilton Sr is a quick learner. He has assembled a small team of lawyers and accountants to help run the show. The contract signed a year ago is believed to have been set at a conservative 350,000 a year. The sting in the tail came with bonuses. What few beyond the Hamiltons recognised was the potential to score heavily by finishing on the podium. Hamilton Sr essentially backed his son to deliver and so weighed the contract heavily on the bonus side, calculating that his employers believed the figures to be beyond reach. Hamilton shot through the seven-figure barrier long ago. Back-to-back victories in Canada and the US sparked a house hunt in Switzerland, the tax haven beloved of Formula One drivers, which requires minimum annual earnings of 850,000 as a condition of entry for foreign nationals. The standard contract term for F1 drivers is 24 months, with options of at least one year. This is the period in which the successful negotiate upwards and those that fail are shown the door. Witness the exit of Ralf Schumacher from Toyota at the seasons end. Hamilton can name his price. The big potatoes are to be earned outside his McLaren deal, from sponsorship endorsements. Once the title is sealed, everything changes. Hamilton Sr said: We are in a long-term relationship with McLaren. At the moment, we have got no plans to make any escape because they are a good, honest team full of integrity and we are happy here. It is the same contract that we signed when we signed up for this job. But everything changes after a while. We wont be asking for anything. We will be waiting as normal to be given things. But I am sure we wont have to wait long. A matter of days, probably. Under the present arrangement, McLaren effectively own Hamiltons commercial rights. The new deal that a world championship would inevitably bring would give Hamilton greater licence to milk his own image. The template was laid by Michael Schumacher, who became the richest driver in the history of the sport through control of his own commercial rights. By the close of his career, Schumacher was earning an estimated 60 million a year, only half of which was paid by Ferrari. The F1 record book is not the only ledger likely to require adjustment on Sunday. Victory in the world championship seems certain to propel Hamilton on the road to record riches, too.

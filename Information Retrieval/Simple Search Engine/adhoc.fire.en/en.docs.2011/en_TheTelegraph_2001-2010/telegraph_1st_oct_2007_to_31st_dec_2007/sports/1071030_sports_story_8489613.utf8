 Clarke should succeed me: Ponting
 Michael Clarke Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting has backed Michael Clarke as his obvious successor. Ponting, who will be 33 next month, wants to continue at least till the next World Cup to be held in the sub-continent and he is aware of the fact that many senior members of the side may retire in the near future. I am not going to be around forever, Ponting was quoted as saying in a local newspaper. Gilly is not going to be around forever. We have to start building the next generation of leaders around the team and (Clarke) is the obvious choice. People have been talking him up as the next skipper and all that sort of stuff. We all hope that is the case and he keeps improving. If he does, he will be one of the leading players in the world, Ponting said. Former Australia coach John Buchanan said Clarkes development as a captain would get a boost if he was made the skipper of New South Wales side. But Ponting said the NSW captaincy was not the only thing which would help Clarke grow as a leader.  (PTI)

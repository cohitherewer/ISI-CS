 Ferguson loses it 
CLIVE WHITE Alex Ferguson is sent to the stands by the referee on Saturday. (AP) Sir Alex Ferguson was banished to the stands at the Reebok Stadium for the second half of Saturdays Premier League match against Bolton Wanderers for telling referee Mark Clattenburg what he thought of him. The Manchester United manager then had to endure a frustrating 45 minutes watching his side slip to only their second league defeat of the season against a team who were third from bottom at the start of the day (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). It meant that the champions lost ground to rivals Arsenal, who have now moved three points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand. As for Bolton, their first win since August 25, secured for them by Nicolas Anelka in the 11th minute, saw them move out of the bottom three. It was the first time since 1978 that Bolton had beaten their local rivals at home. Ferguson could now find himself in trouble with the Football Association, not so much for his finger-wagging at the referee whom he followed down the tunnel at half-time but for what he said afterwards. I told him exactly what I thought and he didnt like it, Ferguson said. Some referees dont like the truth. I just told him how bad I thought he was in the first half and the game was becoming a shambles. We should have got much more protection from the referee, but we didnt get that. It was a battle. Ferguson felt his team should have been given more protection, in particular his left-back Patrice Evra. Yet Evra, in fact, was fortunate not to be sent off himself for flicking out a foot off the ball in Kevin Daviess direction. The two players were at loggerheads throughout the first half. I dont know whether they targeted him but he seemed to be involved in everything, Ferguson said of Evra. Poor soul, he got some terrible tackles on him today. I dont know whether it was part of the plan  I could think that was the reason  but he seemed to be involved in a lot of the tackles that were made. Fortunately in the second half they cooled down I think. They defended very deeply in the second half. We had a lot of possession without really making any chances. I cant say we deserved to win the game because we didnt make enough chances to win it, but we did have the majority of the possession. We just couldnt get the openings we needed.

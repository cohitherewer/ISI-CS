				 																Fundamental mistake				 																																																				Sir  The views expressed by Ashok Mitra in his article, Fundamental Judgments (Oct 1), are hasty and injudicious. All his postulations rest on the erroneous notion that the non-adherence to a Fundamental Duty would entail punishment. He infers from this flawed belief that the Allahabad high court judge, who declared that it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to observe the tenets of the Bhagvad Gita, is a dangerous person and needs to be removed from the seat of judicial authority. Mitra then casts aspersions on the government because it did not have the will to carry out his advice. For the sake of the readers who were misled by Mitras half-baked knowledge of the Constitution, it needs to be stated that while Fundamental Rights are legally enforceable, the Fundamental Duties are not. The citizenry cannot be compelled to perform the Fundamental Duties. As such, the judges comment was innocuous and can be accepted or rejected by an Indian as he thinks fit. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Pranay Chaturvedi, Howrah 

				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitra has described the Bhagvat Gita as a wretched Hindu holy book. Since I am not a scholar of English, I looked up the dictionary and found that the word, wretched, conveys the sense of living in a miserable, pitiful or desolate state. I am not sure which of these meanings truly describe the Bhagvad Gita. It is entirely possible that since the content and teachings of the Bhagvad Gita are beyond the comprehension of most men, Mitra found the book wretched. 				 																																																				Although the Bhagvat Gita does not require a certificate of greatness from Mitra and his ilk, it certainly does not deserve to be called wretched. Mitra might be trying to display his secular credentials by making such a comment. But could he have ascribed a similar adjective to the Quran or the Bible and got away with it? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Sanjaya Sharma, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is comments like that of the judge of the of the Allahabad high court that stoke up communal passions and threaten Indias secular fabric. The judge might have faith in the sanctity of the Bhagvad Gita but what right has he to impose his belief on others? Ashok Mitra deserves praise for making a pointed exposition of the judges folly in his article.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soma Datta, Siliguri

				 																																																				Sir  The judge of the Allahabad high court has not done the wise thing by exhorting citizens of India to follow the precepts of the Bhagvad Gita. But he has not committed a crime by expressing his views. Very few books can match the philosophical content of the Gita. As such, one is likely to learn a lot by leafing through the Gita. Ashok Mitra should not have a problem with the judges remark simply because the Gita happens to be a religious text. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Loose tongue				 																																																				Sir  The remarks made by the Pakistan captain, Shoaib Malik, after his team lost the Twenty20 World Cup final against India were baffling, to say the least (Pak captain puts his bat in mouth; Apology sparks row, Sept 26). What did he mean by apologizing to Muslims all over the world for the defeat? Malik might be a Muslim representing a Muslim country, but surely he knows that the game of cricket has no religious colour. Besides, he should be aware that not all Muslims in the world are supporters of Pakistan. The Pakistan cricket board will be well advised to impart training to its players on how to speak in public. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kazi Galib Ahmed, Asansol

				 																																																				Sir  Shoaib Malik should be told that Indian Muslims, who outnumber Pakistani Muslims, celebrated Indias victory along with their countrymen from other faiths. It is time that someone reminded the Pakistan players realize that they are not the spokespersons of the entire Muslim world.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C. De Bakshi, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  While apologizing to his Muslim brethren around the world for failing to win the trophy, did Shoaib Malik forget about Indian players such as Irfan Pathan and his brother, Yusuf Pathan? Surely these two Indian Muslims, like several others, were not feeling sorry for the Pakistan side which lost the finals. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avijit Banerjee, Melbourne, Australia

				 																																																				Sir  One should not be too agitated by Shoaib Maliks comments. It should be remembered that Malik was speaking as the captain of a Pakistan team that had lost to India. Therefore, it was natural for Malik to sound emotional. One must also remember that people often recall spiritual tethers like god and religion in times of distress. As such, Maliks comment is easily excusable as the spontaneous remark of an upset man.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ravindra Kumar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I can think of two reasons for Shoaib Maliks unfortunate comments. Firstly, by underlining his Muslim identity, Malik might have been trying to appease his fans back home. It is also possible that since Maliks English is poor, he might have made a mistake while expressing himself in an alien tongue. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

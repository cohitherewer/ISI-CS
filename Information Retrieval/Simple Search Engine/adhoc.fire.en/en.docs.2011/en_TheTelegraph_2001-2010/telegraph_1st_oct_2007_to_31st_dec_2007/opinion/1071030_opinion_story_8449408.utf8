							 																						HOME, AND NOT JUST FOR THE HOLIDAYS						OTHER VOICE With more Indians heading back from the Gulf, the Arabian dream is now just a myth.																														I am more than satisfied with my decision to come back to India, said Rashed, an IT engineer. In spite of the IT boom in India, he had opted to come to Saudi Arabia in 2005. Not happy with the environment and the stunted growth opportunities in that market, he immediately returned, disappointing his family members. When he got back to India, his salary was Rs 65,000 per month. After two years, it has shot up to over Rs 100,000. The incomes of his colleagues in Saudi Arabia have hardly increased by 12 per cent. Had he stayed in the Gulf, his salary would now have been 6,600 riyal, or Rs 71,000. In India, he was offered a loan by one of the local banks with which he bought a luxury flat in a prestigious location, with an annual appreciation of 25 per cent. 																														According to the seventh annual Asia-Pacific Salary increase in 2007 survey by Hewitt Associate, India offered the highest salary hike in Asia. Another survey carried out by the Dubai-based GulfTalent. com reveals that at least six per cent foreign nationals living in the Gulf will leave and return to their home countries for growing employment opportunities, especially to countries like India .																														Indians form the second largest expatriate community in Saudi Arabia. Many Indians working in this oil-rich kingdom have made good savings and enhanced their status within their communities. The recent incident of an agent duping people in Hyderabad with the lure of a job in Saudi Arabia, speaks volumes for the dreams many youths still harbour about working in this region.																														But most are not aware of the hard facts. The average Indian is finding it difficult to sustain the attractiveness of the Gulf market. The prices of essential commodities and services have increased by 20-25 per cent.																														On the other side of the fence, the booming Indian market is offering opportunities like never before. Property rates are rising and foreign investments is flowing in, especially to the major cities and surrounding areas. 																														In spite of the double rate of inflation, the cost of living in India is less than half of Saudi Arabia. If we analyse the rents in an Indian city other than the metros, a two-bedroom flat is available for rent at an equivalent of 500 riyal per month, compared to 1,000 riyal in Saudi Arabia. Locally produced vegetables and fruits are available at 1/8th to 1/4th of the cost of the same in Saudi. This list can go on. School fees in India are less by almost 60-70 per cent. A person can save at least 50-60 per cent on monthly expenses here.																														The conversion rate of riyal to rupee has reduced from 0.0802 in the middle of 2006 to 0.0932 in September, 2007. This reduction in rates has brought down the earnings of Indians by 15 per cent. If we analyse a persons earning, someone earning 5,000 riyal would be able to make a saving of 2,500 riyal prior to mid 2006. Today, he can only save between 250-500 riyal. On a similar salary back in India, the same person will be able to increase his savings by more than twice the amount. 																														In the coming days, the dollar may come under more pressure. The salary levels in India will increase further. This will give the expatriates in Saudi Arabia an opportunity to ponder over their future plans, and think of going back to India and starting afresh.																														It is high time that Saudi Arabian employers take a serious look at the state of affairs. More thought must be spent on the erosion of the dollar, inflation and growing economic prosperity in the home countries. Needless to say, all this will mean increasing the salary levels considerably. SHUJAATH AHMED KHAN

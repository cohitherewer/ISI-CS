							 																						SMELL OF EARTH AND SWEAT Mohua Mitra											 			 Music																														Bengals folk tradition has a distinctive style and a lot of variety. The main streams of this tradition are baul, bhatiali, and sari. Baul songs have a high spiritual content and are sung by wandering minstrels of the Sahajiya sect. Seeped in mystic philosophy, the songs are composed during moments of divine inspiration, which is usually accompanied by ecstatic dance. The lilting melody is simple and the tempo quick. 																														Bhatiali is essentially a song of rivers which open into a wide, uninterrupted vista. The measure is often slow, languid and even melancholic. The cheerful and chirpy sari is the boatmens song, rendered with a lot of gusto to the accompaniment of vigorous rhythmic strokes of the oar as the boat glides along the river. It is usually sung in chorus. 																														Ma-dal  a performing group whose members are essentially women (picture)  has assumed the task of unearthing the original roots of Bengals folk music and of bringing the vigour and freshness of baul, jhumur, santhali folk songs, jhanpan (songs of the snake charmers), bhatiali and bhaoaia to the city audience. Authenticity is the keyword here. And Ma-dal (a pun on the prefix of the name of a drum  signifying that mothers have taken it upon themselves to carry the folk traditions forward) made a unique effort to bring together different strains of Bengals folk music and a variety of artistes through its presentation of Matir Surey Surey at Rabindra Sadan on October 9. From the dhamai of Srihatta to the music of Chittagong to the lilting compositions of the naoriyas (boatmen) and folk singers from the interiors of Assams Goalpara, the richness of variety was evident. 																														Alaka Pandey from Assam demands special mention for Hastir Kanya and Baitha Maro. Pandeys tunes and wide range were impressive. Tapan Roys extensive research was evident in his choice of songs. There were compositions of Lalan Faqir, Hasan Raja of Sylhet and Jalaluddin from Mymensingh. The yodels came naturally. Roys his timbre brought out the earthiness of the songs. The baul strains of Sonar moyna gharey thuia were highlighted with an excellent mandolin support. 																														A group of Bangladeshi students signed off the programme with some soulful music. A few of the solo numbers were rendered with finesse. The spirited programme was a sincere effort to bring out the beauty of a land and its music.

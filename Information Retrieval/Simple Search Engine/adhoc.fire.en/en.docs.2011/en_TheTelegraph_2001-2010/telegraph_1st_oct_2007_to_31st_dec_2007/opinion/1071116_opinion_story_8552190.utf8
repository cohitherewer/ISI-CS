							 																						DIFFICULT GAMES																														The United Nations was not created in order to resolve ethnic or other armed conflicts. Its successes in such missions, whether in Bosnia or Chechnya, have only been partial. But in Nepal, the UN mission is caught in the vortex of the countrys domestic politics. If Nepals interim cabinet has denied a wider role for the UN mission, it has nothing to do with the missions record in resolving the Maoist conflict there. Given the devious roles that the former rebels and other politicians play in Kathmandu, there is little to complain about the performance of the UN mission chief, Ian Martin. The missions mandate to manage the arms of both the Maoists and the Nepal Army has often seemed to be too narrow to be truly effective. But its other job of supervising the Constituent Assembly elections has been made increasingly difficult by the Maoists themselves. They have made the elections uncertain by sticking to their unrealistic demands that these be held on the basis of proportional representation and that the country be declared a republic before the polls. 																														Unfortunately, the prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, is in no position to ignore or reject the Maoist blackmail. His decision not to widen the UN missions role is yet another proof that he has succumbed to such blackmail. The allegation about the missions  and Indias  involvement in some developments in the Terai is nothing but an excuse to keep the area out of reach for the mission. Yet, the ethnic flare-up there is ominous for both the future of Nepals democratic politics and its social harmony. The Maoists may have their own designs for exploiting the ethnic unrest in the Terai. The area has been used by them as a conduit for smuggling arms into Nepal and also for reaching these to rebel groups in India. The area has the longest border between Nepal and India. Ethnic violence on the Nepalese side of the border has its impact across it. The Indian origin of large numbers of the Nepalese people in the Terai makes the ethnic issue even more complicated. New Delhi cannot therefore leave the field open to the Maoists games. For Mr Koirala, the best strategy to defeat such ploys is to go ahead with the polls. The earlier Nepal returns to democracy, the safer it would be from the Maoists.

							 																						SHARE CRACKER																														There is only one word to describe the sentiment when the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index crossed the 20,000 mark: euphoria. Since the beginning of the year, the stock market has gone up by over 40 per cent; well over 30 per cent of that rise occurred in just the last nine weeks. Have Indian stocks and companies become so valuable? It may be argued that value lies in the eye of the holder; however, there is general agreement that corporate performance  the fundamentals  does not appear to justify the benchmark indexs meteoric rise. Take the case of Reliance Industries, the one stock that has contributed more to the rise of the Sensex than any other. In a recent report, ICICI Securities, or Isec, broke down the share price of the company  Rs 2,200  into each of the three businesses: refining (Rs 550), petrochemicals (Rs 750) and exploration and production (Rs 900). The first two are the companys bread and butter; the last has not generated a rupee of revenue, yet its value, based on stock price, is Rs 125,000 crore or over $30 billion. 																														From the fourth quarter of 2006-07, growth in corporate earnings and sales has been declining. Researchers at securities firms see no change in this trend for the next two quarters of 2007-08 either. Take out earnings that are generated from activities other than the core business, and corporate performance rests on rather shaky foundations. But this has made no difference to overseas investors, who have been flooding Indias financial system and stock markets with billions of dollars. True, it is not just India; other emerging markets  Brazil, Russia and China that together with India make up the BRICs  have also grown at the same pace. Most emerging markets are trading at premiums to developed country markets. Excluding energy and materials, and using expected earnings estimates, emerging markets are trading at a 24 per cent premium to developed markets. Led by the BRICs, an asset bubble seems to be forming. John Kenneth Galbraith had observed that euphoric episodes are protected and sustained by the will of those who are involved in order to justify the circumstances that are making them rich. And they are equally protected by the will to ignore, exorcize or condemn those who express doubts, such as the Reserve Bank of India and some finance ministry officials. They have been accused of having inadequate imagination and of lacking the ability to grasp the new and rewarding circumstances that sustain and secure increases in values. They would do well to remember the four most dangerous words in investing: Its different this time.

 Letters to Editor
				 																Gods own country?				 																																																				Sir  Two nomadic women were stripped and beaten by a crowd in a Kerala town on charges of petty theft (Crowd disrobes pregnant thief, Oct 10). One of the victims was pregnant and this horrific incident took place in a state that prides itself for its high literacy rate. What is equally shocking is the fact that the complainant was allowed to leave after she failed to find the ornament. The rising incidents of instant justice by unruly mobs are certainly a cause for worry. It seems that even a crowd can get away with murder in India.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Hit and run				 																																																				Sir  Recently an autorickshaw driver slapped a student when she protested against his slow driving (Slapped by autodriver, Sep 21). This is by no means an isolated incident. Instances of such roguish behaviour on the part of bus and auto drivers have become a dime a dozen in Calcutta. This makes one wonder whether we live in a civilized society or not. Although the problem has reached alarming proportions, the authorities are yet to suggest corrective measures. It is a well-known fact that political parties offer tacit support to transport unions. This has given the union members the licence to flout rules and misbehave with citizens. Worse, the police often turn a blind eye to the plight of the people who have to put up with abusive drivers. The media has reported that the chief minister has asked the police to crack down on rogue drivers. But can the police force be trusted to follow the orders? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph frequently carries reports of errant drivers causing grievous injury to pedestrians and passengers. Admittedly, on most occasions, it is the driver who is at fault. However, the fact that passengers are also sometimes responsible for mishaps cannot be ignored altogether. Recently, an auto driver was arrested for assaulting a passenger who had requested him to drive faster. I think that the driver cannot be faulted, at least on this occasion. If the passenger, Chitrita Dutta, was worried about missing her train, she should have left her house earlier so that she could reach her destination on time. What was said between Dutta and the driver is not known, but it must be borne in mind that circumstances can sometimes force civilized people into behaving abominably with others. 				 																																																				What do we expect from public transport drivers anyway? If they drive fast, they are rebuked or penalized for speeding. If they are slow, passengers complain that they are running late for work. It must be hard life for drivers, who are often forced to obey the whims of the people they ferry. 				 																																																				This is not to say that all auto drivers, bus conductors or hawkers behave nicely with passengers. The problem of abusive drivers cannot entirely be solved because these people happen to be members of some political party or the other. As a result, no minister can dare to take action against them for the fear of losing precious votes. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  As a motorist who drives on Calcuttas roads, I must confess that bus drivers in the city have remarkable driving skills. Driving in Calcutta is not a pleasurable experience. On the contrary, it is a risky proposition. The root cause of most accidents is careless pedestrians who have little regard for their personal safety. It is the prerogative of the government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to see that footpaths are cleared of encroachers and are fit for walking. There is no use blaming drivers when bad roads and careless pedestrians cause most accidents.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raj Mohan Jolly, Calcutta

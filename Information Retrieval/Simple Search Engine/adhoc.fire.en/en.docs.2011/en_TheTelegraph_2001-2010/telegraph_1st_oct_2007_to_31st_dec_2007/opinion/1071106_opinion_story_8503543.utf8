 Letters to Editor
				 																Politics of idling				 																																																				Sir  The letter by Satarupa Chaudhuri, (Open letter to bandh-bound Mamata; If you have to protest please do so sensibly, Oct 31) speaks the mind of peace-loving Calcuttans. She has voiced what many feel but are afraid to put forward in terms as bold as hers. As pointed out by Chaudhuri, daily-wage earners suffer the most on any bandh-day, yet they cannot protest as they live in fear of being harassed by partymen.				 																																																				Those who profess to work in the interests of the people cannot ignore the fact that many of the same people have to go hungry on the days of bandh. Mamata Banerjee should also know that by calling bandhs, she is only hindering West Bengals progress towards industrialization. She should do some serious thinking for the future of the state she belongs to before she calls the next bandh. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
F.S. Rozario, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I am in agreement with the points raised by Satarupa Chaudhuri. Have the issues on which Banerjee called the bandh last Wednesday been solved after the state was paralyzed for the day? Can she assure us that there will be no more firing in Nandigram after this? If Banerjee had tackled the various problems plaguing West Bengal sensibly, then by this time, some solutions could have been arrived at. 				 																																																				However, Banerjee has always preferred to avoid the rational way of handling matters. Perhaps she does not care for the welfare of the state as much as she covets the position of the chief minister of West Bengal. Banerjee had better know that most of us shudder to imagine her in that post. She may have got a section of the people on her side but most know better than to be taken in by her histrionics.				 																																																				I actively opposed the bandh called by Banerjee by attending office. Although the streets were emptier than usual, with only a few buses running, I saw people braving the circumstances to go to work as on a normal day. I believe that those who did not venture outside their homes probably did so to avoid being harassed by the Trinamul cadre.

				 																																																				Sir  I am inspired by Satarupa Chaudhuri, who aired every Indians frustration with politicians like Mamata Banerjee. She will motivate others to come forward with their grievances. The Telegraph also deserves praise for giving Chaudhuri a forum. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vandhana Bhaskaran, Hyderabad

				 																																																				Sir  It was not fair of Satarupa Chaudhuri to address her letter exclusively to Mamata Banerjee. Had she or The Telegraph been impartial, then there would have been letters to the leftist leaders who have called, and continue to call, similar bandhs in the state. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Mamata Banerjee called the bandh on October 31 reportedly because she could not sit and watch innocent people being killed by hooligans in Nandigram. So she deployed some more hooligans to stop responsible citizens from going to work. Her way of functioning is unparalleled even in the chaotic political context of India. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pratik Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The open letter to Mamata Banerjee did not deserve a place on the front page of The Telegraph. Both the form  bad English, repeated words and phrases, disjunction in thought  and the content of the letter were of poor quality. 				 																																																				As for the content, strikes are a legitimate weapon of protest worldwide. In some countries they are illegal, but at times the fact that I am defying law itself becomes a form of protest. On the issue of Nandigram, which was Banerjees peg for calling the bandh, it must be said that when supporters of the Trinamul Congress are killed by CPI(M) goons, the Trinamul leader has no option but to go for a bandh. Only with extreme measures like bandhs can one make oneself heard in this state. And, if one is opposed to bandhs, then he should oppose all bandhs  and certainly not support strikes by leftist outfits. 				 																																																				Chaudhuri sympathizes with the daily wage-earners who go without food on bandh days. But does she think of the below-par wages they earn everyday? Is not the ruling party responsible for fixing a minimum wage for them so that they do not have to go hungry? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur 

				 																																																				Sir  I am no longer directly involved in the life of Calcutta. But I cannot help feeling bad for my friends and relatives there who are probably as disturbed by frequent bandhs as Satarupa Chaudhuri is.				 																																																				The work culture in the United States of America, where I live now, stems from the belief that constructive confrontation and diplomacy will help resolve any chronic problem. Such convictions seem to be unheard of in West Bengal. The politics practised in Bengal is destructive, rather than constructive. Most of Chaudhuris accusations against Mamata Banerjee would be applicable to the leaders of the Left as well. If West Bengal is to develop, then a work ethic that looks kindly at frequent closures must be replaced by a progressive one. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amitava Bhaduri, Santa Clara, US 

				 																																																				Sir  Satarupa Chaudhuris views cannot be taken to represent that of the people of West Bengal. She stands for the urban, educated, salaried class who think it is fashionable to shout at every move from the Opposition while keeping mum about the atrocities of the ruling party in the state. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

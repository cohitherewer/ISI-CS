							 																						PERFECT STAGE FOR SUN AND SHADE Sreyashi Dastidar											 			 Music																														Rashmi Welfare Society and Nritya Mandir brought together Rabindrasangeet singer Rahul Mitra (picture) and poet Joy Goswami at Rabindra Sadan on October 29. Rabindrasangeet has unfairly been associated with drab, bare stage spaces, with a raised platform for the singer and accompanists to sit, and perhaps a carelessly-hung banner bearing the organizers name in the background. Rahul Mitras performances have always been characterized by innovative and aesthetic stage dcor. This time the backdrop was a framed tapestry with dhakai threadwork. For Joy Goswamis reading of Ghasphuler Kobi, the stage became a drawing room, with oil paintings on the wall and reading lamps.																														Mitras half of the show, titled Banshi tomay, expectedly comprised songs of the season  that is autumn (sharat). Some, like Ami chahitey eshechhi shudhu ek-khani mala, Gaye amar pulak laage and Tobu money rekho were picked from outside the Prakriti parjay, making for a well-thought-out selection. Kar banshi nishibhorey was sung free of the tritaal rhythmic structure, which allowed Mitra to push up the tempo while singing the rather long phrase of aruno-kirano-kolika. He was perhaps most at ease with Hridaye chhile jege and Amar raat pohalo. 																														Mitras efforts were clearly to remain within the limits of the notation. It essentially meant that he did not pepper his songs with his own little embellishments and vocal acrobatics, though a few phrases with compound notes came out a bit flat (the longer balo in Tomra ja balo tai balo, and bajlo dhwani in Amar raat pohalo). In songs like Ogo ke jay banshori bajaye and Amar nayan-bhulano ele, Mitras vocal discomfort was palpable, and this may have been why he seemed fussy about the particulars of amplification. Surajit Ray on the esraj, Raju on the flute and Swapan Adhikari on the tabla and srikhol provided excellent accompaniment.

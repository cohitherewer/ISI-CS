							 																						PENGUINS TO THE RESCUE
 Dhiraj Nayyar
																					The Patagonian province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, is famous for its penguins, and now for the Kirchners. Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner recently succeeded her husband, Nestor, as the first elected woman president of Argentina well before Hillary Clinton, with whom she is often compared, may become the first female president of the US. Unlike Hillary, however, Cristina Kirchner was a recognized face in Buenos Aires (as a senator from Santa Cruz) much before her husband (then the little-known governor of remote Santa Cruz) became president in 2003.
																					Yet, she owes her smooth ascent to the presidency to Nestor Kirchner, and his impressive performance as president over the last four years. Cristina Kirchner was a close policy advisor as Nestor Kirchner restructured Argentinas devastated economy after three years of severe crisis. In fact, Los Pinguinos (the penguins), as the fellow travellers of the Kirchners are affectionately known (Cristina is La Pinguina), have risen to national prominence on the back of their popular economic policy.
																					Nestor Kirchner became president in 2003 in the aftermath of the economic crisis. Argentina had defaulted on its international debts, which amounted to some $180 billion. Unemployment was around 25 per cent and poverty was high. The International Monetary Fund, with its neo-liberal prescriptions, was partly responsible for this. Following its advice during the crisis would have meant further hardship for Argentinians.
																					Instead, Kirchners government renegotiated the foreign debt on favourable terms. Most creditors recovered only around 25 to 30 per cent of their credit. This move, opposed by the IMF, was based on the idea that creditors must bear some of the damages in a meltdown, especially if they have been lending carelessly. Kirchner also postponed debt payments to international organizations, which substantially helped the recovery. Other policy departures included a well-managed devaluation that boosted an economy crumbling under high interest rates and an ill-advised currency peg to the dollar  both being the IMFs doing. 
																					A new Argentina
																					However, expenditure on social programmes was increased with cuts made elsewhere  where they would not hurt those worst hit by the crisis. Over the four years of Kirchners term, the economy had grown annually at a steady 8 to 9 per cent. Today, unemployment is down to around ten per cent and poverty has been halved from the levels of 2002-03. 
																					Under Kirchner, Argentina maintained a distance from the US and the IMF, reaching out instead to Hugo Chavez, Tabar Vzquez and Lula da Silva and pushing for closer cooperation in the Latin American trade block Mercosur. Although Kirchner moved Argentina away from a dependent alliance with the US, he has been quiet about it, unlike Hugo Chavez. Chavez, Kirchner, and now Cristina Kirchner, are leaders of the two fastest growing economies in Latin America and offer plausible alternatives to neo-liberal economic reform, at least in the region. 
																					The only unanswered question is why Nestor Kirchner himself refused to stand for a second term. He remains, apparently, more popular than Cristina Kirchner. The explanations range from ill health to a Machiavellian strategy to come back for eight years once his wife has served one term. Kirchner has hinted that his wife is better suited to do the job now required  repairing a damaged relationship with the US and the West, appealing to international investors to return. Cristina Kirchner is known to be more flexible and internationalist. 
																					Time will undoubtedly reveal the truth. However, there is little doubt that Los Pinguinos will dominate Argentina for a while. The people of Argentina certainly appreciate the warmth they bring from their very cold home.

							 																						TIME FOR A DIFFERENT DREAM				 	 Church at Barran																																																													Divisadero By Michael Ondaatje, Bloomsbury,  17.99																														Midway in the novel, Anna, whose sporadic first-person narration loosely holds Divisadero together, stops to look at a church in the French village of Barran on her way to Dmu in the Gers region of France. This is the closest Michael Ondaatje comes to offering the reader an image of the way his story structures time, or times  and places: Built in the thirteenth century, the belfry had been constructed like a coil or a screw. It had one of those unexpected, heliocoidal shapes  the surface like a helix  so that as it curved up it reflected every compass point of the landscape. The landscape may be the dispersed topography of the characters adult lives, from the point the journeys of Anna, Claire and Cooper began in a farm in Seventies California, once the Gold Rush country, to San Francisco, Nevada and furthest to south-central France, curling back to the journeyings of a little-known pre-World War I French poet, Lucien Segura, whose life Anna is studying in his last home in Dmu, close to Barran. But beyond and within this landscape, Ondaatje, the fascinated cartographer, also maps the topography of the characters minds, the recurring, careful choreography of their memories, so that his tale captures refracted themes, images, mottoes and lives  dispersing, intersecting, flowing on and back and forcing the reader to remember.																														Ondaatjes story-telling is powerful because he tells no story as it should be told. Its enigmatic quality is reflected in the peculiar structure of Divisadero, meaning either divisions, or gazing afar, or possibly both in this tale. Much of it follows the fates of Cooper, Anna and Claire, and the last section follows Lucien Segura through his youth, escapes and illnesses, the belated discovery of his suppressed love, his writings and the search for his last refuge. 																														It is also possible to see the novel as a rhythmic oscillation between the loss and discovery of homes. Annas mother dies in childbirth, and her father brings home not just his own baby, but another little girl orphaned by her mothers death, whom he names Claire. They are brought up with Cooper, a slightly older neighbours son, whom he had rescued when a killer got his parents.																														The quasi-siblings lose their almost idyllic home through a single episode of primal violence when, during a blinding storm, the father discovers Anna and Cooper making love. Anna can never forget that just as her father tried to kill Cooper, she tried to kill her father. We live permanently in the recurrence of our own stories, says Anna. Like the belfry, she thinks, turning onto itself again and again, the inclination of going back to events in the past is like a villanelle, the way the villanelles form refuses to move forward in linear development, circling instead at those familiar moments of emotion.																														But that, again, is only partly true. Anna herself, ever escaping that primal moment and trying to retrieve the past of individuals in the backkrooms of history in archives, where life meets art in secret, goes on to discover not just Seguras griefs and joys by working in his last home, but also a new love, Rafael. Son of a gypsy mother and a gentle, moral thief, he had known Segura as a little boy. Seguras last home is Annas refuge. Claire, working in San Francisco in a public defenders office, meets Cooper in Tahoe. He is the solitary wanderer trained in cutting and dealing cards in the secretive deserts of Nevada, who is soon so badly beaten up that he loses his memory. Claire must retrace the steps of his life in an unresolved effort to retrieve for him his past and his sense of self, and take him back to their dying father. 																														So the familiar moments of emotion are relived also as a dreamlike initiation into the totally unfamiliar, just as the belfry curves up beyond reach and beyond vision like a flame. Anything can happen in this constantly curling time-flow. Seguras own life bursts onto the surface of the narrative, annihilating the presence of the searching Anna. Unfamiliar in place and time, it haunts the reader in its anachronistic echoes of alienness and loss, attraction and solitude, of violence and of care in the stories of Anna, Cooper and Claire.																														Ondaatjes blend of passionate particularity with dreamlike motion is peculiarly addictive. It is part of his odd magic that he is so good at raw violence, suppressed passion and pure sex, without which his characters would lose definition. In Divisadero, though, he seems to be pushing at the margins, for the middle section flags a bit in spite of the mesmeric grip of Coopers obsessive pursuit of the mysterious Bridget. The change of direction from the card-sharping, drug-taking, knife- and whip-wielding world of the adult Cooper straight into Seguras journey to find a last home in rural pre-war France hits the reader hard, but Ondaatje pulls that off with the sheer effrontery of his hypnotic prose. 																														Yet some problems remain. His immaculate recounting of one particular skill, as the archaeologists putting together of a skeleton in Anils Ghost, or the sapper taking apart a bomb in The English Patient, can pall sometimes, as does Coopers training in dealing cards. And in spite of the richly allusive texture, an almost independent realm of enjoyment in which Colette and Nietzsche, Dumas and Nabokov, Japanese poetry and John Muir appear and disappear, while afar rages the Iraq war or perhaps a diptheria epidemic on the Belgian border during World War I, all the characters tend to sound alike at times, with the same wisdom, vision and regret, have the same discrete solitary homes, and are enveloped in the same kind of silences. Perhaps it is time for a different dream.						BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

				 																Cold comfort				 																																																				Sir  The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, finally had to pay a visit to Rizwanur Rahmans family (Thank you for the visit, sir...but what about cops amp; cash?, Oct 14). On a personal level, it was a kind gesture, and coming from the chief minister, it made good political sense. It is another matter that the action was prompted by the overwhelming pressure of the people of the state for justice to Rizwanurs family. While sceptics would doubt the ulterior motive of the visit, Bhattacharjee has shown that his government has a humane face after all. With the removal of the accused police officers, it seems that Bhattacharjees visit has brought some succour to the grief-stricken family. The plight of the family has moved thousands of people from all over the world to express their solidarity with the fight for justice. The chief minister ought to appreciate that Rizwanurs family seeks nothing but justice  something that any government worth its name should be delivering anyway. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit to 7B Tiljala Road, ostensibly to console the bereaved family of Rizwanur Rahman, was actually a formidable damage-control exercise. The state agency investigating the case is known to have prepared its report and awaiting the nod of the appropriate authority to make it public. It has perhaps established a glib theory of suicidal death, leaving most fishy matters untouched. Both the Muslim vote bank and industrialists like Ashok Todi help the Left Front to strengthen its hold over the state. Most people are convinced by now that had Todi been a commoner, he would have been arrested much earlier, if only to douse the flame of public anger. Similarly, why did it take so long to remove the accused officers even when Bhattacharjee has agreed in principle to their involvement in the case? Given all this, the chief ministers visit to Rizwanurs residence cannot be regarded as anything more than a gesture to appease the minority community.

				 																From green to grey				 																																																				Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Rays concern for the Charlie Chaplin Park in Cornfield Road should be an example for all those who sit and watch as Calcuttas few remaining patches of green are taken over (An acre of green grass, Oct 6). As the population of Calcutta continues to grow, there is a breathless rush to convert every open space into ugly housing estates. Local councillors usually have their reasons for not maintaining a particular green spot in their locality. They allow vagrants and goondas to take over such land, so that they can later hand them over to realtors on the pretext that the place has become the haunt of criminals. The coffers of not only the promoters but also the political bosses and their henchmen are fattened in the process. Of late, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has adopted certain measures to restore a few parks. But there still remains the glaring lack of a well-established civic policy for the upkeep of these open spaces. The role of the corporate houses in such matters also leaves much to be desired. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Calcutta is notoriously apathetic towards its spots of beauty. The same attitude of indifference also applies to its historic buildings and landmarks. The other day, as I was walking down Harrington Street, in which the American consulate is located, I came upon the decrepit mansion of a now-forgotten Bengali couple who once had as much influence over the industrial and cultural scenario of Bengal as America has over India today. It was the house of Sir Biren and Lady Ranu Mookerjee on 7 Harrington Street. Sir Biren was a leading industrialist who founded Indias second steel plant, IISCO, at Burnpur. His wife, Lady Ranu, was a famous patron of the arts, and set up the Academy of Fine Arts, which, till date, remains the most prestigious institution of its kind in the country. It is sad to note that in spite of the immense contribution of the Mookerjees to the industrial and cultural renaissance of Bengal, their residence is in a sorry state today. The faade is almost crumbling and the sprawling lawns are overgrown. The solitary guard who mans the ornate iron gate tells me that descendants of the family still inhabit a part of the 100-year-old property, which, according to rumours he hears, is soon to be brought down to make way for a hotel. Would it be asking for too much if the Heritage Commission turned the house into a museum of Bengals industrial history to do justice to the memory of the people who once lived there?

				 																																																				Sir  Durga Puja is here  the biggest extravaganza in Bengal. In Calcutta alone, there are more than 1,000 pujas. The organizers collect several million rupees and spend the money on innovative themes, idols, decoration and synchronized lighting. Does the city stand to gain anything from these in constructive terms? I would like to request the puja organizers to spare a thought for the depleting green cover and the poor quality of air in our city. They could keep aside a small percentage of their collection and use it every year for planting broad-leafed trees in parks, open areas and elsewhere. For a year or two, guards can be employed to protect these plantations. We should not depend on the municipal corporation alone for the execution of such civic projects. As concerned citizens, we should pool our resources and try to do something that would make our city a more habitable place.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

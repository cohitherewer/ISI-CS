				 																Bitter truth					Sir  Indias performance against Australia in the Future Cup series was disappointing, to say the least (Symonds makes the difference, Oct 15). It seems that the Indian players were a complacent lot, especially after winning the Twenty20 World Cup. This was reflected in their lacklustre performance. It was as if the boys just wanted to relax, and were in no mood to even put up the semblance of a fight. Indias bowling and fielding were disappointing in most of the matches. These failures cost the team dear against a strong side such as Australia. The most disheartening aspect of the Indian performance was the absence of aggression on the field. The players were in a defensive frame of mind, while bowling, batting or fielding. It is difficult to win a series against Australia if the players lack the hunger to win for the country. This certainly seemed to be the case with the Indians. It is evident that Indian cricketers lack the confidence to beat the best in the business. The players must now try and regain their confidence by spending quality time on improving their performance. It is a matter of great shame that the Indians lost tamely to Australia so soon after winning the T20 championships. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Former Indian captain, Rahul Dravid, was not among runs in the one-day internationals against Australia. However, Dravid should not have been dropped in the last ODI. Dravid has always been a team player and has rescued his team from trouble on a number of occasions. The Indian team will suffer if the management decides to ignore a batsman of Dravids calibre in the future.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  There is something wrong about the way Rahul Dravid has been treated recently. Neither the selectors nor the board tried hard enough to make Dravid change his mind after his sudden decision to quit as the captain. Then he got dropped from the team in the final ODI after a few poor scores. This despite the fact that he had done reasonably well in Ireland and in England. One wonders what is the benchmark for performance in India. Sourav Ganguly was rested for a couple of matches although he was in good form. On the other hand, it had taken a number of games for the selectors to drop an out-of-form Virender Sehwag. It is a pity that different yardsticks are being applied for different players. The board should make it clear that performance alone would merit selection, for both the seniors as well as the juniors in the side.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  India may have lost the one-day series against Australia. But, after beating the Aussies convincingly in Mumbai in a T20 game, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his boys have proved that they are the real champions in T20 cricket. I have spent a large part of my childhood in the mid-forties in a remote village in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh. The game, gilli danda, was very popular in those days. Gilli danda is not very different from T20 cricket. After all, in both games, a player is required to hit the ball hard. Indians have been playing gilli danda for some time now. Little wonder then that our boys have excelled in T20 cricket as well.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  As a former sports journalist in Calcutta and a proud Indian now living in Australia, I am extremely disappointed and saddened to see a small section of Indian cricket followers making a mockery of the true, passionate Indian fan. There is really no need for the average cricket fan to present his patriotic credentials by making fun of the Australian cricketer, Andrew Symonds. There are more sensible ways of proving that Indians are a proud, intelligent and cultured sports-loving people. Sadly, to the neutral eye, those individuals who resort to shameful actions (such as making monkey-like faces and actions whenever Symonds came in to bat) only prove that their own jump in the evolutionary process has fallen short of the mark. 					Yours faithfully,																															Andy OBrien, Sydney,Australia
					Sir  What is it with the Australian cricketers? Why cant they swallow a bit of their own medicine? It has long been known that the Aussies are really a bunch of brats. Sledging originated in Australia and the Australians have done well to continue this hallowed tradition. But when it was their turn to be in the line of fire, they started crying foul. First, S. Sreesanth was accused of getting under Andrew Symonds skin. Then, the Australians alleged that Indian spectators were guilty of racially abusing a particular Australian cricketer. It seems that the current Australian team is easily hurt. Ricky Ponting and his mates should realize that they should be able to take as much as they give. Gone are the days when teams from the subcontinent could be intimidated with ease. Now, they are ready to match Australians even in sledging. Similarly, the Indian crowd cannot be accused of racism. A pre-dominantly white team is seldom abused in this part of the world. Perhaps the Australians are already building the ground to target Indians when they tour the country the next time round. 					Yours faithfully, 																															
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa

					Sir  The Indian players should now focus on the upcoming series against Pakistan. A win against their arch rivals would certainly help the fans forget the humiliating loss against the Australians at home.					Yours faithfully,

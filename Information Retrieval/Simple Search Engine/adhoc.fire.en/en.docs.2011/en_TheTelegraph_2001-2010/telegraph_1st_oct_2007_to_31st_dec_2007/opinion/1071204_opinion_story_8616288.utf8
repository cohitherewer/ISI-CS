				 																Singled out				 																																																				Sir  It is really a matter of shame for all law-abiding citizens of the country that the government could not set an example by rewarding an upright police officer such as Kiran Bedi with the post of Delhis commissioner (Sidelined Kiran opts to retire, Nov 28). Instead of making use of her experience and skill, the powers that be chose to ignore Bedis rightful claim and appointed someone else to the post. Would it not have been appropriate to bestow Indias first woman police officer with the honour of becoming the police commissioner of its capital city? 				 																																																				Humiliating working women by forcing them to resign has long been a favoured policy of men who wield power in this country. The net result of this discrimination is the total lack of value attached to a professional womans life, work and beliefs. Bedi is well-known for instituting police reforms in Tihar jail as well as for her impeccable integrity. Honest and dedicated public servants like her are routinely eased out while corrupt but pliable individuals are given plum positions. In spite of the governments claim of granting equal opportunities to men and women, gender discrimination is very much in practice. An honest policewoman may be a liability for the administration. But Indias citizens would remember Bedi fondly even if she were to be denied the official recognition she deserves. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Kiran Bedis unexpected decision to retire from the forces stems from the fact that she has been unfairly treated by the government. Bedis achievements in her career as a civil servant were spectacular. This may not have made her endearing to her male colleagues who were obviously jealous of Bedis success. Bedi will continue to be successful even if she takes up voluntary work. But she should remember that without an official position, she will not have access to crucial resources which might help her to work more effectively. Isnt it strange that no matter how efficient or honest an Indian civil servant is, he has to be loyal to the party in power in order to be considered for a promotion?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Daring to speak				 																																																				Sir  It was daring of the vice-president, Hamid Ansari, to call the policies of the United States of America an impetus to terrorism, while speaking at a conference on Emerging security concerns in West Asia (Out of tune, Nov 25). In saying this, he is perhaps not far from the truth. After all, it is because of its intervention in Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and other countries that the US is now a despised name to Muslims all over the world. Whatever truth there is in this statement, Ansaris comments go to show that he has a mind of his own, unlike some other occupants of high offices. More important, Ansaris comments also come at a crucial political crossroads, when the United Progressive Alliance government led by Manmohan Singh has been dancing to George Bushs tune over the signing of the Indo-US nuclear deal. Thus Ansaris views directly contradict those of the government. Some may feel that Ansari has transgressed his constitutional role, but he should be listened to and his words considered carefully.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Danendra Jain, Ranchi 

				 																																																				Sir  The vice-president, Hamid Ansari, has shown why the communists backed his candidature for the vice-presidents post. His comments on the US foreign policy would go down very well with the communist parties in the country which are not living in great comfort these days. But in our country, where most politicians are known for their ignorance and self-interested comments, Ansari is a welcome exception. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																On deaf ears				 																																																				Sir  The Supreme Courts indictment of state machinery and muscle power used for political rallies is not going to deter the parties in power. Their mode of operation does not permit them to listen to their conscience (Rally amp; bandh under apex court glare, Nov 24). There is nothing new in political parties in power using the state machinery for furthering their own cause. Only the scale of such misuse has been growing, and gaining newer forms. There are two aspects of this phenomenon: one, such misuse always happens at the cost of the public exchequer, and two, the party cadre ensure that ordinary people face no end of harassment and disruption in their daily lives. But the magnitude of the misuse of official machinery  requisitioning 35 trains to transport political supporters, or diverting 57 other trains inconveniencing thousands of bona fide passengers, letting a convoy of 50 cars disrupt city traffic  has become startling. Will the courts directives be of any use? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Surajit Das, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Despite the apex courts directives against organizing political rallies and strikes, ministers are flouting its guidelines with impunity. Lalu Prasad, the self-styled raja of Bihar, is one of the biggest offenders. Whenever he or his party organizes rallies, the railways are treated as their personal property and private means of transport. Sometime back, the apex court had directed that government advertisements should be objective and free from photographs of honble ministers and other dignitaries. This is yet to be followed. At this rate, what would be the efficacy of any order that the apex court issues in future?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

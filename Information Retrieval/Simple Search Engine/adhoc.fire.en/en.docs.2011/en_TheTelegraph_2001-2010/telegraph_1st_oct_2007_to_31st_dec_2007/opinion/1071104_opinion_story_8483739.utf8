				 																Struck by the moon				 																																																				Sir  Whenever television serials or films show women celebrating karva chauth, the ladies are seen looking at a full moon with their husbands before breaking their fast. I have often wondered at the absurdity of the full moon shown shining in the sky. Are not film- or serial-makers aware that karva chauth is held on the chauth, that is, on the fourth day after the full moon of the month? The moon, thus, cannot be a round, bright disc that day. Hopefully, heroines will witness a chaturthi moon during karva chauth someday.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															Kanta Chandra, Calcutta
				 																Legal bond				 																																																				Sir  The order of the Supreme Court to Indian states and Union Territories to make registration of all marriages compulsory deserves unanimous praise (SC: Register all marriages, Oct 26). In the case of a civil union, there can be no reason for failing to register the marriage, and non-compliance in the name of some religious or personal law should be firmly dealt with. The order paves way for the prevention of child marriage, as registration would undoubtedly bring up questions about the age of the bride and the groom. Even if one tries to escape the law by not registering a child marriage, then, under the present directive, the marriage would automatically become null and void. By registering their marriages under the Special Marriage Act, women would also have the option of not having to change their surnames. If the Supreme Court order is properly implemented, it would go a long way in promoting gender justice, besides eradicating a number of social ills.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is shameful that the Supreme Court had to serve an ultimatum to the states and Union Territories to make registration of marriages mandatory. Why should state governments have to be told to implement a law regarding marriage registration repeatedly? Perhaps this is because political leaders would rather disobey the law than displease certain minority communities that are against this legislation. It is these politicians who are as responsible for turning India into a country where the law of the land almost does not function.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Muslims leaders are not too happy with the apex courts order on marriage registration. Muslim clerics profess that Islam is a progressive religion. Yet, when it comes to implementing laws, they seem to prefer clinging on to tradition. While the nikahnama does serve as documentary evidence in Muslim marriages, it does not have legal sanction except in Islamic courts. The clerics should try to realize the advantages of the apex court order. Once put into practice, it would help secure womens rights across communities. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur 

				 																																																				Sir  To make sure that the Supreme Court order is effective, it should be made compulsory for Hindu purohits and Muslim qazis to inform the relevant authorities of the marriages they have presided over. The concerned parties might then collect the certificate from the office of the registrar.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shariq Alavi, Lucknow

				 																																																				Sir  The case of Rizwanur Rahman proves the value of a marriage certificate. In spite of their political and financial clout, the Todis found it difficult to separate Rahman from Priyanka because he was armed with a legal certificate to prove his marriage. It becomes possible to fight against coercion in cases of inter-communal or inter-religious union when the marriage is registered. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Sinha, Calcutta

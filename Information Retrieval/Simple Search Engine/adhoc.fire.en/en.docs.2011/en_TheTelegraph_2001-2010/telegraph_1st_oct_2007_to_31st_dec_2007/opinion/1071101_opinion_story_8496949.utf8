							 																						UNPROTECTED AT HOME AND IN THE WORLD The criminal negligence that marks the Bengal governments attitude towards womens welfare also allows it to evade the implementation of the domestic violence legislation, says Chirosree Basu				 	 For a healthy life																														Protection comes at a price. A state that spends a major part of its budget in paying its teachers and is sometimes compelled to spend Rs 10 lakh on the winding up of a judicial review even before it has commenced has reasons to feel stingy. Teachers have their political use and so have judicial reviews, but there is no such immediate benefit to be gained from protection officers for West Bengals victims of domestic violence. It is historical common sense that women should expect to be teased with cigarette butts or knocked out by a few cuffs if they are to allow themselves to be loved by their spouses and dear ones. About 40 per cent Indian women titteringly admit to this fact, and the benevolent State through its insolent police officers  who prevent daughters and wives from straying  often does its bit to keep the home truths relevant. 																														It is thus no big surprise that Bengal, more preoccupied with the interests of visiting dignitaries than with the shrieking women in its special economic zones, should pay little attention to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. It has made social welfare officers act as token protection officers to deal with a widespread social crime. Incidentally, South 24 Parganas, and its district headquarters, that is Calcutta, have the highest incidence of domestic violence in the state, and the graph is steadily rising under the very nose of the states administrators. 																														The 1999-2000 Estimates Committee for Police Matters of the state assembly that registered this sharp rise had felt that the increase in reports of marital violence was the result of greater awareness of rights among women. Perhaps one way of keeping the figures under control is to limit the spread of awareness, which the absence of protection officers could definitely assure. That would explain why the West Bengal administration has steadfastly refused to do what other states have already initiated during the one year that has elapsed since the domestic violence act was passed after much ado. 																														The presence of protection officers in police stations, not very hospitable places for battered women, was one of the major gains of the domestic violence legislation that took its time to become the object of consensus on the need for womens protection against actual abuse or the threat of abuse inside the home. The protection officers, once approached by a woman, are supposed to provide her and her children with immediate safety from violence, assist her in getting her essential personal effects, reach her to a safe location (a friends or an acquaintances home), and get her medical treatment. The most important thing is that the protection officer would help the woman lodge a first information report, which is often denied by the existing staff at police stations, most of whom are unwilling to recognize domestic violence as a cognizable offence. Even more important, the protection officer is supposed to assist the woman in reporting the matter directly to the concerned court after, expectedly, acquainting her with the legal avenues open to her. 																														There have been special cells for women in police stations before, such as those in Mumbai, which were manned by social workers who would counsel women and their husbands, when approached. Police stations in Calcutta too have considered setting up counselling cells for victims of domestic violence. But where they existed, the cells were either mechanical or bureaucratic in their functioning, and often left the woman high and dry by asking her to approach the court on her own or by trying to resolve the issue by coaxing the victim to return to the hostile territory of her home. The latter action, which passed off as counselling, often became an insidious way in which she was not only denied justice, but kept away from gaining an access to it. The protection officers, on the other hand, are their direct connection with the legal machinery. According to the present legislation, these officers would also help the women get a court order (some kind of an interim arrangement before resorting to Section 498A, which makes cruelty a non-bailable offence, and is often an extreme and irreversible step) to warn the abuser, to get monetary relief and, more important, to get custody of the children (which is often denied when the woman decides to lodge a complaint). On violation of the order, the violating party could be tried in court. 																														It goes without saying that if committed, properly trained and sensitized protection officers can make a difference, particularly in urban areas, which are found to be more susceptible to marital violence. The presence of protection officers has already made a difference in states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi that have seen a visible increase in registered cases against this invisible crime. The argument that the Centre has not released enough funds for the plan to be implemented does not hold much water. A protection officer does not necessarily have to be a state government employee. Any representative of a non-governmental organization or a representative of the service provider registered under the Act, may be appointed, according to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. Funding for such operations is often not a problem with NGOs committed to the cause. However, where the state is, in no uncertain terms, asked to provide the protection officer with both the infrastructure and financial provisions for the same and reimbursement for the performance of the duties, one cannot fathom why the state government should pass on the blame for its failure in appointing protection officers to the Centres miserliness. If Bengal can bend over backwards to pay its teachers and clerks, why should it plead bankruptcy when it comes to appointing protection officers? 																														The attitude that makes it possible for the government to completely evade responsibility for this criminal negligence is evident in all matters concerning womens welfare in the state, be it the assurance of their reproductive rights, nutrition, education or health. The assessment of The Changing Status of Women in West Bengal , 1970-2000 (edited by Jasodhara Bagchi) gives a clear picture of this. The sex ratio in the state, which has always been worse than the national average, seems to be getting worse, particularly in urban areas, where it has dropped to 893, according to the 2001 Census. The fall in child sex ratio (1007 in 1971 to 963 in 2001) points to female infanticide and a high female mortality rate. While the Central government and states like Assam and Punjab are giving cash and educational incentives to boost the figures, Bengal remains complacent. 																														The states failure becomes particularly glaring in matters of health. The chronic poverty in several regions in the state has, in any case, taken its direct toll on the health of women and children, and this has been compounded by poor institutional care for women. The slow rise in the age of marriage, a fallout of the lack of a concerted drive to promote female education (evident from the fact that 51 per cent women are married in the state before they are 18 compared to 10 per cent in Kerala), leading to early motherhood and often pregnancy and childbirth-related complications, is a major factor in poor maternal and child health. The inadequacies of the healthcare system become apparent when women are forced to deliver under a tree outside hospitals or to surrender themselves during the time of delivery to quacks who might severe the childs head from the body. And yet, women in this state are supposed to be conscious (and free) enough to go out of their homes to avail of health services during pregnancy. Why then do 60 per cent of them still deliver their babies at home? When 74 per cent of women develop complications during delivery or post-delivery, why do less than half their number get treated? Why do 14 per cent of maternal deaths occur during a simple process like the medical termination of pregnancy? 																														Bengals administrators are unlikely to be able to answer these questions. They, in fact, would hardly bother to even look for an answer. During a sensitizing programme held last year by the Bengal womens commission to acquaint legislators with Bengals startling maternal mortality rate and the need to spend more on health, it was only a government fiat that compelled the men to attend the workshop. Many, however, walked away in the middle of the session. 																														But the blindness or the refusal to look can prove to be disastrous in the long run. Tolerance of domestic violence and its scarring experience have not only a debilitating effect on women, their confidence and the prospects of their empowerment, but also a direct impact on future generations, their physical health and their psyche, making them prone to depression and compromising their ability to sustain relationships in the long term. The rapid changes both urban and rural Bengal are undergoing because of the thrust towards industrialization will make the situation more tenuous for women. But neglect the crucial question of womens wellbeing, and you will have an industrialized state minus social stability. 																														The reach of the state into the confines of the home will continue to be debated and resisted. It will also never be able to reach deep enough to protect all women from the threat of violence from their most intimate enemies. But it is important to put an infrastructure in place for their use. That is one way to assure the visibility of a crime that, by a social consensus, is made invisible and eminently acceptable. That is also another way to guarantee the health of the state.																														Rank poor show

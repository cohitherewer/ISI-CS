							 																						WITHOUT CARE																														It is only natural that a country that has its bourses riding the crest should spare little thought for the widening gulf among its classes. That is a fallout of economic growth that India has learnt to live with. The nation is perhaps as comfortable with the widening gender gap, for it seems to have done nothing to improve its standing in the gender gap index of the World Economic Forum. In fact, its position has slipped from 98 in 2006 to 114 in 2007 in a list of 128 nations, topped by the Nordic countries, which have done consistently well economically as well. India, despite its shooting sensitive index, can hardly lay claims to such consistently good overall growth if it continues to brush the figures indicating negative trends under the carpet. The WEF index measures womens economic participation, political empowerment, education and health  the critical areas of inequality  and, in almost all of them, India, unreservedly, paints a dismal picture. The contrary ranking in political participation (a high 21 as against above-100 in the rest) is because of the longish reign of one woman prime minister. But that serves more to highlight the gap in opportunities between the Indian elite and the vast unwashed majority than to hold up a mirror to Indias success in overcoming its bias against women in politics.																														It should be obvious that the countrys poor performance in two of the categories  education and health  is intrinsically related to its failure to show marked changes in the other two. Without education (the female literacy rate is 54 per cent against 76 per cent for males), Indian women can neither have a say in social matters nor political. They will remain perpetually ill-equipped to fight centuries-old traditions that discriminate against them, that limit their individual freedoms and their access to their legal or political rights which the State may want to guarantee them. Indias negligence of womens welfare is suicidal. It can hope for no long-term prosperity if it stops caring for almost half of its population.

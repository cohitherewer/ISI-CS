				 																Angels and demonsTHE BOOK OF DEMONS (Penguin, Rs 325) by Nanditha Krishna is one of the few rare books that are scholarly and entertaining at the same time. Krishna sifts through the complex world of Indian mythology to bring to life the various monsters and demons who keep appearing in the legends. She underlines the fact that even the simple task of enumerating the demons of Indian myths is made difficult by the liminal nature of these intriguing figures. They are hardly ever embodiments of pure evil because some of them are fallen gods, while others represent warriors of vanquished tribes. This is perhaps indicative of the philosophic tradition that refuses to demarcate the realms of good and evil in unambiguous terms. Thus, the demons are often defeated but never eliminated altogether, as without evil good ceases to exist. Adding to the value of the book, there is a dictionary of demons in Sanskrit literature at the end.																												BUKHARI (Oxford, Rs 225) by Ghassan Abdul-Jabbar is one of the series titled Makers of Islamic Civilization. Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari is one of the most well-known experts of the hadith literature, hadiths being textual reports on what the Prophet did, said or approved. Bukharis magnum opus, the Sahih, is the most widely revered book in Islam after the Quran. Being a specialist in hadith studies, Jabbar explains the intricacies of the Sahih with ease. Jabbar himself points out that books on Bukhari in English are scarce, although there is a considerable body of work on the scholar in the non-Western languages. As such, this slim volume would enlighten many a reader who is interested in Bukhari and the hadith tradition.																												THE SMALL HOUSE (Penguin, Rs 325) by Timeri N. Murari is touted as a many-layered exploration of the fragility of modern-day relationships...of memories that lie in wait to threaten the past on the back cover. However, the unfolding layers, if there are any, reveal only sleaze, and more sleaze as socialite wives pursue adulterous husbands, who in turn, run after lovers and money. The thought of lucrative deals give the men erections and the guileful body of a woman becomes serpentine...in her serene sexuality while making love. FANTASIES OF A BOLLYWOOD LOVE THIEF (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Stephen Alter is a look Inside the World of Indian Moviemaking. The movie in question here is Omkara, which was Vishal Bhardwajs adaptation of Shakespeares Othello. Although the film was admittedly better than the most that are churned out of Bollywood everyday, one cannot help wondering whether it was so special as to merit a book on its making. However, if, after having watched the movie, you have been convinced of its worth, then Alters book will disappoint you. For Alter has nothing new to offer on his subject. Even his anecdotes about the cast and crew of Omkara would fail to impress anyone who regularly catches up on Bollywood gossip.																												TOHELLWITHYOU MITRO (Katha, Rs 200) by Krishna Sobti has been translated from Hindi by Gita Rajan and Raji Narasimhan. Sobtis tale of the feisty Mitro, who by the uninhibited display of her sexuality outrages the members of her marital home, scandalized readers when it first appeared in the Sixties. Since the power of Sobtis story is contained in a large part in her innovative use of language, translating her work must have been a daunting task. However, Rajan and Narasimhan have successfully retained the nuances of Sobtis style in English.

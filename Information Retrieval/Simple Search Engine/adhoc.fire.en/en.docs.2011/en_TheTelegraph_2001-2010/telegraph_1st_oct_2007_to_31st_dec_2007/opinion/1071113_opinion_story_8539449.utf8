							 																						BEWARE OF THE BIG BROTHER						SHOT IN THE DARK Musharraf may regret incurring Americas wrath, feels Con Coughlin																														It is never a clever idea to upset the worlds leading superpower, particularly when you are supposed to be a key ally fighting a common enemy. General Zia ul-Haq worked closely with Washington to evict the Soviet army from Afghanistan. But shortly after Zia dismissed the government and threatened the imposition of martial law, he was killed when the C-130 flying him to Islamabad mysteriously exploded in mid-air.																														Hamid Gul, the head of Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence at the time, later accused the CIA of causing the crash, though it also killed Arnold Raphael, the US ambassador to Pakistan. Whatever the cause, with Zia out of the way, Pakistan undertook yet another awkward transition to democracy.																														No one is suggesting that the Asian desk at the CIA is working overtime studying the Pakistani militarys presidential flight schedules. But, by the same token, General Pervez Musharraf should be under no illusion about the anger he has provoked within the Bush administration over his decision to impose martial law and round up hundreds of political activists.																														Its not as if President Bush does not have enough on his plate. And now he must grapple with the prospect of a civil war erupting in a country whose support is regarded as vital to defeating al Qaida.																														Musharraf has a reputation for living dangerously, and by ignoring Washingtons advice and in effect staging a coup against himself, he has incurred Americas wrath.																														The mounting political instability in Pakistan has been worrying Washington policy-makers since the summer, when Musharraf ordered the army to end the siege by Islamic militants of Islamabads Red Mosque. The fear that the country might ultimately fall into the hands of extremists led the Bush administration to press him to restore the country to something approaching democracy, and back the return of the pro-Western former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto.																														Pakistan, it should be remembered, is the father of the Islamic atom bomb and, given its proximity to Iran, and its murky history of cooperation on Irans nuclear programme, the prospect of Pakistans nuclear arsenal falling under the control of Islamic fundamentalists is truly alarming.																														Musharraf will surely argue that, by imposing martial law, he is curtailing the activities of Pakistans militant Islamists, even though his primary motivation was to pre-empt a decision by Pakistans supreme court on whether he could remain president for another five years. But when he first intimated to America and Britain last month that he was considering such a drastic course of action, he was told that what Washington and London really wanted to see was the return of Pakistans democratic process, starting with the national elections scheduled for January.																														If Washington is seething at Musharrafs double-cross, the administrations frustration is all the greater because there is precious little it can do to restore the status quo ante.																														Immediately after the martial law declaration, there were mutterings that the State Department might withhold the billions of dollars in aid that goes to support General Musharrafs regime each year.																														But as most of the money is used to equip the Pakistani military, such action would be self-defeating: the main priority in supporting Pakistan is to defeat taliban, and Washington could hardly expect Islamabad to intensify its campaign against Osama bin Ladens cohorts while at the same time cutting its financial lifeline. Nor is there any great confidence in the West that restoring democracy will necessarily lead to greater political stability.																														Democratic government in Pakistan has a chequered history, and both Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, the other opposition leader who was unceremoniously deported to Saudi Arabia by Musharraf in September, had their respective terms of office as prime minister curtailed amid allegations of corruption and unbecoming constitutional conduct.																														Musharraf might be forgiven for thinking he has outwitted his American paymasters. But however much Washington needs the general as an ally to defeat the Islamist menace, he might still be well-advised to think twice before boarding his next flight. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

				 																Damage control				 																																																				Sir  Top cops stutter before CID (Oct 7) was expected news. There is little doubt that the Calcutta police honchos have acted out of their jurisdiction by trying to break up the Rizwanur Rahman-Priyanka Todi marriage. From what has been exposed so far, it is apparent that Ashok Todi has used his wealth to influence the entire system. This case reveals the way violence and indignity can be covered up with a bit of help from friends in power. The police force has proved that it is a regressive force in society, and is synonymous with corruption and oppression. Perhaps it is time the Constitution of India were amended by including a clause that states that citizens should take prior permission from the police and the ruling party before committing themselves to an inter-religious marriage.

				 																																																				Sir  Harassment, leading to the death of Rizwanur Rahman, shows how conservative our city has become. Not long ago, I had boasted to some friends in Chandigarh that there is no such thing as honour killings in West Bengal. I seem to have been wrong. The rot has set in quite deep and the liberal city, which once gave everyone the right to live and dream, has closed its doors to the winds of change. 				 																																																				Rizwanur-Priyanka, who had transcended the boundaries of religion and socio-economic status to marry each other, were hounded mercilessly by the custodians of law and order. They had the courage to stand up against it. Unfortunately, Rizwanur is no more and not much can be known about Priyanka. The police meanwhile try out every possible way to cover their tracks, and the chief minister keeps thinking of ways to keep public anger at bay.				 																																																				The only ray of hope has been the media, as also the public which has been unflinching in its support for the cause of justice. If the media manage to keep public interest in the matter alive and the people have the courage to raise their voices louder, there can still be justice for Rizwanur. The candlelight vigil outside St Xaviers College has made me proud as a Calcuttan, and reinforced my belief that Calcutta will not take things lying down.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Smita Roy, Hooghly

				 																																																				Sir  The Rizwanur Rahman case should follow the investigative protocol stringently and the public should be made aware of the procedures. Transcripts of all the witnesses interviewed should be maintained carefully. Priyanka Todi is expected to play a crucial role in the trial, but at the same time, we must remember her terrible state of mind. Rizwanurs family hopes that she would come back to live with her in-laws. While this is certainly desirable, she should be allowed to choose, on her own accord and without succumbing to social pressure, where she wants to be. After all, she is a young girl who would have to continue with her life. It has been common in such cases in the past for the girl to refuse deposing in court. There might be a repeat of this in this case as well.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It seems to be a particularly difficult time for the ruling party in West Bengal. The alleged murder of Rizwanur Rahman has resulted in an unprecedented public outcry. Over the years, the police have become an arm of the government. Which is why the government now finds it so difficult to remove the suspect officers. But the callousness of the police force might cost the party dearly in the elections. Although the chief minister is making a desperate attempt at damage control, it is unlikely that the people would be convinced very easily. The Bihar police seem far better than their counterparts in West Bengal. At least they do not pretend to be honest. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

				 																Trial and errors				 																																																				Sir  The Patna court verdict against a former member of parliament and two politicians in Bihar has created history (Death for lynch leader, Oct 4). The picture of the leaders makes it apparent that they were well looked after inside the jail. Their show of confidence also leads one to have a gnawing suspicion that the sentence may not be carried through after all. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It was baffling to see Anand Mohan and Munna Shukla, the two legislators sentenced recently to death and to life respectively, waving at the crowd. But then a hardened criminal like Anand Mohan knows that the case would first go to the Supreme Court, where it would lie for years, and then hang indefinitely at the office of the president of India, who may or may not commute it. The occasion demands that they retain a brave face. Their supporters would abandon them if they themselves started getting jittery about the court verdict. Fear, if any, has to remain in the minds of the people. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  It is shocking that George Fernandes should not only have visited the convict, Anand Mohan, in Beur jail but also demanded the dismissal of the Bihar government over his treatment (Fernandes flak on JD(U) leader, Oct 8). The leaders sentenced for the murder of the Gopalganj district magistrate are criminals and should be shown no mercy. The Patna district and sessions court has set a precedent which should be followed by courts in other states as well. Fernandess comments clearly show how political patronage helps criminals to go unpunished in this country. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

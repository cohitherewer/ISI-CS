 Letters to Editor
				 																Faith accompli				 																																																				Sir  Swapan Dasgupta has rightly chastized the government for not just dishonouring the cultural significance of the Ramar Sethu but also for its mindset of insensitivity that deems Hinduism, and Hinduism alone, an impediment to modernity, development and cosmopolitanism (Tread softly on faith, Sept 21). Liberal intellectuals love to insult Hindu conventions under the veneer of secularism. Excesses committed by fundamentalists from minority communities are overlooked by the United Progressive Alliance dispensation for fear of upsetting potential vote banks. One has only to look at the way cultural legacies from different communities are regarded differently. Nude paintings of Hindu divinities are considered to be great art  while cartoons of Prophet Mohammed can never be  and the demand for a proof of Rams existence is projected as scientific progress, an attempt to move along with the times.

				 																																																				Sir  In addition to filing the controversial affidavit in the Supreme Court, the department of culture committed another gaffe earlier, which went largely unnoticed. In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha in March this year, it was claimed on behalf of the department that there have been no archaeological studies revealing the existence of the Ramar Sethu and so, no conservation initiatives have been shown by the government. But this statement is inaccurate. Even if the Ramayan is disregarded because of a political interest in secularism, there is no dearth of published material to prove that there has indeed existed a formation or structure (man-made or natural) that was actually used as a footbridge by commuters between India and Sri Lanka. In his travelogue, New Account of the East Indies, Alexander Hamilton describes how he went from India to Ceylon by the Ramar Sethu. The bridge is shown clearly in a map drawn by Alexander Parks in 1788. The Administrative Report of Madras Presidency, published in 1903, states that an ancient bridge was used by commuters between India and Ceylon up to 1480, when a sea storm caused a breach in the rocks and the bridge became less popular. After another storm some years later, the breach became wider and movement on the bridge stopped completely. 				 																																																				It seems that a vicious misinformation campaign has been unleashed by interested parties, to portray anyone objecting to the destruction as opposed to development. What is forgotten is that as far back as 1956, the A.R. Mudaliar committee had suggested as many as five alternative alignments for the channel or canal, which could be executed without destroying the structure. Why cant the government adopt one of those options?				 																																																				Sadly, the entire discourse around the project has focused on saving navigation time and navigation fuel. The environmental and the geo-political costs of this plan have not been clearly articulated. The Sethu is a natural protection against tsunami. Apart from the irreparable damage to the marine ecosystem, the thorium reserves in Kerala and southern Tamil Nadu will suffer desiccation if the Sethu is destroyed. It is no use stirring religious sentiments over the Sethusamudram project. It is not merely a development versus obscurantism issue, but also a question of conserving a priceless heritage from senseless vandalism.

				 																																																				Sir  Swapan Dasgupta and the votaries of the sangh parivar would like to talibanize all Hindus, drowning all voices of reason in blind faith. Dasgupta surely knows that no single deity is equally revered by Hindus across the country. He could also recall that the offer by the head of one group of Hindus to mediate in the Babri Masjid affair was rejected by the parivar on the excuse that, being a Shaivite, he would not be able to appreciate the greatness of Ram. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Swapan Dasgupta has claimed that the temple town of Kumbhakonam has been named after Ravanas brother, Kumbhakarna, who had only a cameo role in the Ramayan. Rather, the town got its name after the kumbha or pot of nectar, which was produced when the oceans were churned by the Devas and the Asuras. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Born unfree				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph deserves to be thanked for highlighting the plight of the animals at the Calcutta zoo (Beastly tales from here and now, Sept 11). People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has pointed out the deficiencies of this zoo, but to no avail. We have also filed a case in the Supreme Court and are working to improve the pathetic conditions of our zoos. The key to saving exotic animals lies in saving their habitat, not removing them from there and putting them in unnatural and restrictive environments. Captivity drives many animals insane or excites them into unnatural behaviour. Zoochosis is unheard of in animals that live in the wilderness. Zoos would perform a valuable service by evolving into sanctuaries for displaced wildlife. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Anuradha Sawhney, Chief Functionary, PeTA, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The Calcutta zoo requires a managing committee that is actively interested in the animals and their environment. The condition of the animals is pathetic. The tigers, for instance, are severely undernourished. It is one thing to keep the tigers lean and fit with a proper diet, and quite another to reduce them to a bag of bones. One cannot help suspect an ulterior motive in reducing the zoo to its present decrepit state. According to media reports in 2004, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority had started informal talks with developers to make use of the 45-acre land for a residential complex. The authorities subsequently denied this, but it seems that the KMDA is surreptitiously moving towards its goal. Removing some of the animals to Sonarpur could well be the first insidious step. The poeple of Calcutta should raise their voice against this injustice towards animals. No new animals should be acquired, expect perhaps a mate for the rhinoceros. The zoo should be turned into a sanctuary for endangered species and a part of the vast grounds converted into a botanical park for the public.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sona Murshed, Calcutta

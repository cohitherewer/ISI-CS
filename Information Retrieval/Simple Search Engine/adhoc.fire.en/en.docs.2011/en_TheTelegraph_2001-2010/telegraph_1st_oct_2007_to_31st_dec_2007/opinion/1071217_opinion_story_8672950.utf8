							 																						OLD TROUBLE
																														It is not clear which rebel group was behind last weeks bomb explosion in the Rajdhani Express in Assam. One tribal outfits claim that it was responsible for the blast may be more of a publicity stunt. But that is no reason for either New Delhi or Dispur to take Assams new tribal militancy lightly. On the contrary, recent events would suggest that the tribal people of the state are becoming increasingly restive. The horrific incident in which a tribal woman was stripped and chased on Guwahatis streets was darkly symbolic of the humiliation and insensitivity that Assams tribal people routinely face. There is hardly any justification for blaming any community for what was clearly a criminal act. But the chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, would do well to ensure that the guilty are punished in accordance with the law. More important, his government should try to understand why the tribal population felt so wronged and alienated not only over getting the scheduled tribes status for itself but also over missed economic opportunities. 
																														Unfortunately, Mr Gogoi and his party, the Congress, seem to take the tribal people for granted. They have been traditional voters of the party and the chief minister apparently thinks that nothing much has happened to change their political loyalties. That must be why he has reacted rather causally to the Assam Tea Tribes Students Associations call to boycott the forthcoming panchayat elections in the state. He would have done better to try and persuade the group to take part in the polls. In his narrow, partisan view, the boycott will not matter if it does not affect the Congresss electoral prospects. But the important thing is to ensure that the marginalized sections of the people participate in the democratic process. Keeping them out of it is a sure way of pushing them into militancy. There are disturbing reports about the Maoists from other states trying to lure Assams tribal groups into their ranks. Mr Gogoi needs to win tribal peoples hearts more than their votes.

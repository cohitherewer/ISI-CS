							 																						STAYING OUT																														In a free market of ideas and enterprise, questions about brain drain should hardly arise, much less worry. But the lopsidedness of the phenomenon in India continues to bother. A recent study into the career of doctors graduating from one of the premier medical institutes in India shows that more than half of them leave the country to seek opportunities abroad. This makes it difficult for India to either add to its health services or recover the expenses of their higher education. For the bright and ambitious, the choice of foreign pasture is not unusual given that the study of science, by the prime ministers own admission, remains dismal in India. As for the application of this study, the scenario is not much brighter, particularly when it comes to the medical sciences. The health sector in India remains a victim of mindless bureaucratic meddling, poor infrastructure, the nexus of the corrupt and the lack of committed manpower. The private sector has only been making a slow change, and that may be trying for many young doctors.																														Strangely, doctors from the general category at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences appear to be more impatient with the way things are run in India than those from the reserved categories, who seem to prefer to stay back. For AIIMS, which has reported gross discrimination against reserved category students, the import of the finding that looks at a 12-year trend, is ominous. Are the misgivings about the reservation policy then so deep-set as to have shaped career preferences for a decade? Has the ticket to the West become another stick to beat a section of the students with? A comprehensive study of the trend in other institutes of higher learning is needed to solve the mystery. But there can be no doubt about the governments responsibility in assuring a level playing field for all categories of students and professionals.

							 																						A DIFFICULT AND ANCIENT MALAISE				 - Lone pharmacist, damp corridors, wheezing children and prosperous quacks
				 						A DAY IN THE LIFE OF																														Kshitish Chandra Sinha has long been looking after the patients at the primary health centre in Rajarampur village in Murshidabad. He is a pharmacist acting on behalf of medical officers, who, according to Sinha himself and the patients, rarely, if ever, visit the centre. So Sinha has the unenviable task of checking over three hundred patients a day and prescribing medicines for ailments ranging from cough and cold to hepatitis. He is helped by Abu Bakkar, who is also a member of the group D staff like Sinha. 																														The way in which patients are treated in the PHC could have been described as quaint, if the issues at stake had not been those of life and death. Sinha calls the patients names, asks what is wrong with them and starts prescribing the medicine even before the patient has finished narrating the symptoms. The patient is then pushed to the adjoining window, from the other side of which Bakkar, perched atop a table, lazily hands over the medicine. Often Bakkar haggles with the patients because he will give no more than two pills at a time, no matter how serious the illness. 																														The automatic, almost unthinking way in which Sinha and Bakkar treat patients is not surprising. According to the stipulations of the state health department, they can choose from only 13 varieties of medicine. Our scepticism about Sinhas efficiency seems to disconcert him a bit, and he complains self-righteously that he is handicapped by the shortage of stock. 																														While Sinha cannot be credited with attempting his best with the patients, he cannot be blamed squarely either. As a pharmacist, he is clearly unequal to the task he is made to perform. The villagers have little faith in his capacity. They protest that Sinha prescribes the same pills for every disease on the few days he keeps the health centre open. 																														If the patients do not have the time or money to take the 30-minute bus ride to the nearest hospital in Lalgola, they visit the village doctors instead of coming to the health centre. The local doctors, most of whom are quacks, have managed to prosper in the towns and villages of Murshidabad mainly because of the poor condition of the public health service. The quacks find an easy target in the illiterate villagers who are repeatedly duped into taking their help in exchange of considerable sums of money.																														Quacks have a flourishing trade in the towns too. At the Behrampore bus stand, a group of rickshaw- pullers stand in wait for villagers arriving in town to consult reputed doctors. A rickshaw-puller would tell an unsuspecting villager that the doctor he is searching for is long dead and offer to take him to a quack with whom he is in cahoots. Sixty per cent of what the quack gets as fee from the patient goes to the rickshaw-puller, the rest is his.																														These shady doctors, who have their boards at every corner of Behrampore, treat any and every disease from gastritis to cancer. However, all of them appear to specialize in sexually transmitted diseases. Almost all the boards declare the proficiency of the doctors in treating what is euphemistically called jatil o puratan rog. Predictably, none of these doctors would speak to us. 																														One of the several women gathered in the dank corridors of the Rajarampur PHC carried a thin, wheezing child in her lap. She told us that she had been waiting for over three hours. On learning that we were from Calcutta, she held her child up and asked us if we could make it better. The desperation of the mother seemed to deliver a damning statement on the state of health and the health, or the lack of it, of the state of West Bengal.  ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

				 																Rallying cry					Sir  As a housewife and mother of two, it had never occurred to me to involve myself in things like protest marches. However, on November 14, I was encouraged by my son to participate in the citizens march from College Square to Esplanade (Clarion call of conscience heard in silent march through city heart, Nov 15). It was a very humbling experience and I am glad that I was a part of this massive show of protest against the terror in Nandigram. I was inspired by the sight of the senior citizens, who walked beside me  never once faltering in their step  and completed the entire stretch of the march. It was an emotional moment when thousands of citizens sat on the road and listened to accounts of the kind of torture that the cadre of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have been unleashing on the people of Nandigram. Medha Patkars rousing speech will forever be etched in my mind. I extend my thanks to the celebrities and organizers of the rally who cared enough to take time off and campaign for the Nandigram issue.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  The people of West Bengal now must ask all those who are playing the Nandigram card to the hilt, to stop the mindgames over Nandigram, at least for the sake of the people who are at the heart of the terror there. It is shocking that political parties, the media, the intelligentsia, minority groups  all have been interpreting the Nandigram issue according to their whims and in a manner that suits their interests. This is jeopardizing the lives of the inhabitants of Nandigram  those whom the activists are apparently trying to protect. No matter in what way they try to demonstrate their concern for these hapless people, each group in this political drama is acting out of self-interest. The Opposition is hoping to gain firmer ground, the ruling party to regain its authority, the media to increase viewership or readership and the so-called intellectuals to get some more limelight for themselves. They should all shut up and allow the villagers to reconcile their differences in their own way. The people of Nandigram are no guinea pigs for experimentation. There should be a limit to hypocrisy.					Yours faithfully,																															Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta					Sir  Although the citizens rally was supposedly devoid of political colour, it must be kept in mind that in a democratic country, everybody is committed to support one or the other political formation. It is not only our fundamental right, but also our democratic duty to cast our vote and choose the government we want. However, we are entitled to keep our political choice to ourselves, which is why the casting of the vote is allowed to take place inside an enclosed space. 					The celebrities of Calcutta, nevertheless, have made their choice very clear. But was it really necessary for these personalities to make their political convictions public? Especially, since they know that these are bound to sway the opinion of their followers? Mrinal Sen appears to have been the only intelligent person among the gathering of celebrities. He did not pledge allegiance to any particular group and chose to participate in both the citizens march and the CPI(M) rally. 					Yours faithfully,																															
Nupur Mitra, Calcutta

					Sir The rally of the so-called Left-leaning intellectuals organized by the CPI(M) on November 15 to counter the civilian rally on November 14 was a damp squib. It failed to match the November 14 rally in numbers despite people having been brought in on buses, minibuses and trucks in the true brigade-style political culture of the communist party. The CPI(M)-organized rally was attended by politicians like the part-time mayor of Calcutta, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, and the foul-mouthed sports minister, Subhas Chakraborty. Then there were the usual CPI(M) sympathizers like Soumitra Chatterjee and Biplab Chatterjee. A mention also must be made of the unpalatable comments made by Biman Bose, Benoy Konar and Shyamal Chakraborty, who went against all norms of discretion in condemning the judiciary, the media, the intellectuals and the state governor. Such misconduct by senior politicians sets a terrible precedent.					Yours faithfully,

					Parting shot					Sir The news of the French consulate coming back to Calcutta is no reason for the city to break into raptures (French consulate opening soon, Nov 19). French tourists abandoned Calcutta around 20 years back, which was also when Dominique Lapierres novel, The City of Joy, was published. Calcutta is described in the vilest of terms in Lapierres book. In France, The City of Joy is still a recommended primer for Calcutta. The best-selling international tourist guide, Lonely Planet, also recommends it. It is therefore no wonder that Calcutta remains outside Indias tourist trail. Prospective tourists are unlikely to be keen on stepping over rotting lepers on Calcuttas streets. Calcuttans, unfortunately, are oblivious to this insult. 					Yours faithfully,

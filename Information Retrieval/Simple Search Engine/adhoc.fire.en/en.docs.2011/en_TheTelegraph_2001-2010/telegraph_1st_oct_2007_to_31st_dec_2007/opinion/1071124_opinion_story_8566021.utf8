				 																Hold your tongue					Sir  Khushwant Singh may still wonder if Nargiss calling a woman not rape-worthy was unparliamentary, but the comment was certainly in bad taste (Brought back to life, Nov 17). This is especially so since Nargis tried to assess the rape-worthiness of the member of the opposition within the august house of the parliament. Was Nargis aware that the lady she snubbed was discussing an issue as serious as gang rape? Nargiss cheap comment was more suited to filmi cocktail parties than for the Rajya Sabha, which is known as the House of Elders.

					Dark clouds					Sir  Cyclone Sidr, which was supposed to strike Indias eastern coast, changed its course in the nick of time and hit Bangladesh instead (Killer cyclone toll hits 600: what Bengal escaped, Nov 17). It caused considerable damage to the already impoverished country. If the seriousness with which warnings were issued in West Bengal is anything to go by, then the state seems to have been well-prepared to face the storm. It is not known if Bangladesh had been as well-prepared as Bengal. Now hundreds are dead and thousands have gone missing there. 					While Indians cannot but rejoice that the cyclone spared them, they should spare some thought for their hapless neighbours. It is our duty to help the affected Bangladeshis all the more since we would have been in a similar situation had the storm not changed course. Political parties in Bengal should stop squabbling over Nandigram and turn their attention to the distressed people across the border. 					Yours faithfully,																															Nandini Saraf, Calcutta					
Sir  Just when the agitation over Nandigram was gaining momentum, Cyclone Sidr threatened to tear it asunder. Warnings from the media about its impending arrival, its overwhelming speed and the evacuation programme it necessitated served to turn attention away from Nandigram for some time. However, no sooner did the cyclone blow over than political parties started quarrelling over Nandigram with renewed vigour. 				 As news of the devastation caused by Sidr in Bangladesh pours in, we must realize what we escaped. Had the thrust of the cyclone fallen on coastal Bengal, as predicted by the meteorological department, the misery of the people in Bengals villages would have been multiplied several times over.					Yours faithfully,																															Arindam Ghosh, Nagpur					Sir  I was shocked to hear people suggest that the meteorological office overreacted in issuing a high alert over the approach of Sidr (Sidr Shift, Nov 17). One cannot be overcautious about cyclones, which, with their high-speed winds, can cause extensive damage. If Sidr had hit Bengal and had the authorities been lax in their preparedness, some of those who grumbled when the storm passed might not have been alive to complain.					Yours faithfully,

					Parting shot					Sir  I was appalled at the poor state of public service at the Chennai airport when I was there recently. The number of seats are insufficient for passengers inside the airport and there is no seating arrangement outside the lounge. This poses an acute problem for passengers who have to wait at the airport for some reason. I had to stand for hours while waiting to switch planes at the Chennai airport. I have to admit that the Calcutta airport is better equipped in this regard. But I wonder how an international airport like Chennai can remain so lackadaisical. 					Yours faithfully,																															N. Ramachandran, Durgapur

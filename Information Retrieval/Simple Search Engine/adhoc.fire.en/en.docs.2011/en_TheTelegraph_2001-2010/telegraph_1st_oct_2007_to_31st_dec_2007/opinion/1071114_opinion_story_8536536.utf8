				 																Inner voice				 																																																				Sir  We condemn the violence in Nandigram since November 6, 2007 which demonstrated, yet again, after the massacre of 14 March, 2007, the way in which the ruling party in West Bengal does not hesitate to use the State machinery to meet its own narrow political ends. The planned inaction of the police since November 6 and the cordoning off of a large area by CPI(M) cadre without any interference from the police were similar in kind to what happened on March 14. In both cases, the police acted as agents of the ruling party, something which goes completely against the norms of democratic governance.				 																																																				This nexus between the ruling party and the state machinery becomes clearer when we consider that the police inaction in Nandigram has been matched by excessive police enthusiasm in cracking down on citizens protesting peacefully in Calcutta. 				 																																																				We demand an immediate initiation of a just peace process in Nandigram, as distinct from an enforced normalcy. Such an initiative cannot take place without the restraining of ruling party cadre and mercenaries and ending the reign of terror that has been unleashed on the people. A just peace process, which will enable the people of Nandigram to return to their homes, must involve residents of Nandigram, as well as a broad-based peoples initiative.				 																																																				It is evident that the government has been complicit in creating a situation of terror in Nandigram. We hold the chief minister of West Bengal, who is also in charge of the police, directly accountable for this state of affairs. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  It is unfortunate that the governor of West Bengal has once again exceeded his constitutional powers by voicing his grievances through a statement given to the press (Governors fireworks, Nov 10). Instead of railing against the state government, he could have gone about guiding the authorities on how to restore peace in Nandigram and, if required, liaised with the Centre. Till the time Gopalkrishna Gandhi holds the post of the governor, he would not be able to make comments such as these, even though he is an independent citizen of this country. 				 																																																				So far, in his tenure as governor, Gandhi has made such press statements twice  once, after the police firing in Nandigram on March 14, and now, as the evicted people have started coming back to their homes. Unfortunately, on both occasions, his statements were considered to have a destabilizing effect on an elected state government of which he is the constitutional head. Questions have been raised as to why he chose to remain silent when Sankar Samanta, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s panchayat member from Sonachura, was brutally murdered in January this year by Trinamul goons. The people also have a right to know what happened to this conscientious governor when the Bhumi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee members murdered several supporters of the Left Front in the course of this year. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rana Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The line taken in the editorial, Rites of office (Nov 11), regarding the governors response to the killings in Nandigram is debatable. The anguish felt by Gopalkrishna Gandhi for the ordinary people in Nandigram is understandable. However, the governors statement should not give Opposition leaders such as Mamata Banerjee the licence to indulge in mudslinging and and to call strikes every other day. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has done the right thing by refusing to indulge in the kind of cheap blame-game that Banerjee prefers so much. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				 n Sir  The governor has responded to the anarchy in Nandigram by listening to his inner voice and expressing concern over the terror unleashed by the ruling party. The leadership at Alimuddin Street has not refuted press reports that CPI(M) cadre have recaptured most parts of Nandigram. Shockingly, the police remained mute spectators to this barbarity and stated that they did not have orders from the above to take action against the miscreants. This proves that the state government is terrorizing the people there to make them fall in line. Such an act calls for the imposition of presidents rule in West Bengal.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The governors statement on Nandigram was not only warranted, but could have even been stronger. The deliberate inaction of the state administration is not just shocking but also frightening. There were two armed groups fighting a territorial war in Nandigram. Both received political patronage, but that is no reason for the State not to act decisively to bring the situation under control. The political angle here is irrelevant. Rather, the violence in Nandigram should be treated as a clash between two illegally armed groups. It seems that CPI(M) functionaries in Calcutta were only too happy to see their private army rout their opponents. Hence, the administration did not step in to put an end to the bloodbath. Since the authorities failed to bring the situation under control, it is time the Centre pulled up the Bengal government on this count.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The governors reaction to the carnage in Nandigram is a fitting indictment on the state governments failure to contain the violence. The use of force by Marxist cadre needs to be condemned. However, at the same time, one must also take into consideration several other issues. First, the Centre has been shamefully ineffective in controlling the lawlessness in Nandigram. Presumably, the Congress is not too keen on annoying the CPI(M) to preserve the coalition government. Second, by not acting against CPI(M)s cadre, the police made it evident that the goons could do as they like. Finally, not a single minister from the party has criticized the government for its misdeeds.This perhaps is too much to expect as those in power have been fully indoctrinated by the Left into its mould.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.K. Das Sharma, Calcutta

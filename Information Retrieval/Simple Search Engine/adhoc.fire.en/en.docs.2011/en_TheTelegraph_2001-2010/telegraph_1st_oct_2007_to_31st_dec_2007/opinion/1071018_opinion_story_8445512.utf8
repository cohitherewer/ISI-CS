							 																						HUNGER STALKS																														There could, after all, be some substance in the prediction that a substantial part of India would turn into sub-Saharan Africa while the rest prospered like California as the country proceeded on the path of economic progress. The Global Hunger Index of 2007 shows that India ranks 94 in a list of 118 nations, and lags far behind both China and Pakistan in the eradication of hunger. For a country that boasts of a growth rate only second in the world this cannot be pleasant news. But this is not a bolt from the blue either. India has lived with the dark spots under its newly-acquired shine for a while now, and knowledge about its possible fate has allowed its canny political groups to shift their concerns from the well-hinged middle classes to the aam admi. But the scourge of poverty and hunger has an even wider spread. Its effect is felt mostly by the already unequal  the invisible poor, minority groups and women and children, who have little purchasing power and thereby little say in the choice of development goals. The juggernaut of progress has doubly inconvenienced them through its promotion of unequal growth, displacement, social distress and internecine violence, and the manifestation of this suffering in the escalating figures of starvation deaths and suicides.																														But it is perhaps unfair to put the blame on economic growth, which has its attendant social costs. It is for the government to try and reduce these costs for the governed. Unfortunately, India has not had much success on this score. Its mechanisms to deal with the problem are either defunct or dysfunctional. Take the public distribution system, which despite its recent restructuring, has failed to make food accessible to those below the poverty line. Indias distribution network is, in fact, so flawed that its foodgrains are allowed to rot in its godowns while people die of hunger. Hunger, however, is not a problem of the lack of food alone. As the reports figures on child mortality and malnutrition indicate, it is intrinsically associated with the lack of access to clean water, healthcare and the absence of environmental hygiene. Food scarcity again cannot be solved merely by agricultural growth. For agriculture to be sustainable for Indias burgeoning population, it has to be supplemented by an uninterrupted industrial drive. It is in the interests of both the government and the governed to realize this.

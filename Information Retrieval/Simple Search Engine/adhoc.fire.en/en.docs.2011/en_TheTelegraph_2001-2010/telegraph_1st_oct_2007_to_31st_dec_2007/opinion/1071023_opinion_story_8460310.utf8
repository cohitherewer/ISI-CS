							 																						FOR A FEW GOOD MEN AT THE GLOBAL TABLES The Commonwealth heads of state will elect a new secretary general in November, and the post could well go to the Indian nominee. But Krishnan Srinivasan wishes that India had a more coherent policy on its candidatures in international organizations				 	 Jawaharlal Nehru with other leaders and King George VI at the Commonwealth conference of prime ministers, Buckingham Palace, 1948																														India is not only a founder-member of the modern Commonwealth established after World War II, but it was also a key country ensuring the survival of the institution during the political changes that took place after the war. Nevertheless, after Jawaharlal Nehrus death, Indias pivotal position in the Commonwealth declined. As the number of Commonwealth members grew, with the accession to independence of a number of former British colonies, so the task of achieving consensus on political issues became more difficult. The organization lost its way in getting bogged down in contentious debates on racism and white minority rule in Rhodesia and southern Africa, and India played no part in the formulations of the major declarations on Commonwealth values issued in Singapore in 1971 and in Harare twenty years later.																														Over time, not only for India but for other Commonwealth members as well, the association slipped into the outer periphery of the preoccupations and policies of foreign ministries. For the majority of its members, the Commonwealth became little more than a procedural necessity at two-yearly intervals, when the attendance of Commonwealth leaders at their summit gatherings necessitated the preparation of briefing papers and drafting of speeches. 																														Indias role in the Commonwealth since Nehrus time lacked the energy and interest that might be expected from a founder-member and the biggest member of the association in terms of population  the capacity to contribute to Commonwealth values, and its potential to use the organization to serve its foreign policy objectives. Many informed and influential Indians regarded the Commonwealth as a rather puny affair, dispensing small change internationally and not significantly punching above its weight. 																														More important than any other country in the association in most respects, as the biggest democracy with nearly 60 per cent of the Commonwealths population, as one of the top five countries contributing to the organizations funds and among the foremost suppliers of consultants, technical experts and training places for capacity-building projects, India has so far been grossly under-represented in the secretariat because New Delhi never pressed its claim for a rightful share of the placements. It preferred the role of the lofty spectator to that of a contestant in a scramble for office.																														India has now laid claim to a leadership role that can restore to India its deserved profile in the association. In November this year, the Commonwealth heads of government will elect a new secretary-general for the association for the next four years, that is from 2008 to 2012.																														The Commonwealth has so far had four secretaries-general, representing all regions of the Commonwealth but not Asia. The first secretary-general was from Canada; the second from Guyana; the third from Nigeria; and the fourth and current one, from New Zealand. It is therefore expected that the next secretary-general should come from Asia. It is nowhere prescribed that there should be a geographical rotation system for this post, but this is patently an equitable arrangement for any organization that claims to have a global reach.																														India nominated a candidate six months in advance of the November meeting of the Commonwealth leaders. This was tardy, but not too late. The root cause of the belated reaction is that our government, even after 60 years of independence, has still not arrived at any coherent policy on its candidatures in international organizations. Many a time and at regular intervals, it has been proposed  and accepted  that the ministry of external affairs, together with a few other ministries directly involved with the work of global and regional organizations, should meet to agree on a long-term strategy, say over five to eight years, over which posts are due for election or appointment, and which of them are considered worthwhile for the national interest to be contested by India. Once the posts were identified, the next stage would be for the government to determine the best possible candidate for the post. Such a forward-looking strategy has never materialized, with the result that it is often the presumed candidate himself who is placed in the unfortunate position of bringing it to the attention of the government that a post is falling vacant, and that India should submit a candidature. 																														It is obvious that when the candidate himself has to persuade his own government to support him, New Delhi can fall into serious errors, not only in the selection of the candidate, but in the post being contested. The result of this situation is plain to see; candidatures are not supported by a national consensus, the campaigns are poorly thought out and badly implemented, the candidates have insufficient credibility, and we can note the failures in the past decade or so of our nominations to the highest posts in the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Asian group of the World Health Organization. It has been a long time since Indians have held the top position in any world organization like B.R. Sen in the FAO, S.S. Siddhu in the International Civil Aviation Organization and C.P. Srivastava in the International Maritime Organization.																														It is hardly surprising therefore that India has never held the highest position in any international political organization  as opposed to technical bodies. If the Indian candidate on this occasion is successful, it will be for the very first time since independence that an Indian will be the executive head of an international political body. 																														Despite the random nature of the selection of Indian candidates, the nomination of Kamalesh Sharma, the Indian high commissioner in London, is a credit-worthy choice, and he has several qualifications which India should turn to its benefit. It may be asserted that Sharma is not a political man, in the sense that he has not emerged from a political background, but those who use this argument ignore the fact that Arnold Smith and Emeka Anyaoku, two of the four Commonwealth secretaries-general so far, were also not from any political stable; nor were Kurt Waldheim or Kofi Annan, both two-term secretaries-general of the UN.																														Sharma has more solid multilateral credentials than any previous Commonwealth secretary-general, having served as permanent representative both at Geneva and New York, has been the UN secretary-generals special representative in Timor Leste, and was involved in the formulation of the UNs Millennium Development Goals. He is an architect of the important Monterrey consensus between the North and the South, has been closely associated with international development activities and gender-parity issues, and has enjoyed cooperative relations with the international civil society community. He has spent the past three years as Indias de facto permanent representative to the Commonwealth, advocating Indias active engagement with the organization.																														Holding the top executive post in an international organization which deals with political as well as economic and social matters will reflect positively on the country represented by the incumbent. It will heighten the countrys profile and contribute to the countrys self-image. It will assist in the projection of Indias globally beneficial soft power and enhance the nations credibility to be ranked among the top nations contributing to enlightened governance of the international system. It will therefore help in an indirect fashion to further all the objectives of the country to play the role expected from it, concomitant to its rise in world standing.																														The Commonwealth has no security council, no Chapter VII, no enforcement machinery, and no peace-keeping operations. It is a grouping best known for providing expertise and advice which are practical and in the best interests of its members. Small wonder that Nehru in 1947 had described it as this new type of association with a touch of healing. It could be said with justification that this orientation has defined the new Commonwealth.																														All the major communities of Indian origin outside India, with the single exception of the United States of America, reside in Commonwealth countries. The Commonwealth provides an extra channel through which India can reach out to persons of Indian origin. The considerable network of non-governmental and professional civil society bodies provides great scope for making rewarding contacts and promoting the national interest. An example of such activity is the four-yearly Commonwealth Games, the next edition of which are going taking place in New Delhi in 2010. Another is the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which is having its conference later this year, also in India. Indias participation in these governmental, semi-governmental and non-governmental activities will have added significance if India happens to hold the post of the organizations elected secretary-general.

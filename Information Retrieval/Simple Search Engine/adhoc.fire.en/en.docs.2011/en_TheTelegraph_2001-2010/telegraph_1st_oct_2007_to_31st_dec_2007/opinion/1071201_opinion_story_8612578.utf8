							 																						ENEMY OF PROMISE																														A crisis, according to ancient Chinese wisdom, is also a window of opportunity. It offers a chance to draw lessons, to distinguish between the symptoms and the disease and to take corrective steps to avoid a recurrence. There is no denying that in the last three months the Left Front government has been more beleaguered than it has ever been since 1977. The handling of the various events has not exactly covered the government with glory. Yet all this should not be allowed to deflect attention from one of the most fundamental issues facing the state and the people of West Bengal: the industrialization and the economic development of the state. Already there are voices from potential investors expressing their dissatisfaction with the performance of the government. They do not question the intentions of the government, but they have serious doubts about the governments ability to deliver on the promises made. In a competitive world, a delay in delivery is as good as no delivery. The slogan, do it now, once raised by the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seems to have disappeared down the trapdoor of party politics.																														It is not necessary to look very hard for examples. On Thursday, the legislative assembly of Maharashtra agreed to lift a 31-year-old urban land ceiling act. It thus freed 25,000 acres of vacant private land. This will enable the state of Maharashtra to take advantage of the funds available under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. A similar act has been awaiting clearance from the West Bengal government for nearly one year. In typical fashion, a committee has been appointed to look into the matter. A complacent urban development minister of West Bengal said reassuringly that the state had till 2012 to chew over the matter. Procrastination is thus preferable to speed. There is a temptation to suggest that there is something in the climate and the environment of West Bengal that makes the people here doze off whenever they hear mention of the word, speed.																														The point might appear frivolous, but is actually serious. What is it that makes people in West Bengal averse to work and to work fast? The erosion of work culture may partly be due to the irresponsible trade unionism sponsored and encouraged by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). But surely it would be simplistic to ascribe such an all-encompassing social phenomenon to the role of one political party, however powerful?																														The chief minister has reiterated his commitment to the project of industrialization. The path to that dream is by no means smooth. Mr Bhattacharjee must realize that apart from the political opposition that is expected, there is the problem of delivery, which is internal to his government. Ones own back garden is the best place to begin a process of cleaning up. Reforms, like charity, begin at home.

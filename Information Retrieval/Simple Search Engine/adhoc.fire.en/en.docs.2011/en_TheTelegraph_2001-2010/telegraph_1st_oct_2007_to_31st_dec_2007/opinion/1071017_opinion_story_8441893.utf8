							 																						DIFFICULT JOURNEY																														Even in this jet age, a pilgrimage remains a perilous journey. The alarming casualties reported from Indias pilgrimages now and then owing to stampedes or drowning attest to this inescapable reality, as do those from other important pilgrimages throughout the world. But why religious congregations alone? An awkward push or the most innocuous remark can have the most dangerous repercussions at any mass gathering, be it at a political meet that promises the free distribution of saris or in a queue for flood relief. The recent stampede at a temple in Gujarat that left at least 11 dead must have had some such trivial incident acting as the spur for such a gigantic tragedy. But the complicity of a larger chain of events in increasing the magnitude of the disaster cannot be underestimated. The administration in Gujarat, quite obviously, had not prepared itself for the volume of the crowd that had assembled to celebrate an unusually auspicious day at the temple. Departing from the norm of providing for a separate entry and exit, it had allowed pilgrims to walk up and down the same pathway despite its manifest dangers. The recalcitrance of the Archaeological Survey of India in giving permission for the widening of the pathway to the shrine made it impossible for the administration to try and control the situation when the need arose. The Gujarat incident is in many ways similar to that which occurred in Wai, Maharashtra, in 2005, where the narrow entrance severely jeopardized rescue operations after a stampede, leading to the death of around 300 people. It is unfortunate that the administration seems to have learnt nothing from the tragedy, and may continue to remain blind to the lessons from Gujarat.																														It is undoubted that religious assemblies are invariably a test of the competence of the secular State and even the administrative acumen of the temple authorities. The people may resent too much administrative control, but the success of a pilgrimage often depends on it. Methodical crowd management has allowed Kumbh Melas to remain free of large-scale disasters for a while. Again, the installation of sophisticated mechanisms of queue regulation at a hill temple in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh, by the temple management has enabled a problem-free spiritual experience. Devotees may continue to blame their destiny when a pilgrimage turns disastrous. There is no reason the administration should do the same.

							 																						GET REAL																														The twin blasts in Pakistan have done for Benazir Bhutto what would have taken her months to accomplish. They have turned her into a martyr for the cause of democracy and turned public sympathy in favour of a leader who, not too long ago, had attracted much derision for striking a deal with a dictator. Ms Bhutto has announced severally since the carnage that she was aware of the dangers to her life when she returned to Pakistan and undertook the triumphant march towards the tomb of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. And now, despite the looming threats, she is ready to start her campaign from Larkana for the return of democracy. Defiance of the threat to life is surely more honourable than defiance of the threat of arrest and deportment. Ms Bhutto naturally scores over her chief contender, Nawaz Sharif, who still has no option but to watch the swift turn of events from distant shores. That is, until the supreme court plays the spoiler, strikes down Ms Bhuttos reconciliation with autocracy, and paves the way for Mr Sharifs return for a democratic contest. Till then, Ms Bhutto can hope to capitalize on the sudden surge of emotions for her. Together with her pointed campaign for the common man, she can even make headway before the supreme court knows its mind and the General finds ammunition to fight the gathering storm.																														But there are indications that Ms Bhutto is labouring from a severely compromised position. This was evident from the way she changed tack and placed the blame for the blasts on supporters of a former dictator and their use of terrorists, instead of directly accusing the Pervez Musharraf administration for an intelligence failure. Ms Bhutto obviously sees a divided army, one half friendly towards her, the other half antagonistic. But if the blasts were the handiwork of oligarchs fearful that democracy would loosen their hold on power, need she be concerning herself only with the threat from Zia-ul-Haq loyalists? Would the General and his armymen allow a Bhutto-inspired democratic awakening to wash them off their feet? Ms Bhutto may try to remain blind to it, but political power, even in the kind of democracy she is planning for the country, will remain with the elite. If she wishes her people to have true democracy, Pakistans army to be purged of traitors, its borders to be cleared of terrorists and its trade to reach an unprecedented high, Ms Bhutto has to get more realistic, and a little more brave.

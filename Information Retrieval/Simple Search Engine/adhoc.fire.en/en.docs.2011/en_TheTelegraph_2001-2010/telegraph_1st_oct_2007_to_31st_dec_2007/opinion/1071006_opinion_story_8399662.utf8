							 																						TO LOOK INTO THE SOUL OF A CITY				 photography Sujoy Das																					Advertising photographer Pradeep Dasgupta took to the streets of New York in 2004 and 2005 to escape his advertising anchors of manipulated images, slick lighting and crafty compositions. NY: Below the Belt, which ended at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre on September 27, included black-and-white prints, which were shot off the hip, using both lighting and contrast with great dexterity to bare the soul of the city. 																					These are not pretty postcard photographs  there are no sunny views of the New York skyline or Central Park. Rather, the collection depicts gritty slices of life from the streets. The photographs have not been captioned and this allows the viewers to focus on the subject without any distraction. Dasgupta uses dramatic perspectives in familiar locations to convert the mundane into the exciting. 																					The images are unconventional, to say the least. Dasgupta breaks most of the rules. In many of the photographs, he cuts off faces shooting literally below the belt. Hand-held photography is taken to its limits. The images are shot inside crowded subways, cafs and theatres in low light where both camera-shake and blur create interesting effects. As a result, Dasgupta is often shooting on the edge, being forced to use wide apertures and shallow depth of field. Using digital technology, he stitches together images to create large panoramic prints of a certain depth and presence which will no doubt be questioned by the purists. 																					Shapely legs with stiletto high heels mirrored in rainy streets, workers chatting before an office with a suited employee staring at the camera (picture), all stand out. The pice de rsistance is an exquisite shot, captured from above, of three people walking out of the shadows together into the sunlight. Dasgupta uses reflections to his advantage and often shoots through glass and windows to leave an impression of fluid motion. However, a number of photographs of people walking in the streets appear a trifle overdone. Dasgupta uses the camera as a mere tool. The real lens is his minds eye, which sees New York as vibrant and alive. This is street photography in the truest sense: candid and swift.

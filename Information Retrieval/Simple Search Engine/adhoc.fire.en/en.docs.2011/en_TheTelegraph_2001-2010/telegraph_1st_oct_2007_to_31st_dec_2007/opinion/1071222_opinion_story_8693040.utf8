							 																						SEEKING BEYOND THE SELF
 This above all - 
Khushwant Singh
																					Till I read an article by Osho Rajnish it had not occurred to me that most of us spend a lot of time comparing ourselves to others. We envy those who are doing better, feel superior to those who are not doing as well as us. In both cases, these have negative results: one gives us a superiority complex, the other an inferiority complex. Neither is good for mental equilibrium. Therefore stop comparing yourself with others: comparisons are odious.
																					I believe that the itch to compare oneself with others is an aspect of the ego problem. The more one thinks of onself, the more the desire. Ego is, as Guru Nanak said: Deeragh roag  a foul disease. In it also lies its cure: Daroo bhee iss maahein  use your will power to get the better of it. Make your own prescription for the medicine and take it in regular doses. If your self-made prescription goes wrong, it can worsen your condition. I have a most amusing example given to me by Dharma Kumar, one of the brightest brains and a mimic I met in my life. She died a few years ago. I keep her photograph on a table facing me. Her story was about a cousin who was exceptionally good at studies  a topper in school and college who won a full scholarship to Oxford University, where he again got a First and was elected president of the Oxford Union. He was also somewhat of a guru and had a number of admiring students as his chelas, who came to hear his pravachans. He told them about the problems caused by the ego and the necessity of overcoming it. One day a female disciple asked him, Sir, I agree with you about the ego, but tell us how one goes about conquering it.
																					Good question! replied Guruji. With my background it poses a bigger problem for me than it does for you people. I have devised a formula for the extinction of the ego. Morning and evening I sit in padmasana (lotus pose), shut my eyes and repeat: I am not Raghavan Iyer who stood first in the matriculation examination in Madras. I am not Raghavan Iyer who stood first in all exams in college. I am not Raghavan Iyer who got a first class first from Oxford University.
																					I am not Raghavan Iyer, the most brilliant philosopher from the Orient.
																					I am merely a spark of the Divine.
																					In the evening recitation, he changed the last line to, I am merely a vehicle of the Mahatmas.
																					It is said that though he agreed to have his name put up for the president of Oxford Union, he did not bother to canvas for himself; his admirers did that and saw that he won. When the result was announced, they rushed to his room to break the good news. He was in deep meditation. He took his time before opening his eyes. With a beatific smile on his face, he pointed his index finger heavenwards and proclaimed solemnly Victory is thine, O Lord.
																					This is exactly what an exercise for self-extinction should not be.
																					Visionary zeal
																					Schools are more important than temples. We have plenty of temples but millions of our children remain neglected. So every gurdwara I build, I make sure that there is a school attached to it. This coming from a 67-year-old man who can read and write only Gurmukhi, and has spent most of his years reciting Gurubani and performing keertans, was a pleasant surprise. The man I am writing about is Amar Singh Barundi Waley. He lost both his parents when he was only eight. His guardian decided to train him as a sevadar (servitor), preacher of Gurbani and raagi (hymn singer). His dedication to his work earned him respect in towns and villages around Jagraon and Ludhiana. From Bhai Amar Singh he became Baba Amar Singh to Sant Amar Singh to Sant Baba Amar Singh Ji Barundi Waley. He had helped building schools across India and England, including one at Malegaon for Muslim girls. He is as secular a man of religion as I have met.
																					He continues to have his feet firmly in the past while his vision is of the future. He sat by me  flowing white beard, while I sipped my Scotch and munched canaps. I asked him what his next venture was going to be. He replied, I am going to start an air service from Amritsar to Nanded. Most Sikhs give top priority to two places for pilgrimage  Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar, Hazoor Sahib in Nanded. Getting to Nanded by rail and road is tedious. So while the government is making an air strip not far from the gurdwara, I will organize an air service. Within two hours after leaving Amritsar in the morning, picking up others from Delhi, pilgrims will get to their destination by the afternoon. Pilgrim flights are expected to start operations by next year.

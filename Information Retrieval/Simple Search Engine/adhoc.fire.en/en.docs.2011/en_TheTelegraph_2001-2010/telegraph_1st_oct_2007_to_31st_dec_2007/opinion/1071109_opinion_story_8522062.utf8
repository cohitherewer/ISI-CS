							 																						KILLING THEM YOUNG Malvika Singh																					Schools have ceased to be safe for children. This is an indicator of the breakdown of civil society and its moral values, as well as of governance. The killings are not an isolated incident, but the response from law enforcement authorities has been pathetic and insufficient. Is it because the kids, who are being killed mercilessly, belong to the lower rungs of society?																					Most of the teachers are incompetent and poorly trained. Hence, the education system ends up churning out millions of students who are incapable of thinking beyond the book. This has led to the creation of a generation which is unread and unable to write engagingly, disinterested in playing with new ideas, unwilling to experiment, and with an attention span that is only capable of absorbing banal sound bites from airwaves. The young men and women belonging to the electronic media space reflect the frightening fall in intellectual standards of the media.																					When a language is mutilated and pushed to the brink, the culture in which it once flourished also begins to die. Uttar Pradesh lost Urdu, and its famed culture was replaced by what we see today. Whenever people like myself criticize the misuse of English, I am told that in India, English has evolved and become Hinglish! This is sad but true. The environment around us, the cities we live in, as well as our values and ethics are fast becoming unrecognizable.																					Dumbed down																					One example of this is the fake American accents that abound in the living rooms of the upper middle-class. Some of these men and women may not even know anything about America, its history or culture. This is what makes us an imitative urban society at sea, having lost its anchor while attempting to ape things that are totally alien to its roots and traditions.																					Bouyant social growth and generational change can only be built on the foundation of strong traditional roots. However, the horrid quick-fix approach that has overtaken us in India is desperately simplistic and destroys the essence of our tried-and-tested civilization. India is, unfortunately, going through the painful process of having to deal with the practice of using half-baked information and knowledge. The lack of intellectual discipline, limited professional demands, no real accountability, sub-standard leadership et al, have contributed to the degradation of our mind space.																					It makes one squirm to see unlettered, cocky newspersons strut about urban India pretending to be little oracles, without realizing that their cover is constantly being exposed by their poor reporting and analysis skills. The plethora of television channels and their need to employ pretty and some not-so-pretty faces have lowered the benchmark. The dumbing down syndrome that has invaded our lives is a direct result of the infectious killer virus that is spreading from our academic institutions.																					Teachers carry a contagious disease which debilitates and disables pupils who go out into the big, bad world. The students are compelled to use only their instinct and not their minds when dealing with life and survival. No norms are respected, no rules applied, and collective responses are not saluted. Each to his own evidently has taken over as the overriding factor in our lives. We are being left behind in this energetic information age.

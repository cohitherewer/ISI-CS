							 																						JUST A VISIT																														The state womens commission of West Bengal has moved. Nine members of the commission went to visit Priyanka Todi in her fathers house when concern for the bereaved girls well-being was being expressed with increasing frequency by the people. The commission, whenever it has been criticized for inaction earlier, has said that it cannot conduct inspection and inquiry till a specific situation is brought to it. This may be the reason it waited so long after the tragedy to talk to her. Someone must have at last asked the commission to visit the girl. It would have been nice to know whose request the commission was responding to. The purpose of the commissions visit, it would seem from the statements the members have given, was evidently not to make any inquiries beyond Ms Todis well-being. According to them, Ms Todi is grief-stricken, she would like to know the truth about her husbands death, but she is free to move around and would prefer to stay in her fathers house.																														The members of the commission have conveyed that they treated Ms Todi with the care accorded socially to the grieving. The awkwardness was inherent in the territory chosen for the meeting; the sensitiveness of Ms Todis position would normally eliminate Ashok Todis house as a venue for any serious discussion about her situation. But the commission had just gone to see how she was, as the members said later. Many governments, and not just in India, have commissions, sometimes to look at womens issues, sometimes human rights. These are often peopled with members of whose loyalties the particular government can be confident. Much of the function of such commissions is palliative, at least from the point of view of the State. The state womens commissions visit may also have palliated the peoples worries about Ms Todis situation. But in the bland and gentle presentation of the interview with Ms Todi, the commission has erased the tragic complexities within which she must find herself. No one can know better than the members of a commission dealing with the predicaments of women what the results of such an erasure can be, especially when an amorphous and excited anger is simmering among the people. It takes no divine inspiration to see that a change of direction of at least part of this anger might serve the interests of its prime targets at the moment. Ms Todi needs to be protected in more ways than one.

				 																American dream, Indian reality				 																																																				Sir  Does Bobby Jindal deserve the kind of coverage that the Indian media is giving him? Jindals parents left India lured by the American dream. First, the family disowned their homeland and then the Hindu faith. After his marriage, Jindal is known to have made his wife convert to Christianity. Now he and his family go to church on Sundays like any other white family in Louisiana. Now that the nuclear deal is uncertain, Jindal is finally feeling concerned about India. Sadly, the Indian media prefers him to those who stayed back and contributed to Indias progress.

				 																Bungle in the jungle				 																																																				Sir  The death of five Asiatic lions by electrocution shows that Indians remain largely insensitive towards issues of wildlife preservation (Live fence kills 5 lions, Oct 20). Their ignorance is partly the result of a lack of general awareness in our society about how invaluable the wildlife is to our eco-system. That a farmer himself had to take the law in his own hands reveals how our wildlife policies are still far from successful in meeting their goals. The authorities of the Gir sanctuary appear unaware of their responsibilities. Had they been more careful, this unfortunate incident would never have happened. It must be investigated why the wild cats tend to veer into human habitat and how they could be restrained without using drastic measures like live-wire fencing. Despite a number of policies drawn up at the expense of the taxpayer, poachers continue to enjoy a free run, wild animals are killed by speeding vehicles or by falling into wells, or simply dying under unexplained circumstances. The reality is that till date, wildlife awareness has remained confined to seminars and symposiums that do nothing to make the elaborate policies work on the ground.

				 																																																				Sir  With reference to the death of five lions in the Gir sanctuary, one must confess to being alarmed by the way in which wild animals continue to be hounded by human beings in a developing country like India. Mere punishment to the offenders is not going to bring us back these beautiful creatures, some of which are on the verge of extinction. Special care needs to be taken to set up more protected and well-run wildlife sanctuaries, in order to ensure a safe and natural habitat for these creatures. The government should keep a strict count of the number of existing animals in these places and monitor the conditions in which they live. Perhaps a separate Union ministry for wildlife could be established for this purpose. It is also important not to turn these sanctuaries into profitable tourist spots and thus to expose the animals to poachers and other criminals.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  According to the Wildlife Protection Society, 32 lions have died last year in the Gir national park alone. This, by any measure, is a shocking figure. Moreover, how could the authorities remain ignorant of the fact that farmers had installed live-wire fences to keep lions from straying into human habitations? 				 																																																				The local people must have complained about the straying lions previously, and decided to take things into their own hands only after that. The concerned departments should have taken pre-emptive measures to relocate the animals. This would have spared the lives of the five lions. Many poachers take advantage of the casual and uncaring attitude of the government and continue making good business by murdering wild animals. The Centre must ensure proper surveillance of wildlife in the country so that our precious animals do not face the threat of extinction.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

							 																						SAILING OUT TO NOWHERE MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH																					The All India Congress Committee session in Delhi, on November 17, was significant compared to other such sessions, but as always, went without much comment in the media. However, if one were to delve a little deeper into what Sonia Gandhi said, and throw the predictable cynicism about the Congress Party aside, what seems to be emerging is a sense that the party is looking to reinvent itself. It is trying to organize itself to bring back into its ideological fold some of the basic tenets  beliefs, ideas and most importantly, their honest implementation  that it has lost over the last few decades, as it diluted and destroyed itself into a rudderless and overloaded ship, weighed down with redundant baggage, both in terms of thought and action.																					Whether the party members are equipped to think and operate out of the comfort of the old and rusted box, one cannot say, but here is another opportunity for the members of the party to assert themselves, to add value and intellectual energy, to participate actively and ensure the possible move forward. The time has come to end the status quo and celebrate experience. 																					The excitement now lies in risk-taking, extending the existing paradigm, breaking the barriers which have dwarfed a party that once went through the rigours and trials of a mass movement that eased out an imperial power using non-violent agitation. Selfish interests and exploitation of the poor, the treacherous caste system, diverse faiths, and plural cultures have degraded the administration of this country.																					Ray of hope																					Indians are waiting, with suppressed impatience, for a leader with a fresh and clean mind, and a commitment that can be trusted, to work at new experiments with the socio-economic and political space. Only such a visionary would be able to alter the failing governance that we see around us and bring dignity into the lives of millions. The lost faith has to be restored. Leaders have to reach out, once again, like they had done decades ago, across social boundaries, and draw in the support and participation of another generation, one that is the product of this new millennium.																					The need to cut down the misuse of resources is imperative because the administrative machine, with hundreds of redundant employees, has killed all accountability and welcomed a parasitic culture. If a conscious correction is not brought into play in a structured fashion, the results could be devastating and disabling. That is when the new set of thugs will dominate, threaten, blackmail and extort. Instead, we need to pass the baton and let go, force a sane and finely calibrated transition which is bound to take some years but which is imperative for Bharat.																					If it is correct to assume that the Congress is at a crossroads, much like after the Mumbai AICC session, then it must ensure that its leaders and workers step out of their urbane settings and embark upon a Bharat-darshan, even if only to acquaint themselves with the truth on the ground. If necessary, they should learn the ropes of good governance by moving away from the treasury benches, learn to be responsible and committed political workers. The priority should be to reach out first and then fight to rule! 																					Congressmen and women have been twittering through the last weekend about the anointing of the heir. Their annoyance and irritation, as always, were shown and loudly declaimed outside the portals of their party, and never from within, where they remain mute, hypocritical courtiers, saluting those they readily abuse. They are unable to speak, debate, discuss or actively participate in party work but are adept at party politics. 37-year-old Rahul Gandhi has had the nerve, at this juncture, to commit himself to reinventing the Congress and deserves to be applauded.

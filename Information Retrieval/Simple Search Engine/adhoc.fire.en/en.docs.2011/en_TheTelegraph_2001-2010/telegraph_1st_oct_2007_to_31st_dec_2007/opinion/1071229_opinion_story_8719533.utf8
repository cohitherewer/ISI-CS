							 																						SIGN OF DEATH
																														A political assassination, it has been famously remarked by the social analyst, Ashis Nandy, is a joint communiqu. It is always a joint statement between the assassin and the victim. The point is readily recognized in the light of recent events. If Benazir Bhutto had chosen to remain in exile, she would, in all probability, be still alive. She signed the communiqu the moment she came back to Pakistan. To take another example, if Indira Gandhi had listened to some of her security advisors and removed her Sikh bodyguards, she could have escaped a gruesome death. In both cases, two remarkable women with innumerable enemies and with the shadow of death on them, decided to do what they thought was right and thus courted death. The point needs no further elaboration.
																														What the observation does not explain is why should such joint statements concerning violence emanate in such large numbers from countries that make up the sub-continent of south Asia. Political assassinations have proliferated in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. Each of these countries has lost very prominent leaders to assassins bullets. This narrative of political murders, in fact, began, with the coming of independence to these countries. Very early, before violence became an order of life in Pakistan, Liaqat Ali Khan, the first prime minister, was murdered in 1951. In India, the apostle of non-violence met a brutal death at the hands of a Hindu fanatic. In Sri Lanka, in 1959, Solomon Bandaranaike, the president, was killed. In the Seventies, the newly-formed state, Bangladesh, as if to show that it too was following the subcontinental trend, saw the murder of its first president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, on August 15, 1975. This was followed by the assassination of another president, Zia-ur-Rahman, in 1981. India followed suit with the killings of the two Gandhis, mother and son, Indira and Rajiv. The list of political assassinations (the above only gives some of the major ones) is long and enough to make anyone despair about the prospects of a mature democratic polity in the region.
																														Any analysis of this phenomenon must begin by nailing the myth that Indians (and the reference here is to all those who live in the subcontinent) are essentially non-violent. Persons belonging to various religious groups have chosen the assassination route to either assert their rights or to demonstrate their protest. This may have something to do with the fact that democracy and government by discussion have shallow roots in the political praxis of south Asia. The depth of the roots, or the lack of them, varies, of course, from country to country. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, where democracy has little or no roots, the propensity to reach for the gun to settle a political difference is more pronounced than, say, in India where democracy, despite lacunae, has a robust presence. Even in India, the violent route is being sought by a larger number of people than before.
																														What is ironic, especially in the examples of Indira Gandhi and her son, is the fact that both were victims of political trends that they themselves had created and nurtured. They actually wrote the joint communiqu with death which they then went on to sign. In the case of Indias neighbours, religious fundamentalism and military authoritarianism have been the principal causes of violence directed at individual political leaders. Bhutto is the latest victim, but political violence may claim others who can sign, wittingly or otherwise, a pact with death. Political assassination is a short cut that is, for some, difficult to resist.

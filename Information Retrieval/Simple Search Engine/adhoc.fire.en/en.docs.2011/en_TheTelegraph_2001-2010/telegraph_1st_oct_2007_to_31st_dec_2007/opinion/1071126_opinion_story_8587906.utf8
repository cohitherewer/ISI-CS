							 																						VALUABLE CARGO																														There are no Important Persons in India; the designation would be too insulting. There are Very Important Persons, and Very Very Important Persons. Very Important Persons are carried free by government airlines in the front row of the first class. However, insult is not thereby excluded. More than one Very Important Person is often booked on a flight, and issues of precedence arise. The result is that many a Very Important Person has been humiliated and found himself seated in the extreme right seat of the second row. So most Very Important Persons nowadays find some way of favouring or frightening the chief of a private airline and earn the right to the front left seat on it. 																														Very Very Important Persons do not face such hazards, for they are transported in helicopters by the air force. They can choose their company, whether of a wife, beloved, escort, or all three. The helicopters are adapted Mig-8 and Mig-17 gunships, originally designed to gun down Afghan insurgents. These gunships are now getting a bit old. They date back to the Eighties; the probability is rising that one of them may stall and a Very Valuable Life may be lost. So the air force has been looking for a replacement. Unfortunately, no manufacturer in the world is prepared to make the helicopter that the air force wants at the price it would like to pay. The order is too small, and providing the president the required luxury in so few helicopters is too costly. VVIPs are not otherwise distinguished or valuable; but they are the totems of our system. So the defence ministry will be inclined to pay the price Sikorsky or Agusta is asking for. But there is an alternative, which may be more economical and useful to the country. 																														It is to import small executive aircraft such as Cessna. These are one-tenth the price of a helicopter; if the government places a bulk order, it will get a huge discount. They can be bought in such numbers that all VIPs can be transported in them, relieving the front seats and improving the bottom line of all airlines. They can be fitted up to whatever standards of luxury the VIPs want. And, above all, they have no security implications, and therefore can be acquired by the rapidly expanding class of Indias Very Rich Persons. If these thousands of VRPs get little planes, they will clog up the airports, which are already congested. However, small planes do not require such long runways; airports for them can be developed in much larger numbers and close to city centres. The runways can be elevated and built just like highways. Small planes will require many more pilots; but they are also ideal for training pilots. And if demand for small planes emerges, our car-makers will be the first to design and manufacture some.

							 																						PRETTY PICTURES, BROKEN FORMS Soumitra Das											 			 Visual Arts																														Two painters and one senior sculptor, who have little in common, recently got together to organize an exhibition titled Glimpses amp; Traces at the Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture. Sculptor Sankar Ghosh needs no introduction. While most of his exhibits were run-of-the-mill, the portrait of the woman with a dented head was exceptional. Ghosh is a seasoned enough sculptor to break form with confidence. 																														Artists inspired by nationalism had made it a point to make copies of ancient Indian sculpture. Some artists continue that practice, if only because those beautiful faces of deities make a pretty picture. Rahul Tarafder has done just that. His paintings look almost like photographs. But despite his skill he hardly makes an impression. 																														Arunangshu Roy cannot be described as a pathbreaker. Although his ideas are not terribly original, at least he has tried to be different. He seems partly to have been inspired by modernists of the West and by Satish Gujrals decorative works. Many of his works are built around the threat that the male genital apparently holds, and he uses it as a symbol of violence and aggression in his depiction of the deity endowed thus. 																														There is a touch of humour in Roys image as he makes use of some familiar Kalighat pata pictures, albeit with a quirk that he himself introduces. The painting of the man and woman sitting side by side shows that Roy can comfortably distort form, and he does so with panache. However, he is clearly impressed by German Expressionists and copies them wholesale.

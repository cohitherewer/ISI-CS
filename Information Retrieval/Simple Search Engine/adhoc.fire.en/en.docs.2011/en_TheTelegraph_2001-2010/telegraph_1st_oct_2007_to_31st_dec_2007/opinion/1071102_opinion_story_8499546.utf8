							 																						UNWILLING ADVENTURERS INTO CHAOS AND SUNLIGHT																																																													Starbook: A Magical Tale of Love and Regeneration By Ben Okri, Rider, 6.00																														The stories that our mothers begin to tell us when we are children seldom come to an end. Sometimes their tellers are dead and cold before the tales are over  so, the narrator of Starbook explains, we glean the rest from the book of life among the stars. Or else, dead ourselves but haunted by the love and grief of our parents, we become  like Azaro, the spirit-child in Ben Okris Booker-winning novel, The Famished Road  an unwilling adventurer into chaos and sunlight, into the dreams of the living and the dead.																														In his new novel, Okri assays impossible heights and depths to invoke a mythical past, a temporal frame of reference that surpasses both human and historical time. The setting, ostensibly, is Africa. But in this land of yam, cassava and towering baobab trees, ancient and obscure tribes inhabit invisible realms between heaven and earth. Here a cold white wind blows all over and begins to erase hills and valleysthe memories of peoplevillages and towns, leaving gaps everywhere. In this land, there are many enigmas: a master artist, who creates a work of art that is beyond art; a prince who dies of a kind of fatal happiness; and his beloved, a maiden, who falls ill from an inability of life to be as fascinating or to be as mysterious as art.																														Okri connects these three characters to a great chain of dreams and realities, of narratives and images, using his prodigious imagination  an imagination that is replenished continually with the strangest myths, folklores and charms. As in Famished Road, Okri creates a labyrinth of stories  fluidly interlaced, sometimes incomplete. It is difficult to escape the oppressive hold of these tales, even as one feels exasperated by their inconclusiveness, their rough edges and unfinished destinies. On every other page, one encounters long, claustrophobic passages: a sudden gush of images, words and feverish action, followed by a delicate and detailed unfurling of events. One feels hounded, as one would inside Piranesis prisonhouses of the imagination. 																														With its sprawling structure and linguistic exuberance, this work, teeming with men and monsters, reminds us of One Hundred Years of Solitude. Yet the dizziness that one feels as one tries to wade through this whirlpool of fantasies never quite manages to turn into unqualified admiration. Unlike Garca Mrquezs masterpiece, one does not feel sufficiently engaged with Starbook, one is not transformed or touched by an enduring wisdom.																														It is possible to succumb to the trappings of these myriad tales, to lose oneself in the casual indirection of the plot and be enchanted by the veneer of mysticism that pervades the book. Yet, despite its audacious attempt at complexity, Starbook remains, essentially, a fairy-tale romance between a prince with doe-like eyes of liquid sadness and a maiden who was born into a tribe of artists living invisibly, like the heron, always on the move, but always perfectly still when fishing for inspiration that will be revealed in their art.																														The forever absent, yet omnipresent heron  a bird of sublime and unfathomable grandeur is the presiding genius of the novel. It is, figuratively, the destiny that unites the prince and his maiden, as well as Okri and his readers. 																														This spirit-bird is first beheld by the prince, who, like the Buddha, had ventured outside his kingdom to know the origins of evil in the world. Soon, he is fixated on the regal, self-aware gaze of the heron  a bird innately aware of the fact that to survive in the world you must not overly dazzle out your brilliance, otherwise you wouldnt catch true fish, and you would be hunted for your beauty. This beautiful creature teaches its beholder the importance of looking deep, of staying unfailingly faithful to the object of his quest, and to remain valiant in the face of an epic battle for attention.																														Between Okri and his readers, another difficult, psychic tussle takes place: the writing starts resembling the heron increasingly, becoming at once profoundly self-aware and intensely self-contained. The narratorial voice quivers with several registers  lucid, frivolous, deranged, puzzled, and always unapologetic in its mysticism. It becomes a Herculean task to decipher the shifts in tone, the ways in which different modes of representation  tragic, comic and epic  overlap, diffuse and become virtually indistinguishable from one another.																														Along with the modes, methods of representation shift as well. Okri begins with a feat of literary description  of unheard people living in unknown places  but soon turns to another kind of linguistic activity. He becomes increasingly obsessed with describing the infinite delicacy, the ferocious and sublime power of certain works of art that should be seen only by initiates and strong-souled masters and then kept in silence for generations for their power to be changed by time into the gold of their highest fruition. 																														Struggling to capture the exquisite splendour of these art forms, Okri realizes that it is possible to capture their brilliance only through the most elusive language. The statue of the dying prince made by the maiden thus becomes most poignant as a dream of beauty and piety in wood. This continuing struggle between different forms of creativity is played out most extensively inside the workshop of the enigmatic master. Like Prospero, he had kept his daughter  the beautiful maiden  hidden and apart, silently passing on his vast and esoteric knowledge in her dreams. Inside this magic room, he is helped by an army of invisible spirits and a remarkably unobtrusive apprentice with no interest in creating art because he wants to become an art, he is like a master who cherishes lowliness. 																														This is actually the prince in disguise, existing like a living statue among figures in wood and stone. In his most ambitious moments, Okri aspires to the condition of the princes heron-like self-effacement, trying to be most eloquent while saying the least. However, without the right kind of restraint, such an effort risks becoming a form of intense self-absorption, something from which Okris prose is not entirely free.						SOMAK GHOSHAL

							 																						WHO WILL FEED THE CAT?																														Maya Mukherjee has not heard about the proposed parents and senior citizens bill, 2007. She hasnt had the time, she tells me, busy as she is with her daily chores. There is a lot to do, even at my age, she says, glancing around her tidy drawing room. One almost wishes that the hectic life she refers to were real.																														She then talks about her duties. Her voice is low, as if letting out a secret. The potted plants on the balcony need constant care, she says. Then, there are her friends, two of them, a scruffy brown cat and an unkempt crow. She prepares their food every morning. They are fussy eaters, she says fondly. Her children visit her too, although not as frequently as she would like them to. Her husband, she says, is a temperamental, difficult man.																														Maya is 72 years old. She has been married for over forty years, and has three children. She agrees that growing old can be difficult. So there is a case for protecting elderly citizens from abuse. A bill to that effect would certainly be welcome. I tell her about the piece of legislation and some of its salient features. She listens carefully, her brows knitted together. There is a serious, contemplative look about her. After I finish, she relaxes, leans back in her chair, and begins to speak.																														It is apparent that she is uncomfortable with the proposed legislation. The possibility of elderly parents taking recourse to the law against their own children seems preposterous. Lojja korbe na bolo (Wouldnt that be shameful)? she asks earnestly. 																														Money, in the form of a stipulated monthly allowance, is a critical requirement, she admits. But that should not come at the cost of happiness. The problems affecting Indias burgeoning elderly population, she feels, were always there, even during her grandparents time. But, she says, proud for one fleeting moment, they saw no reason to settle their disputes in court. Love and respect had done the trick, not the law.																														This septuagenarian is not excited about old-age homes either, even if there were to be one such institution in every district. She finds the whole idea revolting. No, she hadnt felt the need to step into such a home, she says firmly. Her space  the little world inside her airy apartment  is precious. The property is registered in someone elses name though. But that doesnt matter, she says. She belongs here, and not in some dingy, crumbling building, which is the image of old-age homes for her. It is not easy to dismiss her misgivings about the bill. There is clearly a need to sensitize the elderly, some of whom are unaware of their rights and distrustful of legal intervention.																														Would Maya ever consider leaving her house, if it became too difficult for her? Hearing this, the old womans eyes widen. In an incredulous voice, she asks Who will feed the cat then?

							 																						FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP																														In India, politics is the art of the impossible and the irrational. Statements are made by important political leaders whose rationale is difficult to fathom and comprehend. This foray into the irrational can be compared to the mindset of a suicide bomber whose motives are beyond the comprehension of the rational individual. Similarly, the attitude of the hara-kiri politician cannot be understood. Both the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, made it clear that early elections were not on their radar. Mr Singh added that he was willing to live with the disappointment of the failure to conclude the Indo-US nuclear deal. His government, the prime minister said emphatically, was not a single-issue government. It is true that neither Mr Singh nor Ms Gandhi said that they are not going ahead with the negotiations in the International Atomic Energy Agency. But everything they said and their attitude seem to suggest that they would not be unwilling to back-pedal on the deal. It is this sudden drop in enthusiasm that is difficult to understand. After investing so much in the Indo-US nuclear deal and in the growing closeness with Washington, why this signal that disappointment is around the corner? 																														The obvious answer is that electoral calculations and pressure from coalition partners prevailed over government policy. This is perhaps the crux of the matter. Both the prime minister and the Congress president must review their definition of leadership. The latter does not consist of being blown this way and that with every gust of political wind. Leadership means carrying forward ones own vision and beliefs within the party and the country. A genuine leader leaves behind his imprint on the organization or on the country of which he is leader. Remaining in office after having failed to implement ones vision is to cling to office for the sake of staying in power. It is to enjoy power without having the ability to do anything with that power. If indeed Mr Singh climbs down on the nuclear deal, he will have failed in fulfilling a commitment and in realizing a vision that he had revealed to the nation. He may well continue to remain prime minister, but he will have lost the goodwill he had earned for himself. 																														Ms Gandhi also seems to have buckled under pressure. She should be reminded of the man who listened to his inner voice, who shares her surname. The reference is obvious: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. When the entire political leadership of the country was involved in shoddy negotiations over the partition of India, he went off to areas hit by communal violence. What he believed in was of supreme importance to him, and, according to him, to the country as well. He never shied away from his beliefs and from acting on them. That is why he is modern Indias greatest leader. When no one walks with you, walk alone, he was fond of saying, quoting Rabindranath Tagore. Ms Gandhi and Mr Singh should learn from the father of the nation.

							 																						DEAFENING JOY																														It is a relief to find that there is a commissioner of police who sensibly admits to failure. True, the failure does not have to do with issues of procedural impropriety or the breaking of the law by policemen, but only with sound pollution during Kali Puja and Diwali. But candour, given the recent history of arrogant posturings by the police in West Bengal, is always welcome. The police commissioner, Goutam Mohan Chakraborty, has said that to keep sound levels within prescribed limits during the festive season, police must mount the campaign at least six months in advance. This did not happen this time, a fact to which he puts down the return of high-decibel enjoyment. That the police can control noise levels if they put their mind  and men  to it was shown two, nearly three, years running in recent times. But things had already been slackening over the last two years; this year it was almost back to Calcutta at its explosive worst.																														Almost, but not quite. The long-term programmes that have been put in place, such as a centralized market for crackers, have been showing partial results. There is a certain amount of awareness, even if it is limited. There is, inevitably, also economics. Crackers are expensive  in a season when a large segment of the people of Calcutta are struggling to buy vegetables. At the same time, there is more money in the hands of another large segment of people, which might explain the remarkable phenomenon of multi-storeyed apartment houses having become noisier than comparatively less privileged neighbourhoods. Evidently prosperity and upward mobility have nothing to do with reflection or responsibility. But it is still heartening to know that the police have seized large loads of prohibited crackers, and are planning to investigate how so many of the noisiest of them came into the market from Sivakasi. Maybe the city will not be so noisy this time next year.

							 																						HOW MANY IS ENOUGH? Gwynne Dyer											 			 FIFTH COLUMN																					Even before the 17th congress of the Chinese Communist Party began last week in Beijing, it was clear that at least one policy was not going to change: the one-child policy. Because China has worked hard over the last 30 years, we have 400 million fewer people, said Zhang Weiqing, minister in charge of the National Population and Family Planning Commission, earlier this year.																					In the eyes of the policys supporters, that justifies the infringements on peoples freedoms that are involved. True, a few women (or a few million) were dragged off to have forced abortions in the bad old days, but now its much more civilized. Besides, the end justifies the means, doesnt it?																					Not having 1.7 billion people now (and not having over two billion in twenty years time) is clearly a desirable outcome for China. Even with decades of high-speed economic growth, there is a limit to how many people China can feed and clothe and house. But did the regime really have to impose such a draconian birth-control policy?																					The doubters point out that the Chinese governments soft birth-control policy in the Seventies  encouraging later marriage, fewer births and longer birth intervals  brought the total fertility rate down from 5.7 in 1970 to 2.9 by 1979, one of the fastest drops in birth-rate seen anywhere at any time. And it happened before the one-child policy was introduced in 1980.																					The famous demographic transition from high-birth-rate, high-death-rate societies to longer-lived communities with lower birth rates still works its magic eventually. But it does take its time. Compulsion does make a difference. 																					Lessons for India																					India and China both started out in the Sixties with very similar fertility rates, and at that time Chinas population (648 million) was much bigger than Indias (433 million). But by 1980, Chinas fertility rate was already down (without compulsion) to the rate that prevails in India today. With compulsion, it has fallen even further, to little more than half the current Indian fertility rate. So Chinas population will level off at around 1.4 billion by 2020, while Indias will go on growing to at least 1.7 billion.																					How much difference does that make in practice? A lot. If China had taken Indias approach, its population would probably reach 2 billion before it stopped growing. Chinas economic miracle (10 per cent growth for the past two decades) skates permanently along the edge of environmental calamity. The country has lost almost 7 per cent of its farmland to development in the past decade. Dozens of cities are already experiencing severe water shortage. What would it have been like without the one-child policy?																					In large parts of the world, it is not politically acceptable to suggest that the sheer number of people can be a problem. Population control is startlingly absent, for example, from discussions about how to minimize climate change. It is partly out of concern for the religious sensibilities of some people, and partly because of human rights issues that it raises.																					There have been relaxations in the one-child policy over the years  ethnic minorities are largely exempt from the rules, and rural families whose first child is female are allowed a second try  but almost two-thirds of Chinese families really do have only one child. And it is clear from the governments determination to retain the policy that it intends to bring the population down in the longer run, whatever the collateral social damage.																					Most ecologists would say that China is well beyond its long-term carrying capacity even with its present population. Maybe the government is actually listening to them. Maybe it also knows that climate change will not be kind to China. There are things worse than a one-child policy. Famine, social disintegration and civil war, for example.

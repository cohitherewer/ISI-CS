							 																						IT HURTS TO BE CARING																														She sits across the road from the astonishing Hangsheswari Temple in Bansberia, Hooghly, hoping for alms from tourists. Her husband, now dead these five years, had been a fisherman. She had started life with him as a housewife, and had two sons. But they grew poorer by the day, and she had to take up work as a domestic worker. It was a struggle to educate her boys. The eldest has a Madhyamik degree, but her second son had to start doing small jobs after Class VIII. Both have left home in search of livelihoods. One is in Burdwan, a workman, and is married. He just manages to subsist. The other has no fixed home, he moves from place to place in search of temporary work. She is too old to work now, so she begs.																														Can her welfare and maintenance be laid at her sons door? She is one of uncounted thousands in the country. The law that would emerge if the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens bill, 2007 is passed is useful when adult children are deliberately cruel or even just selfish or irresponsible. Their parents need protection and have rights. All old people do. But what happens when poverty, the impossibility of continuing in school and joblessness drive half-starved boys and girls away from their homes and villages into towns, cities, brothels, or to underground political formations, in a desperate hope for change, for food, for a life  and the old, sometimes starving, parents are relieved to see them go? Relief that the children might live, and relief that there is one mouth less to feed. While India can be proud of the amount of its foreign remittance, it cannot ignore the numbers among whom any sort of remittance is impossible.																														A law reflects the society it envisages, it implies the limits of that society in its inscription. The vast population of aged people that the lady in the picture represents, the value of her lifelong work and her emotions, the respect due to her and her peers, are erased from the canvas the law projects. Why should we allow that, we, who are privileged to be within the laws purview? Those within the laws purview might have more questions. While we let in the winds of the world, and insurance companies come up with new schemes for the family to match the competitors coming in, what is erased is filial devotion. The insurance will pay if my spouse or children are ill, not if my aged parents need treatment. If I live with my widowed mother, tough luck. Family insurance excludes the parents. Who will bridge the gap between the Indian law and the Western concept of Family Values? BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

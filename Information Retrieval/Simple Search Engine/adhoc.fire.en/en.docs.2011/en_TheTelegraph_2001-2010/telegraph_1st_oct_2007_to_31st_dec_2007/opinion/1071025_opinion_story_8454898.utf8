				 																Bombs and roses					Sir  The bomb blasts following Benazir Bhuttos return to Pakistan prove that the prospect of political stability is still distant and premature in that country (Homecoming horror Oct 19). Pakistani politics, since independence, has taken unpredictable turns, marred by a contest between military dictatorship and democracy. Despite fleeting phases of stability, none of the leaders, including Benazir and Nawaz Sharif, has succeeded in giving the country a government that is stable and free of vested political interests. Since the October 1999 coup, the present dispensation under Pervez Musharraf has tried to stabilize the country. But this too has come at a cost; Pakistan has had to do without a democratically elected government for some time now. The present exigencies have forced a reluctant Musharraf to forge an alliance with Bhutto. One wonders how long such a friendship of convenience would work before one of the leaders starts aiming for exclusive power. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  India has reasons to be concerned about the way the political scene in Pakistan is unfolding. Both Benazir Bhutto and Pervez Musharraf are, after all, trapped between two super-powers  America and China  and their respective diplomatic stances. A single false move by Pakistan might provoke any one of these super-powers to put pressure on Pakistan. Unfortunately, every Pakistani ruler must take the blame for the present situation in that country. There is little possibility that Pakistani politicians might try and confront the domination by China and America by taking India into diplomatic confidence. It is also shameful that the present dispensation is willing to drop charges of corruption against Benazir to facilitate the deal with President Musharraf. This means that the General only wants to retain power by forming an alliance with Benazir.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  A stable, democratic Pakistan is extremely important for the countries in south Asia, especially India. Only democracy can rein in the forces of extremism. Benazir Bhutto is a persuasive political leader who can articulate the aspirations of the masses effectively. Her years in exile have turned her into a mature and forward-looking politician who needs all the support India and the West can extend. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  The attempt, by a suicide bomber, to assassinate Benazir Bhutto led to the loss of many lives. Such a state of anarchy has been brought about by the despotic rule of General Musharraf. The abortive attempt to suspend the chief justice, Iftikar Chaudhary, by the General added fuel to the fire. The prevailing scene of discontent makes it clear that Pakistan is not going to elect a participatory government soon. However, Musharraf has the support of radical Islamic groups, while Benazir commands the support of the West, including America. So there is a slim chance that the two of them together would be able to rescue Pakistan from the brink of anarchy. But the alliance between these two leaders has the potential to turn dangerous. Musharraf is addicted to power. Hence, restoring democracy is of little importance to him. Benazir, too, is not concerned about the nations prosperity. Rather it is the allure of power that has brought her back home after eight long years. The unrestrained jubilation over Benazirs return does not indicate that the masses find her acceptable. The huge crowd had probably gathered to get a glimpse of a woman who has become more of a celebrity and less of a leader who is a harbinger of hope. 					Yours faithfully,																															
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

					Sir  The blasts that took place on Benazir Bhuttos motorcade were intended to kill her. Luckily, Benazir escaped unhurt. One must remember that Musharraf has been forced to form an alliance with Benazir. Therefore the General and his supporters cannot be considered to be above suspicion in this particular case. Benazir should realize that her opportunistic association with Musharraf is not going to last for long because of the simple reason that both of them are highly ambitious and canny politicians. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  It is unfortunate that politicians disregard ground realities in order to gain political mileage. This is what happened to Benazir Bhutto who returned to Pakistan recently. More than a hundred people died and many more were injured in the bomb blasts that were possibly meant to kill her. The tragedy could have been averted had Benazir heeded the advice of the Pakistan interior ministry that she move by helicopter from the Karachi airport to Jinnahs tomb to prevent terrorists from mounting a surprise attack. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  The suicide bombings on Benazir Bhuttos motorcade should be severely condemned. The Karachi bombings are also an indicator of the dangers and challenges that Benazir would face in the course of her political journey in Pakistan. With the country experiencing a state of political uncertainty, terror elements may cash on the instability and implement their sinister designs. Instead of blaming each other for the bombings, Benazir and Pervez Musharraf should commit themselves to bring back democracy to the country, besides putting an end to the spectre of terrorism in Pakistan.					Yours faithfully,				 Barun Kumar Mahapatro,Berhampur, Orissa					Sir  Leaders in Pakistan have always extended their support for spreading organized terror in India. It seems that the trend has now backfired on them. The Karachi blasts, which killed more than 125 and injured many more during the welcoming of Benazir Bhutto, point to this fact. Most probably, Bhutto would not be able to usher in even a semblance of democracy if she is to continue her political career in Pakistan. Pervez Musharraf has in place a strong support system, which would help him to stay in power. He controls terrorist outfits as well as the military, which now employs terror tactics to solve political crises. Terrorist organizations operating from Pakistan have hurt India in a major way. They have started to attack holy places in India to create communal tension in this country. India must be careful about every move that Pakistan makes. After all, developments in Pakistan have a bearing on this country as well.					Yours faithfully,

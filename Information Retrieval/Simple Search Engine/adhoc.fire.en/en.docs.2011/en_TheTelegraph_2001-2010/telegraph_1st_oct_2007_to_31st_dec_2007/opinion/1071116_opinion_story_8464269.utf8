 Letters to Editor
				 																Power without glory				 																																																				Sir  The terror in Nandigram and the mishandling of the crisis by the government are a pointer to the state of affairs in West Bengal. The ruling party cadre shamelessly violated all norms of civilized society in Nandigram while the police waited in the wings. If this is not terrorism, then what is? The chief minister had appeared very concerned about the future of the state and was taking confident strides to ensure its prosperity. The events in Nandigram not only undermine his authority but also puts a question mark on his leadership skills and his professed dream of building a resurgent Bengal. How can he be the architect of a prosperous state when he condones the massacre of the innocent? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Asad Rauf, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The chief ministers defence of his partys action in Nandigram proves that he had full sanction from the party to embark on this dangerous plan. His press briefings show that he is unmoved by the human tragedy there. As citizens of a democratic nation, it is our duty to condemn such activities. It is time to show the government the door. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Debasish Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  When the rest of India was celebrating Diwali, the houses of poor farmers were being burnt in Nandigram. The state government has been killing innocent people in repeated acts of violence over several months, all in the name of industrialization and growth. By going back on his word that there would be no land acquisition in Nandigram, the chief minister has proved himself to be a fabulist. How can we expect growth and development to benefit us if these are achieved by suppressing and neglecting the people involved in one major sector  agriculture? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has put its future at stake by deciding to gratify industrial giants. The crime is multiplied by the silence of the Centre on this particular issue. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anirban Dhar, Cedex, France 

				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph must be congratulated for its sensible reporting of the Nandigram issue. Rather than blaming the state government blindly for the crisis, it is necessary to point out the fact that the Opposition needs to be more accommodative in order to arrive at a solution. The terror in Nandigram has been perpetrated by the cadre of both the CPI(M) as well as the Trinamul Congress. 				 																																																				One hopes that the intellectuals who are protesting against the violence realize that the Opposition is equally to blame for this terrible situation. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Ghosh, Tempe, Arizona, US

				 																																																				Sir  The leaders in Bengal are behaving like the mafia in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This is unexpected in a state that prides itself on being the intellectual capital of the country. If one looks closely at the reactions of the chief minister to the Rizwanur Rahman tragedy and to Nandigram, one will be alarmed by the similarity. This only affirms his inhuman side. Is there no leader within the CPI(M) with a sense of integrity, someone who is willing to work for Bengals development without shedding blood?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anindya Dasgupta, Bangkok

				 																																																				Sir  It is evident that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has completely lost control of the state administration and that he has no authority over his colleagues (like Shyamal Chakraborty) or the cadre who have been wreaking havoc in Nandigram. Bhattacharjees arrogance and high-handedness will push the state into a deeper crisis. It is also time that the Centre stepped in and took appropriate steps to repair the unimaginable damage done to the state by the chief ministers stubbornness. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  No language can adequately condemn the bloodshed in Nandigram, which will continue behind the public eye. It is unfortunate that a political party, which came to power as the champion of workers and peasants, is behind this ongoing massacre in the name of acquiring land from farmers to set up a chemical hub. As the state government has failed to control the situation, the governor should inform the president about the need to impose presidents rule in West Bengal. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J.N. Mahanty, Puri

				 																																																				Sir  The Trinamul-CPI(M) conflict in Nandigram should not be allowed to cripple either Calcutta or the state as a whole. The human rights commission should intervene immediately to stop the political drama staged by Mamata Banerjee, Medha Patekar and our Tollywood actors. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Central government has chosen to remain inert despite full knowledge of the gravity of the situation in Nandigram. It is the responsibility of a democratic government to safeguard the lives of citizens, but our leaders seem to have conveniently forgotten their primary responsibility. By sustaining the political disquiet in Nandigram for such a long period of time, both the Opposition and the state government have proved that they care little for democracy. Both the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and his colleagues in Alimuddin Street need to be reminded that it is the people who elect leaders, not parties. The government of West Bengal must be aware of the long-term results of its foolhardiness.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Debrup Hui, Texas, US

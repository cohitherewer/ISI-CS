 DIARY
				 																																																																														 As the son of the soil, senior minister, veteran politician, and a man who has done more than anyone to keep the channels of communication open between the Left and the Congress, the comments of Pranab Mukherjee were much sought after following the red operation in Nandigram. But Pranabda, who, of late, seems to have been losing his cool more often than usual, was found to be particularly edgy that day. Mukherjee, Lok Sabha MP from Jangipur, was speechless for a while when asked for his views on the violence in Nandigram. I stand by the remarks of the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, said Pranabda to hawkish scribes in the capital. A search was immediately launched to trace Mohsina Kidwai, AICC gen-sec in charge of Bengal. Kidwai was traced to Lucknow. When she was finally tracked down and asked to make a statement on the matter, the leader said that she fully endorsed the views of Pranab Mukherjee on Nandigram. 				 																																																																														 Not many were as comfortable at the AICC meet in Delhi as Nagma, former Bollywood starlet and now a major actress in Bhojpuri filmdom. For the rest, like the old war horse, Arjun Singh, and the home minister, Shivraj Patil, the stakes were too high. And, in any case, heads can hardly rest in peace when no less than the party leader announces from the podium that there were deserving men to take on ministerial responsibility if the incumbents failed to perform. In fact, Singh and Patil were reportedly seen to be shuffling nervously on the dais when the comment was made. For Arjun Singh, the AICC meet seems to have been particularly difficult, given that he knew his bte noire, Digvijay Singh, had scored a brownie point by becoming AICC gen-sec in charge of the youngest Nehru-Gandhis karmabhoomi, that is UP. Apparently, this was one post Singh had vied for, for years. Having been drafted into the Congress during the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, the old man is said to have been always keen to take personal charge of a fourth generation member of the illustrious family. Unfortunately, that is not to be. Arjun, however, did not leave without delivering a parting shot. Rahul ka jo hashr UP mein hua, woh aur jagah nahin hona chahiye (What happened to Rahul in UP should not be allowed to happen elsewhere). The point was made, both to Diggy Raja and Rahul, and perhaps to his mother as well.				 																																																																														 The Uttar Pradesh director-general of police, Vikram Singh, seems to have been in an excellent mood till the serial blasts played spoiler. Only days ago, he had had the wonderful idea of personally checking the physical fitness of his subordinates. A race was organized and Singh beat everyone hands down, from the rank of the DIG to the constables. Singh took great pride in his performance, as he did with his many successful cases against wildlife crime. Officials of all ranks formed a queue to congratulate him and things went smoothly till the chief minister, Mayavati, on being informed of the DGPs feat, threw the poser, Who would want to beat the police boss?				 																																																																														 Where is Lalu Prasad? Members of parliament no longer have the privilege of seeing him during question hour nor listen to his wisecracks. Every day, Lalu sends two letters  one to the speaker of the Lok Sabha and the other to the chairman of the Rajya Sabha  informing that his deputy, R Velu, would reply to all questions meant for him. What is holding back Lalu? The railway minister seems to be obsessed with the freight corridor project, which the Japan Bank has apparently refused to fund. He is now trying to rope in the Chinese. But others say that something more important is occupying him  formulating a strategy to remove Nitish Kumar from power. 				 																																																																														 The chill in Indo-Russian ties is pinching scribes too. Newsmen accompanying Manmohan Singh to Russia had to allegedly cough up $575 a day for a room in Moscow to brave the Russian winter. Those familiar with the beat say that it was almost 50 per cent higher than the normal tariff. Could the Left offer a solution?				 																																																																														 Heard at a Mumbai multiplex: Sanjay Leela Bhansali should change his name to Sanjay Neela Bhansali after his dyed-in-blue Saawariya. In any case, he is going blue in the face defending his film and lambasting critics. It was at the glittering function at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, on the recent occasion of the award of the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development, that the organizers realized that the recipient of the prize, Nobel Laureate Wangari Maathai, had been given the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding only six months ago. Karan Singh, who heads the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, is supposed to have told a confidante that he would have looked for more options had this little fact been brought to his notice. Apparently, the decision to accord the Nehru award to Maathai was taken by a jury chaired by the then vice-president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. It is not known if the little fact was known to the Congress cabinet ministers, but most absented themselves at the Indira award. The attendance was so thin that the Delhi CM, Sheila Dikshit, had to summon the backbenchers to move to the front.

							 																						HOW TO CLEAN UP THE MESS IN TIME Neha Sahay																					Its that time of the year again, when, despite working weekends, you come home cheerful. For in a couple of days, you know work would be coming to a standstill. The Mid-Autumn festival in the middle of last week set the tone; though not a public holiday, the traffic jams and the restaurants, overcrowded with families getting together to eat moon cakes while gazing at the moon, gave an indication of what was to follow. 																					The week-long National Day Holidays began on October 1, with the usual massive display at Tiananmen Square. This time, however, the celebrations were marred not by protests but by inspectors out to enforce social etiquette on the masses. Five thousand government employees had to forego their Golden Week holiday so that China shines at the Beijing Olympics next year. They were out on duty among the tens of thousands who thronged Tiananmen Square, looking out for those who broke the new commandments: do not spit, do not litter, do not break the queue. 																					As the Olympic Games approach, Chinese authorities are getting increasingly nervous about the peculiar habits of the citizens. Foremost among them is the loud spit. Startling at first, after six months, it becomes as much a part of your life as the sight of fabulously slim, fashionably dressed, Chinese beauties. You know you are in China when you hear a throat being cleared loudly, followed by the sickening sound of a spit. The habit cuts across the barriers of time and space, sex and class. A few people take the trouble to spit into trash bins; fortunately, even rag-pickers use gloves and a long-handled stick to ferret out what they are looking for. 																					The four bugs																					Actually, there is reason to hope. Well-educated Chinese as well as students do not spit, at least in public. However, there is a problem. Although the number of Chinese enrolling in high schools and colleges is on the rise, the drop-out rate is increasing too, as education becomes expensive. 																					Just after Liberation, Mao Zedong had launched a campaign against what he called the Four Pests: flies, mosquitoes, rats and bed bugs. A member of the central communist party has now identified spitting, smoking, swearing and queue-jumping as the Four Pests  stubborn diseases that stain the image of the capital city. Actually, its not just the capital thats afflicted by these pests. But, for some reason, Beijings taxis reek of cigarette smoke in a way taxis elsewhere in China dont. The National Day also saw the start of a ban on smoking in taxis, which applies to drivers and passengers. However, while drivers will have to pay stiff fines of 100 to 200 yuan, passengers will only have their names exposed through the media. 																					Queue-jumping is a real irritant in China, where queues exist. After meekly submitting to the brute majority, foreigners in China have begun asserting their rights where queues are really long. Often, boards saying Foreigners Only at immigration counters are merrily ignored. Littering in China isnt as common as in India, thanks to the numerous trash bins, although its disturbing to see school kids indulging in it. As for swearing, its only in exceptional cases that a foreigner realizes that hes being sworn at. 																					The original Four Pests campaign galvanized the country; the goal right now is to create a good impression for the Olympics next year. Will it succeed? A similar effort, earlier this year, is a good indicator. Five teams from Beijings Management Department and Civilization Promotion office fined as many as 50 offenders during the Labour Day Golden Week Holiday. The fine amounts  ranging from 20 to 50 yuan  made up for the negligible number of offenders. Fifty yuan is almost two days salary for most Chinese.

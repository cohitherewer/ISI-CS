							 																						ANOTHER PICTURE																														Pictures signifying irredeemable shame for the nation seem to have suddenly multiplied in the last year. Now there are images that have to be blacked out because certain scenes cannot be looked upon. It seems that the men who stood photographing the desperate tribal woman as she raced away down a street in Dispur from the tormentors who had stripped her naked had had an old wish fulfilled. Humiliating women and their tribes or communities by forcing them to parade naked has long been a favoured penalty and signature of class-domination among village authorities in much of rural India. Perhaps these men had always wished to be there. To have achieved a similar deed in the middle of a city demonstrates a level of barbarism that is rarely reached even in this country. A city pretends to be, or at least aspires to be, civilized. Such an incident shows how thin that veneer of civility is. It takes just one excuse of violence and disorder for the collective desire to tear the clothes off a woman in a contemptuous assertion of power to find expression.																														But the point, of course, is not just the desire to humiliate. A woman can be beaten into submission, as many husbands, fathers and brothers would be willing to testify. The point is the nakedness: the desire to expose a womans body to a world of prurient gazers  and photograph her as she runs frantically away. It is the focus on the body of the woman that says most about the dangerously skewed ideas about sex, violence, domination, purity and ownership that lie at the root of Indias attitude to gender, sexuality and sexual morals. The net result of all this is the total lack of value attached to a womans life, work, beliefs and sense of self. No one public gesture can destroy all these together and reduce her to flesh for one-way enjoyment more than stripping her bare. In effect, this gesture achieves everything that a rape does, although technically it may not be rape, but only its first step. To a woman who has been publicly stripped, it may not matter after the event that her tormentors have been caught or that a chief minister has promised her compensation. It is time Indians began to think about not just the effects but also about the causes of such hair-trigger explosions of violence. There is little enough time before the nation is forced to acknowledge that it is a nation of murderers, rapists and strippers of women.

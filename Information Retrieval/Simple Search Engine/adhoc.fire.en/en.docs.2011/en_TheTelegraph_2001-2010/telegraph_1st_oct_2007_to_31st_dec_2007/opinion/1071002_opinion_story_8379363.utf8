				 																Passion play					Sir  The antagonism towards Gorkhas, most recently expressed by a radio jockey while commenting on Prashant Tamangs Indian Idol win, is shocking and must be questioned (Idol worship to war, Sept 29). Though the Gorkha/Nepali community is a minority in India, yet the number of talented individuals it has produced cannot be ignored. Ram Singh Thakuri, the famous composer of the Indian National Army, Tenzing Norgay, the first Indian to conquer Mount Everest, Bollywood actors Danny Denzongpa and Mala Sinha all belong to this community. RJ Nitin would have done better had he remained silent about his knowledge (or the lack of it) of Nepalis. Hopefully, he will now realize that Nepalis are not just chowkidars. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir The controversy that has been raging ever since Prashant Tamang was crowned the third Indian Idol is an instance of regionalism. The Gorkha community has always been looked down upon in most parts of the country. A vicious cultural stereotype of the Gorkha as chowkidar has been bandied about relentlessly. The provocative remarks of the radio jockey have added fuel to such communal feelings.					Criticism of Prashant Tamangs singing abilities is certainly acceptable, but to mock him for belonging to a particular region, race or community is cruel. RJ Nitin should have been aware that Tamang is a member of the police force and had been serving the country before he decided to pursue a career in singing. But then why blame the RJ alone? Films and advertisements too propagate stereotypes like the one which has been voiced. Is this what the country really thinks about us?					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Prashant Tamang has acted wisely and appropriately by appealing to his supporters to remain calm after Siliguri erupted in a riot against the untoward comments made by a radio jockey (Prashant appeals for peace, restraint, Sept 29). A solely regional support will surely harm Tamangs career and this show of maturity on his part will stand him in good stead. Matters would not have come to such a pass had strict action been taken against Sony TV for making Tamang wear a chowkidars uniform on the show. Enough warning would have gone out to those who show disrespect to any particular community, and the mob violence averted. One can only hope that peace will hold following Tamangs appeal and the FM channel, particularly its RJ, will extend an unconditional apology to the hill people. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Of all the controversies that have surrounded Prashant Tamangs win, the violence in Siliguri was the most serious. RJ Nitin may have been simply exercising his freedom of speech, but he should have known that such freedom is not limitless and cannot be used to hurt the sentiments of a community. Why is it that even after over 60 years of independence, the people of the Northeast are still not seen to belong to the country in the same way as the rest belong? Is it because of the difference in culture and customs? Yet, India is supposed to be a country that accommodates a variety of cultures. The bias against the region makes no sense, particularly if one considers that the Gorkha regiment in the Indian army continues to be seen as integral to the armed forces. All of us have sprung from the same Indian soil. Why do some other communities then hesitate to acknowledge our identity as Indians? Why are we still referred to as chinkies? The Preamble to the Indian Constitution states that India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic. If this were true, then such prejudices would not have been allowed to persist. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Fridays violence in Siliguri proves that the communal rifts can be brought to the surface at the slightest provocation. Prashant Tamangs fans may have acted rashly while taking out the procession to the office of the sub-divisional officer. But the fact that they were held hostage for hours within the court compound raises serious questions about the security of the minorities. Tamang is unlikely to be able to celebrate his victory wholeheartedly knowing that there are people in his own state who do not share his joy. Such events only strengthen the idea that a struggling artist has no place in Bengal, where caste and community are considered more important than talent.					Yours faithfully,																															
Tulsi Lama, Jalpaiguri

					Sir  Many have remarked that Prashant Tamang won only because of the large number of SMS votes sent in his favour. To some extent, this is true. But even in the past, winners of Indian Idol have always been the audiences favourite, and not necessarily the judges. For instance, Amit Sana had always been considered the better singer although Abhijeet Sawant won the first Indian Idol contest. It is unfair to single out Tamang and victimize him and his community in this manner. 					Yours faithfully,																															
Subha Mukhia, Gangtok

					Sir The belief that Prashant Tamang is Darjeelings choice and not Indias is baseless because he won a nationwide contest where people from all over India had voted for him. Those who feel his victory is undeserved have no business creating a furore now. The winners of the last two Indian Idol series had also stirred up a lot of controversy, but there had never been such a show of ethnic hatred. It is time we realized that the man who won the contest is an artist first and then a member of any community.					Yours faithfully, 					 Preksha Shree Chettri, Darjeeling

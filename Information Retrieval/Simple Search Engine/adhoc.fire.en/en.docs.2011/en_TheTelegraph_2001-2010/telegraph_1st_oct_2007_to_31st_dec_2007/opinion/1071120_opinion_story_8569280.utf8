							 																						THE NEW LEFT Somak Ghoshal																														It began, in a major way, with Rizwanur Rahman. First, the candlelight vigils and silent congregations. Then the St Xaviers College pavement resounded with poems, songs and music. Passers-by stopped to listen and participate, those driving by interrupted their journey to put their names to the growing list, light another candle and thus record their protest. It was a sharp departure from the traditional forms of protest  strikes, bandhs, rallies and violence  that Calcutta, or generally Bengal, has always witnessed. 																														After the death of Rizwanur Rahman, a new language of protest was forged by the people. An essentially disruptive and damaging political culture of protest was reshaped into a civilized, urban mode of dissent. Perhaps it was for this reason that society was anxious to point out the non-political or apolitical nature of this protest, a discourse that has also strongly moulded the public demonstrations against the atrocities committed in Nandigram.																														On November 12, a group of individuals  popularly perceived as intellectuals  gathered near Rabindra Sadan to protest against the Left Front governments brazen violation of human rights in Nandigram. They, too, had emphatically stated their distance from politics. Afterwards they were attacked and humiliated by the police. This led to a mahamichhil on November 14, where close to a hundred thousand people, along with the intellectuals, took to the streets to protest apolitically. Clearly, the word politics  alongside its cognate, political  was being construed in a specific sense. This was a different kind of rally in that it eschewed all possible party affiliations. Neither did these masses subscribe to any specific ideology, nor project a particular political party as superior to another. The presence of the intellectuals in this rally reinforced its apartness from party politics. The intellectuals became one of us, part of the many ordinary, conscientious citizens, walking this unique, apolitical march.																														Yet, in the widest sense of the word, this too was a political event. The participants were motivated by their good judgment and humane sense of justice. This turned their protest, pre-emptively, into political action. Alongside their insistence on the governments obligation to ensure the fundamental rights of its citizens  the right to a secure life, equitable treatment from the State, and democracy  the people were also appealing to the moral conscience of a community of citizens. They were performing the duties of good citizenship. The idea of governance was being liberated from the narrow concerns of administration. Rather, governance was configured in terms of a different rhetoric. Governance was not just what the government did: it also became an activity blessed by the imagination of the governed. The claim of being apolitical was thus irreducibly political from the very beginning. 																														Perhaps this emergent discourse of a supposedly apolitical politics could, with time, become a way of redefining what constitutes being political. The role of the intellectuals, how they mobilize the strength and emotional response of the masses, would be crucial in this new formulation. As a speaker at a recent talk show pointed out, the mahamichhil did not just reveal the failure of party politics in Bengal, it also heralded the emergence of another political force in the state  the voice of the people, the New Left.

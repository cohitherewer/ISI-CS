							 																						BATON TALK Uddalak Mukherjee																														Awkward; helpless; uncomfortable. I was stuck. I could not possibly think of a fourth word to describe how it felt while visiting a police station in Calcutta. You could add alienating to that list, said Tushar Talukdar. He looked pensive as he sat sipping his tea. The former police commissioner of Calcutta had been thinking about the word as well. His choice, I thought, could not have been more appropriate. A visit to a local thana for the average Calcuttan was always alienating. Talukdar proceeded to explain why.																														The entire problem, Talukdar explained, lies with a piece of legislation; a strip of paper that has not been amended for over a hundred years  the Calcutta Police Act of 1866. For the colonial administration, the police was the ultimate weapon of State coercion. Police officers were instructed to thwart the nationalist movement. In return, officials in the force were entitled to a certain degree of indemnity. Unfortunately, the situation has not changed, even decades after Independence. Hence, policemen, secure in the knowledge of the protection granted by the State, have turned into a brazen, impolite, condescending lot. Such disdain for civil society, and even law, informs every level of the force. A visit to any police station in the city, Talukdar reminded me, would confirm this fact. 																														For a moment, I started to think about Rizwanur Rahman. Then I forced myself to stop, and paid attention to what Talukdar said.																														Like a good cop, Talukdar based his reasoning on solid evidence. Another sip of tea, and he started to tell me a story; a tale he said he had heard from the driver of a car rental agency. The man had recounted to Talukdar how the cops harassed him when he visited a police station to retrieve his driving licence. The price of the licence? A packet of expensive cigarettes for the man in charge. The victim was made to visit the place at least four times before his licence was returned. There was nothing really new about the story. Yet, I felt that a familiar tale of police exploitation had a different ring when one heard it from a former commissioner.																														The indifference, even hostility, towards notions such as transparency and accountability on the part of the police is actively encouraged by the political class, said Talukdar. You must remember that the police is a State subject, he added. 																														Therein hangs a tale. I thought. Many tales in fact. This, presumably, also made things difficult for even conscientious officers. 																														How had it felt being the commissioner of police? For a moment, I thought I saw Talukdar smile. The next instant, he became his formal, polite, self. Predictably, his was a mixed response. He admitted that there were times he felt helpless. The sleaze and the corruption around him left him with a feeling of guilt. But there were rewards as well, in the form of associations he made with honest, upright officers, who went about their task in the manner expected. 																														A phone rang somewhere and Talukdar excused himself. He returned after a moment and asked me whether I had any other question. Can nothing be done to purge a corrupt institution? Talukdar seemed doubtful. I asked him why. He quoted a Chinese proverb and asked, Didnt you know that the fish rots from the head?

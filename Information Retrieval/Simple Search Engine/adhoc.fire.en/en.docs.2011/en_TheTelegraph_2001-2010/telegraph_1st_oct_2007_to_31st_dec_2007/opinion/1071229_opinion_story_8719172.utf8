							 																						FUNNY FIGURES IN BRONZE

																														Bronze is associated with classical sculpture. Think of the equestrian statues of the great and good of the raj that once stood at various important points in central Calcutta, and of similar statues cast in imperial Rome, which were the original inspiration of all sculpture meant to create an impact on the citizenry. Even when we see them today, we cannot help being awestruck by these symbols of imperium. Our famous Chola bronzes are equally impressive, if not more. The famous sculptures of the Nataraj are dynamic. Yet, their poise and elegance are undeniable. Rodins sculptures may be a different kettle of fish, but we still find their raw energy quite overwhelming. So bronze sculpture is in the main associated with weighty themes, concepts and people. 
																														Just about a year ago, Galerie 88 had held a workshop of some senior sculptors from all over the country who laboured tirelessly and produced various pieces that were later to be cast in bronze at a foundry. This exhibition is the product of that elaborate process, which, by itself, is quite interesting because the sculptors used ceramic clay in this workshop. Quite a mutation from soft clay to solid bronze. 
																														The sculptors who are used to creating robust forms with a lot of heft looked best. Nagji Patel, N.N. Rimzon (picture), P.R. Daroz, Rajendra Tikku and Thomas John Kovoor are among them. Partha Pratim Deb often produces wonderful work almost out of nothing. Here, he presents two solid pieces exuding the vitality of certain folk toys. The strong element of eroticism in Laxma Gouds prints and drawings is unmistakable. This quality is missing from the sculpture on display. He does borrow elements from traditional sculpture but the ornamentation on the textiles, architectural elements and jewellery looks too heavy on these medium-sized pieces. P.S. Ladis heads emerging out of chaos as if at the time of creation is not a novel idea, and this sculptor has not given it any fresh treatment either. These are just clunky pieces of metal. 
																														Nagji Patel and Rajendra Tikkus pieces have a monumental quality, their medium size notwithstanding. Patels works are unpretentious and have an element of humour. He manages to defamiliarize workaday objects, and therein lies the fun. Darozs masks, with their close resemblance to representations of Medusa and Agamemnons death mask, come closest to classical sculpture. Adip Dutta creates things of everyday use, such as a hot water bottle, slippers, a toy plane and a pillow. They would have looked more effective when blown up. Now they look like brass toys from Benaras. The question remains if that effect was intended or not.

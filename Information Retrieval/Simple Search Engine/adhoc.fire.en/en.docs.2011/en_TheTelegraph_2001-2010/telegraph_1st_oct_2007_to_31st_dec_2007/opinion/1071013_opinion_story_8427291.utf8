							 																						RECLAIMING THE STAGE Mohua Mitra											 			 MUSIC																														Tracing the musical heritage of theatre songs of 19th- and 20th century-Bengal is a historical research by itself. Mancha Gaaney Manabi Katha  presented by Academy Theatre at Star Theatre on September 9  went beyond this quest. It looked at recurring motifs and images of womanhood, as presented on stage during the period, through songs and snippets of racy dialogue. Devajit Bandyopadhyay, through his engaging script, presented a narrative of the times, focusing on the women thespians who rose from the dark alleys of poverty and exploitation to face the arclights. Their pioneering performances set new trends in the entertainment district of colonial Calcutta. 																														Riddhi Bandyopadhyays (picture) solo portrayal of this rich heritage, ably supported by none other than Soumitra Chattopadhyay, who wove the huge repertoire of songs and their theatrical references together, proved to be a unique and enriching experience for the audience. Ascharjyamoyee Dashis songs from the play Khasdakhal; Sushilasundari and Subashinis renditions like from Misharkumari; Niharbalas songs as Niraja in Tagores musical comedy, Chirakumar Sabha  all of them were presented in their purest form. 																														Snippets of information from Chattopadhyay  Prabhabati, a stage aspirant, changed her name to Angurbala in the Star Theatre lobby and transformed herself into a singing legend  preceded the songs and enlivened them. Angurbalas soulful and mellifluous Aamar jiban nadir oparey, sung as Laila in Baradaprasanna Dasguptas famous play Nartaki, was revived in public memory by Bandyopadhyays touching rendition. 																														Indubala, Rajbala, Kananbala, Ranibala, Rajlakshmi, Molina, Prabha  some of them went on to become silver screen divas of the early 20th century. Kananbalas Toofan mail jaaye, from the film Shesh Uttar, is still hummed by many. Experimentation was the order of the 19th- and early 20th century-theatre music. And European orchestral touches were the most sought after. Bandyopadhyay excelled in handling the quivering tremolos and the swings between octaves, alternating with the meends and gamaks of thumris. She changed her style with ease to suit the varying moods of the century-old songs.

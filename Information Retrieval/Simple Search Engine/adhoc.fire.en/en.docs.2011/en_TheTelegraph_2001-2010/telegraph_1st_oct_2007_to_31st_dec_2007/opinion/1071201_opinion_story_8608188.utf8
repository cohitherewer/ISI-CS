							 																						STEPPING OUT IN LIVELY STYLE Sharmila Basu Thakur											 			 Dance																														Performing arts demand some kind of an interaction between artists and their audience so that the former could enrich themselves. Apart from regular training and vigorous classes, a dancer needs to perform in front of rasikas to be appreciated. Arangetram or manchapravesh is the first performance of a dancer on stage. Through this recital, a dancer gets an opportunity to display her talent and this often becomes the starting point of a career in dance. Kavya Iyer and Shruthi Narasimhan, two young Bharatnatyam dancers, made their debut at Gyan Manch on November 4. Under the tutelage of Sujatha Ramalingam, the dancers offered a bouquet of traditional Bharatnatyam numbers, starting from alarippu to tillana, with fervour and passion.																														It is interesting to watch a debut performance that is lively and spontaneous. It is also inspiring to see two young dancers pursue this classical form with devotion. Dressed in brightcoloured traditional Bharatnatyam costumes, Iyer and Narasimhan commenced their performance with pushpanjali, a floral offering to the almighty. Jatiswaram, a nritta piece or pure dance number based on raga arvi and taal adi, was performed with speed and precision. This was followed by sabdam, with abhinaya making up a substantial part of it. It was based on ragamalika and taal mishrachapu, depicting the transcendental power of Krishna. However, this particular presentation lacked vigour. The varnam, the most difficult number in Bharatnatyam in which a dancer exhibits her command over rhythm and power of expression, was enjoyable.																														The flaws notwithstanding  both Iyer and Narasimhans postures and lines need improvement  it will be fair to say that the performers have managed to master most of the intricacies of Bharatnatyam. Their strong footwork is commendable but they need to learn to use the entire stage. The most enjoyable presentation of the evening was keertanam, where the dancers described the uses of mudras and navarasas. The performance concluded with tillana. The artistes were accompanied by Aishwarya Shankar and R. Srinivasan (vocal), S. Venkatraman ( mridangam), Jinagam Chandramouli (violin), Sukhamoy Bhattacharya (sitar) and Vempatapu Mallesh ( flute). Sujatha Ramalingam lent able support on the nattubhangam.

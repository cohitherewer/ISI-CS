				 																Refutable logic				 																																																				Sir  It is not clear which country  China or the United States of America  is Ashok Mitras demon in Beware of the demon (Nov 26). Given the praise Mitra has heaped on China for its economic progress, and keeping in mind his Marxist credentials, it is safe to assume that the demon cannot be China. Mitras demon, therefore, must be the US. 				 																																																				Mitra feels sorry for the US because it is unaware of certain facts about India that he is privy to. In other words, like other leftists of his kind, Mitra does not like India doing business with the US. Would he then have India do business with China instead, accept its supremacy, as also its demand on Indian territories?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitra is jubilant at Chinas breathtaking progress. But a comparative study shows that Chinas progress pales when compared to the success stories of Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and others. The International Monetary Fund ranks China 86th with a per capita GDP (PPP) of $7,722, while Taiwan ranks 25th with a figure of $30,687, and South Korea 31st with $24,084. Mitra may argue that small countries progress faster, but he can be cited the examples of communist countries like Cuba and North Korea, which lag far behind small free-market economies like South Korea and Taiwan. If China has been able to boost its exports, most of the credit goes to American companies that outsource the manufacture of their products to China, which provides cheap labour. 				 																																																				Mitra claims that China is taking care of the skewed income distribution. I must bring to his notice the report, India in rich family race (November 18), published in The Telegraph, which said that there are 301 million deprived households in China. In his article, Help or hindrance? (Jan 16, 2006), Alok Ray wrote, The Gini Index of inequality (a measure of deviation from perfectly equal distribution) was 33 in India in 1999-2000 while it was 45 in China in 2001. So, India has far lower inequality than China. Mitras contention that India is seen to be indispensable to the US sounds funny when the ground reality is that both China and the US are indispensable to each other. Without its exports to the US, Chinas economy will fall like a pack of cards. Therefore, China is more dependent on the US than India is.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Although Ashok Mitra insists that Chinas income distribution is less skewed than Indias, facts prove otherwise. Chinas Gini coefficient was much higher than Indias and was comparable to that of the US. This means that India had a more equitable income distribution than China or the US. 				 																																																				Mitra has also argued that China earns a lot from exports to the US while Indias exports are much smaller. But then, the Chinese economy is export-driven, while that of Indias is driven by the domestic market. This implies that Chinas economy is heavily dependent on the economic health of the US and its other importers. Indias only area of major dependence is the information technology sector. If the US goes into a recession next year, as many economists predict, China will be much more badly affected than India. 				 																																																				Mitra says that China has a huge foreign exchange reserves. But it is questionable if that is an asset or a liability. Then again, as some economists argue, both China and India seem to have more reserves than is good for them. It is important to remember that most of the reserves is in US dollars. Thus, the recent devaluation of the dollar would affect both the countries. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Communists like Ashok Mitra will never get over their love for China. Prakash Karat and his colleagues get angry when India makes plans for nuclear energy and weapons. But they fully endorse Chinas nuclear programme. Mitra has a problem when India globalizes and opens its markets. But whenever a comparison is drawn with China, he ridicules the Indian market for lagging behind Chinas. Mitra hates the US and all associations with that country. However, he seems to be quite happy with the collaboration between the US and China. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  China may be making astounding economic progress, but we should not forget the human cost of such development. For example, Chinas coal production is many times more than Indias. But lives lost in Chinas coal mines from accidents and disasters are one of the highest in the world. Chinas human rights record is also not enviable. Mitra says China will use its huge dollar holdings as Damocles sword over the US. He forgets to mention that the dollars are being spent by China to finance Pakistans nuclear arsenal to be used against India in the future.

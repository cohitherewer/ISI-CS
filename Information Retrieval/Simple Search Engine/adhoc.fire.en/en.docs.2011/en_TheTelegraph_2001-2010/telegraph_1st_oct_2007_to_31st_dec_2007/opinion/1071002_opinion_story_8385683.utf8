							 																						MESSAGE IS THE MEDIUM																														What is the most common refrain on TV at the moment? The ticker on reality shows, saying To vote, SMS Y and send to 01010. 																														Going by the TRPs over the last few months, it is clear why every channel is hell-bent on churning out a star singer, dancer, dancing couple or even an inconsequential idol. Filmstars, awaiting the release of their films, are the cherry on the icing. They are roped in to play the special judge, irrespective of their understanding of music or dance. After all, it needs no special talent to applaud or mouth expressions like Superb, outstanding, mindblowing!																														All this is fine until the host starts goading the viewer to vote. It is as if watching TV without the cellphone by ones side is a sacrilege. One is almost consumed with a sense of pity for those pleading contestants who vigorously shake their heads and lip sync their names and the number to SMS at, at the end of each performance, good or bad. If this is not an assault on the viewers sensibility, it surely speaks volumes on the performers sense of self-esteem. All of a sudden, their careers, even their lives, seem to hang on the SMS balance. Surely, that cant be a nice feeling.																														Lata Mangeshkar has pointed out in a recent interview, A search doesnt have to be launched for a singer. He or she arrives, sings and stays...A singer cannot be judged by SMS. But this is little consolation. SMS does give the audience a chance to suffer from an illusion of omnipotence. Few fail to realize that this very chance is also a sure way of shaking the secular foundation of our country. To vote, SMS is another way of saying, To divide the country, SMS; each performer receives the maximum number of votes from the part of the country he comes from. What is worse, with SMS now being the lifeline of most programmes  news included  it wont be long before viewers are asked to predict the result of a cricket or tennis match or even vote on the nuclear deal or Ram setu, a murder or a road accident.																														One can argue that this is in keeping with Indias democratic fabric. We, the people, decide for ourselves. We, the people, are entitled to our opinions and it isnt mandatory to have a thorough or even cursory understanding of any subject. We, the people, have the authority to comment on anything and everything under the sun. We dont need experts to enlighten us or help us sift the wheat from the chaff. We have cellphones, so we can SMS. And as the SMS seems to have become, all of a sudden, the mainstay of the Indian television industry, it has injected a false sense of power into all cellphone users. Be it award ceremonies, reality shows, opinions on a news item, the audience feels a compulsion to SMS its opinion. At this rate, one shudders to think of the consequences of turning into a nation of SMS-fanatics who believe that they are the real decision-makers.																														One doesnt quite know if that precious SMS actually counts. But what is certain is that it jacks up the phone bill, enabling the cellphone service providers and TV channels to sing and dance their way to the bank. VISHNUPRIYA SENGUPTA

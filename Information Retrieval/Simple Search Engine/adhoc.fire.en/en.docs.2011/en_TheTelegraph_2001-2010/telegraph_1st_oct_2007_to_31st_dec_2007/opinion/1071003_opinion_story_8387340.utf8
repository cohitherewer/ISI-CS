							 																						RETURN GIFT																														Matters in Pakistan are as democratic as they can be. The supreme court has given a patient hearing to petitions against the candidature of Pervez Musharraf in the forthcoming presidential polls, and thrown them out. The General, to show that he has no wish to keep his uniform after he is elected president, has dutifully named his successor in the army. And the national and provincial assemblies, albeit minus 230 opposition legislators who resigned en masse in a last-ditch attempt to deny legitimacy to Mr Musharraf, are resolutely waiting for October 6 to exercise their choice of electing the president. The capitulation of Pakistans democratic institutions to the steely will of Mr Musharraf however does not mean that the pro-democracy movement in the country is dead. Numbed by the betrayal of the judiciary and weakened by the absence of political figures who would have mattered, it is being kept alive by the street protests of lawyers and journalists, the undying will of the more common people and dissident efforts to inconvenience the government by questioning its every move. The political dissent of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), and perhaps that of the Pakistan Peoples Party will add to the wild clamour of voices, all of which the newly-elected president may not be able to silence. Over and above this sound will rage the fury of the armed Islamic radicals, the product of Mr Musharrafs undemocratic experiments with power. Enervated by the al Qaida chiefs recent call to end the rule of the infidel president, they are bound to mount a more bloody attack on the regime.																														Pakistans drive towards an apparent democracy is unlikely to end with the predictable re-election of the president. It will see election to its assemblies next year, the deal for which is already being brokered with Benazir Bhutto with the express blessings of the West. The government that will be formed following it  one led by a weakened prime minister and an empowered civilian president  may take the country a few more steps towards a working democracy. However, given the fact that neither the ruling elite in the country nor the army will forsake their claims to power in a hurry, it is doubtful how much of actual democracy Pakistan will have. But before mulling over that eventuality, it will first have to deal with the ignominy of having an unpopular president returned to power.

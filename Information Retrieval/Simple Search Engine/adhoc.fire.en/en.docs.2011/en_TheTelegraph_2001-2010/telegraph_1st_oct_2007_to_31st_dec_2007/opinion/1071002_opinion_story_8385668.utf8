							 																						CATCH EM YOUNG																														 Indians must have their soap operas. The K-serials and their many clones have outgrown their novelty, so they have been replaced by the reality talent-hunt shows. So what if there is nothing real about these shows except the violence that breaks out over their results? Indians have traditionally shunned reality, most famously in their films. There is too much of it in their lives.																														So we need to be told, over and over again, that the heavily made up and bejewelled girl who sings with a nightingale voice on our TV screens every week comes from a slum where there is often not enough to eat. Here is someone who has beaten reality, we assure ourselves, and reach for our mobile phones to send the all-important SMS that will take her to the mega-finals. The smaller the town, the more remote the village, the bigger the physical challenge, the gorier the tales of past humiliation, the greater our faith in the candidates talent as a singer. And if the girl or boy, who has braved Herculean odds and reached what is called the platform, is eliminated, TRPs soar as the nation joins the live audience in weeping as they never had, even when Amitabh Bachchan died at the end of Deewar. What do you call this  navet on the part of the Indian audience, or rank bad taste on the part of the producers?																														Bad taste raises its head again when some judges  respectable men and women, all of them  insinuate amorous liaisons between contestants. Of course, we know by now that such accusations or suggestions, and the tiffs between judges that invariably follow, are mostly engineered to increase TRP for the channels. (Doubters are advised to look at the K-serial-like sound and camera effects that accompany these dramatic moments.) For those who still take these shows seriously  and there are, obviously, millions who do  could you please pause to think of what the little games played by judges and producers might do to the nervous girls and boys who have never been on such a big stage before?																														And then there are the children. They are definitely the flavour of the season, with Zee TV about to launch its next edition of Lil Champs, and at least three Bengali talent-hunt shows already on air exclusively featuring children. There is a cut-off age for children to qualify for these shows, but no lower limit, it would appear. As a result, girls and boys barely able to toddle and without their full set of teeth are dressed up in the tacky, adult-looking dresses and ushered on to the stage. And what happens when, one by one, most of them are told of their failure to progress to the next round? A probe into their personalities ten years hence may provide an answer.																														There is something that makes the dozens of talent-hunt shows occupying prime slots on Indian TV (there is even one for the best bathroom singer) seem futile. Historically, our film-music industry has had place for just a handful of stars. The circle has expanded a bit, but is still hopelessly inadequate for the scores of singers thrown up by todays shows. For those who have tasted success so early in life, what happens next? SREYASHI DASTIDAR

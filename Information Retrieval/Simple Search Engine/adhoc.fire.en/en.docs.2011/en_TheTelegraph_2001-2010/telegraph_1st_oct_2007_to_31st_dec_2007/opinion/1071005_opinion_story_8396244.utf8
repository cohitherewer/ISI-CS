							 																						SEPARATE TASKS																														It is not wise to keep crossing over the fence into a neighbours territory. Everyones garden is likely to end up as an undifferentiated wasteland of conflict, with no one able to recall who  or what  started it. No system can survive this kind of a mix-up, and it has become urgent that the executive, the legislature and the judiciary in India thought seriously about a return to the principle of the separation of powers. The concept implies not just a refusal to transgress the constitutional boundaries of duty, but also a rigorous execution of those duties that fall within these boundaries. The issue has gathered new fire with the report that the Supreme Court has said it would recommend to the Centre that the Tamil Nadu government be dismissed and presidents rule imposed, because the state allegedly flouted a court order against a bandh. Fears of judicial activism voiced with growing alarm in recent times seem to have been given new substance. But no story has one side. The recent history of the executives repeated abdication of responsibility, whether in major issues as in passing on the Babri Masjid question to the courts, or in constantly occurring episodes of administrative failure and the violation of civil and human rights, has opened up grey areas where the judiciary has been directly or indirectly invited to step in.																														How dangerous this is has been demonstrated by the courts reaction to reports that Tamil Nadu ignored the order against the bandh. The court is within its rights to summon the representatives of the government on a contempt charge; whether the government will go or stay is a decision others must take. There are other dangers in this trend too. One, presidents rule is a last resort  even as an administrative move its use has been questionable and politically motivated. Two, neither the call for the bandh nor the petition against it was apolitical; the reports to the court too cannot be free of the interests of warring political parties. The court has other things to do than enter the political arena. If a government must go, it is for the people to decide. In their different ways, it is the interests of the people that the executive, legislature and the judiciary are meant to uphold. Any action, or lack of action, that endangers a system in which the peoples will and weal are primary is a betrayal of both the Constitution and of democracy.

							 																						THE THAW																														Blinking, a perfectly normal human activity, acquires enormous significance in a political stand-off. In the charged context, where two contesting parties are poised eyeball to eyeball, the first to blink gives the signal that it is stepping back, that the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation is over and steps can be taken to restore status quo antebellum. The Congress and the Left have been in a tense situation over the Indo-US nuclear deal ever since Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), announced that grave consequences would ensue if the government of India went on ahead to operationalize the deal. The implicit threat was not really very implicit. Mr Karat was saying that if the government proceeded with the deal, it would jeopardize its own survival. There matters stood for a long while with neither side quite reformulating its position. Negotiations proceeded but it did not appear that they were making any progress towards a resolution of the crisis. To most observers it seemed that the government led by Manmohan Singh was counting its last days, dependent as it was on the support of the Left parties in the Lok Sabha. Yet, the fact that the chief of the department of atomic energy, Anil Kakodkar, will be in Vienna today to attend the meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency is a sure sign that the Left has blinked and that the worst of the crisis has blown over.																														It is true that the negotiations in Vienna are by no means a ratification of the deal. They are only a step in that direction. That this step has been possible is due to the efforts of the minister for external affairs, Pranab Mukherjee, who was tireless in his attempts to persuade the Left leaders to abandon their rigid approach. Mr Mukherjee tried to convince the Left leadership that going back on a treaty would seriously harm Indias international standing. He was adamant that the treaty would in no way compromise Indias sovereignty and autonomy. Mr Singh may have slightly softened his position on the deal when he said that it was not the governments only agenda, but Mr Mukherjee did not relent on the critical importance of the deal. The threat of the Left still remains: the treaty cannot be signed in its present form without the price of Left support. For the nonce, the ice has thawed a bit, and the Danube can be crossed to Vienna. Crossing the pond may yet take a while.

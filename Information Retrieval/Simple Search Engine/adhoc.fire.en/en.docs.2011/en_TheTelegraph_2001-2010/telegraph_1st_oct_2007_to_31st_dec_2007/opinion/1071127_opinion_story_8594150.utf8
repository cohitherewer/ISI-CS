							 																						THOSE LEFT BEHIND MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh																					Camp Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan. It is a source of great happiness and calm, much like a stress-free, soothing holiday, to be cut away from the daily, terrifying news that envelopes us all, when we are within the easy reach of the newspapers and satellite television. Even cellphone operators have failed to deliver their goods in the hinterland of rural India, where communication with the larger towns, particularly the marketplace, is essential for growth, development and the alleviation of poverty and lack of opportunities. Connectivity is faulty here and disappears from the handset mid-conversation much like the electric supply. Abysmal service, no infrastructure worth the name, endless political promises at election time, silent, ominous neglect thereafter, and when the patience of the people has been stretched to inhuman levels, resulting in anger and violent demands, we wonder why social unrest has got out of hand. 																					Airtel, Reliance, Vodafone and all the other smaller subsidiary companies need to get real. They need to extricate themselves from the metropolitan-and-larger-town jig and address the needs of a subcontinent, bursting at its seams with over a billion people, their potential subscribers. The action has shifted. The Indian countryside is changing rather radically and in some progressive states, it is rocking. A new generation of urban and rural citizenry is raring to get on with it, led by their aspirations, dreams and determination to alter the exploitation that they have been subjected to for 60 years in independent India, only because they waited silently and patiently, hoping the powers that be would notice and rectify their rotten, undignified plight. Democratic India has failed the majority with the relentless and continuing exploitation of the poor at the hands of those who were mandated to administer this nation honestly and with a sense of equality.																					Seeing is believing																					The nexus of politician, cops and trader stalled the growth and retarded what could have been a modern superpower. To shift gears, change course and move ahead in an effort to catch up with the world and include those who were forgotten into the process, will need gargantuan doses of intelligent, compassionate politics, governance that puts priority on honesty and integrity, and a restructuring of the laws to deal with a modern nation-state. Unfortunately, our own elected leaders have treated us  the citizens of India  within our democratic framework, with deep scorn and high-handedness. A new leader who will dismantle the colonial laws that govern us and replace them with a humane civil code of conduct, will become the messiah of the majority.																					The essential needs, the diverse realities, the truthful picture of India is never on the pages of our printed media, nor on our small screens. Because the media are busy raking in large dollops of money, growing their private fiefdoms and projecting their biased views, usually based on the diktats of those who fund them and keep the coffers full. They wake up when something explodes on their faces and then repeat the same news till the viewer wants to smash the screen. Nandigram and the dreadful turmoil there is one such example. Where are the other stories similar to this one, that have not been broken? Cadres have been operating for decades and we hardly hear anything about their activities in the Bengal countryside. Are there the usual dictatorial politburo wraps on such disturbing realities? That is the impression that came across while listening to Brinda Karat being interviewed by Karan Thapar. She tried to convince us that there was no rape or plunder, no eye for eye! Half-truths dominate our political space and have become far more poisonous than pure lies because they confuse and allow for the benefit of doubt, even when we can all see what is happening.

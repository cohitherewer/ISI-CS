							 																						CHANGE THE WORLD BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh																					Sometimes one wonders whether the authority that is meant to govern this country is only interested in taking care of the needs of the rich and famous. As India begins to take off and free itself from decades of restriction, the institutions that were founded in the Fifties to protect and nurture our infant republic have been destroyed by the men and women who were trained to govern. This has had a terrible impact on the countrys development and growth. Our ancient and once-secure, multi-cultural civilization has now begun to contort in profound pain. The assault has taken on unimaginable proportions and has managed to invade virtually all aspects of life in India.																					The recent verdict in the Uphaar case, in which a fire killed many people in a cinema theatre, goes to show the impending change that is taking place under the surface. Corruption, abject mismanagement, mal-administration are there for us all to see. We have learnt to accept these vices as we live and do our work. 																					That Indian citizens have been taken for a ride by politicians and the administration, is an undeniable fact. The institutionalization of corruption has been recognized by one and all. The lack of initiative on the part of the powers that be, regardless of their ideology or political dispensation, to correct the failure and restore integrity into the body politic is disappointing, to say the least. It is unfortunate that some of the lower courts in this country have failed to implement the rule of law of this land.																					Grave threat																					In 1975, when the Emergency was declared under a provision in the Constitution, our fundamental rights were rudely taken away and press censorship imposed in India. But the people of India knew, even at the time, that the Emergency was unwarranted, that corrupt practices needed to be couched in the rhetoric of the breakdown of legitimate law and order. People found ways and means to communicate despite the censorship that prevailed. They watched the propaganda unfold on television and realized within days that the words being spoken and images portrayed were a drama that was being enacted. Word of mouth relay of true events replaced the written word and the images that were being shown in the State electronic media. India knew what was happening and, at the first opportunity, this nation rejected the tyrannical regime silently and without violence.																					The replacement joint venture was a disaster because it used similar tools of repression and corruption to secure itself. This coalition was made up of different political segments that had come together for a taste of power. It failed and the Congress Party returned to rule shortly thereafter because the voters saw through the opportunism of the new crop of leaders and preferred to go with the known and familiar. Indira Gandhi was more acceptable to them as a leader than the other netas who fought for power. 																					The virus that had been injected during the Emergency years was not expelled from the system. It remained in various forms such as ineptitude, falsification, intellectual lethargy and the lack of integrity. Gradually the horror of this disease got embedded in the engine which was intended to lead this country and became institutionalized.																					That corruption rules us today. The white ants of corruption have eaten into the pillars of our democracy and will soon result in the caving in of our nations superstructure. As the economy starts to boom for a section of the population, and corrupt leaders continue to look the other way, social anarchy will overwhelm this sub-continent. Truth, integrity, rule of law and creative endeavour will be suffocated. Lumpen elements will take over the little bits of civil society that remain. This edifice must be dismantled and the underlying demand for change realized.

							 																						A LITTLE HELP FROM A FRIEND CHINA DIARY - Neha Sahay																					Xianglin, 21, has just started her new job as a cashier in a Western-style caf-cum-bar  her seventh job in three years. But this one is different. Her friends are celebrating; Xianglin herself is nervous, as if she has never been in any of her earlier jobs. Considering she had managed a small grocery store single-handedly for two years, that too when she was only 17, handling cash in a restaurant too exclusive to be crowded should be no big deal. But this job may just be the ticket to realizing her latest dream  working in an office. 																					Why then isnt Xianglin jumping with joy? Because she can barely believe she got the job. Until now, the kind of jobs Xianglin has had entailed walking in and walking out, with minimum fuss. Unlike in India, China is bursting with jobs for young girls educated only till middle school like Xianglin who left her village at 15 to seek her future in the city. Like millions of migrant girls, Xianglin has gone through the routine  factory-hand, shop assistant, bar-girl, beer-girl. In not one of them did she need to use her knowledge of English, so rare in someone with her background; nor her intelligence, sharpened by hours of studying English grammar on her own; nor even her ability to manage money. Instead, she found herself doing things she hated: cleaning tables, mopping the floor, waiting till 2 am upon drunken louts, even sharing a beer with them to get them to come back.																					Thats why this opening as a cashier was so crucial. But she almost didnt get it. The caf is the latest rage among expat swingers. Any event involving foreigners, be it a halloween party or celebrations by F3 circuit winners, is held in its ultra-chic metal-leather surroundings. Latin nights, tabla on the weekends and so on  the caf wasnt going to take on just any girl who walked in looking for a job, specially one as unsophisticated as Xianglin, even if she had been escorted by a helpful expat. 																					Narrow escape																					Xianglin spent an anxious week after submitting her bio-data (sure they hadnt liked her), ready to take the next opening she got. Many inquiries later, she was told they needed a cashier, not a waitress, a medical certificate and an NOC by the local police. Having got both (for 180 yuan, a princely sum for an unemployed migrant), Xianglin thought she could join the next day. But they had one more demand  a reference from a previous employer, a domiciled local, not a migrant like her, someone they could get hold of if she ran off with the money. Xianglin turned to the obvious choice  the motherly owner of the store she had minded from 5 am to 8pm for two years. But both the times she called, the woman was non-committal. 																					If she wouldnt help, nobody would, concluded Xianglin in despair. Too discouraged to try anyone else, she called up the caf and told them she could get no one. Too bad, was their reply. 																					What happened next makes Xianglins story unique. Till late night, Xianglin cried her heart out. Early the next morning, she called the caf manager. You are a dishonest woman, she told her. Why didnt you tell me I needed a reference the first time we met? You never wanted to hire me, the reference is just an excuse. Unbelievably, the caf called her the next day. If she was still interested, they were willing to wait till she found a local  it need not be an employer. 																					Amazed at the turn of events, Xianglins expat friend decided he had to help. At his request, a local agreed  though with great apprehension  to be Xianglins guarantor. One mistake by this simple, impulsive but totally honest girl, and his hukou, the all-important ID card that entitles you to a range of social benefits, would be in jeopardy. Xianglin made it. Most migrants dont.

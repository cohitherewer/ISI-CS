							 																						THE TRUTH ABOUT DECEPTION

																														Heavyweights ruled the roost last weekend at Nandikars National Theatre Festival. It was heartening to see the National School of Drama Repertory Company doing some relatively unusual things again. The day after Acharya Tartuffe (picture) presented Molieres great comedy on a religious fraud, showing that one can fool all of the people some of the time but not all of the time, Narendra Modi won the Gujarat elections. For many years, I have been trying to interest directors in what I regard as Molieres magnum opus, but its controversial angle (which led to the Church denouncing it and the Parliament banning it 340 years ago) made them shy away. Finally, Prasanna has done the deed for NSD.
																														His Indianization takes a few liberties but does not betray the original. Tartuffe becomes a Hindu godman and the gullible Orgon a corpulent Seth-ji, Omkarnath. His daughter is in love with a Muslim boy (which has no parallel in Moliere) whom Omkar rejects, naturally recalling in public memory the case of Rizwanur. Omkar has two daughters, whereas the French follows the convention of a young woman and her confidante. And Tartuffe gets a sidekick, not at all essential, but permitting a lot of satire on cultism.
																														The target of religious hypocrisy remains uppermost, though Prasanna removes the complex depiction of minor flaws in everyones characters. Moliere begins with Orgons mother threatening to walk out, listing the very real shortcomings of every family member. Prasanna opens with farce, quite unnecessarily getting a man to act her, cheapening the level at which Moliere enters. But you cannot keep a classic down, especially what Richard Wilbur has called the comic equivalent of King Lear.
																														Prasanna compensates for Molieres marvellously rhyming couplets by converting much of the dialogue into a musical, delivered fluently, punchily, and with a nudge, spoofing popular Hindi songs with even the mike used inventively as a prop. Virtually everyone sings, giving the production a surprising richness and sophistication. Suresh Sharma stands out as Omkar.
																														Theatre, said Peter Brook, lives by surprise. The surprise element is also what keeps us tuned to Ram Nam Satya Hai, a Marathi play by Chandrashekhar Phansalkar, translated into Hindi and directed by Chetan Datar, who has always preferred to stage drama on uncommon subjects. Unlike most scripts on AIDS, here we have no inkling as to what holds the cast of hospital ward inmates together, keeping the suspense alive until fairly late. Otherwise, many spectators would have turned off because of the graphic, and sometimes grisly, slides projected on the backdrop.
																														The nature of the theme makes Datar go for very loud and painful acting, while retaining Phansalkars message that one should enjoy life regardless of the fearsome diagnosis. Yet, there is a moralistic undertow, that if one behaves recklessly, one should be prepared to handle the consequences. Some AIDS sufferers who have contracted it innocently, through blood transfusions for instance, may not appreciate being clubbed with the protagonist, who had a promiscuous fling with an infected woman.
																														We return to religion and bad faith in Girish Karnads Flowers, published two years ago in English, and produced by RAGE (Mumbai). As he has done frequently, Karnad draws on tradition, of a Kannada folk tale in which a married priest has a torrid affair with a courtesan. It has been observed that Karnad, who often places a heroine at the apex of his sexual triangles, here gazes at male desire for the first time. Flowers does provoke ideas, contrasting the priests Shaiva spiritual devotion to the lingam with his flesh-and-blood carnality, which his deity seems to uphold at the end. But in this day and age, the deus ex machina miracle does not convince.
																														Much more troublesome is the solo performance. Roysten Abel directs Rajit Kapur in an impassive monologue that leaves no impact on us: Kapur expresses no engagement in the role. He need not melodramatize, sing or dance, of course, but, on the other hand, to shift just three positions in one hour, from standing to sitting yogically and then relaxing a bit, does not capture us, unless in an intimate space. I could close my eyes and hear him without losing anything. One could derive responses by reading rather than watching Flowers; thus, it does not create theatre. Visually, the only striking aspect is Abels flower-strewn set with a huge metal basin of water representing the lake, off which the lighting reflects magically.

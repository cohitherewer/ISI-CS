							 																						LADY ON THE MOVE																																																													A Princesss Pilgrimage: Nawab Sikandar Begums A Pilgrimage to Mecca 
																																																												 Edited by Siobhan Lambert-Hurley, Women Unlimited, Rs 350																					There can be no discounting Nawab Sikandar Begums special place in Indian history. The only female knight in the British Empire besides Queen Victoria, Sikandar Begum ruled Bhopal with an iron hand. She gave it much of its modern transport, education, revenue, judicial and civil administration, and, by prudently siding with the British during the 1857 mutiny, secured for herself a nineteen-gun salute and the title of Nawab that allowed her to rule with a fair amount of independence from 1860. 																					Like her mother before her and very few other Muslim women of her time, Sikandar Begum went on a Haj pilgrimage in 1863, but unlike them, she came back in 1867 and penned her travels to Mecca and Jeddah. The literary exercise, however, was in response to the wishes of Lady Durand, the wife of the former political agent in Bhopal. The wish, expressed in writing before Sikandar had left for her destination, was perhaps not as innocuous as it sounded, given Britains political interests in the Arab world during the time. 																					Sikandar Begum may or may not have sensed this need. But she rose to the occasion by stashing her account with details about the corrupt ways of the Arab world, the Arabs desultory habits, be it sanitary or monetary, and verily suspect social mores. In doing so, the editor of this volume argues, Sikandar Begum was fulfilling her own agenda. She was constructing her image as an enlightened and able administrator in juxtaposition to the image of the decadent Oriental despot of the Arab world. The latter was a product of the British imagination which she had internalized and which she sought to reproduce and even to contribute to in her own distinct way. 																					The colonial complicity in the production of the princesss travelogue is one of the central themes of Lambert-Hurleys analysis of the account of Sikandar Begum. The advance in travel and technology that made journeys and their writing possible, the establishment of travel-writing as a literary genre and the Orientalist project that was a culmination of a variety of processes unleashed by Empire-building lay behind Sikandar Begums writing about her journey. Lambert-Hurley calls this a quintessentially Muslim journey in a colonial environment. She further establishes the works colonial context through her detailed discussion of its 19th century translator, Mrs Willoughby-Osborne, who embarked on the project under the false belief that no work written by an Eastern lady had, to her knowledge, ever been published.																					Notwithstanding its historical merit, however, the Nawab Begums recollection of her Haj pilgrimage has little to recommend itself as a piece of travel-writing. Sikandar Begum may have been a good administrator, but she was a terrible writer. Most of the account is full of mindless detail about her correspondence with the Arab customs authorities, and her contest, both verbal and epistolary, with the Sheriff and Pasha of Mecca and the Pasha of Jeddah. There is hardly much about the pilgrimage itself, except intermittent information about the completion of the rituals. With her constant slander of all things Arab, the Nawab Begum comes across as a self-important, irritable, contemptuous, even miserly woman. All this may have been great material for the construction of the self, but there is little mercy for the reader. Thankfully, Lambert-Hurley ends with detailed information about later travel accounts from Muslim women since Sikandar Begums time, some of which may lift the pall of gloom.						CHIROSREE BASU

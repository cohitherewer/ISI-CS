							 																						SHUT OUT																														The strength or weakness of the legal system has a decisive impact on the governance of the country. The head of State in one of Indias neighbouring countries can vouch for this fact. If the role of the justice system is crucial in the revival of democracy, it is more so in a functional democracy like India, where judiciary forms one of the pillars of the State structure. The judiciary has tried to live up to this role, perhaps a little more consciously and conscientiously in recent times than before. Which is why the lapses in its functioning appear glaring, and so does its inability to address them. In West Bengal, for example, courts have remained closed for a stretch of almost two months now, first on account of the holidays connected with various religious festivals and then because of the cease-work called by the state bar council in protest against the violence in Nandigram. The closure will invariably add to the huge backlog of cases in the courts and inconvenience those who come to seek justice, sometimes from the remotest corners of the state. But if a precise Supreme Court directive against lawyers strike has been unable to hold back the men in black coats from an irrational expression of political dissent, it is unlikely that a forthcoming high court ruling on the matter  in response to a public interest litigation moved by a member of the fraternity  will restrain them. 																														The logic behind the apex courts stricture against the participation of lawyers in a strike is simple. Public interest is to be accorded topmost priority, and no action by anyone can undermine it or any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The same logic lies behind the repeated judicial rulings against calls for bandh or strike by political parties. Lawyers have themselves tried to uphold the repeated court orders on the subject. Suspension of work on their part not only reflects badly on the judiciary, but also helps propagate the poor work culture in the state that frequently finds expressions in the incessant strikes. There is no doubt that staying away from strikes alone will not ensure the greatest public good. For that a more wholesome revision and reform of the legal system are required. And this would include reducing the long periods of closure on account of holidays as also a more indepth look into the problems concerning the recruitment, pay and role of judges.

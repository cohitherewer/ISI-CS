							 																						UNBEATABLE LOGIC																														There are not too many bedroom secrets that Indias married couples can share with the world. The discovery by the recently-concluded Family Health Survey-III that 40 per cent married women in India are abused by their husbands is, in fact, the mostly badly kept secret among them all. A little over two years ago, an international survey quantifying this abuse had concluded that one married woman was burnt alive or beaten to death every six hours in India. The reality, which has changed very little, has been worrying enough for the government to repeatedly alter its laws related to domestic violence in order to make it more sensitive to the needs of the women. Despite efforts, however, reported cases of such violence have remained abysmally low. Victims have continued to accept domestic violence as normal, and sometimes even welcome. The family health surveys discovery that 54 per cent women and 51 per cent men believe that wife-beating is an inevitable adjunct to marriage attests to this attitude and makes obvious how superficial Indias brush with modernity has been. 																														The reason why the findings appear shocking is the presumed change in the mental world of a liberal India that seems to be putting as much weight on womens choices  from cars and condoms to the tiniest household item  as on those of men. But the reality is not what the glossies construe. Women in swathes of India continue to remain second-class citizens who need to be told what to wear, how to live, how to behave and what to expect of their spouses if they transgress their socially-appointed roles as bearers of the family honour and line. Having internalized this established social behaviour, women end up blaming themselves if they invite violence for failing to carry out their expected duties  be that of putting up with the most difficult in-laws or cooking or looking after children. Spousal censure in the form of slapping or arm-twisting, is often seen as an expression of affection that need not be protested against even if it crosses the limits of endurance. So despite the counselling centres, temporary shelters for the abused and legal aid  the result of much activism in recent years to establish the torture as a social evil  wife-beating retains its sanctified place in the Indian marriage. And perhaps more securely than ever before, thanks to the combined efforts of men and women alarmed at the onslaught of Western values.

																														Dance workshops are a rage these days. Most of them are organized under the tutelage of renowned dancers and gurus, and provide young dancers with a wonderful opportunity to interact with great stalwarts. Such exchanges enrich the learners minds, and allow them to appreciate the art of dance properly. 
																														Under the guidance of Khagendra Nath Burman, an authentic Bharatnatyam dancer in kalakshetra style and a dedicated teacher, Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre organized a workshop on Bharatnatyam. It also presented a scintillating dance performance featuring the workshops participants and Burmans students at Bharatiyam on November 23. 
																														For the evenings performance, Burman had chosen all the traditional items in Bharatnatyams repertoire. The programme commenced with an invocatory number in which the dancers offered their salutations to Ganesha. This was followed by Rukmini Keertanam with live accompaniment. Based on raga vasant and taal adi, the number paid tribute to Rukmini Devi Arundale, one of the doyens of Bharatnatyam. Choreographed (both music and dance) by Burman himself, the presentation featured all the participants of the workshop. The performers  Tama Nath, Debasree Das, Manisha Naskar, Ballari Kanjilal, Esha Banerjee, Mrinalini Biswas and others  put up an inspired performance and were earnest in their execution of this dance form. 
																														Alarippu was performed by the students of Natanam Kalakshetra, Burmans own institution. Rahul Dev Mondol, Arpita Saha, Himika Barman and Udayshankar Sengupta exhibited their understanding of this genre, as well as an excellent sense of rhythm and command over difficult postures. The most enjoyable presentation of the evening was Shabdam. Combining the elements of dance and abhinaya, it elucidated Krishnas childhood pranks. In this particular number, Burman has succeeded in capturing the true spirit of choreography by blending rhythm and sahitya with seamless grace while depicting the character. Deft footwork, strong movements and subtle abhinaya were the hallmarks of this presentation. 
																														Ashtapadi from Jayadevas Geetgovind is an all-time favourite for classical dancers. Ashtapadi abhinaya by Burman was also impressive. An innovative composition, comprising the Tagore song, Eki labanye purna prana, it was a refreshing performance, full of energy and vitality.
																														The concluding item was a tillana composed in Hindi by the choreographer. Based on raga vasant, it was an inspiring performance, characterized by sweet notes and striking of poses. What was also heartening to note was that unlike other presentations by the EZCC, this one was far more synchronized and well-balanced.

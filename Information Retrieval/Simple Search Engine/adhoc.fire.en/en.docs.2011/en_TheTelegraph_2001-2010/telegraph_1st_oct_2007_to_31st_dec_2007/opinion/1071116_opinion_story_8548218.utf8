							 																						WOLF IN SHEEPS CLOTHING BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh																					To hear the chief minister of a state in the Union of India explain away open gang warfare by saying that the illegal armed assault by CPI(M ) cadre against their political opponents was merely an act of taking moral revenge makes one sick in the stomach. It is impossible to comprehend Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees ridiculous explanation during his recent press conference where he virtually condoned the horror, without having visited the war zone. India abides by a Constitution and by established laws. To permit two gangs to go on rampage, fighting each other for dominance, is unacceptable and warrants the immediate resignation of the chief minister.																					Why did Bhattacharjee not send his police force to stop the escalation in violence? That would have stopped the armed gangs from taking the law into their own hands. Does the party cadre have the legal mandate to act and administer on behalf of a government? Is that what is enshrined in the Indian Constitution? Or is West Bengal a dictatorial state that lies outside India? 																					Why is the the Left government blaming the Central Reserve Police Force for arriving on the scene much too late? Does the Communist Party of India (Marxist) believe that the CRPF should administer law and order in Bengal? If so, should the Centre then impose presidents rule in the state to protect Indian citizens from being tortured, harassed and, ever so often, killed? Does dissension and difference of opinion, and now political ideology, merit an organized assault on human beings? Is West Bengal the last bastion of Stalinist rule on our planet? 																					For a new direction																					The other face of the coin is the absurd, juvenile drama being enacted by senior comrades of the CPI(M) from the comfort zone in New Delhi. See-saw, yes-no, kind words-vile words, have all been used in a desperate attempt to embarrass the ruling coalition at the Centre, forcing it to take two steps back for every step forward. It is part of a now exposed, childish and inappropriate strategy on the part of the CPI(M) to discredit its traditional political enemy, the Congress party. 																					Any association with the CPI(M)  the enemy within  following the recent expos in West Bengal, can only destroy the credibility of the Congress, compelling its allies to support some other party in the next general elections. If the Left achieves this objective, it would have succeeded in working against the interests of the United Progressive Alliance while remaining a part of the coalition. To give the Left more time to destroy the credibility of the Congress would indeed be suicidal.																					The rather wicked charade being performed by the Left forces around the 123 Agreement that India is attempting to seal with 42 nations of the world has resulted in this country being bracketed along with other insular, failed States that are struggling with poverty. The UPA has been consciously immobilized by its coalition partners with the help of administrators who seem to be supporting the present regime only to remain in power for personal ends. These men are responsible, collectively, for tearing apart the fragile fabric of a developing, democratic nation in which the impoverished masses continue to be exploited. All this is being played out circa 2007.																					The immediate, short-term solution for the Congress could be to dissolve parliament and go to the people. Speak the truth about the shenanigans of the partners in the coalition, both within and outside. Speak out against the political blackmailing that counters every positive attempt to promote development, change, growth, freedom and modernity. The Congress leaders need to reach out and engage faithfully and honestly with Indian citizens. This could change the direction of politics in the country and give the party an upper hand.

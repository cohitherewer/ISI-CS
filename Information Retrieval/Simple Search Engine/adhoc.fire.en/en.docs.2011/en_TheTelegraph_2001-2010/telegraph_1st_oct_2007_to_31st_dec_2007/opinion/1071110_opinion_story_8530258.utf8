				 Perfectly timed																					Arnold Wesker made his name with his Roots trilogy, which examined the crisis in British socialism in the middle of the 20th century. With a similar questioning of commitment going on within the Left in Bengal, Samskar Bharatis revival of Rudraprasad Senguptas adaptation, Jakhan Eka, becomes highly relevant. It has always been so, whether in 1966, when Nandikar first staged it, or in the Eighties, when Theatre Workshop transformed it into the powerful Bela Abelar Galpa.																					Jakhan Eka draws on the central, eponymous play in the trilogy in which the young working-class heroine Beatie (here, Bithi) returns to her Norfolk home from her urban workplace after being jilted by her lover, a union leader who had inspired her into thinking anew and had promised to marry her. The first play, Chicken Soup with Barley, had described their affair. Betrayed and alone now, Bithi cannot reconcile herself to her familys abject acceptance of things (all the men are bus drivers) and strikes out on her own to affirm her independent existence. Supriti Das performs the role most convincingly, complemented by her mother (Chhanda Chattopadhyay). Asit Basu directs the team in a commendable naturalistic style that reflects on the betrayal of Left forces now. Samskar Bharatis productions are becoming more and more watchable.																					Ananda Lal																					Natural flair																					Joy Bhaduri is a Calcutta boy, who, for a while, experimented with music and was a singer as well. He went on to experiment with paint. He lives in Italy and recently 																					held his exhibition of watercolours, acrylics and drawings at the GC Laha Gallery on Chittaranjan Avenue (until Nov 10). Although direct references do not exist, his large and small works are evocative of natural forms and clouds, rock formations, choppy seas and curtains of light and shadow. At moments they may look like a blot of ink used in a Rorschach test, and the images could flummox certain viewers. His large works are non- figurative but he presented some pen-and-ink drawings as well. These are figurative works in the main, and he draws his spidery lines with self-assurance born of practice. He should show his drawings more often for they do have a streak of originality. 																					SD																					Vibrant hues																					The search for the mythical Phoenix motivated Shukla Chowdhurys exhibition of paintings at the Academy of Fine Arts last month. The sublime enchantment of the magical creature has been an abiding fascination for this Mumbai-based artist. Flamboyant colours  primarily red, blue and yellow  dominate the canvases. These vibrant, soaring hues are either splashed with wild abandon or else the brushwork becomes hectic and ragged. Given her limited imagination, this technique tends to become repetitive if overemphasized. The abstract works look appealing, while the rest are simply tedious. 																					Chandra Gupta

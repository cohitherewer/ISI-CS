							 																						BIRDS OF A FEATHER Theatre -  Ananda Lal																														Max Mueller Bhavans re-awakening on the theatre scene after a long slumber has delighted stage enthusiasts who remember its luminous record of cultural interaction. Since 1971, it has supported and hosted local productions of the works of many German authors. Now, more recent German drama finds exposure. The process began earlier this year with Marius von Mayenburgs Fireface (1997) rendered as Agunmukho, directed by Suman Mukhopadhyay for Tritiyo Sutro. It continues with Volker Ludwigs Sky Earth Air and Sea (1990), adapted into Akash Mati Haoya Jal (picture) by Jayoti Bose for Sutrapat. Written by the pioneer of the Grips project in Berlin, it re-establishes MMBs connection with this innovative childrens theatre programme, and also marks Boses welcome return after years.																														Just as Agunmukho told the shocking tale of a frustrated adolescent in a dysfunctional family within the larger transformations in a globalized society, Akash Mati Haoya Jal deals with the environment  contemporary concerns missing from earlier German drama. A country girl, acutely susceptible to chemicals around her and in her food, comes to the city on an exchange visit and is not only sickened by the pollution and adulteration but berates everyone for accepting them. Her urban friends initially think of her as a weirdo, but ultimately join her in saving the environment. 																														The eco-fundamentalist heroine, effortlessly enacted by Momo (who prefers to go by a stage name in the time-honoured tradition of stage and screen, and has a bright acting future ahead), receives great support from those with whom she lives (Sangita Mandal and Sudipta Saha). Boses workshop method in rehearsal definitely helped the fluency and credibility of the adults imitating kids, though she should reduce the duration by getting rid of all diversions; a show for pre-teens should not exceed an hour. Entertaining and never didactic, Akash Mati Haoya Jal should receive invitations from schools to perform for their students. 																														In a similar play for children, Swatilekha Senguptas dramatization for Nandikar of Leela Mazumders story Pakhi, traffic flows in the opposite direction. The eight-year-old Kumu goes to her grandmothers house in the village to recuperate from a leg injury. There, she meets her playful male cousin and they find a wild duck in their garden wounded by a hunter. A bond develops between her and the migratory bird, both lame; she sees herself in her feathered friend, both yearning to fly home. Sengupta directs with sensitivity. She has composed the music and designed the bright costumes and the muppet-like ducks. Rimi Majumder steals the show as the duck. Without language, she expresses every emotion through a vocabulary of modulated quacks. Antara Banerjee makes an adequate Kumu.

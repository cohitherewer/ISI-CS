							 																						CHILD AT HOME																														For erring children, living with parents or guardians is certainly preferable to living in a correctional centre. This has been made possible by the amendment to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. The new rules will allow children in conflict with the law to stay in their own homes or with foster parents while performing certain specific services for the community. The specially formed Juvenile Police Unit would be one of the main features of the machinery that will make this possible. The change is without doubt humane and, given that the subjects are children, suggests that the shift might actually help bring down the crime rate in minors, as love and care are great correctives. Even then, certain questions are unavoidable. One lies at the very base of the homogeneous idea of children  can everyone from 0 to 18 be considered in the same way with regard to agency, vulnerability, sexual awareness and activity, or the sense of right and wrong?																														A case-by-case assessment would be the only way out of this dilemma. That is, perhaps, impractical in terms of administration. And there are greater problems, especially in the light of the new rules. In a country where studies have repeatedly pointed towards the childs family as one of the chief sources of abuse  physical, mental and sexual  how safe is the minor offender in his or her home? Cruelty, or at least tyranny, begins at home. Restoring street-children to their families to check the rising rate of crime among them raises the same doubts, since the socio-economic profile of these families is such that the child must either work or run away. Or, what about the child or teenager who has killed or raped? Can a neighbourhood be imagined which would look understandingly upon a family that has such a young offender in its midst? While the rule is welcome, it must also take these questions into account.

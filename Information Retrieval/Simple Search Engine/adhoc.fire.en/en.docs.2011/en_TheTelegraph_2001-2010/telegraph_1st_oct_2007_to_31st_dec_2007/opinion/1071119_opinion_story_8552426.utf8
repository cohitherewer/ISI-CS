The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor
				 																Power of words				 																																																				Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees comment that Opposition parties were paid back in the same coin is totally unacceptable (Buddha shield for land grab, Nov 14). To make such a remark is unbecoming of a chief minister whose job is to ensure the well-being of each and every citizen in the state. However, Bhattacharjees statement needs to be put in proper perspective. Like all communists, Bhattacharjee too believes in the use of violence for political gain. The problem with using violence as a political weapon is that one does not really know when to use it. Additionally, such a strategy also makes political parties indifferent to counter- arguments or rational discourse. Arrogance often leads to a denial of simple truths. For instance, it took Jyoti Basu years to concede that communists made a blunder in their assessment of Subhas Chandra Bose. Bhattacharjees observation should surprise no one. Like a true Marxist, he has remained faithful to his ideals. It may take him a century to realize his mistake. Hopefully, by then, Marxism itself will be relegated to history books. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees comment justifying the move to recapture Nandigram with the help of armed cadre has confirmed our worst fears. It is now clear that Bhattacharjee is not the peoples chief minister, but belongs to the party first. This is certainly a dangerous argument and brings to mind not just the State-sponsored pogrom in Gujarat but also the tragic events such as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. If Narendra Modi is communal, then Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is certainly a terrorist.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  I have been following the reports on Nandigram in the The Telegraph from Chennai. They are easily some of the best instances of reportage that I have come across. It was also heartening to read about the huge turn out at the rally led by Calcuttas intellectuals. 				 																																																				I was born and brought up in Calcutta, and I dont remember having seen anything like what was reported in the newspapers. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), which has inherited and nurtured the Congresss culture of political violence, is not in favour of any kind of debate. On the contrary, the party prefers violence to silence its opponents. In the last three decades, the party has tried, and succeeded in most cases, to infiltrate Bengals knowledge centres to consolidate its hold. It has neglected critical areas such as education and health which has cost Bengal dear. The chief minister has gone on record justifying the recapture of Nandigram. This proves once again that for 30 years, all political debates in Bengal have been settled by the use of force by the red brigade. 				 																																																				The picture may be dismal but all is not lost. The rally by the citys intelligentsia shows that although pushed to the wall, Calcuttans have not yet forgotten the language of protest.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  I fully endorse Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees views on Nandigram. The violence perpetrated there was an attempt by rival parties to gain a slice of the political turf by taking the law into their own hands. Bhattacharjee tried to restore law and order by sending the police on March 14. Unfortunately, the move backfired and some people lost their lives. Then the chief minister asked the Centre to deploy the Central Reserve Police Force, but the government in Delhi was tardy in its response, which resulted in unnecessary delay. In between, each and every attempt by the chief minister to negotiate a peaceful settlement was stonewalled by an uncooperative Opposition. 				 																																																				By this time, supporters of the CPI(M) who had taken shelter in Khejuri after being driven out by the Bhumi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee were desperate to return home. They finally succeeded in going back to Nandigram only recently. The bloodshed in Nandigram cannot be condoned. But, considering the fact that the entire issue was politicized by the Opposition, the reaction on the part of the government is justified. One must also mention the medias partisan role in this context. Comparisons between the events in Nandigram and the riots in Gujarat in certain sections of the media were unfortunate, to say the least.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had repeatedly assured members of the Opposition that there would be no chemical hub in Nandigram. Despite these assurances, the militant BUPC, with the support of the Trinamul Congress, took advantage of the situation and drove CPI(M) supporters out of Nandigram. Not just that, its armed cadre dug up ditches, destroyed small bridges to make it difficult for the police or the administration to set foot in Nandigram. 				 																																																				Such a move on the part of the BUPC and the Trinamul Congress was totally unacceptable. After waiting for several months, the CPI(M) supporters decided to retaliate with the help of party cadre in a bid to recapture lost territory. Such a move was all the more necessary as it was clear to the government that the police would not be able to restore peace and order. Bhattacharjee and his colleagues at Alimuddin Street have done nothing wrong and, therefore, should not be criticized.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Newspapers are supposed to edit articles. But certain memorial statements should be left untouched. So, if Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said that the Opposition was paid back their own coins, the statement, with its glorious grammar, ought to have been left intact. Such remarks are indeed historic. By editing the original statement, most English newspapers in Calcutta have edited a piece of history.				 																																																				Yours faithfully

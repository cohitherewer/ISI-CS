							 																						DONE IT AGAIN																														A coalition government that falls apart exposes some peculiar dilemmas. And Karnatakas coalition has fallen apart not once but twice within two months. Karnataka, now under presidents rule for the second time within the same sequence of events, demonstrates these sorry dilemmas with rather greater clarity than is desirable for the people of that state. The coalition forged between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal (Secular) in 2006 was, at its very foundations, frankly self-serving. The Janata Dal (S), headed by H.D. Deve Gowda, whose son was the chief ministerial candidate, was, at that time, fresh from having ditched the Congress. At any time that such a coalition takes place, the question of the peoples will, which is the founding principle of a democratic republic, becomes deeply problematic. Did those who vote for the BJP expect or want the party to tie up with the Janata Dal (S) and vice versa? Whether they did so or not is irrelevant to the parties making up the coalition. Apart from holding on to power, which can happen only with the help of another party, the Janata Dal (S) had no concerns. The BJP, on its part, just wanted a toehold in the South.																														Not much can be expected of politicians who are least interested in governance, in the interests of the people or even in any kind of ideology. Presidents rule in such a situation is an admission of the defeat of the system because of the stubborn greed and egotism of a few people voted to power. The BJP has been ditched by the Janata Dal (S), which found various reasons to refuse to participate in the confidence vote proposed by B.S. Yeddyurappa, whose chief ministership was just over a week old. The BJP had resigned earlier when, in October, the Janata Dal (S) had refused to hand over power to it according to the 2006 agreement. Presidents rule had to be imposed then. But the BJP is a great one for clutching at straws. It grabbed the chance to govern when its fickle partner suddenly decided to support it. Obviously, the right kind of bargains have not been struck  the BJPs refusal to give the Janata Dal (S) the urban and mining portfolios is a presentable excuse, and there are a couple more  and the Janata Dal (S) has played its usual trick at the last minute. Voters cannot be blamed for apathy and cynicism. They are looking at a situation in which democratic functioning has failed.

				 Pretty little things
																					If child is the father of man, then the future of visual arts in West Bengal seems bright enough. Xpressions07 (November 24-30), an exhibition of artworks by young adults, proved that there is no dearth of new talent in the state. The exhibition at the central gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts included oils, watercolours, glass-paintings and clay art by over 150 students from Nehru Childrens Museum. Some of the paintings were uninspired depictions of village scenes of the kind that almost all of us have tried our hands at in school. Thankfully, the majority of students has advanced beyond the typical and has learnt to put their imagination to use. The paintings by Ananya Mukherjee, Kanyaka Bhattacharya, Pallabi Mazumdar and Sayan Chanda, although not always technically perfect, can provide food for thought. 
																					The terracotta figurines were pretty and seemed to have landed straight from a village fair. And you could learn a lesson or two from the children on ways of converting the humble glass chimney into a thing of beauty. The coloured patterns on the glass-cover of the chimneys transform them magically. No doubt they will look even more dazzling when light streams out through the colours.

																					Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre presented an evening of Kathak at Bharatiyam on November 22. The show, conceived and choreographed by Susmita Chatterjee, offered two items based on traditional style. 
																					The first number of the evening, Anubhuti, depicted the significance of the primordial sound, Om. The crisp footwork and graceful movements of Chatterjee and her students helped establish the theme in a convincing manner. Chumki, Arpita, Chameli, Mandira, Payel, Souvik and others put up a pleasant performance, thanks to the coordinated movements and simple compositions. This presentation was followed by an analytical piece, which explored the different shades of Draupadis character. Chatterjees capability to stay true to the grammar of this particular dance style was impressive. Attempts were also made to put in elements of various other contemporary forms as well as marshal arts into the Kathak presentation. However, such an innovative experiment deserved to be presented in a compact and precise manner. Anubha Fatehpurias narration of the concept was intense while Utpal Ghoshal and Chandrachur Bhattacharya provided able support on the tabla and sitar respectively. Luna Poddar on bol parhant would pass muster.

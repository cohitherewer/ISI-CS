							 																						MATURE MELODY OF THE EVENING
 Nilaksha Gupta
											 			 Music
																														Amaan Ali Khan played a mature alap in Yaman Kalyan at the outset of a sarod recital to mark the birth centenary of a fabled music patron of the city, the late Manmatha Nath Ghosh, on December 13, at the patrons Pathuriaghata residence. The maturity showed in the development of the two halves of the raga alternately in the mandra saptak or bass octave and the incorporation of Shuddh Kalyan and Nat phrases in the classic manner. Like all alaps or even vilambit khayals in Yaman Kalyan, the alap started off with the elaboration of phrases of the uttaranga or upper tetra chord of the raga in the upper bass octave. But after the rishabh and the gandhar were first sounded in the madhya saptak, the phrase development switched to the lower mandra saptak or deep bass octave. It was here that the shuddh madhyam was first used in the main phrase reserved for it: Re Ga Ma Ga-Re. 
																														Immediately after that, the elaboration returned to the upper bass note cluster. It then returned to the deep bass to proceed up to the pancham. It shifted again to the madhya saptak to sound the characteristic phrase Ni Re Ga and swooped back to the deep bass again. That is how the alap alternated between two halves of the raga for the first 10 minutes and created a melodic impact not usually found in the conventional linear approach. The Shuddh Kalyan phrases Dha Pa Ga-Re and Re Ga Dha Pa appeared in the madhya saptak portion and the phrases ascribed to the Nat ang (Pa ma-Pa `Sa , Pa ma-Pa `Re `Sa ) were sounded immediately after the taar saptak sadaj was struck. In the jod, the same maturity showed in the blend of melodic phrases and the devices that carried them: lapets, lad-lapet, medium pace, fast medium and fast ekhara taans (at times laced with gamaks in khayal style). The concluding ulat jhala was not only dressed with gamaks and powerful bolkari but had excellent melodic content as well. 
																														The emphasis was more on taankari and bolkari in the madhya drut jhaptal gat. There were bass ekhara taans, duni ekhara taans growing out of melodic patterns, bolang taan-toda and melodic bolkari climaxing with tihais. Sabir Khan on the tabla played with restraint and to the context, totally shunning elaborate display of skill. The drut teental gat was played in the same vein. Amaan went on to play an aochar and rupak tala gat in Kirwani that displayed fine melodic development and variegated ekhara taankari. Finally there was a thumri-style aochar and drut teental gatkari in Khamaj. There were thumri-style movements in the gatkari initially and then powerful ekhara taans and bol-ang taan-toda.

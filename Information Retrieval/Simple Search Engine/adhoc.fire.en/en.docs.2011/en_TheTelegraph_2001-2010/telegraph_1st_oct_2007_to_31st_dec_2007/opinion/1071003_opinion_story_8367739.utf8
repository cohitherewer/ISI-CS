				 																Party poopers					Sir  The grand party organized by the Maharashtra government at Mumbais Wankhede stadium to celebrate Indias victory in the ICC World Twenty20 championship was no doubt ridiculous. The 35,000 people who packed the stadium to catch a glimpse of their heroes must have been thoroughly disappointed. But not so the politicians or the officials of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. It must have eventually also pleased the cricketers who never tire of being the cynosure of eyes. That the same attention will never be given to other sports is obvious from the Indian hockey teams threat to go on a hunger strike for being overlooked after their win, and Viswanathan Anands despondency after being crowned the world chess champion. Such partisanship will kill the spirit of players and affect Indias performance in sports.					Yours faithfully,																															
M.M. Kale, Kakinada

					Sir  India might be delirious with excitement following the Twenty20 World Cup win. While the response might seem a bit over the top, it would be unfair to condemn it outright. In a country ridden with corrupt politicians, crime, violence and poverty, how often can we come across events that merit joyous celebration? Since sports has no political or religious colour, people all over the country can give expression to unreserved joy for once. 					Yours faithfully,																															
S.C. Kapoor, Noida

					Sir  Cricketers were not only considered insignificant at Wankhede, their security also did not seem to matter any more. The frenzied crowd was allowed to invade the ground, as a result of which the pitch, where the India-Australia one-day match is scheduled to be played on October 17, has been badly damaged. 					Yours faithfully,																															
R.K. Saha, Calcutta

					Sir  Cricketers in India get crores of rupees when they win and lakhs when they lose. On the other hand, hockey players get fined for goals conceded. Even when they win, the amount awarded to the team is so meagre that it is insulting. No young men or women in India will take up hockey if they see that cricket is where all the money is. 					Yours faithfully,																															
G. Singh, Calcutta

					Sir  It is good to see young cricketers being generously rewarded. But when the Indian hockey team brought home the Asia Cup, were the accolades similar? If no, then the government should stop rewarding sportspeople in such a disparate manner. 					Yours faithfully,																															
Ashok K. Ghosh, Calcutta

					Sir  A welcome change seems to be sweeping over India. In sports, as in politics, the young are replacing the old by proving their mettle. Even as young Mahendra Singh Dhoni leads India to success, Rahul Gandhi takes over the reins of the Congress as the newly-appointed general secretary of the party. Let us hope that the young brigade will infuse new life into moribund India. 					Yours faithfully,																															
Geraldine H, Mumbai

					Sir  The post and telegraph department of India might consider the issue of colourful postage stamps to commemorate the successive sports victories of India this year, particularly in cricket. It will be a fitting tribute to the team and will also rake in revenue for the department.					Yours faithfully, 																															
Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba 

					Sir  Once the celebrations are over, Indian cricket will have to face the reality. The selection process and the politics played by the senior players are going to be a serious challenge for Mahendra Singh Dhoni. For him, the real challenge begins now as he has to skilfully maintain his position within the team while combating the political manoeuvrings. 					Yours faithfully,																															
Kausalya Giri, Calcutta

					Parting shot					Sir  There are heinous crimes being committed in the name of healthcare in Calcutta. I was in the city recently on account of my mothers illness. She was admitted to the intensive therapy unit of a renowned hospital specializing in cardiac care with breathing difficulty and several other complications. Confined to bed in that state, she was sexually molested by the male nurses, whom the hospital calls Brothers. 					Patients in intensive care units are most vulnerable to such unthinkably perverse acts. A huge number of male nurses are on duty at night. I have myself witnessed how they make fun of patients advanced in age while they change their diapers. This is a crime and a violation of human rights.					Yours faithfully,																															Sumana Barua,

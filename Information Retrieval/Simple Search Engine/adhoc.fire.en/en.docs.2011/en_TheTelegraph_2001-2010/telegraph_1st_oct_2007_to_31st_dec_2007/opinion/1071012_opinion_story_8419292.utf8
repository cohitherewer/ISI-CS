				 																Master of nuance and scrupleSelected stories (Penguin, Rs 295) by Sadat Hasan Manto collects some of the finest tales by one of the pre-eminent masters of Urdu literature. In his 43 years of earthly life, Manto produced scores of short stories, alongside one novel, radio plays, critical essays, memoirs and filmscripts. Much of his tempestuous and emotionally harrowing life was reflected in the texture of his bold prose. In stories like Toba Tek Singh, A Womans Life and Colder Than Ice, he interlaces political upheavals with individual tragedies. The tales are haunted by the spectre of Partition, and sometimes bristle with strong eroticism. An acknowledged stylist of the language, Mantos Urdu was capable of capturing the delicate nuances of any human situation. It is therefore a daunting task to bring the richness of his prose alive in English. Given these limitations, the selection has been translated and introduced very capably by Khalid Hasan.																												With respect to sex (Yoda, Rs 395) by Gayatri Reddy looks at the challenges of Negotiating Hijra Identity in South India. Reddys extensively researched work is the latest addition to the on-going series on Sexualities under the general editorship of Gautam Bhan. This volume gives a comprehensive account of the social and political destinies of the third sex in South India. Reddy locates the problem of alternative sexual identities within a cultural and ethnographic model before moving on to other pertinent issues  religion, iconography, mythologies, oral histories and sociological structures. Despite the academic nature of the survey, the flavour of the prose is informal and engaging. The exhaustive bibliography at the end is a bonus.																												Protection (Headline, 6.99) by Claire Allen tells the story of Marinas flight from London with her infant son, Oscar. A homeless mother, Marina tries to escape the looming hand of social care poised to snatch her beloved son from her. In the course of her peregrinations, she runs into a kindly woman, Hannah, who tries to protect mother and son from their destitution by offering them lodging. But then there is also Liam, a young man with a troubled past, with whom Marina has a different score to settle. In this nexus of loneliness, suspicion, trouble and despair, people come together to help each other out. With her gift of lucid and informed writing, Allen puts life into social issues.Shaam-e-awadh: writings on Lucknow (Penguin, Rs 395) edited by Veena Talwar Oldenburg is an anthology of various moods and memories associated with Lucknow, a city with a rich cultural past. The entries are often quirky, as evident in this snippet by Ghalib, who made no secret of his disdain for the city: My reason for coming to Lucknow remains a puzzle, because my desire for strolling among spectacles or carnivals is negligible. There are some fascinating records as well. Loot!, an extract from the Government of India Archives, is a painstaking chronicle of those items that actually made it to the royal coffers in England after the crown took over the Indian empire and disbanded the joint-stock company in 1858. Other, equally interesting vignettes  fictional, anecdotal, historical  are provided by a wide range of texts. The timeline is vast, from the mid-19th to the late 20th century. The list of authors includes Attia Hossain, Ruchira Mukherjee, William Dalrymple and I. Allan Sealy. However, the selection is neither representative nor judicious. How else could the absence of Abdul Halim Sharar  whose classic, Lucknow: The Last Phase of an Oriental Culture, inspired Satyajit Rays Shatranj ki Khiladi  be explained?

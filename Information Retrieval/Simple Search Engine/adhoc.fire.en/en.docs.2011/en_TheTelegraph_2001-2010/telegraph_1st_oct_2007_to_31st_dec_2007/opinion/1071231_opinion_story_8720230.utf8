							 																						BRAVE, BUT NO SAVIOUR
 Gwynne Dyer
																					Benazir Bhutto did five years of hard time in prison, much of it in solitary confinement, after her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was overthrown and hanged by the worst of Pakistans military dictators, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. But she was a woman who liked her privileges and her luxuries, and she was never a very effective politician.
																					I got to know Benazir Bhutto a bit in the mid-Seventies, when she had finished her degree at Harvard and was doing graduate work at Oxford. She actually spent much of her time in London, in a grand flat she kept just off Hyde Park.
																					If you knew a lot of people in town who took an interest in Middle Eastern and subcontinental affairs, and you werent too old or boring, you were likely to end up at her flat once in a while, at what some would call a salon but I would call a party.
																					A fairly decorous party as those things went in Seventies London, to be sure, with everybody showing off their sophisticated knowledge of the regions politics and nobody getting out of hand, but definitely a party. The hostess was well informed and quite clever, and she obviously had money coming out of her ears. We knew her dad had been prime minister of Pakistan before Zia overthrew him, but she was neither a serious scholar nor a budding politician.
																					She seemed more American than Pakistani in her style and attitude, but beneath the Radcliffe and Harvard veneer she also seemed like thousands of other young upper-class women from Pakistan and India who were floating around London at the time. They called one another by girlish nicknames like Bubbles, they didnt take anything very seriously, and they seemed destined for a life of idle privilege.
																					Fading hope
																					Then Benazir Bhutto went back to Pakistan in 1977, just about the time Zia had her father sentenced to death in a rigged trial. He was hanged in 1979, and Benazir was thrown into jail for five years. But when she came out after Zia died, she was already the head of the party her father had founded, the Pakistan Peoples Party, and, by 1988, she was prime minister. She was only 35.
																					The problem was that she never seemed to have any goal in politics, apart from vindicating her father by leading his party back to power. At the start, she was hugely popular, but she wasted her opportunity to make real changes in Pakistan because she had no notion of what a better Pakistan would look like. Pakistan is already pretty good for her sort of people, so it should not surprise us that there was almost nothing to show for her years in office.
																					If she had become prime minister again, which was a quite likely outcome of the current crisis, there is no reason to believe that she would have done any better this time. Her assassination just makes it harder to solve the crisis at all.
																					The most probable outcome is a new period of military rule under a different ruler, simply for the lack of a good alternative. It is pathetic that a country the size of Pakistan should have so few inspiring or even promising candidates for high political office.
																					The vast majority of Pakistans politicians, and of the people who run pretty well everything else in the country apart from the armed forces, are drawn from the three or four per cent of the population who constitute the countrys traditional elite. It is a very shallow pool of talent, made up of people who have a big stake in the status quo and a huge sense of entitlement.
																					Look east to India, west to Iran, or north to China, and, by comparison, Pakistans political demography is absolutely feudal. So long as that remains the case, it is absurd to imagine that democracy will solve Pakistans problems. I admired Benazir Bhuttos courage and I am very sorry that she was killed, but she could never have been Pakistans saviour.

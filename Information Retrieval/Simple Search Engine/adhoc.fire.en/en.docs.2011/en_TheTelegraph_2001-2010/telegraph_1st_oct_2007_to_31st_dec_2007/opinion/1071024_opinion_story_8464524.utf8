							 																						SING IT ALOUD																														Manmohan Singh is a very modest man, even though he has very little to be modest about. Sometimes this modesty  a sign of the gentleman that Mr Singh is  can become the most critical weakness of Mr Singh, the prime minister. His innate humility often prevents him from speaking his mind clearly and assertively. This comes across as a sign of weakness, and leads to his being taken for granted. The prevailing state of uncertainty over the Indo-US nuclear deal grows largely out of the prime ministers failure to speak his mind unambiguously. Two months ago, Mr Singh had said in an interview to The Telegraph that the Left allies were welcome to withdraw support if they did not approve of the Indo-US deal. That had precipitated a political crisis, which was averted by forming a committee that would try and formulate an acceptable compromise between the Left and the government. This had then appeared to be a temporizing measure. In the middle of October, Mr Singh seemed to be yielding ground to the Left when he announced that he would be disappointed if the deal did not come through, but the deal was not the only item on the governments agenda. Many people felt that the crisis had passed, but the more observant noted that nowhere had the prime minister said that the deal was dead. On Monday, the prime minister returned to the theme of the deal in a meeting with some of his cabinet colleagues and expressed his anguish that some of them had let him down by first okaying the deal and then speaking against it.																														What is evident from this sequence of events is the lack of clarity in Mr Singhs position regarding the deal and its future. Is he going ahead with the deal? There is no definite answer to this question. This is surprising because Mr Singh has invested a great deal of time and energy in and also staked his reputation on the deal. Yet he appears to be dithering. Or he seems to be unwilling, for reasons best known to him, to state clearly what his future course of action on the deal is going to be. Under the circumstances, the nation can only echo Mr Singhs anguish because it has a prime minister who is incapable of making up his mind on a very crucial issue. This is no way to conduct public affairs and is least expected from a man of Mr Singhs rectitude. He should tell the country, in no uncertain terms, what he wants to do and be prepared for the consequences.

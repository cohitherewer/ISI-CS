				 																Writer blocked				 																																																				Sir  It is a shame that Taslima Nasreen has now been forced to flee the city she had sought refuge in and called her own (Red with shame, Nov 24). The violence seen on Calcuttas streets on November 21, one that resulted in the army having to come in and restore law and order, was orchestrated by a section of the Muslim community demanding that the government should revoke Taslima Nasreens visa so that she is forced to leave this country. Nasreen had penned a book nearly ten years ago that is seen as anti-Islamic by large numbers in the Muslim fraternity. Consequently, Nasreen had to leave Bangladesh, fearing for her life. 				 																																																				In this case, one needs to point out the fact that the constitution of Bangladesh, describing the country as secular, as framed in 1972, was subsequently amended in 1977, to remove the particular word. However, the reasons for Nasreens aversion for her own country are not our concern. As a citizen of a secular country, we should only be concerned with ways to discourage those who are trying to deny her the right to express her views freely. 				 																																																				Unfortunately, instead of standing by her, a prominent Left leader asked for Nasreens expulsion from Bengal after the violence. Though the statement was withdrawn later, its implications were evident from the manner in which the author was packed off to Jaipur immediately. It seems that Bengals leaders are incapable of securing the life of an eminent writer. Surely we cannot repose our faith in such a cowardly government. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Bengal has always been known to have faith in secular traditions. But, after the recent incidence of violence in Calcutta, it is difficult to believe that this still holds true. The manner in which Taslima Nasreen was shooed away from the city by a scared government after a rowdy mob took to the streets must have shocked most Calcuttans. Even a senior Left leader asked Nasreen to leave Calcutta, only to retract his statement later. It is ridiculous to see an elected government bend over backwards to appease fundamentalists. The discontent of the minorities can be attributed to extreme poverty and the governments failure to improve their economic condition. So why is Nasreen being made the target of their anger?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ashis Mitra, Ranchi

				 																																																				Sir  Every person has a right to reside anywhere in India if he holds a valid visa and has no criminal record. More importantly, no political party or individual has the right to call for someones deportment on fictitious grounds. Taslima Nasreen has the right to live in India as long as she follows visa rules that are applicable in this country. If Nasreen has hurt the religious sentiments of a particular community through her writing, then her opponents are free to take legal action against her. But they cannot indulge in violence in the name of protesting against the authors supposedly blasphemous works.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Taslima Nasreen has always been critical of the treatment meted out to Muslim women in the name of religion. Most Muslim women are forced to cover themselves in the burqa. They are seldom provided with the opportunities for an education, barring the reading of the Quran at home. It is disappointing to note that a rampaging mob of Muslim fundamentalists succeeded in forcing Nasreen to leave Calcutta. This incident has shown, once again, that democracy and freedom of speech continue to remain in danger in our country. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tuneer Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir The governments handling of the Taslima Nasreen issue defies logic. A non-entity whose credentials as an author are suspect, one who has gone against the tenets of her religion, is first given shelter in this country and then flown from one city to another as if she were a VIP. Nasreen has been given privileges which even established and well-connected Indians are unable to command. She should remember that she was given shelter in Bengal at a time when her life was in danger. But now that her presence in the city has lead to disturbances, she should have the courtesy to leave of her own volition. There is only so much sympathy that can be shown to foreigners at the cost of peace and stability in ones own land. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

				 																																																				Sir  I am a Bengali Muslim, and am proud to be one. Calcutta is known as a hub of intellectuals and I have a few questions for the citys intelligentsia. Would Calcuttas intellectuals remain sensitive to Taslima Nasreens cause if she were to malign a Hindu god? If the answer is yes, then why is it that they have done nothing to bring back M.F. Husain to his own country? Our intellectuals seem to have forgotten that Nasreen is a mediocre writer who is only interested in creating controversies to boost the sales figure of her books. 				 																																																				A lot has also been said about an artists right to freedom. But should an artist be allowed to hurt the sentiments of a particular religious community for the sake of this freedom?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nadim Qaisar, Calcutta

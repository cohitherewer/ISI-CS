							 																						NEW CONGRESS																														The Congress is unique not only in its history, but also in its character. Throughout its history, it has been a mass-based party without actually having the strong disciplinarian structure of communist parties across the world or of the Bharatiya Janata Party in India. The Congress has been like a platform to which many have been called and on which many have been represented. The core strength of the Congress has been its inclusive character. Thus the conditions of membership to which Rahul Gandhi has drawn attention in his debut in the Congress working committee  members should wear khadi, not drink alcohol and so on  were more a reflection of some of the idiosyncratic views of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi than of the strength of the Congress. Khadi became a symbol of swadeshi that Gandhi used with devastating effect against the British Empire. But after independence, its relevance related to the past rather than to the progress of India. Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhis chosen cup-bearer, gave to Gandhis message of self-reliance and swaraj a technological and modernist dimension. Under both Gandhi and Nehru, the Congress grew because it preserved its inclusive character without laying too much stress on the various criteria of membership.																														By resurrecting these criteria, Mr Gandhi is, unfortunately, harking back to a past that has lost much of its relevance. The critical issues before the party are not the wearing of khadi and the drinking of liquor. Rather, the leadership must look at the ideological moorings of the party. Despite its earlier platform-like character, it was always clear what the Congress stood for. Before Independence, it stood for nationalism and independence. After Independence, under both Nehru and Indira Gandhi, the Congress was identified with socialism. But from the time of Rajiv Gandhi, and increasingly so from the Nineties, it has never been clear where the Congress stands. It pioneered the economic reforms, but has always been somewhat shamefaced about them. It has not yet jettisoned its socialist baggage. Whenever there is a crisis, the Congress falls back on populism, which it believes is a confirmed winner in the electoral race. This ideological confusion  its critics would say, ideological characterlessness  is reflected in the policies, or the lack of them, of the government that the Congress currently leads at the Centre. This clutter needs to be cleared if the Congress is to refashion itself as the party of the future. The clutter consists of ideological debris from the past, and lack of clarity in the present.																														Mr Gandhi, if he is to be seen as a serious candidate for the leadership of the country and the party, has his task cut out for him. It is not to remove or reaffirm quaint criteria of membership. He has to give to the party a direction and inspire loyalty towards certain ideals that are in tune with the times. This has to be combined with an attempt to restore the Congresss inclusive character. The debut may not show the day.

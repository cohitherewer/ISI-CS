							 																						SWEET BUT NOT SHARP ENOUGH Sharmila Basu Thakur											 			 Dance																														Each classical dance format has its own style and demands a specific manner of presentation to establish the essence of that particular form. The brilliance of a dancer depends on his or her ability to master this essential characteristic, apart from the dancers capability to express gracefully. 																														Rasika Khanna (picture), a Mumbai- based Bharatnatyam dancer, was traditional in her costume and presentation but her dance lacked the chiselled brilliance that is the hallmark of the Bharatnatyam dance form. Presented by Padatik Dance Centre and Sangeet Ashram, the recital at G.D. Birla Sabhagar on September 28 brought together an array of traditional Bharatnatyam numbers. The most enjoyable part of the entire programme was the live accompaniment, so rare these days. Divided into two parts, the programme started with slokam pranamya shirsha devam Gouri putra Vinayakam from Narada Sukta, which describes the birth of Ganesha. 																														Based on raga Kalyani and taal adi, the padam depicted Krishna with his gopis. The dancer here was expressive and earnest. Her neat footwork and precise mudras were praiseworthy. The choreography to the Rabindrasangeet, Esho shyamala sundara, was innovative although the presentation was average. Khanna was accompanied by S. Sekhar on nattubhangam, Suriya Narayanan on mridangam and A.S. Vishal on violin. Raja Gopal rendered excellent vocal support.

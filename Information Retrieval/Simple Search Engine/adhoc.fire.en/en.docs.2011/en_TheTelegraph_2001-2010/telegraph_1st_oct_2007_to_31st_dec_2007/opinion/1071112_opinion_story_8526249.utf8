							 																						HOME ON A LOAN																														The current credit cycle has had a substantial mortgage element from the beginning. The inexorable rise in foreign exchange reserves flooded the economy with liquidity, so companies had no need to borrow. Some of them had so much cash flowing in that they went round the world looking for businesses to buy. For the first time in history, Indian companies began to export capital instead of importing it. Left without their traditional borrowers, banks had to find some use for their overflowing cash. So they cultivated borrowers that they had traditionally treated with disdain  prospective home buyers. And when buyers hesitated, banks went after builders, leaving it to them to lure buyers. In this way they built up a large portfolio of mortgage loans. The Reserve Bank of India was always chary of mortgages; from last December it began to raise interest rates. But that did nothing to dampen either the banks enthusiasm or the builders energy. When real estate prices were doubling every year, a rise of a few per cent in interest rates could hardly discourage anyone from investing. But the new financial year changed the mood. The stock of creditworthy borrowers began to run out. First, sales of two-wheelers began to fall; sales of cars soon followed. The banks perception of risk increased; they began to raise rates. By July, growth of new house loans was also slowing down. 																														Now begins the next stage. As interest rates rise, those who had borrowed on floating rates suddenly find their monthly installments going out of control. Banks are sending musclemen after defaulters; they are repossessing vehicles, and sometimes breaking a few heads on the side. But the worst has not been seen yet. Banks have not yet run out of liquidity. A point must come when defaults begin to impinge on banks solvency. That is when the RBI will panic. In the guise of saving banks, it will give them some tough love. And as borrowers woes increase, politicians will see an opportunity. 																														Just what they will do then cannot yet be clear. The last crisis involved perhaps a few thousand companies. It felled IDBI, and made a number of nationalized banks sick. The government set up debt recovery tribunals, which continue to grind slowly. But the next crisis will involve lakhs of individual borrowers. If musclemen beat them up, the media will give them banner headlines. If thousands are driven out of their apartments, politicians will be agitated. The next crisis will be politically far more sensitive then the last. That is the experience of industrial countries where mortgage lending has a longer history; that history will be repeated here. The government would do well to prepare for the crisis, and try and ameliorate its rigours. It should make plans for refinancing banks that cannot recover loans. Its traditional methods of dealing with bad debt epidemics will not work this time.

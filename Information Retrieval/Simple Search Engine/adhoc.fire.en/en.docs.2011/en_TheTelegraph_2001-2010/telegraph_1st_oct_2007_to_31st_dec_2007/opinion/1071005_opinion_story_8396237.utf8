							 																						BAD DEAL																														If Bengals ruling Marxists are to be believed, food is not a problem for the poorest of the states people. Such people would not have been voting the Left to power for the past thirty years, the argument goes, if the government did not provide them with their meagre quotas of rice and wheat. The ration riots in several of Bengals districts blow the lid off this political myth. The anger against the ration-dealers points to the inefficiency of the government and to the corruption in the system. These are old problems but the outbursts show that nothing much has been done to solve them. More ominous are the political signals emanating from the riots. The ruling Marxists seem to be increasingly losing the political will to reach the benefits of the rationing system to the people who need them most. The supply of essential commodities through the public distribution system has always been the cornerstone of Left politics in Bengal. The leftists have made much political capital from accusing different governments in New Delhi of trying to undermine the rationing system. Now, the agitating people in Bankura, Birbhum and Burdwan have accused the ration dealers of doing much the same. The people cannot get wheat from the ration shops allegedly because the dealers steal it from them and sell it in the open market at a higher price. In other words, the dealers, who are appointed by the government to run the system, are out to sabotage it. 																														The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, is right in saying that violent attacks on the dealers and their shops are no answer to the problems. It is also true that the poor people would be the biggest losers if violence disrupts the rationing system. But things cannot get any better if he or his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), sees in the peoples protests only a conspiracy by the Lefts opponents. It would also be simplistic to complain, as the state secretary of the CPI(M), Biman Bose, has done, that a few black sheep among the ration dealers are ruining the system. Mr Bhattacharjee has much to worry about if his government cannot ensure the smooth running of ration shops in the villages. The least he can do is ask the food minister to punish the erring dealers. The leftists rise to power in Bengal owes much to their food movements in 1959 and 1966. They should know how powerful the politics of food can be.

				 																Between fun and malice				 																																																				Sir  It is unfortunate that a radio jockey made some uncharitable remarks about the Gorkhas. This shows that educated Indians continue to remain insensitive towards regional cultures. Caricature could turn out to be a sophisticated art form, but it must be remembered that the line between fun and malice is often blurred. The controversy surrounding the RJs comments points out the importance of restraint even as one invokes the freedom of expression. After all, we should remember that we are social creatures and co-existing harmoniously with fellow human beings requires us to be careful about our actions in public.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Exclusion of all else				 																																																				Sir It sounds incredible that a two-time world chess champion had to wonder about the kind of reception he would get when he returns to his country (World Master mulls, Oct 1). Viswanathan Anands speculation is validated by the euphoria surrounding only one sport in India at the exclusion of all else. It is not as if India winning the Twenty20-World Cup is the only reason our country has to rejoice about success in international sports. The Indian football team won the Nehru Cup recently while our hockey players bagged the Asia Cup. In billiards, Pankaj Advani won the IBSF world billiards title as well. Each of these is as significant a feat as Indias victory in South Africa. Indians ought to be proud of each of these events and not lose their minds over cricket. We should ensure that Anand gets a rousing welcome, like the one our cricketers got after they returned to India.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kundan Singh, Jalpaiguri

				 																																																				Sir Viswanathan Anand made India proud by scaling new heights in world chess. Despite his continual success in international chess, he has not been recognized either by sporting bodies or by the government. On the other hand, Indian cricketers have always been treated like superstars by the fans and the administrators alike. After winning the Twenty20 World Cup, they were rewarded with unimaginable sums of money. But the players who shine in hockey, football, athletics or chess continue to be neglected. Apart from members of the national hockey team, billiards champion, Pankaj Advani, too, has expressed displeasure for being ignored despite sterling performances. It is true that India has not been performing well in athletics but that is primarily because of the lack of funds for training. Japan has recently announced rewards for its athletes to encourage them to perform better. This, despite the fact, that the Japanese have been winning medals in most major international events. The sports ministry in India should give equal importance to all games, not just cricket. Unless the government does this, Indias performance in international sports other than cricket would remain mediocre. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Ram, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir Viswanathan Anand deserves to be congratulated for yet another brilliant performance in the World Chess Champion. Within a few weeks, India has excelled in various sporting competitions. It all began with the win in the Nehru Cup football tournament, followed by the triumph of the mens hockey team in the Asia Cup and Tania Sachdevs triumph in the Asian Chess Championship. Then came the spectacular victory in the Twenty20 World Cup. One hopes that Viswanathan Anand would receive a warm welcome from his countrymen on his return from Mexico City. The government and the sports department should also make some effort to make Anand feel special. After all, winning the World chess championship twice is no mean achievement. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

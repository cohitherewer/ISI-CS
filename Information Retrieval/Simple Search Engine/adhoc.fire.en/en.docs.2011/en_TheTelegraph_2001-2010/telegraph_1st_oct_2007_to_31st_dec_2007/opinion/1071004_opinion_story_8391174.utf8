							 																						A MIDDLE PATH																														As was to be expected, the mission by the United Nations special envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, to Mynamar has not led to any immediate breakthrough. There are few signs yet of the military junta relaxing its hold over the country or letting the pro-democracy uprising take the shape of a powerful movement again. India has adopted a cautious stand, but perhaps excessively guarded. While it is essential that Indias policy remains rooted in realism, it is important also that New Delhi continuously monitors the ground reality in Myanmar and remains in constant dialogue with the major regional and international players on the issue. Mr Gambari, however, achieved success in being able to meet Myanmars reclusive junta leader, senior General Than Shwe. But there was no joint communiqu or comment by either side, following the meeting, which could indicate a positive outcome. 																														Mr Gambari was also able to meet Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained pro-democracy leader and Nobel laureate, who has become the worldwide symbol of popular resistance against the military regime. Although the military crackdown on pro-democracy forces began in 1988, current protests have been inspired by two recent events. In August, the military regime, unexpectedly, raised fuel prices by nearly 500 per cent, generating protests on the streets of Yangon. In September, the army alienated the ruling clergy by firing at a group of protesting monks in the town of Pakkoku. These two events coalesced into an anti-establishment uprising, which led to a bloody crackdown by the junta, resulting in the killing of several civilians including a foreign journalist. While the major Western countries have a variety of sanctions in force against the Yangon regime, the Association of South East Asian Countries have traditionally followed a pragmatic approach of constructive engagement. Given, however, the degree of international outrage, Asean too has sought to influence Yangon to cooperate with the UN envoy. 																														From 1988 to 1992, Indias policy towards the military junta was driven by idealistic considerations, and the significant support in the country for Ms Suu Kyi. Only since 1992 has New Delhi adopted a more realpolitik posture, motivated as much by the need to contain Chinese influence in Mynamar as by the desire to ensure that the military regime does not provide sanctuary to militants from the northeast of India. In the process, it has clearly been seen as abandoning the pro-democracy movement. A slight course correction may now be in order and the external affairs minister may have finally signalled this in his meeting with his Myanmar counterpart, U. Nyan Win, on the margins of the UN general assembly. Realism is essential, but standing up for the right values too is important when a country is emerging as a major player in international relations.

							 																						LAW OF THE JUNGLE, OR THE LACK OF IT																					 - If trains drove slower through the Dooars, would fewer elephants and tigers die?
						RIGHT OF WAY																														Take a count. Twenty-seven elephants, three bison, four leopards and a Royal Bengal tiger. It could well be the large wild mammal count in the forests of north Bengal ten or fifteen years from now. Thankfully, it is not so as yet. The numbers are of animals killed in the region over the last 12 months.																														The deaths of elephants were caused mostly by speeding trains, poaching and electrocution by fences. A large mature male tiger was also reportedly dashed to death by a train right on the border of Cooch Behar district and the Alipurduar subdivision of Jalpaiguri.																														Reams of research have been devoted to the conflict between man and animal around the world. Counter-measures have been suggested, compensation packages planned and awareness programmes devised. But none of this has managed to stem the mounting animal deaths in the forests of north Bengal.																														Foresters have tried to put their finger on the reasons behind the abnormally high rate of wild animal deaths. Many of the deaths, they said, were because of the negligence of train drivers to stick to a slow pace while they passed through the forested area of the Dooars on tracks that have left the natural corridor for the migration of elephants totally redundant. An allegation that the railways authorities have promptly denied. In fact, railways officials have claimed that on many occasions, their drivers have saved elephants from being run over.																														Animal rights activists have been sharply criticizing both the foresters and the railways for the incidents which have left large holes in the already depleting population of animals in their natural habitat in north Bengal. Equally large holes have been made in the pockets of the forest department, which has had to part with an average of Rs 20 lakh to Rs 25 lakh annually as compensation to farmers for crop damage caused by wild animals.																														If wildlife enthusiasts condemn the failure of wildlife management and the lack of vigilance to prevent human incursions into forests, they should also spare a thought for the thousands of workers living in the tea gardens of the Dooars and Terai areas in north Bengal.																														Every year, hundreds of houses and huts where tea garden workers stay are damaged by wild elephants searching for food and getting attracted by the smell of locally-brewed liquor. These workers are left without hearth or home, as the forest department does not pay them the standard Rs 5,000 compensation for damage to their property. Tea garden workers, under the plantation labour laws, are not eligible for any compensation by the forest establishment unless they are killed or injured by wild animals. And, with planters trying to tide over the hard times for the tea industry now, the garden managements too can provide scant relief to the workers by repairing or strengthening their dwellings.																														There have been initiatives to form reporting systems within the panchayats about the movement of animals in collaboration with the forest department. But such a system has never been put to the test. The erection of energized fencing that exists in wildlife reserves and sanctuaries like Mahananda, Gorumara and Chapramari to restrict elephants within their corridors has also failed to control the age-old strife between animals and humans in north Bengal.

							 																						MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD																					Writing a Nation; An Anthology of Indian Journalism 
																				 Edited by Nirmala Lakshman, Rupa, Rs 795																					An interesting anecdote does the rounds in the field of journalism. It goes thus: an up-and-coming journalist, who later became quite famous, was asked by his editor to write about the elephant. The journalist was flabbergasted. Hesitantly, the poor fellow murmured a weak protest, But sir, I know nothing about the elephant. The editor flashed a benign smile, then said condescendingly, Okay, then write what you dont know about the elephant.																					The tale, albeit its comic exaggeration, captures the true spirit of journalistic writing. A journalist seldom has the luxury to go back to his library to study a subject. Rather, he must be ever-prepared to take on his subject headlong, glean relevant information in as little time as possible, and write in a way so as to initiate public debate. And since a democracy that does not allow space for such debate is but crippled, the role of the media in a given democratic set-up can hardly be over-emphasized.																					Nirmala Lakshman, the joint editor of The Hindu has done a commendable job by editing the present anthology of contemporary journalist writings. It definitely is a pioneering work in the Indian context. Freedom of the press doubtless is a sine qua non in a thriving democracy. In her introduction, which succinctly traces the evolution of Indian journalistic writings, Lakshman shows how this freedom has been challenged from the Raj era onwards. In fact, the fight of the Indian press for its freedom has been co-terminus with that of the Indian democracy aspiring towards maturity.																					Lakshman, quite appreciably, alerts us to the perils besetting the journalistic ethic in an age of globalization and commodity fetishism. She draws on the book, Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky to demonstrate the twin effects of money and power on news choices, which, in India as elsewhere, increasingly undermine the concerns of the marginalized.																					The 134 articles collated from the leading Indian dailies and journals and arranged under six broad divisions encompass a dizzyingly wide spectrum of issues which at once define the contour and dig into the interstices of the Indian democracy. Lakshman incorporates articles of historic value, like those by B. R. Ambedkar, C. Rajagopalachari and Jawaharlal Nehru. Their animated polemics on the question of linguistic states and anti-fascist agenda foreshadow some of the raging debates of Indian politics in subsequent years.																					Issues such as the state-sponsored genocide in Gujarat, the poor public distribution system triggering famine in India or the painting of nudes are discussed in this volume. The stylistic variations in the essays are stimulating. The felicity of style of most of the articles belies the common notion that newspaper articles are by nature perishable. Jean Drizes level-headed analysis of Indian poverty coexists peacefully with M.J. Akbars recapitulation of the chilling spectacle of a riot. Dom Moraess A Question of Keys can well be read as a short-story. 																					However, too many spelling errors and syntactic blunders somewhat lessen the prestige of this anthology. Such an innovative venture surely called for a superior editorial standard						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

				 																Life after marriage				 																																																				Sir  Japanese women who have chosen to remain single need to reconsider their decision (Learn to be nice to your wife or pay price, Nov 27). If a new law allows women filing for divorce in Japan to lay claim to half of their husbands pension, why should women stay unmarried? Netting a corporate warrior could not get more lucrative as the wife, besides the guaranteed luxury, now has the assurance of getting a lump sum on dumping her man. For such women, life would begin at sixty, when their husbands retire.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

				 																Failed god				 																																																				Sir  In Reflections on a rally (Nov 25), Rudrangshu Mukherjee rightly criticizes the leftist intelligentsia of Bengal for upholding a creed that has lost its relevance. The Wests disillusionment with socialism came after witnessing the terrible form it took under Josef Stalin and Mao Zedong. A similar change may visit the intelligentsia in Bengal. It has watched with horror the atrocities committed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Keshpur and Nandigram. It may soon feel too ashamed to associate with the Left in any form. 				 																																																				Quite evidently, the much-desired goal of the Slovak politician and leader of Czechoslovakia, Alexander Dubcek, to create a socialism with a human face still remains a dream. It is time intellectuals in Asia woke up to this reality instead of burying their heads in the sand like the proverbial ostrich. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It would do well for CPI(M) stalwarts like Biman Bose, Benoy Konar or Shyamal Chakraborty to read Rudrangshu Mukherjees excellent article. They might be inspired to do something to salvage the tarnished image of their party. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Way back in 1949, there appeared a book called The God that Failed. It contained six essays by writers like Ignazio Silone, Arthur Koestler, Louis Fischer, Stephen Spender and others. All of them wrote about their disillusionment with communism. In those meridian days of the Soviet Union, these writers were accused of writing under the directions of the CIA, and dismissed as such. Irrespective of whether the allegations were true or not, the fact remains that these people had once been ardent leftists. If The God that Failed was not enough, there appeared yet another devastating critique of communism in the late Fifties. The New Class: An Analysis of the Communist System by Milovan Djilas, criticizing communism in East Europe, delivered one more blow to the red bastion. Bengals intellectuals, however, learnt no lesson from these books and went on casting their vote in favour of the CPI(M). One hopes they will change their ways now. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anindita Satyabrata, Santiniketan

				 																																																				Sir  Communists believe that the party is the only instrument through which the oppressed masses can be liberated. Only the party knows what is good for the people. This is a dangerous formulation. For one, it denies agency to the people. Two, it assumes that the party is the sole repository of truth. Some of the ill-effects of this belief are visible in West Bengal, where the communist leaders assume that if they believe that industrialization is good for the people, it must be so. They had expected that when the party called upon landowning farmers to surrender their lands, they would do so without a murmur. 				 																																																				Intellectuals now have to choose between two alternatives. They can either acknowledge the flaws of the Marxist doctrine or dismiss what is happening in Bengal as an aberration. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Buddhadeb Ghosh, Calcutta

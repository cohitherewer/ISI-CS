 DIARY
				 																																																																														 Who was the one who worked the hardest while Madam had her day out at the UN general assembly? Pranabda, of course. During his two-week stay in New York and Washington, the external affairs minister was not only balancing the precarious home situation on the phone from the US, but also handling 50 bilateral meets over and above the multilateral ones, as with the NAM group, that continued on the sidelines of the general assembly meet. What kept Mukherjee going? Apparently, the Bengali babus sparse meals of dal-bhaat, not very different from the home-cooked variety, provided him all the energy he needed. The food, sent up to his 52nd floor hotel room in New York, was consumed for lunch while fruits and milk made up Pranabs dinner. If imaginary flies on the wall are to be believed, his only divergence was the pineapple morabba kept in his room to indulge his sweet tooth. Looks like the diet worked wonders. Mukherjee appears to have managed to sweet-talk the Americans into holding on a little while longer for India to keep its promise of signing the nuclear deal. He also succeeded in eating into the Left resistance at home. Perhaps the prime minister too should try out Pranabs simple fare, now that it is certain that hilsa is not the only way to a Bengalis heart.				 																																																																														 Madams foreign sojourn over, major changes are expected in several state Congress committees as in Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. It is being suspected that Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who holds the dual charges of parliamentary affairs and the information and broadcasting, might be asked to return home to ready the state for the mid-term polls. Similarly, Suresh Pachauri, minister of state for personnel, may also be asked to go back to Bhopal. But none of the leaders are willing to forsake power at the capital. Sonia may have to keep ready a carrot, along with the stick, for them.				 																																																																														 The Congress is keeping a hawkish watch over matters in Gujarat, but perhaps a little more on Narendra Modis watch than most other things. Congressmen have noticed that Modi now sports a brand which would cost no less than Rs 2 lakh. Congresswallahs also have information that the Gujarat CM has had a bathroom make-over which was done at a cost no less than his watch. Overzealous partymen now want Modi to come up with a white paper on his watch and bathroom expenses. But one wonders if Modis disclosures would be worth the paper they are written on.				 																																																																														 Is it not true that more judges are shot in Italy than in Bihar? The Italian ambassador was apparently forced to consider the question on his recent visit to Patna. The envoys interaction with bureaucrats and politicians went off well till he asked the stock question, Why investors from Rome and Milan should invest in Bihar? Pat came the reply in English. The precise figures of men killed in Italy were blurted out even before the states industrial development commissioner had a chance. 				 																																																																														 Knives are out against Digvijay Singh in Madhya Pradesh after he chose to take a lift in the chartered flight that flew the BJP president, Rajnath Singh, from Jabalpur to the capital. It is not unusual for politicians to extend such curtsies even to their arch rivals, but Congressmen in MP see it as something more than usual. For one, many believe that Diggy should not have shared the flight with another thakur and his enemy number one. But then others say that Diggy Raja is in the habit of trying to strike deals with the opponent. His son-in-law recently contested the Uttar Pradesh polls on a Congress ticket but on a Diggy-Rajnath understanding. Unfortunately, he lost the elections. Could Diggy be trying to revive his prospects?				 																																																																														 Six months after its appointment, the new wage board for the print and the television media under Justice N Krupp is yet to start work. The reason: the urban welfare ministry has not been able to allot a suitable house for Justice Krupp that would allow him to leave Kerala and take up his new assignment. Meanwhile, senior scribes are against an order that would deny them the use of medical services under the Central government health scheme. Hitherto journos accredited to Parliament were allowed to use the consultation and laboratory facilities available to legislators. But now that the finance ministry has objected, the health ministry no longer allows them the privilege. Such spoilsports!				 																																																																														 Call it animal instinct. Both the Maharashtra CM, Vilasrao Deshmukh, and his revenue minister, Narayan Rane, are having sleepless nights after an owl entered their lives. Once the owl was spotted, a major debate started on whether it had sat closer to Deshmukhs room or Ranes. When there was consensus on the fact that Deshmukhs room was a few inches closer to the spot where the owl sat in the Mantralayas sixth floor, it triggered off another row. Since the owls appearance comes at a time Ranes men are trying hard to dislodge Deshmukh, some senior cabinet ministers and MLAs were heard saying that it meant a bad omen for Deshmukh. But the CMs camp soon hit back. For its turn, it quoted an Arabian superstition which believed owls to be lucky. They have another argument. Owls could not be unlucky since they are associated with goddess Lakshmi. Now that weve got all the major arguments down, you can take your pick.

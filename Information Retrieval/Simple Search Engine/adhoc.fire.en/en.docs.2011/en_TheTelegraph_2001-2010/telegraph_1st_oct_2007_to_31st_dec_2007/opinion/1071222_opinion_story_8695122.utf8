							 																						MANY STORIES ON STAGE

																														Dhaka Theatres Nimajjan, written by Selim Al-Din and directed by Nasiruddin Yousuff, went literally all over the place. It depicts ethnic cleansing down the centuries in a sprawling, indulgent and nave exercise. We all know how violent we are, which no amount of art will alter. So to wail over gory historical scenes from across the world is pure overkill (pun intended). The only justification is that it may console the main constituency of Bangladeshi theatre  rural audiences  to realize that they are not the only people to have suffered pogroms. Yousuff explained that the original is seven hours long. Let alone inspire, the curtailed editions two hours made me want to expire. How can Dhaka Theatre commit such violence on viewers?
																														The Story of the Wild Duck, by Pocket Teatret from Norway, seems pointless in a different way. Why would anyone want to tell the story of an Ibsen tragedy in short, like Charles Lamb did of Shakespeare? It can only work if the actor is brilliant. But Ingunn Oyen is unable to carry off all seven main characters in the manner of more seasoned soloists. At best, she sounds like a narrator for children, simplifying and condensing it into an hour. Perhaps she was not fully comfortable in English, and Stig Bratens direction did not help. Oyen regards Wild Duck as Ibsens finest, but her version is certainly not a good tribute.
																														Compression of masterpieces like this does away with the subtle verbal textures crafted by great authors within an ambient space. A similar situation arises in the University of Punes Death of a Salesman in Marathi, sacrificing many dialogic nuances that give Millers tragedy such depth. Besides, by dropping the requiem, director Padmanabh Bind loses its essential finality. In his defence, we should mention that it is a student project, hence it had constraints. Also, I have the utmost respect for the few Indian institutions of higher education that have introduced theatre as a subject in recent times  their trained graduates will ultimately take Indian theatre ahead, and this forms part of the process. Still, the youth of the actors playing Willy and Linda shows; in contrast, their sons look and behave more realistically.
																														One must applaud Azad Dramatic Culture Clubs Hathe-Handool, not because it is Nandikars first-ever Kashmiri guest, but because it represents theatres rebirth in Srinagar after a ten-year shutdown during the peak of militancy. Azad belongs to the handful of groups that have picked up the threads again. Like some of his peers, Rashie Rashid resurrected the Kashmiri folk slapstick of Bandi Pethir (which had become endangered, too) and applied it first in a trailblazing adaptation of Waiting for Godot two years ago, and, now, in a fitting satire, Dario Fos Accidental Death of an Anarchist, where the police deny that they killed a prisoner, and claim that he committed suicide. The political comment is what deserves attention; the truncated text and somewhat amateur theatrics are secondary when one thinks of the conditions in which Kashmiri troupes function.
																														Third Bell from Bhopal proves the benefits of retaining a strong text in its entirety by following Arakta Kshan, the Hindi translation of Mahesh Elkunchwars Raktapushp (1981), faithfully. Elkunchwar has a fine ear for the kind of conversation one hears in families, which director Anoop Joshi appreciates and keeps intact. He creates some riveting scenes of discord in a marriage where the partners hate each other, the absence of love rubbing off on their daughter and paying guest. Minal Naphde acts the girl most naturally, but her parents could express their mutual revulsion better and project their voices farther. Nevertheless, it was the most powerful production at the festival so far.

				 																Party power					Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee has made some bold, lucid and timely statements in Where party rules (Nov 12). However, it is most likely that criticism of the Left will fall on deaf ears. Would any amount of condemnation change the way politicians like Biman Bose, Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechury or Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee operate? The Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Bengal has won a massive majority for more than three decades now. Such uninterrupted hold on power has corrupted its leaders, so much so that they even have the audacity to chastize the governor for protesting against the complete collapse of law and order in Nandigram. What do they expect him to do? Sit and watch the ruling party cadre go on a killing spree? 					Mukherjee has no reason to despair over the partys rule in rural areas. In fact, he should be amazed by the integrity of the CPI(M) cadre. They have relieved the police of their duty and risked their own lives to purge Nandigram of anti-party elements. A commendable performance really!					Yours faithfully,																															
Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur

					Sir  A fundamental question about our political identity has been raised in Where the party rules. In a state where the government is synonymous with the party, those who do not support the CPI(M) are likely to be branded enemies of the State. Do they then run the risk of State-action against them because of their lack of allegiance to the ruling party? 					It is unfortunate that the government of West Bengal should proudly assert the supremacy of the party over the State. The rhetoric of us and them is only going to facilitate a divisive politics. In other words, people like us can only watch helplessly while they carry on their misrule. Some of the so-called intellectuals have reinforced this helplessness by towing the government line at public rallies. Nandigram has turned West Bengal into a Gujarat and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee into a likely contender for Narendra Modis stature.					Yours faithfully,																															
Sharmila Ray, Calcutta

					Sir  The hell called West Bengal is beyond redemption; so is the destiny of the present dispensation. While equating Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin and V.I. Lenin, what Rudrangshu Mukherjee leaves unsaid is that the chief minister has been dreaming too big. A State with such an incompetent administration and a police force as tarnished as Bengals, cannot hope to achieve anything close to what Bhattacharjee has been aspiring for. However, what bothers is that in the coming years, Bhattacharjee may force us to witness many more liberations like Nandigrams in order to chase his dream.					Yours faithfully,																															
Surajit Das, Calcutta

					Sir  The capture of Nandigram by the ruling party cadre has no precedents in this country. Even in Narendra Modis Gujarat, or even Lalu Prasads Bihar, infamous regimes in their own ways, such a totalitarian display of power was avoided. The present unrest in Nandigram seems to be worse than that in March. Then the government had pretended that it was doing its bit to remove the troublemakers from the area. This time, the gratuitous silence of the chief minister is unpardonable. Many of us had believed him to be a man of conscience. Unfortunately, we have been proved wrong. 					Yours faithfully,					 Mangalmurti Pandey,Calcutta				 																																																				Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee deserves credit for speaking against the misdeeds of the CPI(M) so directly. Not just Nandigram, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would be remembered for being the architect of several shameful episodes during his term as chief minister  the Chota Angaria massacre, starvation deaths in Amlashol and in the north Bengal tea estates, irreversible ecological degradation, including giving away of multi-crop land for industrial use, filling up of water bodies in and around Calcutta for promotion of real estate, shielding corrupt police officers and so on. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Parting shot					Sir  The editorial, Home on a loan (Nov 12), touches on a fear most Indian homeowners are bound to experience at some point. For many, repayment of home loan often gets priority over other expenses. Barring instances of home loans sanctioned by frauds, in collusion with corrupt bank officials, the rate of default in this segment is less than that in many other categories of loan. Since banks find it difficult to chase big companies which fail to repay their loans, they pick on the vulnerable middle class individual, often with some help from musclemen. 					However, the banks cannot be faulted entirely. Recovery litigations may run for ages and debt recovery tribunals are mostly ineffective. The way out is to empower bank managers with powers of recovery, to make EMIs open to revision on a case-by-case basis, and to keep political influence out of the sanctioning and repayment of loans. 					Yours faithfully,																															
G.C. Biswas, Barasat

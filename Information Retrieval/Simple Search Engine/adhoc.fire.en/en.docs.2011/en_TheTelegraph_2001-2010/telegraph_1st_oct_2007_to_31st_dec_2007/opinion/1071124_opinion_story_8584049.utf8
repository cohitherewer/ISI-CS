							 																						RED WITH SHAME																														Shame is not a sensation that can be borne for very long. Yet that is exactly what the people of West Bengal are being forced to experience, as the state becomes the butt of derision of the entire country. Each of its points of special pride has been systematically dismantled in the last year, especially during the last three months. Now the last shred of democracy, secularism and culture has been torn away with the writer, Taslima Nasreen, being furtively flown off to Rajasthan, a state governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party. It just needed one day of violence on the streets, conducted apparently by unnamed groups offended with Ms Nasreens remarks about Islam in her book, Dwikhandito, for the government to decide that her stay was causing too much trouble. The alacrity with which the government caved in to the fundamentalist demand, it might be pointed out, has been astonishingly absent in the entire sequence of the violence in Nandigram. 																														Giving in to fundamentalists is not just cowardice, it is cowardice of a most miserable kind. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front had shown its pusillanimity first when it banned Ms Nasreens book. But to presume to decide where she can or cannot stay after the Central government has given her a visa takes pusillanimity to new depths. Like all most shamefully cowardly acts, the surrender to fundamentalism was disguised as aggression  a mouses roar. Biman Bose, the state secretary of the CPI(M) and chairman of the Left Front, said, as if in a fit of pique, that if Ms Nasreens presence causes so much trouble, she should go. He has since pretended to modify this statement, but that modification continues to elude. Mr Bose is, of course, allergic to apologies, propriety, dignity, and the faintest memory of democratic procedure. Yet, even his apparently casual statements represent what the party thinks. It was a matter of a few hours after his expressed desire to see the last of Ms Nasreen that she was on a plane to Jaipur.																														The CPI(M)s anxiety to retain the minority vote after the Sachar committee report, Nandigram and a hundred other things has reduced it to pitiful straits of cowardice. Reportedly, the state government did not contact the Rajasthan government officially; Ms Nasreens departure was organized with the help of a gentleman of Rajasthani origin known to the party through the Bidyasagar Mela under Mr Boses patronage. The state government cannot even face up to its own decision of surrender to fundamentalist groups, it does not dare to show itself as the only agent in driving Ms Nasreen out, it cannot bear to be seen as officially asking a favour of a BJP government. Not one official, either from the police or the bureaucracy, has admitted to a thing. There is not much lower to sink. It was a matter of pride for India to have been able to give shelter to a writer seeking asylum. And, in the whole of the country, it is West Bengal alone which treats a guest like a ping-pong ball.

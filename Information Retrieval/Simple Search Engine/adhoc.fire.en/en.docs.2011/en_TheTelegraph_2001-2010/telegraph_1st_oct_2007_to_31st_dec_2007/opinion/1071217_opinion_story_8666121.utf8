							 																						OVER BORDERS
																														A country with an international currency can always sell its own currency in the international market and push down its value. It would not normally do so because it might cause a run on the currency: speculators, seeing what the countrys central bank was doing, would start selling the currency, and it may depreciate far below the level favoured by the central bank. But a central bank does not always have the means of raising the international value of its currency. To do so, it would have to sell foreign currency, and international financial flows are so huge nowadays that central banks cannot afford to keep enough foreign exchange to carry out exchange rate support operations. So, many central banks have given up currency support; some have sold off their gold and foreign exchange reserves.
																														With the abandonment of currency support, central banks have been left with their classic function, which is to prevent and counteract domestic panics. They do this as far as they can by preventing risky practices and transactions; and when they cannot do so completely, they stand ready to release credit into the market to relieve any shortage of liquidity that may arise with the failure of financial institutions. Such a release may cure a domestic liquidity crisis. But if the crisis leads foreign investors to withdraw money, it may cause a run on the currency. So domestic troubles may spill over into currency depreciation. This is worrying not just for the central bank dealing with domestic troubles. Futures and swap markets in international currencies are large; an unanticipated run on a currency may send currency traders into bankruptcy. Their troubles may spread to the much larger number of commodity traders and lending institutions that use currency traders to hedge against risks arising from changes in exchange rates. Thus a domestic crisis of one major country can spread to other countries.
																														The sub-prime crisis  arising from failure of risky mortgage loans given to people without collateral assets  did not spread from the United States of America where it originated; but banks have had to increase their precautionary reserves in the US, and the consequent reduction of liquidity has affected other countries where they operate, particularly in Europe. The realization that crises can spread across countries is primarily responsible for the agreement the Federal Reserve has made with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to swap currencies when necessary. Although not so spelt out, this agreement implies an understanding that the three banks may enter currency markets at times and prevent runs. Thirty-six years after the US government ceased to buy and sell gold at a fixed price and heralded an era of floating exchange rates, it and other Western powers are realizing the value of exchange rate stability.

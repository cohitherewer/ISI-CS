							 																						SEATS MATTER																														A lot changes in twenty months. For the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka, the arrangement made all those months ago with its coalition partner, the Bharatiya Janata Party, does not seem to matter any more. The Janata Dal (S), with H.D. Kumaraswamy as chief minister, had promised to change places with the BJP in October 2007. And B.S. Yediyurappa, the deputy chief minister, was expecting to become the chief minister for the agreed term. A coalition created for power alone, with no ideological or programmatic similarity, is always uneasy. Mutual trust is at rather a premium in such cases. Besides, the Janata Dal (S) had already broken up a partnership with the Congress to forge this new one with the BJP. So each partner knew exactly what it was taking on. 																														The Janata Dal (S) was finding excuses not to budge from its dominant position for quite some time. There was the strange affair of the BJP tourism minister accusing the chief minister of having tried to kill him. This was one of the reasons cited by the Janata Dal (S) for not wanting to hand over power to the BJP. The prime mover, of course, is the chief ministers father, H.D. Deve Gowda, whose unwillingness to see his son resign his chair to Mr Yediyurappa was clear enough. With his party sweeping past the Congress and the BJP in the urban local body elections with almost 30 per cent of the total seats, his stance has hardened. It looks as if the BJPs mark of umbrage, mass resignation, might misfire. As blackmail, it certainly has not worked  the BJP legislators had handed in their letters to Mr Yediyurappa the day before submission to give the Janata Dal(S) a last chance. Evidently, the prospect of mid-term elections, instead of giving Messrs Deve Gowda the heebie-jeebies, is providing occasion for pleasurable anticipation. Since governance is not on either partys mind, perhaps the people can entertain themselves by watching the drama unfold.

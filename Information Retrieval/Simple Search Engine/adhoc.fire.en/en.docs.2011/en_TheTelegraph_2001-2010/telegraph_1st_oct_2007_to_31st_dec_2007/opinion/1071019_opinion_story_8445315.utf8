				 																Same old story				 																																																				Sir  It is a common belief that people who pray at Khwaja Moinnudin Chishtis dargah in Ajmer have their wishes fulfilled. By an ironic twist of fate, many pilgrims, possibly praying for peace and harmony, were wiped out by a brutal terrorist strike last week (Hit on secular symbol, Oct 12). The targeting of such holy places has proved that terror has no religion. More shocking, however, was the medias claim that the blast was not very powerful, as if this fact could underplay the trauma it has left in the minds of the people. Could such a statement possibly imply that the loss of just two lives is not big enough to make news? One also wonders why intelligence agencies in Rajasthan failed to react to the warning sent out from the Centre about the possibility of a terrorist attack. Those who were entrusted with the running of the dargah must also be blamed for their neglect of the CCTV cameras, which had stopped working days before the attack. Such negligence raises the suspicion that an insider is involvement in the incident. These lapses must be explained and the culprits punished as soon as possible.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Why is it that terror attacks take place more commonly in Islamic places of worship? The easiest guess is that the fanatics would like to divide the country along communal lines. Sadly, in India, it is the ordinary people who wish to live in peace and harmony, but the political discourse ensures that a communal divide is willy-nilly kept alive. As for diplomatic and bureaucratic interventions in such matters, the less said the better. Immediately after the Ajmer blast, the Central home minister came out of his slumber, donned his Sunday best, paid a breezy visit to the site and asked all governments and officials to be alert, take preventive measures, and send reports to him. With that, he returned to Delhi and settled down in his slumber once again. We can be sure not to hear from him till the next blast takes place. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  It seems that the home ministry and certain unnamed intelligence officials have become masters in churning out sensational conspiracy theories  blaming Bangladeshis, the Inter-Services Intelligences rogue agents and, now, some mysterious Bilal for the Ajmer attack. Thus the investigation process begins with contradictory and confusing guesses. Such a slap-dash approach should be familiar to Indians by now. But this will not do. It requires more organized political action than a prime minister wringing his hands and the Opposition hounding him for a few days. It is not enough to pretend that since the most recent victims of terrorism are Muslims, a Hindu political backlash will not build and life will go on. Terrorism cannot  should not  be seen only with respect to electoral compulsions. The battle against evil cannot be circumscribed by vote-banks. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  There is a suspicion that Pervez Musharraf could not visit the Moinuddin Chishti dargah in Ajmer in 2002 because his intentions were not pure. According to intelligence reports, the Karachi-based Huji terrorist, Bilal, supported by Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Toiba, may have been involved in the bombing at the dargah. India should put pressure on Musharraf to punish such fundamentalist outfits. If he is a devotee of this shrine as he has claimed, he should do this fast.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Mistaken spirit				 																																																				Sir  I read with interest both the edit, False magic (Oct 8), and the oped article, Where spirits may kill or heal (Oct 11), on folk-healers and their ethno-medical and magical practices. Both claim that the folk healers or ojhas generally misguide people, fiddling with a communitys health, beliefs and practices, which sometimes result in death. I have done my PhD fieldwork in 22 interior tribal villages for the past seven years, and have interacted with 44 shamans in West Bengal and in Jharkhand. I have found that the ojhas among ancient tribal populations like Santhal, Munda, Ho, Lodha, Sabar have done good work as magicians, medicine men and snake-charmers. Although there have been instances of people being misguided by shamans, it is also a fact that as medicine men, shamans have been providing herbal medical support for almost all diseases to villagers for a long time. This tradition is oral and the knowledge is transferred from one generation to the next. I have interacted with such medicine men who remember thousands of plants and their medical usage without having to look up any text. While public awareness has been raised about magical practices in tribal societies, we need to take a wider perspective on the superstitions prevalent in so-called advanced societies. It would be simplistic to overlook the beneficial aspects of shamanism in backward societies and the fact that it has its value simply as an authentic folk knowledge system.

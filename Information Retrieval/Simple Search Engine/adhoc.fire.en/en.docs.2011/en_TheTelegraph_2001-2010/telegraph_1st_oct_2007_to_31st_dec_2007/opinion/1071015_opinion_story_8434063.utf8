							 																						PLAY THE GAME																														Indian cricket is being stalked by the most peculiar of controversies. There is an ongoing debate between age and performance, regarding which of the two should be given preference when the Indian team is being selected. Senior players, such as Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, have declared that only performance should be the criterion for selection. On the face of it, this should be self-evident. But the statement of the senior players is somewhat self-justificatory, and thus suspect. It has been argued in certain quarters that senior players are no longer performing as well as they used to, and, therefore, they should make way for younger players who represent the future of Indian cricket. In riposte to this, Messrs Tendulkar and Ganguly have argued that they are still making runs and that is all that matters for selection. There can be no doubt that the older players are still making runs, albeit not with the regularity that they used to. Performance in cricket, however, cannot be seen only in terms of run-making. Anyone who has seen Mr Tendulkar bat at the top of his form will agree that he is no longer the same batsman: the fluency is gone, often he is found to be struggling, rarely is he on the top of the bowling all the time. In Mr Gangulys case, the flaws in his technique have become more prominent as age has crept up on him. But there are other aspects to consider. With age, both Mr Tendulkar and Mr Ganguly have become slower on their feet. This means that their fielding and their running between the wickets have begun to suffer. (For Mr Ganguly, these have become more noticeable because he was always weak in these departments.) In this sense, there has been an overall decline in their performance, even though this is not always reflected on the score board.																														There is an even more important aspect to consider. Selectors and coaches cannot be obsessed with the here and now. They also have to look to the future and plan for it. This means that they have to seed and nurture talent. They cannot do this unless older players make way for younger ones. This is not to discount experience altogether. But there is the need to rest the older players to give younger ones a chance. In this, older players also have a responsibility. They should retire at a time people ask why they are retiring. There is the apprehension that some of the older players continue to play well past their prime because of non-cricketing reasons  sponsorship and endorsement contracts. That is not cricket.

																														A photography exhibition comprising 35 monochrome prints, 61 colour prints and the same number of colour slides is expected to be diverse. The point of interest in such a show is whether the works on display are consistent in terms of quality. The 14th Members Photographic Exhibition organized by Chhayapath at the Academy of Fine Arts (Nov 26-Dec 3) failed to impress on this count. 
																														The role of the camera is that of a chronicler in this collection. It recounts tales in the course of exploring life, both still and moving. The variance in technique, theme and medium notwithstanding, only a handful of images manage to stir the imagination. In Touch of Morning Light, Tapan Kr. Das effortlessly captures the beauty of straight lines by using the image of two children walking down a gravelled path that lies parallel to a block of white concrete. A shift in scene and theme follows in B.G. Chowdhurys Emperors Children, featuring smiling faces of destitute children against the backdrop of a crumbling palace. Layered and complex, the image represents the triumph of human resilience over hardship. Bahubali by Barun Kr. Dutta (picture) depicts the beauty as well as blindness of faith. 
																														There were plenty of rotten apples in the basket though. For instance, the erotic sparks that Anup Paul attempts to capture in Submission cannot possibly light any fire.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

							 																						OUT OF TUNE																														To have an opinion is no sin. A citizen in a democratic republic, such as India, is not only welcome to have an opinion but also to air it, and everyone around him is free to agree with it or disagree, debate or contest it as they may please. The domains of the private and the public, as far as the expression of opinions is concerned, need not be separated, unless the citizen wishes to do so. But the situation is reversed for certain office-bearers of the State. Their formal roles are defined by the Constitution within a careful design of the distribution of powers and responsibilities that holds in balance a dynamic and many-armed polity. The vice-president of India is given a significant symbolic role in this design, next to the president of India. The executive power of the Union is vested in the president. The vice-president is the ex-officio chairman of the council of states and also hasto discharge the duties of the president if an unexpected vacancy occurs in that office till a new president is elected.																														When the vice-president of India, Hamid Ansari, inaugurates an international conference, he does so in his formal capacity. At the inauguration of the conference, Emerging Security Concerns in West Asia, Mr Ansari spoke of the need to have the will to formulate a correct policy for the region. In his speech, he brought up the role of the United States of America in the continuing instability of West Asia, and mentioned that the USs policies of unilateralism, creative destruction and pre-emption have faltered and have given an impetus to terrorism. He did not stop at this, but these were the most striking bits of his argument. Mr Ansari, like anyone else, is welcome to his opinion and to his observations and logic. But he is the vice-president, and when present in this role at a formal occasion, he is necessarily different from everyone else. His opinion can only be aired under private circumstances, not in public. Besides, these comments contradict in spirit the current position that the Indian government has taken towards the US, and that at a moment when the fate of the 123 Agreement has not been decided. As deputy to the formal head of the executive, Mr Ansari can represent the governments views when called upon to do so; he cannot represent contrary views or attitudes which can be construed as a comment on the policies of his own government. 																														It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that the president and his deputy should have no opinions of their own which they can articulate in public. Their public pronouncements can only be those that are in tune with the governments policies and should, in fact, carry the approval of the government. Mr Ansari, by expressing a view contrary to government policy, has caused great embarrassment.

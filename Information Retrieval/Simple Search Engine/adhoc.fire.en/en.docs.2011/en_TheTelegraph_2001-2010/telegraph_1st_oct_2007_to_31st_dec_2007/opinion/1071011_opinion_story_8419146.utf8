							 																						PRICE OF DRUGS																														Sports refuses to part ways with scandal. If it is match-fixing and betting in cricket one day, it is performance-enhancing drugs among athletes on another. The latest scandal to rock the world of sports is the confession by the former track star, Marion Jones, who admitted that she had used performance-enhancing drugs. She followed up her confession by returning the five medals she had won at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. She agreed to forfeit all other medals, trophies and results going back to September 1, 2000. She thus joins a list of highly successful athletes who have come to be dubbed by the neologism, doping cheat. Before her, there was the Canadian sprinter, Ben Johnson, who was stripped of his 1988 Olympic title, and Justin Gatlin, another gold medallist (2004 Olympics). Both had tested positive for testosterone and other steroids. Ms Joness guilt in the realm of sports is further compounded by the false statements she made to federal agents about her use of performance-enhancing drugs. A quondam heroine is now discovered to have had feet of clay. Her entire achievement stands destroyed because she played unfairly. The sincerity of her apology cannot take away from the enormity of her guilt. There is one aspect of the episode to which attention needs to be drawn. Ms Joness public statement makes it clear that she was misled by her former coach, Trevor Graham, who had told her that the substance she was taking was flaxseed oil. Without absolving Ms Jones of her guilt and her navete, it stands to reason that Mr Graham should also be made culpable.																														There can be no doubt that celebrity sportsmen like Ms Jones deserve the strongest possible punishment. People like her are role models for the young. Her behaviour should have been exemplary. Instead, she stands exposed before the world as a cheat and as a person who refused to play within the rules. One of the fundamental features of any sport is that men and women compete to win, but they do so under similar conditions. This is especially true when sports has become professionalized and more competitive. By competing under the influence of performance-enhancing drugs, Ms Jones violated this basic feature. She thus fell from a pedestal. By losing all her titles and medals, Ms Jones has paid a price, but that is not enough. The punishment meted out to her should be exemplary so that it acts as a deterrent.

				 																Money for marriage
				 																																																				Sir  I had paid Rs 500 for a three-month silver membership of a matrimonial website on the internet. It began on June 1, 2007. I sent a message to one of the many members of the site expressing an interest in her. She sent a reply too, asking for my contact details in turn, on June 13. However, the website administrators informed me about the reply well after my membership had expired. In other words, unless I cough up more money, I cannot send my contact details to the person. If this isnt cheating, what is?
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
Mukul Dube, Delhi

				 																Hungry to bed
				 																																																				Sir  Breaking an egg into two to feed two children cannot possibly be a way of tailoring diet according to local needs (Blame on states for hungry kids, Dec 26 ). The percentage of underweight children in India is on a par with sub-Saharan Africas. This is a perfect example of the failure of the governments three-decade-old integrated child development programme. There are two main reasons for this failure: one, the level of awareness among the target population is very low. Two, when a Central scheme is executed through the state government, there will inevitably be some lapses in its implementation. Health is not a Union subject under the Constitution; therefore, instead of just blaming the states, it is more important to productively use the experiences gathered over the decades to strengthen the ICDS. The Unicef has termed Indias progress in the field of child-welfare as insufficient, but that need not be taken too seriously. It was perhaps trying merely to underplay its failures in sub-Saharan countries and Bangladesh.

				 																																																				Sir  The state of childrens nutrition in the country is most alarming. On the one hand, India boasts of a vibrant economy, influx of massive foreign direct investments, skyrocketing of real estate prices; and on the other hand, 43 per cent of its children under the age of five years are underweight. This is an indication of lopsided economic development in the country. Surely the country cannot expect the services of these malnourished children when they grow up, if they do at all. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

				 																Wishes few
				 																																																				Sir  One feels sad to learn about the low turnout of political bigwigs to greet the former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, on his 83rd birthday (Vajpayee has his day, too, Dec 26). It is understandable that his party leaders were busy worshipping the rising son, Narendra Modi, after his victory in the Gujarat assembly elections. But the leaders from the other national parties seem to have lost their old graciousness. Or has the old man outlived his usefulness?
				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 
																															
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

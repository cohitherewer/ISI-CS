							 																						FRESH LIFE																														It has been a long battle. The point of the battle would seem simple enough  that the adoption law in India should be equally applicable to all communities. The government has tried to formulate such a law, most notably in 1972 and then in 1980, but failed because specific communities blocked its progress. While the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 does allow adoption by the strength of which the adopted child is given the place and rights of biological offspring. Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jews have their own laws or religious directives that forbid any relationship beyond that of guardian and ward between an adopted child and his foster parents. Both sides lose out  the parents lose their guardianship once the child becomes 18 and the child has no inheritance rights. Recent amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act has included a provision that can give an adopted child the status of a legitimate child of the adoptive parents, with all the rights, privileges and responsibilities such a status entails.																														That a part of the battle has been won, an intangible but once impregnable barrier breached, is indicated by the fact that a district judge in Delhi granted the rights of adoptive parents to a couple from the minority community under this law last month. But the difficulties that still remain should not be underestimated. As it is, adoption is not high in the list of priorities of activists, although India has thousands of orphaned or deserted children. Besides, one law among many other contradictory ones gives people a choice, but only when they know about it. When the personal laws or religious instructions of a community forbid adoption, reaching for a law that allows it can be difficult socially, at the moment of decision and after. Everyone thinks hard before adopting, if only because it is a life-changing decision. In India, each humane, generous tendency, it would seem, is made psychologically turbulent. The control exercised by organized religion on the one hand, and the cowardice of politicians playing vote bank politics on the other, combine to produce an effect of heartlessness. There are children who need love, and adults who need to love, but the path to their convergence is made as thorny as possible. The recent amendment and the judgment under it give some hope, but the bigger battle is far from won.

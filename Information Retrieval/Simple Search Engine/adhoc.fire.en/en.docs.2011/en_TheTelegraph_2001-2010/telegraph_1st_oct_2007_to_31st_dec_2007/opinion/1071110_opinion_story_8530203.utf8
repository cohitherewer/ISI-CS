							 																						WEEP AWAY THE LIFE OF CARE This above all											 			 Khushwant Singh				 	 Poetry on the hills				 																					There is an expression that one often comes across in Urdu poetry, but in no other language that one knows. It is gareeban chaak karna. Its literal meaning is to tear up ones shirt. I had assumed that it meant, to expose ones inner self in all its ugliness or to bare ones soul for everyone to see. It could also mean introspection to examine ones own shortcomings. I came to this conclusion by Iqbals lines which ask, How is it possible that I tear open my shirt and not earn ill-repute  gareebaan chaak karoon aur ruswaee na ho? To clear doubts in my mind, I sought enlightenment from Deepak Tandon of Panchkula whose erudition and scholarship I respect. He assures me I am wrong. I quote his words  As regards your query about the exact implication of the phrase, gareebaan chaak karna or gareebaan taar taar karna, the lexicon meaning is to tear ones garment to shreds in a state of madness, rage, grief and so on. Such a state, to my mind, comes in extreme cases. One may let ones garment come off only in cases of extreme derangement, distraction, lunacy, frenzy, fury, rage or keenness of passions. Ipso facto, it does not mean exposing ones real self. On the contrary, it is a sign of abnormal behaviour or eccentricity.																					Apnee vahshat kee numaish mujhey

																					gareebaan hona																					Shelley, too wrote: I could lie down like a tired child,/And weep away the life of care/ Which I have borne and yet must bear,/ Till Death like sleep might steal one me. He believed that Mans yesterday may neer be like his morrow. Byron in Childe Harolds Pilgrimage says: Im not so weak;/ But thinking on an absent wife/ Will blanch a faithful cheek. Further, he says: There, in a moment, we may plunge our years/ In fatal penitence, and in the blight/ Of our own soul, turn all our blood to tears/ And colour things to come with hues of Night. Shakespeare in Henry IV, Part I says: A plague of sighing and grief! It blows a man up like a bladder. When things such as these tear ones heart, travail and heavy sorrow tend to kill the holy spirit of man, believes Swinburne. Sometimes, rage makes him blow like cataracts and hurricanes spout.																					Thanks Mr Tandon, youve left me more confused than I was.																					A long days journey into beauty																					Never again will I go to my summer home in Kasauli by road: the last journey was a torture. Besides the never-ending construction of over-bridges in Panipat, Karnal and Ambala, the main highway was in a sad state of disrepair. I used to pray that there would be no hold-ups going through the narrow bazaars of Pinjore and Kalka: my prayers were answered, as there were none. But there was a 20-mile traffic gridlock extending from Panchkula near Chandigarh to Pinjore. Thousands of cars, buses, trucks, tractors, motorcycles, scooters stood still for over an hour and a half with no one knowing the reason why. A journey which took me between 5-6 hours door-to-door from Sujan Singh Park, New Delhi to Raj Villa, Kasauli took more than eight hours. You can guess what that kind of ordeal can do to a 94-year old buddha. I swore this is the last time I would undertake this journey.																					That night I slept for almost nine hours: complete silence and clean air have soporific qualities. I was woken up by the sunlight streaming in through my window opening out to the east. Get up lazybones! It seemed to say. See how the mountains are lit up, autumn flowers in bloom and hear birds in full-throated song. I dragged myself to sit out in the garden and soak up the sun. The first thing my eyes fell on was the havoc caused by the monsoons. The approach road, I had re-tarmacked only two years ago, was a shamble of loose pebbles. A huge pine tree near the entrance of my villa had come down crushing the rickshaw shed, including the rickshaw under its massive trunk, and had blocked the approach. It had been cut to clear the way, and the wood stacked away. In the cantonment, trees, including those growing in private compounds, belong to the cantonment. At many places the corrugated tin roof had sprung leaks. It was a long litany of woes I have to hear this time of the year. Last May, there were swarms of white butterflies swirling round the garden. This time there was not one to be seen. Birds were there  crows, whistling thrushes, bulbuls, mynahs, blackbirds and woodpeckers. I could not hear their calls: I had become deafer than I was four months ago.																					Owning a second home in the hills is a status symbol, which bores a big hole in ones pocket. Nevertheless, homes, which were bought for paltry sums of under Rs 30,000 barely 20 years ago, are today selling for over two crores. Most of the year they remain unlived in. Nevertheless, people continue to buy old ones and build new ones. Recently a home, barely 50 yards along the same hillside as mine, was bought and renovated by the retired brigadier, Wazir Singh Chaudhury, who spends half the year in Panchkula playing golf, half the year in Kasauli playing bridge. He is, as the saying goes, happy as a lark. The family dropped in to introduce themselves. Their names are very easy to memorize: the wifes name is Gursharan Kaur, the daughters Sonia. He had no regrets buying a second home in Kasauli. After a hefty Patiala peg, he fished out a piece of paper from his trouser pocket. He had never written poetry in his life till he was hospitalized with a heart ailment and put in intensive care unit. Then the muse burst forth. He asked for a piece of paper and a pen. He scribbled an ode in Urdu in praise of Kasauli: Its soft, misty, mornings, its gentle breezes fragrant with pine-scented air, its hillsides bedecked with a variety of wild flowers and the singing of birds from dawn to dusk. I was moved. How could I ever forget what Kasauli has given me in the 80 years that I have been coming up to spend a few weeks of the summer and autumn in the little cantonment township? It is I who have become an old, crotchety grumbler. Thank you Kasauli!

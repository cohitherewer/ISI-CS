				 																Veiled truth
				 																																																				Sir  The life sentence, along with a fine of Rs 15,000, awarded to Praveen Mahajan as punishment for killing his brother is bound to raise a few eyebrows (Praveen dodges death by a motive, Dec 19). The sudden death of the Bharatiya Janata Party leader, Pramod Mahajan, at the hands of Praveen had been a mysterious affair from the very beginning. As the trial progressed, things got even murkier, with skeletons tumbling out of the closet. The case reached a definitive point when a sessions court judge ordered the trial to be conducted behind closed doors in October this year. This was because of the defamatory comments which Praveen had made against Pramod. 
				 																																																				The ruling needs to be seen in the light of this development. With due respect to the judiciary, I cannot help but speculate whether the court was wary of Praveen damaging the reputation of the deceased leader and his party with his shocking revelations. This may have prevented the court from sentencing Praveen to death. Praveen has now been punished for his deed, but certain questions will continue to be raised. For instance, why was Pramod the subject of salacious gossip? Is it not ironic that our political leaders always present a spotless public image, even when they are involved in dubious activities? Praveen Mahajan, of course, did not act rightly by murdering his brother but Pramods death proves the way in which money and fame often become the undoing of a family. In Pramods case, his closest kin became his nemesis.

				 																																																				Sir  Praveen Mahajan has been sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering his brother but a lot of intriguing questions about Pramod Mahajans death remain unsolved. The case should have been probed from other angles since no possible motive of murder has been discovered thus far. It is being speculated that Pramod had accumulated an enormous amount of wealth. Was he murdered by someone for his wealth, someone who used Praveen Mahajan as a shield? It should also be recalled that a few days after Pramods death, his secretary, Bibek Moitra, died, reportedly of a drug overdose. While reaching a verdict, were all these facts taken into account by the court?

				 																																																				Sir  Praveen Mahajan committed a heinous crime by killing his brother in cold blood. Nothing less than a death sentence can be punishment enough for such a man. In my opinion, life sentences only drain the public exchequer in a country where people die of starvation. Murderers, terrorists and traitors should only be given the death sentence.

				 																Harsh tongue
				 																																																				Sir  One finds it hard to swallow the unsavoury comments made by Ashok Mitra on Bengalis (Uses of a sub-hero, Dec 21). Mitra finds Bengalis to be a bundle of contradictions because their modernity is hopelessly mixed up with beliefs and prejudices eerily reflecting totems and taboos of a tribal culture. 
				 																																																				Far from being a drawback, I think that it is this characteristic that gives Bengalis their peculiar charm, and makes them different from other Indian communities. While coping with the modern world, they always try and remain true to their roots. Perhaps because Bengalis are torn by dualities like these, a large number of poets are to be found among them. The Bengalis passion for hero-worship stems not so much from his fascination for a totem as from his desire to live a life of dreams even when everything around him goes wrong.
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Some people have always revered foreign icons while sneering at their own. This holds true for dedicated communists such as Ashok Mitra as well. Hence it is hardly surprising that Mitra looks down upon Bengalis for having always preferred to be respectful of national leaders. This trait, according to Mitra, is akin to the veneration with which a tribal society holds a totem. Mitras article has definitely hurt the sentiments of every patriotic Bengali.

				 																Parting shot 
				 																																																				Sir  The article,Old journals too yellow for Asiatic Society (Dec 20) left me distressed. Bengals history is closely related to that of the Asiatic Society, which was set up in 1784 by the then British government in India. This institution has provided opportunities of research that have yielded important results, the proof of which is to be found in its journals that have been published over the years. A few years ago, when I was writing a book on Indian astrology, I found most of the material I needed in the issues of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, dating back to 1844. It is appalling to note that the authorities have decided to give away or sell off priceless journals because they are yellow and unusable. If the pages of the journals are crumbling, they should be microfilmed before it is too late. Selling or distributing the invaluable papers is a grievous offence. Those responsible for this insensitive act must be brought to book so that such acts of vandalism are not repeated. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

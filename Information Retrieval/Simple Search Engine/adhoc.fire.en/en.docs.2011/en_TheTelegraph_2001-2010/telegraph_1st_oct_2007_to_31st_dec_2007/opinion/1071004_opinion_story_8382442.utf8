				 																Bad neighbour				 																																																				Sir  It is disheartening to note that the ideas of independence and democracy have lost their meaning for Indians and their government (Uneasy calm back on Yangon streets, Sept 30). The greatest proof of our disregard for democratic ideals and our callousness is our indifferent, insensitive and selfish reaction to the crisis in Myanmar. Even the assault on a peaceful demonstration by monks could not evoke a strong response from the Indian government and the public. Indian politicians will carry on wasting time and the peoples money debating inanities but not stir to raise their voices against Myanmars gruesome reality. They ignore Myanmar because interfering in that country does not yield political mileage. The Union government will go on reposing its faith in the junta to help it tackle terrorism in the Northeast though history does not reveal any instance of such help. If the United States of America can criticize Pakistans autocratic rule, why is India being tight-lipped about democracy being murdered in Myanmar? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The Indian government has shot itself in the foot over Myanmar. Ridiculously, it continues to believe that it can do business with the junta, ignoring the latters many atrocities on the people of Myanmar. Indias views, though not put in black and white, seems to be that the military regime helps Indian interests in business and in battling terror. But the world is watching India betray its democratic credentials by remaining silent on the brutal actions of the junta. If India does not heed either its own conscience or the rising international displeasure with the junta, the global community will not forgive our country. Surely, the Union government is aware that the juntas long-term supporter, China, has beaten India in calling for democracy in Myanmar? Democracy will come to Myanmar one day or the other. The newly liberated Myanmarese people may not be willing to do business with India then.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The crackdown on the protest by monks in Myanmar is deplorable. Innocent civilians have been the common victims of almost all dictatorships. The unbridled power held by such regimes emboldens them to suppress popular uprisings. The United Nations needs to do something that will stop the crimes against humanity in Myanmar and other countries and prevent them from recurring. However, the remarks of Indias external affairs minister and the chief of the army staff on Myanmar are very disconcerting. Why this ambiguity in Indias stand on such an important matter? The credibility of the country has already hit a low. The international community should take the initiative in ending the oppression of people in Myanmar, Zimbabwe and other countries. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Army backs Burma (Oct 2), reflects Indias low ethical standards in formulating its foreign policy. The government thinks that a few thousand monks will hardly manage to overthrow the military regime. This attitude of our government raises the question as to whether our foreign policy should be designed to back the winning horse only. It is shameful that Indias government is not taking any interest in the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar though it was found poking its nose into the affairs of another neighbour, Nepal. Was Nepals monarch more oppressive than the military rulers of Myanmar? Or are the oil reserves of Myanmar too precious for India to care about the people of this country?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Of her 62 years of life, Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained Myanmarese leader, has spent almost 12 in detention, albeit in different spells. She made the supreme sacrifice of staying back in the country and await the restoration of democracy, instead of returning to England to be with her ailing husband, Michael Aris, who died of cancer in 1999. At the time of taking that painful decision, she knew that she would be detained immediately and indefinitely. Some of those who justify the Indian aloofness with regard to Myanmar allege that Suu Kyi has joined hands with Western capitalists to destabilize Myanmar and thereby prevent China from grabbing the natural resources of the country. However, in Myanmar, the resentment against the military is popular and deep-rooted. The people were seeking a pretext to explode against the juntas long misrule. The hike in fuel prices provided that opportunity. From the start of the agitation, it was clear that a mere reduction in fuel prices was not the actual goal of the agitators. 				 																																																				The most revered section of the Myanmarese population, the Buddhist monks, has now taken over the leadership of the protests and is openly speaking up in demand for democracy. As expected, the junta cracked down, but not with the same ferocity as in 1988. The world is not altogether indifferent this time round. The UN has sent a special envoy to Myanmar. The West has at least expressed solidarity with the agitating masses and demanded the restoration of democracy. Russia and China, which have considerable financial interests in Myanmar, have understandably vetoed a security-council resolution for the restoration of democracy in the country. India too has stakes in the giant Shwe Gas Project. But economic growth, at the exclusion of all else, cannot be the desire of a nation of Indias stature. It must show concern for human rights in its neighbouring countries. Fear of China should not keep the Indian leaders mum because, one way or the other, China will always pose a threat to India. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

							 																						UP THE SLOPES
																														The Bharatiya Janata Party seems to be recovering its management skills. The Congress may claim that Himachal Pradesh swings between the BJP and the Congress in election after election, but the scale of the BJP victory in the state this time  41 out of 68 seats  cannot be explained away in terms of normal expectations. What the BJP managed excellently was the inner-party factionalism between Prem Kumar Dhumal and Shanta Kumar, a division that had gone against its success in the last election to the assembly. It was an old feud, and had the dimensions of a caste division as well. But the party managed to please both sides before going to the polls, while the Congress failed to capitalize on it. 
																														Of course, this alone cannot make such a victory. The Virbhadra Singh government was being increasingly perceived as corrupt and dictatorial  the BJP cited, for example, the Congresss sedition case against some journalists as an example of fascism  and was being shown up as inefficient and indifferent in matters of governance. Rising prices in the state had become an election issue, as had unemployment. The BJPs promises of a clean government and of development obviously held out hopes for the people that the Congress had been unable to fulfil. And, after Gujarat, the BJPs campaign for development was likely to have gained more of an aura.
																														The end of 2007 has turned out to be a period for the BJP to crow and the Congress to retire into its usual introspection. Naturally, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, now holding 10 states against the Congresss 11  of which Punjab, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh were won this year  is predicting its return to the Centre in the next Lok Sabha elections. It is also reading in these victories a rejection of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliances policies and attitudes. The drama of the Gujarat victory, where Narendra Modi came to power again and where the elections could be perceived as personality-centred, followed by the victory in Himachal Pradesh, where the anti-incumbent tendency was seen as one of the driving factors, and where the election was not so personality-centred, appears to give some substance to the BJP claim. It has carefully left out Indias nuclear deal with the United States of America in its declared list of the UPAs failures and mistakes, but is most vocal on the Congresss appeasement of minorities and the UPAs failure to contain terrorism. Whatever the worrying hints that lie hidden in the subtext of the BJPs list, it is certainly true that the Congress has failed in major ways. Its management skills leave much to be desired, and it has not been able to evolve a decisive language to counter the many variations the BJP plays on an overt and covert Hindutva.

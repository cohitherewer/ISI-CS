							 																						ORDINARY TOUCHES Soumitra Das											 			 Visual Arts				 	 Jogen Chowdhury, Couple				 																														For the past eight years or so, Indian artists have been going places. Art galleries that have proliferated all over the city organize trips abroad in five or seven-star comfort for artists, some of whom  actually the creamy layer  enjoy the lavish lifestyles of rock stars.																														However, if one takes it for granted that the quality of their work, too, has improved in direct proportion to the money invested in them one would be gravely mistaken. The exhibition by Calcutta Painters, recently organized by Mon Art Gallerie, once again drove home the point that while one does not exactly expect artists to live in penury any longer in this city, money alone cannot improve their aesthetic output .																														This exhibition was supposed to travel to Singapore, thanks to another gallery in that island nation. But is this motley collection of paintings by 20 artists working in Calcutta really representative of art as practised in this city? Notwithstanding the presence of Jogen Chowdhury and Rabin Mondal, the answer is a resounding No.																														For one, these artists must be mass-producing such works throughout the year, and for years on end. So even the remotest hint of freshness is missing. To make matters worse, most of these works seem to have been hastily conceived and executed. So one cannot even expect technical finesse for which Bengal artists are justifiably famous.																														It is a shame that the business of art has become so commercialized that it is no longer a priority for gallerists to be art lovers themselves. They are there only for the moolah.																														Hence writing about individual works displayed in this exhibition would be like picking on the artists themselves for it is difficult to write anything positive about them. To begin with the two biggest names here  those of Jogen Chowdhury and Rabin Mondal  both their works lack the touch, which quickens the imagination of viewers. This is the distinguishing mark of artists of their class, and one looks for it in vain here. Chowdhurys lines lack their usual tautness and Mondal is content with applying a thin coat of pigment on his primitive visages.																														Producing a white canvas with lines in Cont depicting a Christ-like profile has become second nature with Wasim Kapoor. So he has done it perhaps as a reflex action here too.																														Two of the most senior artists here are Bally-based Prakash Karmakar and Bijan Choudhury. At one time, Karmakar used to create huge faces of women with a startled look. Now, he churns out nudes any which way, often passing off weak drawing as deliberate distortion of form. His neighbour, Bijan Choudhury, has created epic figures which look like hackneyed illustrations for a calendar.																														Isha Mahammads paintings can safely be described as puerile, lacking in any saving grace whatsoever. Dont these works go through a screening process before they are displayed?																														One must add that Anita Roy Chowdhurys two paintings are honest and sincere exercises, although she has not deviated from her busy brushwork, bold lines and dirty tones. If not anything else, Tapan Ghoshs drawings stand out for their delicate pencil work.																														Of the participants, Subrata Ghosh is the youngest and one wonders if he is already tired of painting. How else can one explain away those two male figures lying supine in the midst of a field? Weak in both design and draughtsmanship, both works have little to recommend them.																														Sculpture does not have a market in our country and so sculptors usually dont take things for granted. Surajit Dass composition in bronze is tiny but it has grit and sharp angles to compensate for its lack of girth. His Mithun, carved out of wood, too, catches the eye for its sensuous lines. Sculptor Bipin Goswami distorts form with ease and his work is often touched with humour. The fun element is not missing here. 																														Such a hastily put together exhibition does not do Bengal proud. The sooner gallerists realize this the better for Bengal art.

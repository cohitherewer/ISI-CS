				 																Proven guilty				 																																																				Sir  October 24 was truly a momentous day in the history of the Indian judiciary which saw the lower courts hand down life terms to 60 convicted criminals (Day of life terms, Oct 25). Among them were Amarmani Tripathi, a former minister, and his two accomplices in the murder of Madhumita Shukla, 10 members of a Delhi police crack team which shot dead two businessmen in a fake encounter, 15 people involved in the 1992 riots in Kanpur and 31 loyalists of the Muslim fundamentalist group, Al Umma, who tried to assassinate L.K. Advani in Coimbatore. Though delayed, these judgments will go a long way in restoring public faith in the judiciary. Perhaps now one may look forward to a fitting verdict for the main accused in the Babri Masjid demolition and the Mumbai riots, although both the Liberhan Commission and the Srikrishna Commission seem to have given a clean chit to those really guilty. It is a pity that the culprits are often those who lead the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  It is difficult to decide whether the awarding of the life sentence to 60 criminals  accused in cases ranging from terrorism and rioting to political murder, on a single day  is an event to rue or to celebrate. It is certainly good that justice has been delivered, and the sentences will serve as an example to criminals, reminding them that no one is above the law. However, it is unfortunate that none of those convicted was given the death sentence for the heinous nature of the crimes they committed. What this boils down to, then, is that these irredeemable criminals will be fed on taxpayers money for the rest of their lives. It gives me a nauseating feeling that my hard-earned money, coughed up as tax, will be used to pamper and feed criminals.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Traffic trauma				 																																																				Sir  The numerous articles published in The Telegraph on errant driving and traffic hazards are of no actual importance. What is important is the utter lack of decency or respect for others and the collapse of those moral values which hold society together. Is this what thirty years of Left Front rule have achieved? I see young boys and girls, without helmets, zigzagging through traffic in motorbikes with not a care for their own lives or for those of others. They hit wing mirrors of cars and turn around and abuse car owners or drivers. They have no respect for elders because they have inculcated the wrong values. They have been brought up believing that bribes provide the escape route if rules are broken, numbers can make or break governments and the police are stooges of the ruling party.				 																																																				The media are hesitant to take up the cudgels for society because ethics has no place in journalism. The revenue from government advertisement determines newspapers political leanings. So news of an autorickshaw driver slapping a woman (Slapped by auto-driver, Sept 21) or grievous injury caused to someone protesting against eve-teasing on a bus (Lady, please step out and speak up, July 18) are not pursued beyond the first report. We should be prepared to fight back and deal with this complex social malaise at its roots, rather than put the blame on stray incidents of traffic disruption and public anger.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Autorickshaws are a nuisance on the city roads. They follow no rules and their drivers misbehave with passengers. This arrogance stems from the shield provided by the CPI(M), which does nothing to these drivers for the fear of losing their votes. What is often not noticed is the fact that autorickshaws are severely polluting. They run on an adulterated fuel called solvent. As an experienced mechanical engineer working in the oil and gas industry, I can say that this solvent is nothing but throwaway oil. This oil can in no way be used as fuel because it is a bad pollutant. Which is why on days there is an auto and taxi strike, the citys pollutant indicator drops sharply. Our silence will only encourage such malpractices.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumantra Chattopadhyay, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is really a shame that in spite of accidents caused almost daily by reckless drivers of buses, trucks and autorickshaws, no stern action has been taken against them either by the Motor Vehicles Department or by the Traffic Police. Neither has any law been passed nor the existing laws strictly enforced to bring order to Calcuttas chaotic traffic. The authorities are not only content with passing the buck, but are also now pleading helplessness.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
P.K. Bagchi, Howrah

				 																																																				Sir  Vehicular pollution in Calcutta is increasing at an alarming rate, and given the shrinking road space in the city, accidents are bound to go up. Footpaths are vanishing as well. This alone is a major cause for accidents because a collision becomes inevitable when pedestrians start using the space meant for motorists. Where footpaths remain, they are taken over by parked cars or by hawkers selling their ware. The pedestrians, too, are sometimes at fault. They believe their hands, which are used to stop traffic, are as effective as the traffic signals. What is needed in order to prevent road accidents is a more disciplined use of the roads. That discipline, however, is woefully lacking in Calcutta at the moment.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

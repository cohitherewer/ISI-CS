							 																						DRAMA IN THE SOUNDS OF MUSIC  Mohua Mitra											 			 MusicPrabahinis presentation of Rabindranather Nataker Gaan at Rabindra Sadan on September 21 was a creditable effort to represent the poets creative range. Tagore was interested in constructing intense dramatic moments and sequences through the use of orchestral accompaniment and songs. This came from his exposure to European operatic music at a fairly young age. The resulting osmosis that took place in those years found expression in some of Tagores most beautiful and opulent music. 																														In the Prabahini presentation, dramatic vignettes were created from some of Tagores most famous plays and operas  Raktakarabi, Bisarjan, Arupratan, Mayar Khela, Balmiki Pratibha, Shyama, and Chirakumar Sabha among them. Spontaneity and fervour were retained, with the characters breaking into on-stage song and dance  like interludes framed within dialogue. Sequences that stood apart in their building of dramatic harmony and the creating of romanticism interspersed with comedy were from Raktakarabi (Debashis Roychowdhury and Ushashi Ganguly), Bisarjan, Balmiki Pratibha (choral music accompanied by dance movements), Chirakumar Sabha (Anup Mitra, Shankar Ganguly) and in some solo renditions such as Aami rupey tomaye (Roma Basu), Chokher joler laglo jowar (Debashis Roychowdhury) Aami chanchal hey (Santanu Dasgupta) and Ami marer sagar pari debo (Shankar Ganguly), in particular. 																														The programme drew its main support from well-orchestrated performances, tasteful stage dcor and fluent narration by Sarashi Chakrabarty and Ashis Ghosh.

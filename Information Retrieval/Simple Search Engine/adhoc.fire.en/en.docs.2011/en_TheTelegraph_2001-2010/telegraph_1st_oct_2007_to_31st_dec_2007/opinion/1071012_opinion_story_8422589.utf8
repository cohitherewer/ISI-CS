							 																															WHEN LESS IS MORE				 Bookwise 				 	 Hitting the mark				 																														Long tail is a marketing concept which means selling less of more in any given market. While it is debatable whether the concept applies to all fast moving consumer goods or not, it certainly is relevant to the book world where more and more new titles are sold but in smaller and smaller quantities. What are the reasons behind long tail asserting itself in the book world? 																														Take the retail first because without bookshops publishers could barely survive. Libraries cannot fill in the gap because most are poorly budgeted and hold up payments for long periods which affects the cash flow of publishers. There are three reasons for the cuts. 																														First, the lack of shelf space; there is simply not enough space to accommodate most of the new books as well the steady sellers. Second, the fear of poor cash flows, because more than 60 to 80 percent of all retail sales are on credit; over-the-counter cash sales are just 20 percent. What this means is that, in most cases, payments to the retailers are held up for 60 days or more. Third, there is the problem of unsold stock that is not returnable to the publisher. Given the small margin the bookseller is left with at the end of the day, it is best to play it safe. The rule of the thumb is that you dont lose money on books you didnt buy. 																														Publishers determine their printruns on the basis of market response, that is, on how many copies the main distributors/booksellers would order, given the synopsis of the forthcoming book, the standing of the author, jacket design, price and discount, the expected date of publication or any other information that the buyer might want before taking a decision. No bookseller would place an order without seeing the final product but he can have a fair idea of how the book would be received eventually if all the variables were in place.																														But this is just one half of the story. What has changed the bookmarket are the advances in printing technology and the internet, which has squeezed the communication-gap between the writer and audience, that is, between the printed book and the potential buyer. On the one hand, you can now print-on-demand, even if that demand is limited to just one hundred copies. Of course the unit cost of production would then be higher than a printing of say 500 copies, but the need for economies of scale has been reduced. Given the new technologies, why should a publisher risk a higher printrun than one that can be sold out within a few months? 																														On the other hand, with the internet you can now access a great deal of information online and in case you cannot get the full text because it is copyrighted, you can do so against a small fee payable by credit cards. 																														The message is clear. Markets have always shrunk or grown but with technological advancement they can be targeted at lower costs. 						RAVI VYAS

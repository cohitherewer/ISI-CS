				 																Be a gentleman on the field				 																																																				Sir  These days it is difficult to claim cricket as the gentlemans game. The appalling lack of decency among cricketers is evident from the way the Indian pacer, S. Sreesanth, and some Australian cricketers fell out among themselves recently. The Board of Control for Cricket in India should take strict action against Sreesanth for this indiscretion. As a member of the national team he is expected to behave carefully on the field. After all, he is also a cultural ambassador for his country. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 
				 																Bad and worse				 																																																				Sir  H.D. Deve Gowda was always an astute politician, prepared to go to any extent to grab or retain power (Partner pulls loophole stunt on partner, Oct 3). But he should have remembered that he is a former prime minister, and refrained from playing so dirty a game as he did, along with his son, in Karnataka recently. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which is projecting itself as the victim of the great betrayal by Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular), is no babe in the woods either. It is clear that the BJP and the JD(S), like most of the political parties of the country, care only for power. It is this shameless craving for power and its trappings that has given birth to the bizarre understanding between two or more parties to rule a state for a few years each to complete the term. Should we give our votes to such people and parties who care nothing for ideals? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Irrespective of its problems with the JD(S), the BJP would have got the reins of the government in Karnataka come October, for the simple reason that it has an agreement to that effect. This would have given the BJP an opportunity to head a southern state. But the party queered its own pitch  first by overreacting to M. Karunanidhis comments on the Ramar Sethu and attacking his daughters house in Bangalore before nearly sparking off a riot; and second, by letting one of its ministers accuse the JD(S) chief minister of attempting to murder him. These speak of the partys complete lack of maturity and cast serious doubts on whether it can run the state even if it gets power. The BJPs actions show that there is no leadership in the state, nor a central leadership which can give a proper feedback or intervene in time. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa

				 																																																				Sir  The phenomenon of rotating chief ministership has a fairly long history in Indian politics. It was tested in Uttar Pradesh, though not very successfully. It might not be coincidental that the BJP was part of the power-sharing deal in UP, as it is in Karnataka. For a party known to follow a hard line, such a penchant for accommodating opposing ideologies would hint at a very different story.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Aravind Rajesh N, Chennai

				 																																																				Sir  The JD(S)s refusal to hand over the reins to the BJP is nothing short of a betrayal. A case of smooth transfer of power can be found in Kashmir, between the Peoples Democratic Party and the Congress. The BJP has been particularly unfortunate when it comes to power-sharing, having been let down by the Bahujan Samaj Party in UP a few years ago. Whatever rationale is offered now by Deve Gowda and his son will sound like a lame excuse. That the BJPs hankering for power is equally bad is evident from the fact that it did not withdraw support rightaway when it was clear that the JD(S) was not willing to transfer power to it. Neither the BJP nor the JD(S) can claim moral superiority on this issue.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

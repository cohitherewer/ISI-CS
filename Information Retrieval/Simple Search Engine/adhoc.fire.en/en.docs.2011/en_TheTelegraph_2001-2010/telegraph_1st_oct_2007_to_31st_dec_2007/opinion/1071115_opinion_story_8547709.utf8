							 																						HOLE IN THE POCKET CHINA DIARY - Neha Sahay																					Its amazing, but true. Many office-goers in Beijing are waiting for today to stop shivering. Sometimes, when the strong winds blow, I can actually feel the cold seeping in through the walls, complained one journalist, working in an old, Eighties building. Winter has set in earlier than it usually does, but not till November 15 will central heating be turned on in all government offices (except, of course, those housing the top communist leadership). The practice dates back to the days of a centralized, planned economy, when a socialist government prized frugality. No one knows how this custom has survived the free market thats taken over China.																					Conscious about their energy guzzling image (the World Energy Outlook said last week that China would overtake the United States of America in energy consumption by 2010, a prediction that China has instantly rejected), authorities are making attempts to show that they care about global warming. Beijing is experimenting with buildings that boast of the latest German insulation technology, which keeps the inside warm. The construction industry accounted for 27.5 per cent of the total energy consumption.																					In its latest five-year plan, China decided to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by four per cent every year, but has met just one-fourth of this target. However, what planning has not been able to achieve, inflation might. Inflation this year may touch 4.5 per cent, the highest since 1987. Rising prices are the first thing people talk about now; the prime minister himself focused on them during a visit to a poor neighbourhood in Beijing two days ago. Shaking hands with a delighted grandmother, Wen Jiabao said he knew how a rise in price of even one yuan could affect peoples lives.																					Out of reach																					The rise has been much more than that. The staple lunch in South China  rice, pork and vegetables  is no longer available for six yuan at the local eatery, since cooking oil and pork prices have shot up this year. Three persons died and seven were badly hurt in a stampede at the French supermarket, Carrefour, in Chongqing, an industrialized city, trying to buy cooking oil at a 20 per cent discount. Customers, mostly elderly people, had started queueing up from 4 am, four hours before the opening time.																					Last month, in a similar incident in Shanghai, 15 persons were injured; there too, cooking oil was being sold 20 yuan cheaper. Government statistics admit that cooking oil costs 34 per cent more than it did this time last year. Pork prices are just too high: up by 59 per cent. Some Chinese have switched to fish, reluctantly, but thats no substitute for pork for the poor. The government has already ordered university canteens to subsidize pork dishes. But villagers get no subsidies, and migrant workers in the cities, mentioned, for the first time, that parents back home were complaining about going without meat for days. Will it be like the bad old days? wondered a grandfather who grew up under Mao, and, today, lives with his children in a new city. Meat was eaten only on festivals. Clothes too: a couple of years back, you could get a nice T-shirt for 10 yuan; today, only childrens clothes come at that price. With the official media itself full of warnings that toxic dyes may be used in childrens clothes, no one wants to buy them.																					Finally, with winter setting in even in the balmy South, gas prices are yet another reason for worry. A cylinder of gas used to cost about 70 yuan in 2004; today, it costs 105 yuan. In small cities, heating equipment such as geysers are powered by gas. We need three cylinders a month already, what will we do in December and January? wailed an employee of a foreign company, earning about 2500 yuan a month, almost thrice the average urban wage. Unmarried, and with a secure job, he is one of the privileged middle class.

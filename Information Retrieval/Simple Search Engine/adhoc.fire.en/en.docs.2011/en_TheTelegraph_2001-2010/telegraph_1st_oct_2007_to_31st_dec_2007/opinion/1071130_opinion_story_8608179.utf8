							 																						NOTE OF CAUTION																														Not all freedoms  and their limits  are written down as laws. In an unwritten social contract, a government and the people expect each other to do certain things. Each also expects the other not to do some other things. It is pretty much the same for the relationship between a host and a guest in a civilized society. What the external affairs minister, Pranab Mukherjee, has said in Parliament on the controversy surrounding Taslima Nasreen is therefore unexceptionable. His assurance that the Bangladeshi author can stay in India reflects Indias commitment to democracy and pluralism. But his words of advice to Ms Nasreen are perhaps even more significant in the context of the controversy. It would be wrong to see them as an infringement on the writers freedom of expression. Last weeks violence in Calcutta is evidence that Mr Mukherjees advice is neither unwarranted nor untimely. While India gives Ms Nasreen shelter and protection, the least the government can expect of her is that she would not do anything that would cause social or political conflicts. There are many examples in the world of how writers and others living in exile have taken care not to embarrass their hosts. In India, the finest example has been set by the Dalai Lama. New Delhi risked an unfriendly relationship with China by offering shelter to the Buddhist leader. But while he has his freedom in exile, he has not allowed it to create problems for either the government or the people of India. 																														All this is not to gloss over the sectarian politics that has bedevilled Ms Nasreens current stay in India. The way Bengals ruling Marxists submitted to the blackmail by some religious groups is indefensible. It shows how hollow the leftists commitment to secularism is. The Bengal governments anxiety to keep her away from the state may have an administrative justification. But if sectarian violence and irrational demands are allowed to force a governments hand, it would be a very ominous sign. Mr Mukherjees statement is a sober response to a complex and potentially dangerous issue. It matches Indias democratic credentials with the responsibilities of a sensitive government. Ms Nasreen cannot afford to misread the essence of Mr Mukherjees words of caution. Not just writers, all people love their freedoms. It is also important to know how to use them with restraint.

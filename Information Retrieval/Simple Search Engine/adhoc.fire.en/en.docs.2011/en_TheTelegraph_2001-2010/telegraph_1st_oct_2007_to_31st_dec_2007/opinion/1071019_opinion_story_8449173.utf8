							 																						PIOUS TRAVELLER 																														Eleven people were crushed underfoot in a stampede amongst pilgrims going up Pavagarh in Gujarat. This is only the latest of such incidents. Public authorities exercise control of crowd movements during Kumbh Mela, but such measures are unknown elsewhere. So these tragedies are waiting to happen, and their scale could increase. It is little realized how many Indians go on pilgrimage. In 2006, 46,160,000 Indians went on tours. Andhra Pradesh attracted almost a quarter of the total. What makes Andhra Pradesh so popular is Tirupati. Vijay Mallya visits it often, N. Chandrababu Naidu was nearly killed by a bomb while driving up to it, Amitabh Bachchan has been seen up the hill. And over 10 million humbler Indians made the climb in 2006. Next was Tamil Nadu, which attracted almost 6 million tourists. They avoided the best beaches, which are on the west coast; most headed for the temple cities of Madurai, Tanjore and Rameshwaram. Rajasthan did get two million tourists, but not for the stately palaces and rugged forts. Rajasthan has Abu, on top of which are the temples of Vastupal and Tejpal that every Jain in Gujarat aims to visit at least once. 																														Just how Indian this pattern is can be seen from a comparison with foreigners patterns. They could not help visiting the major airport cities, since they landed there. So it is no surprise that of the 4.5 million foreigners, 17 per cent visited Delhi and 15 per cent Maharashtra. But over two-thirds entered India somewhere else; and other airports or ports could not account for the rest. Obviously, most crossed over from Bangladesh and Nepal; they were just neighbours dropping by to go to an astrologer or shop for saris. Some must have been medical tourists from Bangladesh, so foreigners have not entirely forgotten West Bengal. The great opportunity the state has missed, however, is in domestic tourism. It is sitting on the banks of the holy Ganges, but hides the fact by calling it the Hooghly. No one thinks of coming to Calcutta to wash off his sins. The government must take steps to correct this, and build temple complexes all along the river. It would generate far more employment than a car plant; and the temple priests trade union, whenever it comes up, would dwarf the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s other adherents in pelf and prestige.

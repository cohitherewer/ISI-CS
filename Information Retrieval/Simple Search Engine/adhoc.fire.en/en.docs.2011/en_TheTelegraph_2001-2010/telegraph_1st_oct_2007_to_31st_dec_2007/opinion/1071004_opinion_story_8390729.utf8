							 																						LOVING WISELY AND WELL Instead of involving the State, the new senior citizens bill makes relatives solely responsible for their elders, writes Somak Ghoshal				 	 Kindness of strangers																														A couple of weeks after the parliamentary standing committee introduced the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens bill, 2007, in early September, an HIV+ woman threw herself before a train in despair. Being a widow, Radha (named changed), was shunned by her in-laws ever since her condition had been diagnosed. But worse still, her 19-year-old son, Chandraprasad, had promised her better medical care, and then disappeared abruptly. With a monthly income of Rs 3,000, the best he could hope for was not advanced treatment, but just a quick end to his mothers sufferings. 																														Noble intentions are often killed by too much reality. Circumstances may dictate a sons attachment to his mother, compelling him not just to love her well but also wisely. But the mandates of the parents and the senior citizens bill dissolve the subtleties of the human condition into a homogeneous moral standard. The elders have been given the unimpeachable right to demand emotional and material care of their children, irrespective of the latters economic and emotional disposition. The definition of children has been curiously stretched beyond sons and daughters to include grandchildren and other legal heirs. It doesnt matter whether these children are willing or not, the parameters of legal justice demand absolute and unconditional filial care. In trying to empower one group of citizens, this bill effectively denies another set of people  the carers  the right to dissent, or even present plausible excuses for being unable to look after their elders.																														Under the provisions of this bill, therefore, there could be no two ways of understanding the desertion of a dying mother. A maintenance tribunal could have Chandraprasad fined, and even imprisoned, for perceived neglect  provided his mother could bring herself to register a complaint against her own son.																														In India, where miserably poor parents routinely sell (or kill) newborns, the obligation to care for aged, infirm, or mortally ill relations, without considerable support from the State, sounds like a perverse legal ploy. Even for those past the poverty line, the legal implications of the bill are not exactly heartening. 																														True to the Indian tradition of social appreciation, only parents have been richly rewarded for fulfilling the duties of heterosexual marriage  the perpetuation of the family line through procreation. Couples with children  biological or adopted  are entitled to maintenance from their adult offspring at any stage of their lives. Unlike the vast number of childless couples as well as single men and women, they dont have to wait till their 60th birthday to earn the privileges of a senior citizen. Even if wronged parents are made legally empowered, it would still be difficult to find too many of them forthcoming enough to take their children to law. The shame of a scandal can keep many from admitting even the most horrific abuses.																														For those who earn their seniority at 60, it has been proposed that their relatives look after them. This injunction, too, operates on the basis of another botched-up moral and material economy. A relative is defined as an heir apparent to his elders property, or someone already in possession of it. The terms of this provision give a sinister and self-interested agency to the very notion of care itself. Moreover, this structure of exchange makes it essential for a senior citizen to disclose his will before his death (and perhaps endanger his life by doing so) in order to ensure sustained care for himself. Further, it is possible that the carer might be deceived in the end. Wills are, after all, changeable documents, ones that can make and unmake the fortunes of many. The question also remains as to what happens to those who do not have the power to tempt their relations with the promise of a lucrative inheritance. Or perhaps the value of their property is not good enough to be alluring at all? 																														Finally, in the remarkably little that it does to co-opt the State into the scheme of geriatric care, the bill casually urges the state governments to establish old-age homes in every district with a minimum capacity of 150 senior citizens per home. The states may establish these places, but are not required to do so. The minimum number of inhabitants in the homes, it seems, has been fixed arbitrarily, irrespective of the economic condition of, and the medical infrastructure available in, a particular district.																														In order to ensure a secure and dignified life for the elderly, it is essential to free the idea of care from an area of legal justice into the more humane region of social justice. Collective enterprise (initiated by NGOs, local welfare bodies or even neighbours) can often be more effective than whatever concern is shown out of legal obligation. Radha, who had attempted suicide, survived, but lost an arm. Left to die all alone in a subdivisional hospital by her son, she was saved by the care of her neighbours, Munna Yadav and Santosh Jha. The two of them stood by her firmly, persuading Radhas mother-in-law to let her stay with the family. They donated blood when her arm was amputated, then looked after her and kept that flicker of hope alive. Sometimes the kindness of strangers is more powerful than what the law can force out of ones own kin.

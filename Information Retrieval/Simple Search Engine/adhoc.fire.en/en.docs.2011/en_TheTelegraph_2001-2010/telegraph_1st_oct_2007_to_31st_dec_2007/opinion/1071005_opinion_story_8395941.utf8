							 																						GET A DOSE OF HIGH CULTURE Malvika Singh																					Cricket has become tukka baazi. This is evident when Indians take on champion teams such as Australia. Indian cricketers have many lessons to learn in this respect  hone their skills, play professionally and not like amateurs, keep their priorities right and remain quiet till such time that they are able to turn themselves into consistent, competent players. Our abject failure in international sports is embarrassing to say the least. No other country is as pathetic as we are and the discipline and infrastructure required to be on top of the pile are virtually non-existent in our country. Our leaders and bureaucrats are weak multi-taskers as well. 																					The authorities are desperate to host international games, only to make a quick buck through mechanisms such as land acquisition and infrastructure that needs to be built for the purpose. They have virtually no interest in supporting sportspersons or in adding value to this great, energetic human activity. Our policies are skewed, methodologies archaic, and opportunities few and far between. It is time to wake up and attract aspiring young people in India to take sports to a new level in a clean and systematic manner using tried and tested tools.																					On the other hand, art forms such as music and dance have begun to get a fresh lease of life. There was a time in the not-so-distant past when dance and music happened in one or two auditoriums in Delhi for a privileged few. But today, this city witnesses many a fine event in splendid locations that are open to the general public. To cite one example, Sanjeev Bhargava runs an organization called Seher that organizes such events, many of them with an underlying theme, for the Delhi government. Vast audiences gather at Nehru Park, the Central Park in Connaught Place, Talkatora Gardens, and every so often at the Purana Qila, to savour an extraordinary heritage that remains vibrant and continues to add new dimensions to its ever-expanding vocabulary. Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of Delhi, has been an enlightened patron and has endorsed this trend of sharing the best in our traditions.																					Bring out the best																					Delhi is the cultural capital of India but every state capital needs to be one too and do likewise. There should be an ongoing festival for the people  ordinary citizens who are the essential spine of this land. Pride needs to be rekindled in them for the country so that they become confident souls in a world that is constantly churning. When the complicated strains of music and the deft use of fingers take over the space under the directions of a creative and disciplined mind , Indians across the board are overwhelmed by emotion. The same goes for the amazing control of vocal chords and the ability to manipulate them to conquer finely nuanced notes during the rendering of ragas that we, as a people, are privileged to have in our repertory. Living cultures such as these must be made a priority in this great civilization.																					In contrast, political fiddling and bureaucratic interference speak volumes about the cloning culture that we are being suffocated with. It is not modern but retrograde. Culture is the soul of the people, embodied in their person, adjusting and growing out of their personas. Therefore it needs space to express itself through performers and participants. That is the jugalbandi which needs to be the mainstay of community life and living, the cement that binds diversity, modernity and tradition. Tardy, bureaucratized events represent the worst in our culture. The average administrator carries the baggage of the State, alienating the people at large by enforcing diktats from the top. People protect their pride by internalizing what they hold dear. We need to bring out the best that lies within.

				 																Red hot performance					Sir  It seems that Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, is pleased with his countrys phenomenal economic growth (Still not open enough, Oct 17). Chinas economy may be stronger than Indias but can that really be called tremendous progress? Chinas economic growth pales in comparison to the performances of Asian countries such as South Korea ,Taiwan and Thailand. The communists have not been able to fare well against their competitors but they have certainly done well in marketing their success story.

					Chosen one					Sir  The former American vice-president, Al Gore, shared this years Nobel Peace Prize with R.K. Pachauri, who heads the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (Team Pachauri wins Peace Nobel with Al Gore, Oct 13). Al Gores nomination for this prestigious award proves that Alfred Nobels original idea of honouring outstanding individuals for their accomplishments stands discredited. Gore won an Oscar for his documentary on global warming. Perhaps this weighed on the committee members when they went about selecting the winners for this years prize. Gore also belongs to a country that is one of the biggest polluters in the world. Did that tilt the scales in Gores favour? 					In the past, some of the other recipients of the peace prize have been controversial figures as well. The peace prize had lost its credibility long ago but Gore winning the prize makes this years selection the worst ever. Whether Gore succeeds in changing Americas policy towards environmental protection remains to be seen. Instead of honouring men like Gore, the Nobel committee would have been better off awarding the peace prize to real heroes who are working to develop scientific models to cleanse the environment.What can we expect from the Nobel committee next? Surely another prize for someone as undeserving as Al Gore. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Global warming and climate change have emerged as the biggest threats to life on earth. Hence, the role played by individuals like Al Gore and R.K. Pachauri in raising environmental awareness is of critical importance. Both Gore and Pachauri have succeeded in directing the worlds attention to the issue of climate change. Already, a report published by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change provided incontrovertible proof that our climate is changing. It also warned of dire consequences if counter- measures are not adopted at the earliest. Similarly, Gore has lent his stature and intellect to the cause, forcing people and governments around the world to sit up and take notice. Hopefully, Gores untiring efforts will bear fruit and the problem will be addressed soon. Otherwise, humankind is headed the dinosaurs way. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  The decision to present the peace prize to Al Gore and the UNs top environmental panel is disappointing. This is because both Gore and the IPCC are guilty of presenting alarming views about the environment based on scant evidence. 					It is difficult to comprehend Gores contribution to peace. Here is a man who blames humans for an imminent apocalypse and then offers as a solution anti-life legislations that include birth control and abortion. In reality, environmental disasters are the result of a society that has moved away from God. It is unfortunate that human beings see themselves as masters rather than keepers of Earth.

				 																Fundamental questions
				 																																																				Sir  The culture of a city does not depend on its heritage buildings and monuments but its residents. The bhadralok class, which was responsible for once making Calcutta the cultural capital of the country, has all but disappeared from the city. What we have in its place are rowdy, boorish immigrants from the neighbouring cowbelt. It is but natural that the city will now dance to violent tunes in the absence of tempering elements. Strangely, the government of West Bengal, which steadfastly refused to listen to the cries of the distressed in Nandigram, sat up at once when members of a minority community went berserk. As Ramachandra Guha puts it in his article, Selectively virtuous (Dec 8), the Left Front government immediately capitulated to the extremists demands and Taslima Nasreen was packed off to Rajasthan. Gaining strength from the ready surrender of the government and the silence of the Opposition, the extremists might soon transform Calcutta into the uncultured capital of India.
				 																																																				Everyone had begun to grow optimistic about a New Left emerging in West Bengal after Left-leaning intellectuals led a rally in protest against the governments action in Nandigram. But the same people are curiously silent on the deportation of Taslima. Perhaps they fear being branded as unsecular. What can be more hypocritical than this?
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Ramachandra Guha says of Rajasthan that the state had never produced a writer or scientist of note and [here] women were particularly badly treated. The comment seems a bit prejudiced. Was not Mirabai a Rajasthani? And for a historian, Guha seems more hopeful about the communists than he would have been if he were aware of the way they have conducted themselves down the ages. Communists have always had a selective sense of propriety. They decry Hitler as a dictator, but the comrades in the Indian poliburo conduct their proceedings under portraits of Stalin, who was no less an autocrat than Hitler.

				 																																																				Sir  Ramachandra Guha has criticized the government of West Bengal for expelling Taslima Nasreen from the state. Guha feels that Bengal has allowed its history and heritage to be brutally vandalized by a bunch of fundamentalists and bigots. The authors sympathy for Taslima is understandable. But surely he does not think that ones right to freedom of expression includes the liberty to hurt others? Taslima has insulted Prophet Mohammad and the Quran in her writings and thus offended all Muslims. Those concerned about the exiled writer should show equal concern for Muslim sentiments too. Does it make sense to ignore the feelings of a whole community in order to appease a single writer? 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
Serajuddin Khurram, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The Taslima Nasreen case has tested, and will test, the integrity of the Left intelligentsia even more than Nandigram, or so thinks Ramachandra Guha. He can rest assured that the Left shall feel no prick of conscience over the Taslima issue, just as it did not after the worst atrocities were committed in Nandigram. Ignoring every criticism has been the hallmark of the Left. And it hates introspection. As a result, the Left-affiliated All India Democratic Womens Association can express righteous indignation over the stripping of an adivasi woman in Assam while shedding no tears for those tortured in Nandigram. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Communists rarely repent. They only change tack to suit the emerging situation. Hence, one should not presume that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his comrades are sorry for what they did to Taslima Nasreen. Taslima has illustrious predecessors like Boris Pasternak and Alexander Solzhenitsyn who faced the unreason of Soviet communists. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
Debaki Nandan Mandal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Taslima Nasreen case, however unfortunate, has helped prove that we treat foreigners and citizens alike, when it comes to the violation of values and sentiments we hold dear. The painter, M.F. Husain, has been banished from the country for hurting the feelings of Hindus. If Husain, whose artistic merits far outweigh Taslimas, could be sent on exile, why should Taslima be protected forever? 
				 																																																				Contrary to what Ramachandra Guha believes, sending Taslima to Rajasthan has brought no shame to West Bengal. After all, she has only been transported to another state, and not forced to flee India. As a foreigner living in exile in India, Taslima should not have done anything to injure the feelings of the people of the host nation. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

				 																																																				Sir  Not being a Bengali, it seems that Ramachandra Guhas ideas about the Left intelligentsia in Bengal is rather rosy. The intellectuals in West Bengal always play safe and will never burn their fingers by touching issues that involve the minorities. These same intellectuals would however flock to the streets in hundreds, flaunting placards, chanting slogans and disrupting normal life, if they chance upon any instance of Hindu fundamentalism. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

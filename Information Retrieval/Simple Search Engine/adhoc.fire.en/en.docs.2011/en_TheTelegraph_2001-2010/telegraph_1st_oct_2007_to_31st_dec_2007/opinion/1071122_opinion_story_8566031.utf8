				 																Heavy burden				 																																																				Sir  Congress supporters should appreciate the justness of Sonia Gandhis concluding remark at the meeting of the All India Congress Committee in New Delhi (Sonia speaks her mind, Nov 18). Congressmen have always looked at Sonia and Rahul Gandhi as a cure for all the ills besetting the party . However, during the meeting, Sonia Gandhi sensibly reminded partymen that neither she nor Rahul Gandhi possesses a magic wand and that only a collective effort would rid the party of its ills. 				 																																																				Sonia Gandhis remark is all the more significant given the present political scenario. If the Congress is to break free of its meddlesome allies and run an independent government, it has to convince the electorate of the partys worth in the first place. For that to happen, flaunting the illustrious name of Gandhi is not enough. The Congress should address issues such as terrorism, price rise and farmers deaths and adopt stringent measures to solve these problems. Issuing verbal assurances can no longer satisfy Indias aggrieved electorate. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

				 																																																				Sir  The way the Congress is banking on Rahul Gandhi to regain its lost ground does not bode well for the future of the party. There is too great a burden on the young man and he might not be able to bear it for long. This is not because Rahul Gandhi is incompetent but because his methods of functioning are different from what the Congress workers are familiar with. Rahul Gandhis short speech at the annual session of the AICC did not show him up as a bad speaker but as one reluctant to play the role the Congress or its supporters expected him to play (Cheers before speech, not after, Nov 18). 				 																																																				Rajiv Gandhis speech at the Congress centenary 22 years ago, when he, like his son now, was new to politics, might be considered a milestone. But why should Rahul Gandhi take a lesson from it? He is not his fathers shadow and the sooner the Congress realizes this truth the better it will be for the party. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ravindra Kumar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, enthusiastically declared at the AICC session that he expects Rahul Gandhi to take the Congress and the nation to new heights of glory. It is one thing to appoint Sonia Gandhis son as the party general secretary and quite another thing to expect that he would turn into a leader overnight. Rahul Gandhi might be young and educated but these qualities and his famous lineage cannot be reason enough for leadership to be thrust upon him. He has to go through the hurly burly of politics before he can emerge as a peoples leader. Instead of idolizing the young man, the Congress should ensure that he is pushed into tight corners to see whether he can perform or not. Otherwise, Rahul Gandhi will continue to disappoint, as he did at the Talkatora stadium.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
K. Venkataraman, Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir  Appointing Rahul Gandhi as the general secretary of the Congress was a decision made in haste. Rahul Gandhi may have glorious dreams, like those of an India connected within itself and to the rest of the world but dreaming big is not enough. Rahul Gandhis initiative to take the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to all parts of the country has not been as successful as it is made out to be by the Congress. The party should realize that simply presenting a few fresh faces at its helm can work no wonders for its future. Rahul Gandhi or Jyotiraditya Scindia might have age on their side but they lose out on experience. If the Congress wants to become Indias chief political party once again, it should try and settle its internal feuds. Sonia Gandhi hinted as much when she said that she and her son would not be able to turn things around for the party by themselves.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																New shade of red				 																																																				Sir  The virulent attack by leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on the governor of West Bengal, the high court, Calcuttas intellectuals, and the media was not wholly unexpected, given the nature of communists all over the world (Shut up or ship out, Nov 18). Communism is not favourably disposed towards any kind of criticism, regardless of whether the criticism is justified or not. Present-day communist countries such as Cuba, China, North Korea or even the erstwhile Soviet Union had brooked no opposition. These nations are also not favourably disposed towards a free media. 				 																																																				The problem with the Indian Left is that it finds itself in an uncomfortable situation of having to exist in a multi-party set-up in which there are institutions that act as a check on its muscle power. The outbursts of the leaders of the CPI(M) are but the results of having its designs frustrated by democratic institutions. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The CPI(M) is baring its fangs at anyone who crosses its path. However, its attitude is evoking more pity than fear. I hear in these ravings against the governor, the high court and the intelligentsia, the last of cries of a cornered political party. The CPI(M) has some very good reasons to feel threatened  what with every right-minded individual condemning its atrocities and even some of the old faithfuls turning against the party. I hope that the widespread protests against the CPI(M) in West Bengal culminate in an ousting of the party altogether from this state.				 																																																				I think that the remonstrations against the CPI(M) would not have taken such gigantic proportions if partymen had not labelled themselves communist. Communism teaches its followers to adhere to certain principles, the foremost of which is the belief in equality. But men who snatch land from poor people because they have more power than the peasants can no longer call themselves communists. Hence, the expression of outrage from intellectuals who have grown up believing in socialist ideals. If the CPI(M), in its new avatar, is to survive in Bengal, it must take on a new name and a new symbol. A party that kills peasants cannot have the hammer and sickle on its flag. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soma Datta, Siliguri

							 																						JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh																					I returned to Delhi after a week, turned on the telly and saw an absurd breaking news  Sania Mirza loses. Whats new about that? It is stale, predictable news, as are the regular announcements of the Indian cricket team losing regularly. In fact, Indian sportsmen have been performing poorly in a consistent manner, be it in tennis or cricket. The hype surrounding the superstars is short-lived. They start to lose after winning the first game because professionalism is non-existent in this country. Quick-fix celebrity status has become a way of life and it is disappointing to find icons making a mockery of real excellence. In sharp contrast, our master artisans retain an unbroken tradition of fine craftsmanship. But alas, they do not find a place on the celebrity list.																					There was a time in the not-so-distant past when celebrities were living, working, thinking individual, people who stood out in the crowd. They not merely made news on the pages of glossy magazines or in daily newspapers and tabloids. These men and women made an impact on the international and national stage, breaking new ground. They were people who set fresh parameters, established new trends, opened stale minds by activating the latent imagination of the masses. They were leaders, the harbingers of change and growth. Today, the indiscriminate use of mediocre methods in the realm of excellence has lowered the level by which we once judged our best and the brightest. By celebrating mediocrity, we have diluted the quality of our creative growth and development. The best shy away from any association with the mediocre and the result is a profound lowering of standards, particularly in the public domain.																					Going down																					Has this happened because the arbitrators of excellence are men and women who know no better? Who have not been privileged to absorb the best and the worst of the world through a studied comprehension of the multi-dimensional aspects of different historical periods? Whose interests and experiences are not as wide-raging as those of their predecessors, and whose intellect and judgment are limited? Or has the official stamp of excellence become a symbol of partisanship? Is it a way to dispense with patronage and demand allegiance to the State? Where are the discerning arbiters of extraordinariness? And why have we, as the people of a great civilization, plummeted to such low depths?																					These questions need to be answered if we are to celebrate our strengths and set a benchmark for another generation of creative minds. Over the last 60 years, there has been a deterioration in morality, ethics, judgement, assessment of what is right and wrong, good and bad and fine and mediocre. Thinking out of the box has been discouraged by the assessors because they themselves are average. The chaos we see around us, the abject lack of respect for integrity, the mockery of excellence  each has plunged India and its people into an abysmal state in which negatives dominate. 																					Our indigenous, contemporary achievements leave much to be desired. It is our past that keeps us going. Will the weak and failed elements in charge of governance allow the best, the energetic and thinking people of our nation to break loose? That could be real breaking news. Or, once again, will the babus survive by killing the rest along with the best?																					There is a lot to learn from the traditional masters and their shishyas. For the masters, discipline was of primary importance. In the past, a weaver or a musician compelled his students to learn the intricacies of his trade with the help of hard work, commitment, and single-mindedness. This is not the case today. A virus has entered training processes, corrupting talent that is required to market goods and services. A return to anonymity may reverse the decline.

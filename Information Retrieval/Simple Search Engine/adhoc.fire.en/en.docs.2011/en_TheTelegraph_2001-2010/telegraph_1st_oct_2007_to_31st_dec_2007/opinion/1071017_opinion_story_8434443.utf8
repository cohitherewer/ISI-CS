							 																						GUIDE TO PLAIN ENGLISH				 WORDCAGE Stephen Hugh-Jones											 			 thewordcageyahoo.co.uk																					Though they wrote a century ago, not often do I disagree with those great gurus of English language  H.W. and F.G. Fowler, known jointly to their devotees simply as Fowler. But reading the Penguin Guide to Plain English by one Harry Blamires, published only in 2000, inspires me afresh to challenge all three.																					Much of the advice in Fowlers The Kings English and the later A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, by H.W. alone, is as sound today as when it was written. Not so their pages of rant against what they called the fused participle: a phrase, to cite Walter Scott, as they did, such as a week passed without Mr Fairford hearing from his son. That, Fowler insisted, should read without Mr Fairfords hearing.																					That insistence was challenged at the time. By now, I had supposed it dead and buried. Not so: Mr Blamires resurrects it afresh.																					His objection, like Fowlers, is to the confusion between the participle, as in, for example, my wife found me reading a detective novel and the gerund, as in she disliked my reading detective novels. Both readings are part of the verb read; but the participle acts like an adjective, the gerund like a noun. So treat each accordingly, these experts insist: she found me reading detective novels is correct, she disliked me reading would be wrong. After all, as Mr Blamires puts it, she didnt dislike me, she disliked what I was doing.																					For the record, my own wife avidly reads detective novels herself, so she could hardly object to me (oops, my) doing the same. But back to our grammar...Consider the following progression of phrases: she saw me reading Agatha Christie; the sight of me reading Agatha Christie; the idea of me reading Agatha Christie; the disgrace of me reading Agatha Christie. The three gurus would okay the first two phrases. But the second two, they would say, must have my reading, not me. Yet...																					I hope you dont mind me interrupting, says my wife, in another phrase that Mr Blamires magisterially condemns, but thats enough Agatha Christie, try reading Dorothy Sayers. Try reading? Damme if Im sure whether its a gerund or a participle that shes using there.																					Frankly speaking																					And, frankly, damme if I care. I think all four of the phrases Ive concocted are perfectly acceptable. English has evolved and survived without too much concern for grammarians niceties, and it will continue to do so whatever they, or I, may say. Id back Scott against Fowler, though he habitually wrote in haste and certainly knew less about the minutiae of grammar. 																					Let alone against Mr Blamires. The Fowler brothers at least had a real feeling for English. Does he? A sometime visiting professor of Eng lit at Wheaton College, Illinois he may be, and author of umpteen books, but are we to take stylistic advice from a man who believes that the sentence They hoped that their partners would know what they wanted without them having to tell them can be straightforwardly corrected by replacing the first them with their? 																					Try saying the result. Thats plain English, is it? In rather plainer English, no. THEWORDCAGEYAHOO.CO.UK

							 																						LATE BUT TRUE																														Legend has it that it was the practice of virtuous kings to don the garb of commoners and mingle with ordinary people to gain knowledge of their lives and opinions. The modern prince  prime minister, chief minister, president, call him by whatever name  cannot, thanks to the intrusion of media and security, assume the cover of anonymity. Limelight chases him. The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, could have earned even more goodwill for himself had he visited the residence of the late Rizwanur Rahman without any fanfare. Unfortunately, this was not possible. The circumstances of the visit detract somewhat from the full impact of Mr Bhattacharjees gesture. Many, especially those who are immediately affected, feel that the chief minister left his visit too late. It was good that he went, but he could have done the same thing many days ago and it could have acted as a genuine salve to hurt souls. In public life, even while making the right gesture, timing is often of the essence. Despite getting his timing awry, Mr Bhattacharjee did manage to strike a chord among members of the grieving family, and also to refurbish his image as a compassionate chief minister.																														Mr Bhattacharjees visit and the circumstances surrounding it raise the all-important question of how a political leader in a mass democracy can remain close to the people, their feelings and emotions. The legendary option of shedding royal attire and walking in the bazaars is no longer a valid or a practical option. Even the most popular of mythical kings would, in todays world, need a security cover, which would give away his identity. It will not be unreasonable to argue that Mr Bhattacharjee was prompted by what he was reading and seeing in the media about the aftermath of Rahmans tragic death. The media can thus sometimes  not always  be a good index of the popular mood. But this cannot be an adequate guide for a leader elected through a popular mandate. All leaders have their own independent channels of information. Beyond all this, there is something called a leaders gut feeling about the mood of the people. Mr Bhattacharjee has been a trifle late in his reading of the profound resentment that has come in the wake of Rahmans death. He has made promises to the family. He will redeem himself by fulfilling those promises, and fulfilling them fast.

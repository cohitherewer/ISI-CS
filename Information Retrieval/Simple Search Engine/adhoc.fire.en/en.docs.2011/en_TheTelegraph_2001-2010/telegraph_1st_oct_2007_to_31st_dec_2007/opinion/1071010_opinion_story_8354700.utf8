							 																						PLAYING AGAINST THE ODDS Fifth Column - Payoshni Mitra																					Im not a guy. Otherwise, I could have become a cricketer, said Indias biggest woman sports star, Sania Mirza, on September 18 in Calcutta, where she was to take part in the Sunfeast Open tennis championship (but an injury forced her to withdraw). Did Mirza realize when she uttered these words that she was being unfair not only to her own sport but also to all women who play cricket in India? When Billie Jean King was young and thought of playing tennis, her mother did not object because she believed tennis was a sissys game. About three-scores of years later in India, Mirzas comment takes us back to the same question: is there a male or a female game? Womens tennis has always collected more gate money than any other sport played by women. Does this mean it has become a womens game? Does this mean we see some games as suitable for men and some for women? 																					In America, baseball is mostly played by men. Women usually play softball. The ball is bigger and lighter in softball, and the softball pitcher has to pitch with an underarm action. American football is considered a male game too, but you have plenty of exceptions now. Combat sports like boxing had a similar reputation, but girls both in the West and in India have begun to challenge such notions. In India, cricket  mens cricket  is the most popular game. Most families, across economic classes, want their sons to play cricket for the country. But there are many young girls, too, who want to play cricket for India. In womens cricket, India is ranked second in the world (higher than the mens team) and has in its team ICCs best woman cricketer of 2007.																					Mirzas comment seems to imply that being a woman and a cricketer is either unnatural or unacceptable. It is definitely not conventional for women to play cricket, even today. But when someone who is regarded as the torch-bearer for womens sports in the country is found saying something that reinforces popular misconceptions, it makes one wonder about the possibilities of change in the lives and games of our playing women. 																					Bad investment
																			 There is also the question of the popularity of games. While mens cricket gets maximum media attention in the country, womens tennis has secured the second place. So, if one thinks of the money in different games and the media attention they get, a boy would be perfectly wise in choosing cricket, just as a girl would in opting for tennis. This takes us to a larger question, though. Is sport then an educational and physical activity, or merely a money-spinning industry  or is it something more complex? 																					Many young girls in India have found their desired space in sports  be it soccer, cricket or hockey. Most of them had not thought of money when they made their choice; and even if they did, they hardly received any. Womens cricket, for instance, like many other sports, is neglected by the games highest administrative body as well as by the sponsors. Jhulan Goswami, after being awarded by the ICC, was felicitated by the Cricket Association of Bengal, where she was given a cheque for Rs 1 lakh. The amount may have made her happy, but it is still a pittance compared to the huge sum the CAB spends even on its first-class male cricketers. 																					Mirzas comment thus points to the neglect that all womens sports except hers have to deal with today  from the media, from the sporting bodies, from sponsors and from the viewers. This leaves our sportswomen with little motivation. Lack of jobs and recognition are are all they get for devoting their lives to sport, and challenging notions of femininity and in many cases, poverty and other forms of discrimination. And still, women athletes in India strive to be recognized and take the cause of their sport forward. Should Sania Mirzas comment discourage them? Hopefully not.

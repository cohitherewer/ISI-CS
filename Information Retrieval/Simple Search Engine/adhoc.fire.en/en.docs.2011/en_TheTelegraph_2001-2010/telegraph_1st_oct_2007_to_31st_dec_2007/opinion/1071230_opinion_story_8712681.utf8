				 																Soaps with harmful suds
				 																																																				Sir  Does the Union law ministry realize what damage the saas-bahu soaps are doing to the cause of law-enforcement in the country? In one soap, a woman gets property-rights transferred in her name using a false identity, taking advantage of a loophole in the law. There are other serials which also show up the flaws of the Indian Penal Code. Criminally inclined individuals can always get hints from these daily soaps. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Bend all rules
				 																																																				Sir  The jawan who beat up the driver and conductor of a minibus recently must have had good reasons for doing so (Jawan belt-whips bus driver, Dec 22). For one, the bus came dangerously close to his motorcycle. The Telegraph dedicated nearly half a page to this incident, complete with a suitably gory photograph of the bloody-mouthed conductor. Readers are likely to feel sympathetic towards the conductor after seeing the picture. But it is often the irresponsibility of drivers and conductors of the citys public buses that lead to gruesome deaths of passengers and pedestrians. What if each accident victims picture was splashed all over the newspapers? Would we have any sympathy left for the clan of drivers and conductors? Almost every commercial vehicle on the city roads bears the sign obey traffic rules. Do the drivers of these vehicles even know what this means? Of course, neither do most of our traffic policemen. The bus drivers probably think they are pilots, and try to fly across streets, endangering lives. Whenever there is an accident, we hear that the driver is absconding. How can drivers abscond so regularly? Do the traffic police let them get away? 
				 																																																				Auto-rickshaw drivers are a class apart. They shamelessly flout rules, taking U-turns where it is strictly forbidden, and seating two passengers to their left simply because the laws prohibit them from seating passengers on both sides. 
				 																																																				Many like me will feel happy if the jawan has succeeded in putting the fear of god into such errant drivers. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  On behalf of the people of Calcutta, I would like to congratulate N.K. Yadav of the Signals wing for meting out summary justice to reckless members of our public transport service. The people of the city have been tolerating their rudeness and misbehaviour for far too long. They throw out aged, infirm passengers, including women, from moving buses. Nobody dares to challenge them as they are backed by political unions. Our pot-bellied police force is hardly a match for them. Yadavs act will find many supporters for sure. It may be a good idea to let a dozen jawans like Yadav loose on the city streets to keep unruly drivers and their helpers in check. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
R.S. Sharma, Calcutta

							 																						GREAT DIVIDE																														Old habits die hard. Despite having burnt his fingers in Sri Lanka, M. Karunanidhi, the Tamil Nadu chief minister, has not fought shy of expressing his concern over the treatment of the predominantly Tamil ethnic Indian population in Malaysia, following its confrontation with the government last week through massive street fights and protests. His forthrightness has naturally led to much discomfiture in the Indian establishment. For a country trying to live down its image of a big brother in the neighbourhood, particularly at the juncture of wresting a free trade agreement with members of the southeast Asian nations, India can ill afford to lock horns with a crucial player in the commercial game. Besides, Malaysia itself has strongly warned against outside intervention in a crisis it sees as a minor domestic problem. Yet, as the worlds most populous democracy and the upholder of certain inalienable human rights, India could be expected to voice a more strident note on the issue than merely making its displeasure known over the goings-on in Malaysia. 																														Ethnic Indians, who make up about 8 per cent of Malaysias population, occupy the lowest rungs of the socio-economic order in the country. The Malaysian government, since the time of Mahathir Mohamad, has followed a policy that has promoted the rights and interests of the indigenous Malay population over that of the settlers, who have consisted of mostly Chinese and Indian peoples brought to the country as plantation workers. With the greater Islamization of Malaysia, which was also to an extent the result of government policy, an anti-Hindu dimension was added to the ethnic divide. This may not have been a conscious decision of the government, but at the ground level, the failure to bridge the ethnic gulf or to respect minority sentiments has worked against it. The misgivings against the government were strong enough to galvanize the ethnic Indians to adopt the improper way of street protests, and, in the coming days, these may lead to a more sustained onslaught against the State, despite its draconian measures. The Indian government, which days back awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman to one such ethnic Indian, cannot write off its responsibility towards this population while selectively claiming the success of a few of them as its own.

				 																Violence pays				 																																																				Sir  It is despicable how the West Bengal government has surrendered to the demands of fundamentalists by forcing Taslima Nasreen to leave the state (Bengal blocks Taslima, Nov 24). This is unacceptable in a democratic country where the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution. What is more appalling is that Nasreen was a guest in this state and the government should have done all that it could to extend hospitality to her. West Bengal, which used to proudly proclaim itself as the cultural capital of the country, has been reduced to a laughing stock because of its incompetent political leadership. As a guest in this country, Nasreen has broken no law and she is here on a valid visa. There is no reason why she should have been forced to move to a different city.				 																																																				The ruling party, to pander to the minority vote bank, has gone out of its way to appease a particular community. There has been no effort to show dissent against the writer in a civilized manner nor has any legal action been instituted against her. It is shameful to see the government cower before a mob. The message is now clear: violence pays. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Biman Boses disgraceful comments urging Taslima Nasreen to leave Bengal show that violence wins the day. It must follow that if far-Right, anti-immigrant groups in the West were to engage in anti-Indian violence, then Bose would prefer to see Indian nationals thrown out of these countries because their presence there was creating a problem for peace. And it must also follow that if people want to oust the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) government then they should resort to using large-scale violence. The CPI(M), in recognition of the fact that their rule is inimical to peace, should then duly resign. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Gita Chakraborty, London

				 																																																				Sir  Just days after the citizens march, a different kind of protest rally, called by the All India Minority Forum, unleashed terror in the city. It is time for the Muslim community of Calcutta to take stock of the situation and engage in serious self-appraisal. Some leaders of the community claim that the violence was instigated and politically motivated. This may be true. It is also possible that the community bears genuine grouse against Taslima Nasreen. But that is no excuse to justify the ransacking of shops or the attack on vehicles. In a democracy, everybody has the right to express personal opinions. But surely opinions must not be equated with personal attacks on revered personalities. Otherwise, what is the point of having laws to prevent defamation? It is one thing to take legal action against Nasreen and quite another to indulge in vandalism.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Abu Mounir, Siliguri

				 																																																				Sir  What could be more ironic than the expulsion of a Muslim writer from West Bengal, a state ruled by the so-called champions of secularism, free speech and human rights? The opinion poll published on the front page of this paper says that 69 per cent Calcuttans didnt want Nasreen to leave the city. She is a guest of the country, and she has committed no crime by writing books. Biman Bose has revealed his true colours by asking Nasreen to leave the state. If the Union government has allowed a foreign national to stay anywhere in the country, the state is obliged to facilitate that stay.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M.C. Joshi, Lucknow

				 																																																				Sir  By throwing out Taslima Nasreen from Bengal we have acknowledged that freedom of speech does not exist in India and that the writ of some fanatics runs the lives of Bengalis, a community that prides itself on being liberal and enlightened. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jyoti Raychaudhuri, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Would the real secularist please stand up? The secular Left Front government had to surrender to Islamic fundamentalism, and Taslima Nasreen had to be removed from Calcutta, the cultural heart of the country. The intellectuals who gathered on November 14 to protest against the atrocities in Nandigram, and brought together thousands of Calcuttans on the streets, should raise their voices against this gross injustice. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Partha Roy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Biman Bose was right in expressing displeasure over Taslima Nasreen staying in Bengal. Calcutta was an enlightened place in the past where liberals lived in peace and harmony. These days, when the administration cannot even save school students from the trauma of a riot, perhaps we cannot afford to play host to a controversial figure like Nasreen. Would our numskull politicians ever be able to assess the psychological damage that the young suffered after witnessing the violence last Wednesday? We are ordinary citizens paying extraordinary amounts of tax to an inefficient government. Surely, we deserve better than this!				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sougata Halder, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why cannot challenges posed by the pen be countered with the pen? Why must religious convictions be defended with violence, and not through debate? Perhaps the fanatics should be made aware of the fact that Wednesdays violence achieved nothing other than tarnishing the image of Islam as a religion of peace.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Prosenjit Roy, Calcutta

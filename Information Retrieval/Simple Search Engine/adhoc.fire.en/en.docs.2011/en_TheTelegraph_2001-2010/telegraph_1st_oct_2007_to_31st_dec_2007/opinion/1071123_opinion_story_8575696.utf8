							 																						KING WITH A HEART OF GOLD				 	 Colourful ruler																																																													THE REGAL PATRIOT: MAHARAJA GANGA SINGH OF BIKANER By L.S. Rathore, Roli, Rs 595																					The state of Bikaner was founded in 1465 by Rao Bika, second son of Rao Jodha, who, again, was the founder of the city of Jodhpur. The Raos were the descendants of the Rastrakutas (or, the Rathores) who formed a formidable dynasty in 10th century north India. With the Muslim invasion, the dynasty went into decline in the 12th century, only to re-emerge in the early 13th.																					Maharaja Ganga Singh was the twenty-first ruler of the Rao Bika lineage. His coronation took place in 1887, at the age of seven. The Council of Regency, set up by the government of India, ruled on his behalf until he came of age.																					L.S. Rathores biography of the Maharaja highlights a sharp, sensitive and enlightened man of the colonial era, whose rule was remarkable not only in the history of Bikaner but also in the history of the Indian Independence. His stature is first to be understood with respect to the political polarization of colonial India. The princely states, covering two-fifth of the total land area of the country, recognized the paramountcy of the British rule, which provided them with safeguards against popular insurgency and external attacks. These states epitomized all the vices traditionally associated with monarchy  aversion to reform, heavy taxing and misappropriation of treasury for personal extravagance being some.																					The biography shows that the Maharaja, in many respects, was a good few notches above his fellow pleasure-hunting princes. True, he never sought to abolish monarchy but tried earnestly to democratize the institution, or, at least to minimize its cardinal vices. This is reflected in his unassuming lifestyle as well as in his formation of a peoples representative assembly for his state. His pro-reform mindset is evinced by his dredging of the Gang Canal to revolutionize the irrigation system in the parched lands of Bikaner.																					Ganga Singh, quite notably, was also one of those few princes who unequivocally sympathized with nationalist causes. He was an ardent admirer of Gandhi and pressed the government for his release from jail so that the latter could attend the second round table conference. As for the Maharaja, he himself advocated strongly for a federated India in the first round table conference in 1930.																					Ganga Singh comes across as a colonial-nationalist with a magical personality. Despite his rapport with most of the British governors, he could unhesitatingly articulate his nationalist ideas, even at the risk of annoying Winston Churchill.																					The Maharaja epitomized the new self-conscious, socially interactive individual, who was the product of Western education  something of which Franz Fanon speaks in The Wretched of the Earth. The Maharaja redefined aristocracy, reformed monarchy itself and laid a secular, modern coating on the core of a tradition which he inherited as a Rajput. His democratic-nationalist principles did not jar with his penchant for battle-field heroism, which he upheld proudly as his legacy, and even went on to offer military services to the British. He was a man of colourful contradictions, and endearingly so. Rathores book enlivens both the man and his time.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

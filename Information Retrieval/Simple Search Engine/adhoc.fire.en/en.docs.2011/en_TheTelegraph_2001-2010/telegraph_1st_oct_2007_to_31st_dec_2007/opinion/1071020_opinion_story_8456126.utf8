							 																						UNHAPPY LOVERS, THIS TIME ON STAGE Ananda Lal											 			 TheatreSerendipitously, because they premiered before September 21, two Bengali productions touch upon the very issues of civil society that have outraged Calcuttas citizens since that date. One is a Mohit Chattopadhyay original that reveals the master of simple, compassionate truths in top form. The other is an adaptation of a Pirandello classic, about the elusiveness of truth, which suddenly turns topical today. 																														Samstabs Ei Ghum centres on an executive saddled with the duty of submitting a report that may result in the sacking of employees under him. This responsibility burdens him so much that, in his need to escape it, he feels drowsy all the time, falling off to sleep any minute, even in office. Initially, this creates a light atmosphere in Chattopadhyays typical engaging style. 																														We get to know that the reason for the heros affliction  analogous to Macbeth shall sleep no more  lies in his past handling of an unproductive worker whose spirit, in the manner of Banquo, returns to haunt him. His decision had led to the ruin of that mans home. In contrition, he surrenders to the police, insisting they jail him for killing that man. Nonplussed, they refuse, citing the rulebook that there is neither a case nor evidence of murder. 																														As he has done before with some of Chattopadhyays finest latter-day work, Dwijen Bandyopadhyay (picture) directs and acts the lead sensitively, no doubt helped by the fact that the author has not padded this script at all. He mounts it with the same simplicity of language and situation that Chattopadhyay often uses to make a profound point: in Ei Ghum, welding the job uncertainties of cutthroat capitalism to human guilt and repentance. 																														Lokkrishtis Ihai Satya? comes from It Is So! (If You Think So), one of Pirandellos first fruits that established him as a dramatist in 1916. It introduced his lifelong obsession with what constitutes fact. Those familiar with Six Characters in Search of an Author will recognize the connections instantly, as the neighbours and colleagues of a newly transferred man, and even the Commissioner (here, the District Magistrate), investigate the apparent mystery behind his wife and mother- in-law. 																														Despite the newcomers unwillingness to mingle, the nosey parkers continue probing without discovering the truth, only succeeding in upsetting the familys settled existence. As the wife puts it at the conclusion, I am whom you believe me to be, underscoring Pirandellos philosophy that what we individually believe becomes reality for each one of us separately, so there is no objective truth. She also implies that the whole play spotlights her as daughter or wife, never herself. To stress these harsh ironies, Pirandello closes each of the three acts with derisive laughter from the one detached viewer of the proceedings. 																														Perhaps Phalguni Chattopadhyay takes this too literally, directing Ihai Satya? as farce when the source is anything but. Halfway through, we understand that the comic kick-start misleadingly began an otherwise serious drama. A poor, uncredited set and Subhasri Rays excessive compression of the text contribute to this dilemma. Granted, Pirandello overwrote (the original is even longer than Six Characters), but she could have kept more of his dialogue that adds to the disturbing sense of public interference imposing its morality on private lives. 																														If carefree enjoyment is the motto for the festive season, Shouvaniks Abalilakrame at Mukta Angan fits the bill, though here, too, we find the theme of star-crossed lovers that has captured Calcuttans hearts. A Brahmin youth falls for a lower-caste girl but realizes that his domineering aunt will disapprove. His clever partner hatches a plan so that she enters the household in disguise to win their hearts. The usual complications follow, but all is ultimately resolved in merriment. Inspired by a Kautilya story, the writer-director, Bimal Bandyopadhyay, gets professional performances from his cast in Shouvaniks 75th production, but one cannot help thinking that this historic milestone (which we must applaud) merited something of greater substance.

							 																						TOO MERRY FOR HER OWN GOOD																														My music teacher lets call her FM refuses to be the typical Senior Citizen. She has always been different, and she has always chosen to be free (her words). At 69, she sees no reason to be otherwise. She had decided, very soon after her marriage, not to live with her husband and his family. (I asked her how I should describe her marital status. Oh, I think I am a widow. At least, I very much hope that I am one! she answered.) Over the years, while bringing up her son and building up her profession as a musician and piano-teacher in various Indian cities, she has sometimes fallen seriously ill, and often known poverty. But every time, she has sprung back from these crises to a vivre full of joie, with a robustness that she thinks is positively embarrassing.																														She is very close to her son, who lives abroad, and to her granddaughter, who lives in another city. But she has chosen to live alone in Calcutta. And this, in spite of what she describes as grim and lugubrious warnings from her local, senior-citizen friends about the medical and financial risks of such a life.																														Recently, she felt her two-roomed flat near Ruby Hospital was too small for a piano and a steady stream of pupils. So she arranged to rent her friends flat in a cooperative society nearby. She paid the advance, packed her stuff, and was about to move when the axe fell.																														The cooperative society had met, and some of its more responsible members had decided that they could not allow her to live there. The reasons they gave reveal an unpleasant muddle of hostilities. Somehow, FM seemed to be a particularly risky combination of senior citizen and single woman, but without quite fitting into the typical image of either. They summoned her, and it was like an inquisition. They wanted to know her religion. Non-practising Muslim, she said. How can that be? they asked, We want proof of religion. Then they wondered why she does not live with her son, and how respectable a single, female piano-teachers life would be. She has chosen to be alone, she replied, adding (I am sure with a vengeful twinkle) that she was, sadly, too old to live a life of anything but the most boring respectability. They immediately seized on that. Why should they take the risk of having among them someone who was too old? What if something happened to her? FMs friend declared, at this point, that she would take full responsibility if something happened to FM. That was still not enough. They wanted a permanent address, passport details and three references. She supplied the last, and said that she had chosen not to have a permanent address.																														After a few more meetings in her absence, she was told that she was not wanted there, and that her friend had no right to rent out her flat to her even if she happened to own the flat. The chairman also believed that he was under no obligation to give proper reasons for any of this.																														With her usual resilience, FM has managed to find another spacious flat with a nice landlord. But her experience with the cooperative society had knocked her out for a while, and the aftertaste is humiliating. The senior citizen, she saw clearly, is yet another category that you could either fit or not fit. If you are not evidently victim-like, self-pitying, pious and hitched to a family that is either protective or neglectful, then you do not quite earn the compassion that these qualities elicit from younger citizens. And this compassion could just as easily tip over into risk-averse nervousness. Difference can be scary. AVEEK SEN

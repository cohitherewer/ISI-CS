							 																						SELFISH INTEREST Gwynne Dyer											 			 FIFTH COLUMN 																					Nothing much will happen right away. The Turkish ambassador to Washington has gone home for consultations after the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives approved a bill declaring the mass-killing of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during World War I was a genocide. But he will come back to Washington, and it will be weeks before the full House passes the bill. This will be a slow-motion disaster.																					The White House tried hard to stop this bill. President George W. Bush declared that this resolution is not the right response to these historic mass killings, and all eight living former US secretaries of state, both Democratic and Republican, signed a joint letter to the Foreign Affairs Committee urging it not to approve the bill. But it did, by a 27-21 vote, and next month, the full House will do the same: more than half the members have signed up as co-sponsors of the bill. The United States of America will be the 23rd country to fall to the Armenian campaign to link the Ottoman Turkey of 90 years ago with the Nazi Germany of 60 years ago and, by extension, to implicate the current Republic of Turkey in premeditated genocide.																					Once such a law is passed, to question the Armenian take on what happened is to become the equivalent of a denier of the (Jewish) Holocaust. The Armenian desire to have their national tragedy given the same status as the Jewish Holocaust is understandable, but it is mistaken. The facts of the case are horrifying, and certainly justify calling the events in eastern Turkey in 1915-16 a genocide, but the key elements of prior intent and systematic planning that distinguish the Nazi Holocaust are absent.																					When I was a graduate student in Middle Eastern history, as a translation exercise, I was given the hand-written diary of a Turkish soldier killed during the retreat from Baghdad in 1917. Mehmet Cavus (Sergeant Mehmet) was a youthful village school-teacher who had been called up in 1914. At first he had a safe billet guarding the Black Sea entrance to the Bosphorus, but in 1915, his unit was ordered to march east to deal with a Russian invasion and an Armenian rebellion.																					Diary of a nobody																					And then, in the diary of this pleasant, rather nave young man, I read the phrase iyi katliam etmistik. Loosely translated, this means: We really massacred them. The diary was written in the old Ottoman rika, a version of handwritten Arabic script that never really served Turkish well. So I asked my teacher if it really said what I thought it did. Oh yes, he said. Those were different times.																					That excuses nothing, but it explains much. The foolish young officers, who led the Ottoman Empire into the war, panicked when they realized that the Russians were invading from the east and the British were about to land on the Mediterranean coast. Just at that point, Armenian revolutionaries, who had been plotting with the Russians and the British to carve out an Armenian state from the wreckage of the Empire, launched futile revolts to assist the invaders.																					The Turks responded by slaughtering many Armenians in what is now eastern Turkey and deporting the rest to Syria. It was certainly a genocide, but neither premeditated nor systematic. Armenians living in other parts of the Empire were largely left alone, and those in the war zone with money for rail travel reached Syria safely.																					So why is the US Congress recognizing the Armenian genocide, but not the more recent genocide of the Tutsis in Rwanda? Because there arent many voters of Tutsi descent in key Congressional districts. This is all about domestic politics: alienating the Turks doesnt cost much politically.																					Armenian activists today arent looking for justice. They want to drive the Turks into extreme reactions, isolate them and derail the domestic changes turning Turkey into a modern democracy. They do not want Turkey to succeed. And the West is falling for it.

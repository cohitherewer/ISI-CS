							 																						TO THE PEOPLE																														The United Progressive Alliance government is living on borrowed time. The Congress should acknowledge this and stop prolonging this artificial afterlife. There is a point beyond which death cannot be deferred. Yet, this is precisely what the Congress is trying to do by extending talks that have already proved to be fruitless. What can be gained by extending the talks by one more week? Admittedly, the crisis is not of the Congresss making. It has been created by the Left, to be more precise by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and to be even more specific, by Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the CPI(M). Mr Karat persuaded his party to put its anti-American ideology above national interests and all electoral calculations. As a result, it held a gun to the temple of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. The demand of the Left was that Mr Singh should not operationalize the Indo-US nuclear deal, and if he did, the Left would withdraw its support to the government. This was obviously an untenable situation since the government could not possibly go back on an international treaty, to which it had declared its commitment, after meeting the reservations voiced by the Left and sections of the scientific community. To temporize, a committee was created to discuss the ways and means by which the inevitable could be averted.																														The meetings of this committee have produced no tangible results. Both sides have only reiterated their respective positions. This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue. It is obvious that elections will have to be held. What is uncertain is their timing. Given the inevitability, what does the government or the Congress gain by parleying with the very force that is responsible for the governments early and unfortunate demise? It should tarry no longer, and get out of the Lefts deadening embrace as soon as possible. This paper has argued before in these columns that the earlier the Congress goes to the people the better. The time has come to reiterate this position. The Congress and its allies need a fresh mandate from the people which will allow the UPA to be free from the pressure tactics of the CPI(M) and its ilk. In a democracy, the verdict of the people is final and the Congress needs this verdict more than empty parleys with men who have not outgrown their moth-eaten ideology. The Congress has nothing to lose but its leftist chains.

							 																						DRIVING HOME A POINT																														Not too many get a second chance in life. Benazir Bhutto, who was accorded a heros welcome, for the second time in two decades, on her return to her country seems to be one of those lucky few who do. Despite her years in political wilderness, she is lucky to have a functional political party at her command that can launch a publicity blitz as large as that which was witnessed on the day of her return, and that too on a hostile territory like Karachi. She is also lucky to have to her advantage the undying popular hope for democracy that, on the day and hour of her homecoming, somehow overrode the ill-will over her dalliances with the dictator. Above all, she is lucky to have survived the twin blasts, at a kissing distance from the truck carrying her, which killed 135 people in the crowd. The unrestrained jubilation over Ms Bhuttos return has been instantly replaced by a numbing horror at the bloodshed. But the feeling must appear to be uncannily familiar to the people of Pakistan who have ridden the crest of hope and ploughed the depths of despair all too often over the past few months.																														There can be no arguing that Ms Bhutto is up against tremendous odds. Her reconciliation with Pervez Musharraf has not only established her as an enemy of the countrywide movement for democracy, but has also created rifts within her own party, which is not too happy with her risky political manoeuvres. There is every chance that the supreme court of Pakistan may strike down her deal with Mr Musharraf, thereby making her as susceptible to arrest and deportation as her political contender, Nawaz Sharif, whom she seems to have so deftly upstaged. The court may even declare Mr Musharrafs candidature (it is for his election that the deal was made and the path of return cleared) illegal. In that case, the ensuing emergency declared by a recalcitrant and vindictive president would rob her and her party of the dream of making it to power again. However, as the bomb blasts make evident, the more real threat is from the taliban, who now run a parallel government on the countrys western borders and have no compunctions in training their guns against their one-time benefactors. They see Ms Bhutto as another inevitable target after Mr Musharraf, given her intention to carry on with the war on terror in keeping with the wishes of her friends in the West.																														The bloodshed in Pakistan has several messages to deliver, and not merely to Ms Bhutto. For her, it should make apparent the indispensability of the army in controlling armed militancy, which would also imply her continued dependence on it. To the people it should once again drive home the point that the greatest threat to democracy is terrorism. If the people manage to decode the message, it should make the job of leaders like Ms Bhutto easier. For it is only the overwhelming popular will for stability and security that can push forward a political settlement. The earlier, the better.

				 																A look at the Potterboiler					Sir  The Delhi high court has shown rare sensitivity in granting permission for the Potter pandal to the organizers of the Salt Lake puja (Pandal wins reprieve, Oct 13). The publicity following the controversy will definitely benefit J.K. Rowling and her publishers. Many would want to visit this puja pandal. This in turn may boost the Potter readership. One thing remains unclear. If the potters of rural India create and sell clay models of the Potter characters in the market, will there be similar attempts to restrain them?					Yours faithfully,																															A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta
					Muddy waters					Sir  The report, Rotten water cuts off residents (Oct 9), brings to light a terrible calamity. It is appalling that a road was allowed to be constructed that blocked the Adi Ganga. Now the water has no place to go. Isnt somebody going to take responsibility for this action as hundreds of families have been displaced? People have been forced to wade through dirty and fetid water, putting their lives at a grave risk for no fault of theirs. Stench and snakes are their companions in the sprawling residential complex. Retired and elderly people living there had been promised a peaceful life away from the din and bustle of the city. Dont they deserve more than what they have been getting for the last few years?					It is impossible to think that nothing can be done. We must remember that no matter how much we develop and industrialize, unless our leaders and decision-makers take care of the citizens first, no progress will be possible. It seems India has a long way to go even to catch up with China. Recently, China evacuated and gave shelter to millions of people, not once but twice, to avoid destruction by typhoons. Here citizens are left alone to fend for themselves. Is it not time for the local leaders and administrators to wake up?					Yours faithfully,																															Niladri Sen, Connecticut, US				 Sir  It was good to know that the mayor of Calcutta, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, visited the ailing Suchitra Sen at the Belle Vue Hospital. Except for Behala, did Bhattacharya have time to visit the people in other parts of the city who were inconvenienced for a number of days owing to waterlogging due to the incessant deluge in Calcutta? What did Bhattacharya hope to achieve by his visit to the hospital? One wonders if our honourable politicians would ever learn to weed out their superfluous engagements and concentrate on the real problems that beset the people. 			 Yours faithfully,																															Abhijit Sen, Michigan, US
 Taken for a ride Sir  The report, Snack sets up spicy spat in sky (Oct 9), should serve as an eye-opener for both the government as well as consumers. Most of the vegetable-sellers and grocers in the market have weighing machines which have been tampered with. Multiplexes and shopping malls sell soft drinks, pop corns, potato chips and so on at exorbitant prices. A bottle of soft drink or a packet of wafers is invariably sold at three times the maximum retail price. Petrol pumps also sell adulterated fuel or have meters recalibrated to their advantage. 					Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir  Consumers uncomplainingly accept being fleeced in posh places. This could be at shopping malls, where goods are sold by smart, English-speaking kids in uniform. Or it could be at the airport, where counters run by major confectioners, charge a hefty price even for a bottle of mineral water. But airports are still under government control. Why should such discrepancy be allowed to go on?					Yours faithfully, 																															
J. Chatterjee, Calcutta

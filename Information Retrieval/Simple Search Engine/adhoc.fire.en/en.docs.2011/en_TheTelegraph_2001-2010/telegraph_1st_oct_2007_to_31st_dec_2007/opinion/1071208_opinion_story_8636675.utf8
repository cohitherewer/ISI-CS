							 																						UNDER SOUTHERN EYES
 THIS ABOVE ALL

				 	 Not a matter of concern				 
																					I was under the impression that Bhajan Lal of Haryana was the megastar of political nautankis, who could perform acrobatics the likes of which we had not seen in India. I have changed my opinion to give the top position in political comic operas to H.D. Deve Gowda of Karnataka. You may recall that this self-styled humble son of a farmer burst on the scene some decades ago and has, for a few months, been our prime minister. He became famous for nodding off in the midst of important meetings but was wide awake if matters concerning his future and those of his sons were on the agenda. The general opinion was that he made the poorest prime minister of India: he decided to consolidate his hold in his home state, Karnataka. 
																					He did not have a high opinion of the Congress, so he set up a party of his own, the Janata Dal (Secular). It did reasonably well in the last state elections but not well enough to form a government on its own. So he made a pact with the non-secular Bharatiya Janata Party to the effect that his son would rule the first half term, and the BJP the second half. The BJP accepted the offer. Deve Gowda put his son in the chief ministers chair and told him how to run the state. When it was time to hand over power to the BJP, Deve Gowda changed his mind. You are not a secular party, he told them, You will turn Karnataka into another Gujarat. Sorry, no change. But his supporters were out-numbered. So the state was put under presidents rule. He had not anticipated that and changed his mind again. Okay, you run the state but you must give my sons important ministerial portfolios. Presidents rule was abrogated. BJP netas were overjoyed. They flew into Bangalore  L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh, Yashwant Sinha et al. They popped pedas in each others mouths. They felt they had conquered the South and soon all of Bharat would be theirs. They chose a chief minister with a mouth-filling, yard-long name hoping his rule would also be as long, Bookanakeri Siddalingappa Yeddyurappa. Deve Gowda demanded his pound of flesh: money-spinning ministerial portfolios for his sons and cronies. BJP said, Nothing doing. So once again Karnataka is under presidents rule.
																					Look upon it as a natak and you will smile; look upon it as a tragic drama of the depths to which our politicians have sunk and you will not sleep peacefully for many nights.
																					Youthful adventurer
																					Most poets and writers, though they may have written volumes of poetry or prose, make their name for a very small corpus of their lifes work. Among Urdu poets, the outstanding example of one who is known largely because of one poem sung and recited ever since he composed it is Hafeez Jalandhari (1900-1982). The poem entitled Abhee to main jawaan hoon  I am still young  is in praise of youth and wine. Few people know anything else written by him. You have to hear Mallika Pukhraj sing it, Zohra Sehgal or Saeed Naqvi recite it and youll know why it has become an all-time favourite. Its words have music; it is celebratory of youth and libation, and pours scorn on puritanism. I had assumed that one could not catch the rhythm and flow of words in English till I read D.N. Vasu and K.C. Kandas translations. I decided to try my hand at it. I reproduce the first half. It begins with a description of the season: 
																					Havaa bhee khusgavaar hai

																					Gulon peh bhee nikhaar hai

																					Tarannum-e-hazaar hai

																					Bahaar pur bahaar hai
																					Pleasant is the atmosphere,

																					 Flowers blossom everywhere,

																					 There is music in the air,

																				 Its spring in all its glory here.
																					The following lines summon the saqi, the wine server  usually a comely lad  to do his duty:
																					Kahaan challaa hai saaqia

																					Idhar to laut, idhar to aa

																					Arey, yeh dekhta hai kya

																					Uttha suboo, suboo uttha

																					Suboo utthaa, pyaalaa bhar

																					Puaala bhar kay de idhar

																					Chaman kee simaat kar nazar
																					Saqi, where are you off to now

																				 Come back, come near

																				 Why look here and there

																				 Pick up the goblet and the cup

																				 Pick it up and fill it up

																				 When its full, give it to me

																				 Turn your gaze to the garden and see.
																					Samaan to dekh bekhabar

																					Voh kaali kaali badliyan

																					Ufaq peh ho gayeen ayaan

																					Voh ek hujoom maikasham

																					Hai sooey maikadah ravaan

																					Yeh kya gumaan hai badgumaan

																					amajh naa mujh ko naatvaan

																					Khayaal-e-zuhad abhee kahaan

																					Abhee to main jawaan hoon
																					Think of the season silly boy

																				 Dark clouds gather in the sky

																				 Sweeping across the heavens go

																				 Crowds of revellers coming along

																				 To the tavern in a throng

																				 Why are you lost in doubt

																				 Think not my strength has run out

																				 Abstinence I still disdain

																				 Young in heart I still remain.
																					Glamorous amorous

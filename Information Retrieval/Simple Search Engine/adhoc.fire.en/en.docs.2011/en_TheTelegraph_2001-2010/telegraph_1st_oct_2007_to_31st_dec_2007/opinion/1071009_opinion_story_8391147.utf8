				 																Dangerous games				 																																																				Sir  As students of St Stephens College, we are extremely disturbed by the report, Burning game at Stephens (Oct 04). We completely sympathize with victims of the unfortunate incident. But to the best of our knowledge, this was not a case of ragging. Media reports on the incident, which did not take into account the other end of the story, have prompted the college to take steps against the four students involved in the case. Another thing that needs to be put straight is that the college authorities are neither trying to cover up the incident nor trying to protect its students.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jeena Sarah Jacob, Mahashweta Burma and Ruchira Sen, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  It appears that the St Stephens College authorities are taking the matter of a student being set on fire in an incident of ragging a bit too casually. The college enjoys a reputation of being one of the best centres of learning in the country. Keeping this in mind, the authorities should institute a detailed inquiry into the matter and severely penalize those found guilty of such dangerous and insensitive behaviour. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Even if one were to believe that the students accused of setting a St Stephens freshman on fire were indulging in some game, how is such a game any less harmful and emotionally scarring than a case of ragging? How can a college of St Stephens repute allow its students to indulge in a behaviour that poses a risk to life in the guise of a game? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  While one can in no way support the behaviour of the students in St Stephens College, it appears that the occurrence is being likened to a criminal offence. Spraying deodorant on a persons hand and lighting a match under it is actually a common trick and usually does not lead to such grave consequences. But there can be no doubting that it can be dangerous. It is also a good idea to highlight the incident at St Stephens so that its repercussions are understood and the act is never repeated. But at the same time, one must understand that boys will be boys and the kind of behaviour displayed by the students at St Stephens are often seen in other colleges too. The incident was, in all probability, an accident, though one that can and should be eminently avoided.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Put into practice				 																																																				Sir  Born on October 2, 1869, Mahatma Gandhi became a symbol of peace and moral integrity to billions across the world. Nowadays, his birthday is also celebrated as the International Day of Non-violence. It is shocking that youngsters these days are ignorant of the achievements of the Father of our nation. While the world adopts his principles and researches his philosophy and contribution to world peace, it is unfortunate that we in India have not passed on his legacy to the next generation. At best, we have cashed in on the Mahatma in series of Bollywood films and come up with tasteless jokes about his teachings. Are we going to stop at this, and allow the Mahatma to be forgotten one day? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Mahatma Gandhi had always advocated hard work and it will be a true tribute to his memory if Gandhi Jayanti were made a working day. The ritual placing of wreaths at his memorial in Rajghat by political leaders may take place in the early hours of the morning so as not to disrupt traffic. The UN general assembly has decided to observe October 2 as the International Day of Non-violence. We should go one step further and try to put his principle of ahimsa to practice. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash C. Agrawal, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  One wonders if Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is today merely a symbol of peace or just a sound commercial venture, providing fodder for innumerable books on his life and teachings, as well as successful cinema, mainstream and otherwise. Perhaps the issue of remembering the Mahatma has already been taken care of, what with his face appearing on the watermark on our currency notes. The important question though is whether we should now allow ourselves to remember him for such entirely personal aspects of his life as his relationship with his family, and/or his sexual preferences or for his remarkable contribution to the shaping of Indian history. Will it not be a more fitting tribute to his memory if his message of peace and non-violence is spread through education and public awareness programmes rather than through a commercially-viable trivialization of his teachings or by tearing apart his personal life?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  The people of West Bengal are accustomed to the news of lockouts in factories and suspension of workers, but they would not care to notice the sudden withdrawal of the 30A bus which had run between Sinthee and Esplanade. This bus used to cater to the needs of thousands of passengers going to offices in B.B.D. Bag and to schools and colleges in Shyambazar or College Street. Before the Metro Railways and the now-ubiquitous autorickshaws arrived in Calcutta, the 30A bus was the only transport that connected the people of north Calcutta to those in the central and southern parts of the city. It is well known that the bus service was completely under the control of the Left affiliated-union and the bus owners had no say in the employment of drivers or conductors. It is rumoured that some intra-party feud has caused the union to call the buses off the roads. This is unfortunate for commuters who no longer have the chance to travel cheap to the office para. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																Playing it safe					Sir  The Indian cricket selectors have taken a step back by appointing Anil Kumble the Test captain against Pakistan (Dark horse beats favourite, Nov 9). However, the decision makes sense if performance is the sole criterion for appointing a skipper. Kumble has, for years together, delivered for the Indian team without ever aspiring to become a pin-up boy. He has been consistent and dependable, although he has never had the star value that Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid can lay claim to. As Indias Test captain, Kumbles immediate task should be to differentiate between aggression and transgression regarding the code of conduct for Team India. 					Yours faithfully,																															Sambuddha Sinha, 
Berhampore					 Sir  Anil Kumble seems to be the right choice as skipper for the Tests against Pakistan. Although Kumble has successfully led India in only a single one-day international, he has, nevertheless, played more than a hundred Test matches for his country. Besides, his performance has probably won India more Test matches than that of any other player. Kumble stays calm under tremendous pressure and is much respected for his cerebral approach to the game. One still remembers how he braved a broken jaw in 2002 and dismissed Brian Lara on the West Indies tour. He is the third-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket and he may achieve many more such feats as Indias Test captain in the twilight of his career.					Yours faithfully,																															
Subhayu Saha, 
					 Khagra, Murshidabad					Sir  No Indian cricketer who has achieved so much has been given so little credit as Anil Kumble. Despite being left out of the team time and again, he has always given a commendable performance on returning to the side. It is only fair that he has been given the captaincy. Unfortunately, Kumble is already past his prime. Since he started his Test career against England in 1990, the apathy of the Board of Control for Cricket in India has been primarily responsible for the delay in making him captain. This time too, the selection committee seemed disinterested in Kumble although Sachin Tendulkar had already refused to accept the responsibility. 					Kumble has tested batsmen of all shades with his impeccable line and length and variation in flight. He has certainly been Indias biggest Test-winner for long. Besides, Kumble has often demonstrated his ability to bat sensibly and responsibly. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  The selectors should be thanked for bestowing some honour on Anil Kumble at long last. Although the boards decision seems to lack spontaneity, people will remember Kumbles selection as a recognition of his enormous contribution to Indian cricket. The BCCI is not known for making the right choice about skippers. But Kumbles selection is certainly an exception to this rule. 					Yours faithfully,																															
Subrata Manna,

					Sir  The choice of Anil Kumble as captain comes as a shock. Since Rahul Dravid had resigned as captain and Sachin Tendulkar has declined to lead the side, why was Sourav Ganguly not considered for the post? After all, Ganguly is Indias most successful Test captain. Anil Kumble may be a great cricketer but he has had no experience as captain. Besides, he is at the fag end of his cricketing career. One would like to know the reason that prompted the BCCI to choose Kumble, and whether he will be dropped for the next series if he fails to deliver against Pakistan. Kumbles appointment looks like a stopgap arrangement till the selectors have found their man. One also suspects that they have been swayed by the opinion of former cricketers, such as Ravi Shastri, who were opposed to the idea of a younger man leading the Test team. Yet, a younger captain would have had time on his side and, if successful, would have stuck around for a longer period. 					M.S. Dhoni was certainly the man for this job. Dhoni may not be experienced, but his performance has been fairly good. In the short period that he has led the team, he has shown enough leadership abilities. Off the field, he has handled the media with great skill. The opportunity to lead the Test team at home against Pakistan would have given him enough confidence to lead the team in the forthcoming series against Australia, which is bound to be a difficult challenge. By downgrading Dhoni, the selectors have lost a great opportunity to infuse fresh blood into Indian cricket. 					Yours faithfully,

																					Dirty business																					Conspiracy theories abound on the internet, but they should stay there. It goes beyond reason why any self-respecting group should theatricalize the biggest of them in recent times  that the CIA and FBI set up 9/11 so as to facilitate an assault on al Qaida in order to keep the arms industry alive. That is what Anticlock, by Spandan-IPTA in Bengali, presents. Up to the point that the US, in its infinitely shortsighted realpolitik, aided the taliban and allies against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and created its own Frankenstein in Osama, this is acceptable. But to argue that American officials plotted to demolish the towering symbols of their own mercantile supremacy and national pride, is a bit thick, if not perverse. Understandably, the ruling party in West Bengal has applauded the production. Dramatist-director Sangram Guha seems to have read too many Agatha Christies in which the most unlikely suspect turns out to be the assassin. At least such thrillers are plausible; Anticlock is farfetched in everything, even in acting, accent, costumes and customs. Most ironically, it is lavishly produced  including documentary large-screen video footage  spending tons of money to damn the dirty business of money. 																					Ananda Lal																					Rhythm rules																					Luna Poddar is a brilliant Kathak dancer and trainer who has nurtured young dancers with passion. Her institution, Prerna, presented an evening of Kathak at Gyan Manch on October 27. The Colours of Kathak brought together an array of traditional numbers and and synchronized group compositions. Poddar tried to explore different taals through group, duet and solo numbers. Debasree, Tanima, Madhuka and Baisakhi seemed to thoroughly enjoy the magic of the beats. Starting with teentaal of sixteen beats, the dancers gradually moved into jhanptaal and dhamar with confidence. In her solo number, Atmaja Das proved her command over layakari. Sohini and Arshiya presented a number in jhanptaal. Piu, Arpita and Arunima seemed to blossom during their performance. An innovative piece Shringar, choreographed to the song, Tum se naina lage re, marked an experimental combination of thumri and Western Classical. The second half of the programme presented Leena Sabarwal, a young dancer from the US. Debasish Sarkar (vocal), Chandrachur Bhattacharya (sitar) and Utpal Ghosal (tabla) gave able support to the dancers. 																					Sharmila Basu Thakur

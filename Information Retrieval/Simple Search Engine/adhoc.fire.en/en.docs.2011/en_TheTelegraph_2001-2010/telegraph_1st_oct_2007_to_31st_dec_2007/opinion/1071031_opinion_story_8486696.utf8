				 																Smoke alarm					Sir  Although I have been a smoker for the last eighteen years, I make it a point never to smoke in public places. Smoking is such a personal act that I cannot even think of lighting up in public. If one smokes not to attract attention but to satisfy what is often a physiological urge, then it is impossible to stand smoking under the public glare. It may often be difficult to resist the urge to smoke and one may not always be within the confines of home at that particular moment. But if one is a smoker, one has to abide by a smoking etiquette, which requires one not to make others suffer by smoking in public. 					It is thus unbecoming of Shah Rukh Khan to light up at public functions (Smoke, and spark legal fire, Oct 27). Both the programmes attended by the actor were on air and viewers across the country saw their screen idol smoking. At one of the events Khan was one of the speakers. Smoking on the dais not only showed his insolence, but also set a bad example for the youth. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  The legal notice slapped by the National Organization for Tobacco Eradication on Shah Rukh Khan will achieve little other than generating bad publicity for the actor. Khan will have to pay a fine of only Rs 200 if it is proved that he has violated the ban on smoking in public places. But filmstars of Khans stature can afford the costliest litigation. Shekhar Salkar, general secretary of Note, however, believes that the principle behind the action is more important than the penalty amount. But this principle, on the basis of which the anti-tobacco body hopes to fight the offender, somewhat loses its significance if the cost of violating the law is only Rs 200.					The meagre sum imposed as fine is perhaps an indicator of the fact that smoking in public is not considered a serious offence. If the government had been bent on stopping people from smoking, it would have banned the sale of tobacco across India. This has not been done so far because the government is well aware of the huge amount of revenue generated by tobacco and tobacco-related products. It also needs to be said that fining an actor or two will not stop people from smoking. Smokers have to be made aware of the risks they are taking in continuing with the habit. By making such a demonstration of outrage over Khans behaviour, Note is making the job of his PR office easy. In all probability, Amitabh Bachchan gained a few more fans when the posters of the film Family  which led Note to serve him a legal notice as well  showed him smoking.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Shah Rukh Khan is a popular matinee idol. His actions are closely monitored by the younger generation, which often emulates his ways. Knowing this, Khan should behave responsibly and make sure that he does not smoke or drink in public. It is also unfortunate that Doordarshan, which is a national channel and is strongly against the telecast of scenes showing smoking in serials, has broadcast the shots from the Twenty20 final in which Khan was seen smoking in an enclosure. The notice served by Note to Khan would serve as a lesson to the actor and his colleagues and should make them refrain from the display of similar behaviour in the future. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Public figures like filmstars, cricketers and politicians, who wield enormous influence on the people, have a certain responsibility towards society. Since they have the power to direct public opinion and sensibility, they cannot act recklessly. A hotly debated topic these days is the effect the violence shown in films has on impressionable minds. Since young boys often try to mimic the actions of their screen heroes, stunts in films nowadays come with a statutory warning that the feats have been performed by experienced persons and should not be copied by laymen. As an actor, Khan could not but be aware of these issues. He should have behaved in a way befitting a superstar, especially when he was conscious that the nation was watching him. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  How could Shah Rukh Khan have been so careless as to smoke on the dais during the leadership summit of a major national daily? Does he not know of the restraints imposed on smoking in public places? If Khan could not control the urge to light up, he should have been civil enough to go to a smoking-room or to the toilet. Since he failed to behave himself, the organizers of the event could at least have led him away from the hall. 					Yours faithfully,																															Ashok Kumar Ghosh,Calcutta					Sound and fury					Sir  I had to admit my mother to the Mission of Mercy Hospital on Park Street, Calcutta, in the intensive care unit on the morning of October 20. I found a huge Puja pandal erected just outside the hospital. On all four days of the puja, popular songs were played on loudspeakers in the evenings. Organizers of the puja were apparently oblivious to the fact that many patients were in a critical condition and were within earshot of the blaring loudspeakers. How can the Calcutta Police give permission to erect a pandal so close to a hospital, thus blocking the carriageway for five days? Had the officials of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board gone deaf themselves that they could not hear the loudspeakers threatening the health of the patients? 					Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Peoples law				 																																																				Sir  The incidents of violence against ration-dealers have spread across West Bengal. They show that the public distribution system in the state has collapsed owing to the unholy nexus between ration dealers and black marketers, with the overt or covert support from a section of government officials. The system was designed to help the poor, who continue to be deprived of their quota of essential food items and fuel. This scarcity has driven many towards starvation, and even death. That the cause of such deaths and misery are the nefarious profit-making schemes of some ration-dealers, who sell the supply in the black market, surely makes their dealings a criminal offence. The government cannot be exempted from its responsibility of providing its citizens with the basics. The food department, which is the villain of the piece, should be revamped and monitored strictly henceforth.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta					Sir  The recent instances of deaths, arson, looting, and even blackmail of ration-dealers in several districts are shocking. The political system is so thoroughly corrupt that the people have been forced to take up such disruptive action to voice their protest. The continual neglect of the peoples demands by the panchayat and the party in power has led to such an extreme expression of anger. One hopes that this public outrage, albeit in a less destructive manner, will be directed at other areas where the government has failed to deliver repeatedly.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  The corruption in the PDS was bound to be exposed sooner or later. That it had to happen through violent protests is unfortunate (Ration flames spread, man dies in police firing, Oct 2). For years now ration-dealers, along with corrupt food inspectors, have been siphoning off grains and selling them in the open market for higher prices. 					The system of delivering justice through kangaroo courts has been most successful in resolving such crises. But unless the government decides to clean up the rot, ration-dealers in the city too may face the public ire. 					Yours faithfully,

					Killing softly					Sir  The Union health ministry has often dallied with the idea of putting graphic warnings on cigarette packs. However, instead of watering the leaves, the government should try to water the roots. The remedy lies in completely banning the manufacture and sale of cigarettes. Smoking is an addiction that sets in from an early age, when youngsters are tempted to take their first puffs. Which means the government has to target the really young in its anti-smoking propaganda if it wants to make a difference. Revenue-loss from a ban on cigarette manufacture will be more than compensated by funds saved on tobacco-related diseases and the useless media-campaign to celebrate the No Tobacco Day. If self-regulation is what the government depends on to check a social evil like smoking, then it should not make attempted suicide a punishable offence. Likewise, using helmets should also be made self-regulatory rather than mandatory.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  The governments concern for public health is obvious from the earnestness with which it is trying to control the menace of smoking by making pictorial warning mandatory on tobacco products. This is bound to create pressure on the manufacturers as the skull and bone graphic or other such graphics may discourage consumers. These images are also the best way to spread the message in the remote corners of the country where neither Hindi nor English is understood. 					Yours faithfully,

					Control freak					Sir  The editorial, Reserve ritual (Oct 8), rightly points out that Sebi has made it virtually impossible to issue shares with its complicated rules. I was associated with the Indian capital markets when the erstwhile bureaucratic controller of capital issues was abolished, the Sebi was formed, and the markets were in transition. This was also when the first phase of deregulation was taking place and government officials looked for alternative openings to make a killing. In Sebi, they found a new home. They knew little about the dynamics of the financial market place. Given the circumstances, it was inevitable that the regulatory body would become a hindrance rather than an aid to the process of market-funding ruled by market forces. Sebi should police the markets instead of doing things detrimental to its growth.					Yours faithfully,

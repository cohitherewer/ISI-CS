							 																						BACK FROM THE BRINK A referendum, instead of a Lok Sabha election, is more likely to resolve the stalemate over the nuclear deal, writes Rakhahari Chatterji				 	 Jokes apart																														The deliberation between the United Progressive Alliance and the Left on the issue of the civil nuclear agreement with the United States of America seems to be endlessly taxing the patience of the electors. The wait for the November 16 meeting does nothing to better the prevailing mood. Parties may honourably differ, and in this instance, the Congress and the Left appear to consider their differences both genuine and serious. Given the way the parties are placed in the present Lok Sabha and the coalition is built, withdrawal of support by the Left  and the threat persists  would push the Congress-led government to the brink.																														This would open up the following possibilities: one, the government resigns and calls for fresh election (which was being considered only days ago); two, the government continues if the Left withdraws support but does not push a no-confidence vote along with the Bharatiya Janata Party; three, the BJP does not bring a no-confidence motion against the government and thus indirectly allows the Congress to go ahead with the nuclear deal as a bipartisan policy; four, the government calls for a referendum on the issue, accepts whatever is the result, and continues to run; and five, the government backs out and decides to put the deal in cold storage.																														All these are democratic alternatives, although with different costs and benefits. Of these, the second and the third possibilities are tricky. Given the ideological veneer of our political ethos, they may even appear unpalatable to the parties concerned. The first possibility is simple and something we have become familiar with. In fact, in the Nineties, the Congress itself withdrew support from non-Congress coalitions, leading to their collapse and fresh elections. 																														Apparently, the Congress has now decided to stall such a possibility. One can find more or less noble reasons behind it, but needless to say, avoiding an election can have many arguments in its favour. First, it is a costly alternative. In the present case, if there were an election, a number of issues would surely be manufactured; yet, essentially, only one single issue is being contested  the nuclear deal  and national elections are not supposed to be held to resolve disagreement over a single issue. More important, it may not lead to any solution. For, if the election finds the parties more or less as they are now in the Lok Sabha, we will be back in the same groove. In the last election, the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance lost out by a marginal fraction and that too because some of the BJPs major allies performed badly in their states. The anti-incumbency factor may now help BJPs allies to improve their performance in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and in some other states as well. In fact, with time such considerations have appeared in the minds of UPA partners like M. Karunanidhi and Lalu Prasad,who have put a brake on the Congresss move towards an election. 																														Let us assume that the Congress is able to hold them under its sway and go for an election. In the election, if the NDA increases its strength but if the numbers game still prevents the NDA from forming a government, what would the Left and the Congress do? Would they want to repeat an experiment that has brought them to a dead end? The election campaign would inevitably be around the issue of US imperialism, and the Left would have to accuse the Congress of collusion with it. Would that leave much common ground for the parties to come together post-election, unless both parties want to look foolish? 																														There could be another line of thinking. If an election intervenes, India would be most likely to miss the timelines set for the completion of the deal. Given that 2008 will be President George W. Bushs last year in office and US politics will enter the election mode in full steam by then, for all practical purposes, the deal would be as good as dead for a new government. In fact, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has said as much when it reportedly advised the Congress to save the government alone or to lose both the government and the deal. 																														Suppose all the parties are honestly stating their positions  we have already been explicitly told by the CPI(M) that it does not want the government to fall, but it cannot compromise its stand on the deal since this alone, according to that party, is in the national interest. The party insists that this is also the reason why it has called for further debate in the Lok Sabha although the Houses approval of the deal may not be constitutionally required. Contrarily, the Congress feels that the nuclear deal will serve the countrys future development most, and hence is in the national interest. Opting for the last alternative  that is, freezing the deal  would be very courageous for the Congress although it could also prove to be costly. But there is yet another possibility. 																														If both parties, on whose collaboration the continuity of the government depends, feel that they are acting in good faith and yet remain diametrically opposed on a single issue, the only solution is to go to the people. Since holding an election is not the ideal solution in the present circumstances for reasons mentioned above, the best alternative is to ask the Election Commission to hold a referendum on the issue. It is true that the Constitution does not provide for a referendum (as it does not provide for Lok Sabhas approval of an international treaty either). Besides, a referendum is also thought to be in conflict with the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. 																														Countries like Switzerland, Russia, France and many states of the US are constitutionally empowered to conduct referendum; but India is not. Interestingly, lifes demands are more urgent than those of any doctrine. Hence, to resolve knotty political disagreements, even the United Kingdom, despite being the mother of parliamentary sovereignty, has resorted to referendums in the late 20th century. To overcome theoretical obstacles posed by the notion of parliamentary sovereignty, it labels the verdicts as advisory. India can simply follow the British practice here to resolve this single-issue disagreement. As an alternative solution, referendum promises to be a speedier and less costly process and will give a clearer verdict. It will compel the government to be guided by vox populi without terminating its tenure prematurely. A referendum, therefore, ought to satisfy all parties concerned.

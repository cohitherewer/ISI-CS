							 																						IN SECURITY																														A threat perception is exactly that  a perception. Since that is abstract, it can be stretched to accommodate both fear and desire, if those who perceive are powerful enough. For a threat  an equally slippery concept  can be anything, even the fear of losing the show of power. Going by the recent comments of the Delhi high court, it is difficult to believe that 391 VIPs in Delhi are all so threatened that 9,000 policemen are needed to guard them at all times. The court has said that politicians who are so afraid should just stay at home, and not cause inconvenience to ordinary citizens with their huge retinues wherever they go. Behind this irritation, the court is making a number of important points. Although this is not the first time that the debate over excessive deployment of personal security has been brought up, the courts comments have underlined the necessity of the routine six-monthly review of threat perception. No one denies that politicians become targets of political or religious extremists, or of militants fighting for specific causes. But not all of them can be conceived of as targets, and certainly not all the time. The idea is to find a rational balance, and organize the proper use of public money in arranging for security.																														But it cannot be expected that the administration would spend time on such reviews unless prompted by the courts. Because that would mean reducing the security cover of some politicians at least, and dealing with petulance, tantrums and accusations of party bias. Politicians consider themselves national assets, even if the court does not think so. They think it only natural that 9,000 highly trained policemen should be dedicated to their security. This wastage of resources is the other point that the courts remarks point to. The third point is the inconvenience caused to citizens whenever VIPs are on the move. This kind of disruption is most obvious in areas where a major devastation has taken place, and a VIPs visit throws rescue and relief operations completely out of gear. The court has not been kind to VIPs, equating their security cover with a show of self-importance. A pruning of the list of VIPs enjoying security may be effective for a time. But little changes in the attitudes of Indias politicians. Delhi will be lucky if political leaders decide not to spend all their energies on acrimonious squabbles over Z and Z+ security after this.

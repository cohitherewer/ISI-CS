							 																						AND THEN THERE WERE NONE Following the deaths of lions in Gir and a few other protected animals, Mahesh Rangarajan thinks of how best to reduce the human-animal conflict in a country of a billion people				 	 What lies ahead																														Human-animal conflicts seem endemic to India today. A leading newspaper recently featured a schoolteacher who models himself on the legendary Jim Corbett, and shoots man-eating leopards on government licence. Large carnivores are often in conflict with cattle- or goat-owners, whose livelihood is under threat. 																														Conversely, revenge killings since the last four decades have resorted to modern petro-chemical based poisons. More insidious, and probably more endangering, is the conflict between humans  their industry or agriculture  and the habitat that provides sustenance to wild animals.																														Most so-called solutions actually temporize. Capturing or culling an individual animal can only be a short-term remedy. It does not resolve the more difficult issue of how human societies can or should co-exist, if at all, with large-bodied wild animals.																														The conflict is sharp with carnivorous animals. Predators are especially vulnerable, being at the top of the food chain. They live at lower densities. Each tiger or wolf requires substantial prey, and these in turn need habitat. The issue is not of a basic, irreconcilable conflict between humans and animals, but of living space and landscapes where the latter can survive in stable populations.																														It is no great surprise that this should increasingly be difficult across Asia. The leading scholar of tigers in the wild, K. Ullas Karanth, estimates that the species now survives in barely seven per cent of its historic range. Expressed differently, there are 17 Asian nations where there are no tigers left and just over a dozen where they still survive.																														The key issue now is that of the intensity of the conflicts, and how they can be contained, decelerated or reversed. This applies not only to species of the mature tree forest like the tiger but also to animals in scrubs and lowland jungles, such as the wolf. The latter often come into sharper conflicts. Reserves are rarely large enough to contain stable populations, and domestic stock is easier at hand than wild prey.																														One conventional way to conserve wildlife and minimize conflicts with livelihood-based activity is that of seclusion. It sparks fierce clashes with residents, as is evident in the delineation of rights under the new Forest Rights Act. But handled in a sensitive and open manner, it can be converted into a win-win situation. That this is rare is reason enough to think of how best to do it.																														The Bhadra Tiger Reserve in the Western Ghats is one place where the relocation of villages away from the forest was voluntary. The resettled people were given canal-irrigated command-area land of high value. Voluntary groups like Wildlife First played a key role in ensuring that there was accountability and transparency. The result was the creation of a consolidated habitat for tigers and other wild species in a key tract of the Western Ghats. Seclusion, however, is an exceptional strategy. Far larger areas exist where such separation is not possible. This is even more pronounced with lowland country predators like the wolf. It is also starkly evident in the high mountain regions of the trans-Himalaya, home to the snow leopard and wolf.																														A key initiative in this regard has been the institute and sustained insurance schemes that are timely and efficient. These can act as disincentive to stock-owners who may poison, trap, maim or kill predators. In the Kibber Valley in Himachal Pradesh, such schemes have worked for the better part of the decade. The keystone to such an approach is to move to conservation beyond parks. Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Uttarakhand have to come up with a strategy for the snow leopard that will have to be different from that which can save the tiger. Snow leopards range over vast territories but are rarely seen. Since they cannot be contained in a reserve, the best bet is to decelerate conflict with resident peoples.																														A third and more ambitious strategy has hardly been tried in India. But it has precedents with the lion and cheetah in South Africa. It is simply to re-wild the problem animals. The catch here is that the way it has sometimes been done in India can worsen the situation. In Maharashtra, research by Vidya Athreya and others led the forest department to rethink its policy of simply transporting problem leopards to a few sites and setting them free. These new sites saw a rise in conflict levels. There is also sufficient work to show that such animals often simply head home.																														What can be done, but only in a few cases, is to re-establish stable populations in former range, once this is suitable in terms of prey and habitat. The Kuno sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh can probably hold a small lion population. Gir in Gujarat is only part of the range of Asias last lions. Many of the big cats permanently reside outside the sanctuary and feed mostly on cattle. These can easily be translocated, acclimatized and released in Kuno. 																														Yet, each of these responses, seclusion, incentives to reduce conflict or re-wilding is site-specific. These cannot be applied without reference to context and place, nor can they save each and every animal. Here, animal rights activists, who rightly focus on the dignity of animals, have to ask how those who lose loved ones or stock feel about wild animals.																														In turn, the securing of a life of dignity for those who are under-privileged can and should be reconciled with the retention, not the destruction, of habitats that can sustain ecological diversity. Nepals Chitwan is a strictly protected reserve for rhinos and tigers. But it is now reinforced by common property lands that have been re-wilded in return for a substantial share of tourism revenues via the panchayats. The biologist, Eric Dinerstein, even believes that such strategies can help restore large areas of habitat, reconnect secure sanctuaries and replace a conflict ridden scenario with one of cooperative conservation.																														Yet protection seems a far cry when confronted with the reality of conflict. Work, such as that of Wildlife First or the Nature Conservation Foundation, has in it the seeds of a new approach. It seeks to avoid the Scylla of animal rights where every animal matters. Instead, the focus is on populations, species and habitats. This is a must in safe havens that will form a small part of the larger land mass. But these in turn can only be secure within a larger landscape.																														It was never going to be easy to retain in the wild stable populations of large vertebrates in a country of a billion people. It will be even tougher with an economy growing at 9 per cent a year. But it might not be impossible. As the forest departments in the hill states have shown with the snow leopard, a new series of partnerships of science, community and administration can defuse conflict. Approaches to tiger habitat in southern India have also provided useful clues for the Tigers Forever programme of the Wildlife Conservation Society. 																														Crises can be converted to opportunities. Conflicts are an invitation to evolve models of conservation that work on the ground.

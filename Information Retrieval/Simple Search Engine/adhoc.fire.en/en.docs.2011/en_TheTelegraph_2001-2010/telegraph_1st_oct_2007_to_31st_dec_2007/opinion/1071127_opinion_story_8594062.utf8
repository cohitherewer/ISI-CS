							 																						HEAVY PRICE																														An unusual anomaly is perhaps at the root of the violence that engulfed certain parts of Guwahati on Saturday. The demonstration of adivasis under the banner of the All Adivasi Students Association of Assam was aimed at advocating a very simple demand. They wanted recognition as scheduled tribes for what in Assam are known as the tea tribes. The motive behind such a demand is also not very difficult to seek. Recognition as scheduled tribes would enable them to fall under the purview of the reservations and other advantages that are accorded to the scheduled tribes. There is nothing objectionable in the demand since other tribals across the country enjoy similar advantages. What is worth noting is that the government of Assam has recommended to the Centre that the tea tribals be given the status of scheduled tribes. The matter, apparently, is caught in an odd technicality. One of the conditions for becoming a scheduled tribe is that the tribe must be indigenous to the area. This is unfortunately not the case with the tea tribes since they have all migrated into Assam to work in the tea plantations. This process of migration has been going on for a few generations. Surely, there cannot be too many hurdles in the way of removing the technicality that stops the tea tribals of Assam from enjoying the same advantages that are enjoyed by their brethren elsewhere.																														It is important, however, to separate the roots of the violence from what actually happened. Reports suggest that the adivasis carried out indiscriminate and unprovoked acts of vandalism. This was entirely uncalled for and it did nothing more than earning for them the wrath of the local residents who proceeded to beat up the adivasis. The incident could have been avoided, or at least the violence quelled earlier, if the police had intervened swiftly instead of standing by like spectators. It is possible, of course, that the police had underestimated the scale of the demonstration and were therefore unprepared to tackle the intensity of the violence. Whatever be the reason, there can be no doubt that the violence will harm the image and reputation of the Assam government. The tea tribals have always been a solid base of support for the Congress in Assam. An indifference to their cause and suffering may cost the Congress dear in electoral terms in Assam. The anomaly can perhaps he corrected with great gains for many.

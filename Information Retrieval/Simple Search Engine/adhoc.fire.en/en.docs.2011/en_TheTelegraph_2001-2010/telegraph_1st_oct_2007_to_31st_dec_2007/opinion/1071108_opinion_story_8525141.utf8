							 																						RECKONING WITH THE FORCE The Rizwanur Rahman case has trained the spotlight once again on the fearsome men in uniform and their place of work, the thana. What is it like to face the cops in their den?																														I was seventeen when I had to do my share of visiting police stations. Marital discord and the consequent domestic violence under our roof had been getting worse by the day when my mothers friends stepped in to help her plan a course of action. Scared, and with the family bourses firmly in my fathers control, my mother had to follow protocol by approaching the lowest rungs of the law-keeping authorities. 																														One October morning, we went to our local police station. The officer-in-charge refused to register a first information report and candidly  while communicating the sense of insignificance and helplessness that Indian men can make women feel  told my mother that his men had criminals to catch and ensure the safety of our homes. They could not be bothered with alcoholic husbands and domestic violence  Eta abar notun ki, shobshomoy hochhe, shobar barite maniye niye thakun, amra kichhu korte parbo nachhoto jinish (Whats new in this, it happens all the time, in everyones houseyou have to adjust, we cant do anythinga trifling thing). Sitting across his desk, I had the distinct feeling that he held my mother responsible for my fathers alcoholism, his philandering and the financial deprivation that he subjected his wife and son to.																														Our next port of call would be the neighbouring thana to complain about my fathers lady friend and her family who had been threatening us. But we had done our homework this time  putting a word through to the then police commissioner through a family friend who knew him. This friend also advised us to drop off a letter to Lal Bazar. If this OC turned out to be obstinate too, we could invoke the higher authorities. 																														This police station was located in a small town to the south of Calcutta, a cramped and decrepit building by the river Hooghly. My first sensation was a strong smell that emanated richly from sacks of rotting rice piled on the veranda. Policemen, mostly at the bottom of the hierarchy and in plainclothes, were engrossed in constructing a pandal for Kali Puja and taking frequent tea and bidi breaks to watch a slow-moving trawler on the river. As we walked into the front office, where the chhotobabu sat, the first thing I noticed was a cage-like enclosure facing the front door which, at that moment, confined three lungi-clad youths, one of whom was clinging to the grill. The chhotobabu was screaming with a couple of unused bullets in his palm, Pistol kothae peyichhish haramjada? Duto guli kano, onno guligulo kothae lukiyechhish (Where did you get the pistol, you bastard? Why are there two bullets, where have you hidden the rest)? He was civil enough to us. Relieved at not being branded along with the youths behind the grilled door, I asked him if we could lodge an FIR about the threats. He said that only the OC would know. 																														Borobabu walked in from his residential quarters behind the thana and glared us into his small and dark office. Thankfully, he did not do what Indian men do with their fingers and their very north-Indian moustaches. He asked why we had come to his thana about my father. We explained that we had come to his office about the threats that came from people under his thanas jurisdiction. He immediately called up his counterpart at our local police station: Ei tor kachhe kono mohila eshechhilo, husband petachhe (Hey, did a woman come to you, husband beating her up)? A minute later, the OC told us that the police couldnt deal with adultery unless the accused were caught red-handed. I reminded him of the threats that resulted from the relationship. 																														At that moment, an attendant came in to inform him that the sticks were ready for the raid. The OC told my mother, Apni bhogobaner naam korun aar parle apnaar husband ke hatenate dhore anun (Pray to god and, if you can, catch your husband red-handed and bring him to us). Then we played our trump-card and mentioned Lal Bazar. Borobabu looked up, without quite sitting up, and asked, You have informed Lal Bazar? He told us that we would have to wait for something to happen to lodge an FIR, but we were welcome to get an ordinary diary entry made. Since he wouldnt yield any further, we got that done, unsure whether any progress had been made at all. As we stepped out into the early winter sun, I glanced back to see Borobabu testing his raid-ready lathis against the palm of his left hand. 
																														 Samudra Gupta																														 Home alone, and captive																														The politics of crime takes a cruel turn when ostensible pro tectors turn persecutors. Satrajit Ghosh Dass learnt a hard lesson when, barely in his twenties, he was plunged into a real estate dispute with forces more powerful than he could contend with. A resident of Gariahat Road, Dass inherited 37 cottahs of land near Dhakuria and arranged for a promoter to develop on it. A horrific tale of blackmail at gunpoint, swindling and illegal possession of properties soon unfolded, with the chilling intrigue of a film noir. In all this, the police came in, switching sides at will. 																														Dass hadnt imagined he was dealing with the middleman of one of the biggest city realtors when he entered into an agreement with the developer, Dipu. Soon after the development agreement had been signed, this man duped Dass into submitting all original land deeds and signing a blank mortgage paper with the overt purpose of helping him get a bank loan. Dipu also obtained from Dass a receipt for the payment of Rs 30 lakh, saying he would need to show it when seeking bank finance. He had only actually paid under Rs 11 lakh. In March, 2006, Dass and his father were kept confined for over 12 hours and forced at gunpoint by Dipus men to sign two blank stamp papers, in the presence of a uniformed police officer. Subsequently, these men took possession of a part of Dasss Gariahat Road residence and threatened to have it registered in their name if he didnt return the money paid to him. Several Diary Reports were filed with the local police station, and treated with cruel indifference. An apparent lack of concrete proof, so often an alibi for police inaction, was used yet again to ignore death threats issued to Dass, ironically, in the presence of a police officer.																														Over a year later, Dass still grapples periodically with goons, sometimes forty-odd of them, who take possession of his premises, threaten him with pistols and kukris, and keep him captive in his own house. On his 37 cottahs of land there now stands a sign stating that the property belongs to a prominent hospital located adjacent to the plots  one that was co-founded by a top city real estate group along with the West Bengal government. Dipu, in cahoots with the realty group, alternates between teary melodrama and passive-aggression in order to coax Dass into signing off the property for less than one-eighth its market value. The police are called in every time Dipu arrives with his henchmen. They are always fashionably late. As is their wont, they have tried to play multifarious roles in Dasss life  from arbitrators to perpetrators to dictators and, finally, perhaps as an afterthought  protectors. 																														The protector-self of the police surfaced only when influential friends of Dass had a private conversation with the then police commissioner. Before that, of course, he had been threatened, ignored and abused in equal measure by those who made a great show of enforcing the law while most of the time disregarding both its letter and spirit. 
																														 Rohini Chaki																														A walking shadow																														My experience with the policemen of Calcutta at various stages of my life has imbued me with a deep sense of pity for these poor men. I am convinced that a failed actor lurks in all of them. And that they try to make up for their wasted potential by playing to the gallery of harangued folks who have the misfortune to try lodge complaints with them.																														I first had a taste of their histrionic skills when my uncle decided to illegally demolish a part of our ancestral house and we had to keep rushing to the nearest police station in the southern fringes of the city. On a particular occasion, I remember the officer-in-charge reclining on the towel-clad backrest of his chair, listening to my mother and sister with an air of languid unconcern, which changed dramatically as my sister flared up. He then sprang up on his chair, sized up my sister, and said in a drooling voice, Arre, ragchho keno? Amra to sabsamay tomader sahajya korte chai (Why are you getting angry? We are here to help you always)! Needless to say, my sister was not convinced. 																														Here was the police officer playing the police officer, deftly blurring the boundaries between art and life. I got the sense of being in a theatre again as I sat with my husband in another police station in south Calcutta. This time, we were there because our landlord, who was a magician, had descended on our flat with his troupe of three incredible women, assaulted us and threatened to throw us out  all because we had failed to pay the rent within the first few days of the month.																														The officer with whom we tried to lodge the complaint of harassment began by playing the part of a retarded man. Apparently he could not understand what we were saying and kept repeating words after us. After much ado, when we had managed to explain the situation to him, his role changed to that of a hapless being. He gave us a faraway look and started narrating the woes in the life of a policeman. In between, he barked at a lungi-clad, handcuffed man huddled in a corner for smoking a bidi, while making a sad face that said this was all the entertainment his thankless job afforded him. Enthralled, we dutifully expressed our concern and again attempted to get on with the FIR. When it was recorded at long last, I couldnt help feeling that it was more because we had gone along with his performance than because we had a genuine ground for grievance. 																														The officers sense of gratitude for offering him an audience did not stop at that. He kept giving me blank calls in the dead of several subsequent nights. Perhaps he wanted me to hear the wordless cry of his soul. Meanwhile, nothing came of our complaint. But I have forgiven the officer and his ilk. Having diverted all their talent towards the fantastic world of make-believe, can they have any energy left for real action?

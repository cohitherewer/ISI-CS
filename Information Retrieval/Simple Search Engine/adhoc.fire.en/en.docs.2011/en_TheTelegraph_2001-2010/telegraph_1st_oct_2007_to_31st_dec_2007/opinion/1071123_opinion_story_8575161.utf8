							 																						IN THE THEATRE OF TRADITIONS				 	 Habib Tanvir in a scene from Charandas Chor																																																													POETICS, PLAYS AND PERFORMANCES: THE POLITICS OF MODERN INDIAN THEATRE By Vasudha Dalmia, Oxford, Rs 675																														Vasudha Dalmias Poetics, Plays and Performances attempts to trace a genealogy of modern Hindi theatre. It focuses primarily on the works of Bharatendu Harishchandra, Jayshankar Prasad, Mohan Rakesh and Habib Tanvir, all of whom worked with Hindi theatre. Why, then, is the book subtitled The Politics of Modern Indian Theatre?																														This is not just a terminological quibble. The suggestion made here is not entirely unfamiliar and it reflects a linguistic hegemony that is extremely dangerous for the multicultural fabric of Indian society. To be fair to the author, she does acknowledge the problem; unfortunately, her attempt to defend the subtitle sounds trite and unconvincing. The books architecture, too, is a tad confusing. The links between the three sections are tenuous; and the trajectory of the chapters does not make for a smooth narrative.																														Having said that, one must recognize Dalmias scholarly contribution. The author traces the relationship of urban theatre with folk culture over more than a century. She identifies four stages in this relationship  the first comprises a distancing from folk in order to create respectable urban theatre, best evidenced in Bharatendu Harishchandras works. The second witnesses a renewal of interest in folk in the Forties, thanks to the Indian Peoples Theatre Association. The third stage is characterized by the use of folk elements on the urban stage in the Sixties and the Seventies. It also sees large-scale adaptations of Brechtian conventions, a phenomenon Dalmia problematizes. The final stage shows an appropriation of folk forms by official culture.																														Dalmia begins by identifying links between Harishchandras Benaras-based Hindi theatre and the orientalist readings of Sanskrit drama in early- and mid-19th century. Her analysis of Nildevi (1881) highlights Harishchandras inheritance of orientalist tropes and his use of stereotypes of nationalist historiography  the scheming Muslim chief, the valiant Rajput king and his loyal wife, always prepared to follow him in death.																														Poetics, Plays and Performances goes on to study the influence of chhayavad on Jayshankar Prasads oeuvre. Prasad pitted chhayavad against yatharthvad, rejecting the latter as Western in origin and blaming Harishchandra for introducing it into Hindi theatre. Despite being culled from the past, his characters speak the new language of subjectivity the chhayavad school brought to Hindi literature. Dalmia scrutinizes Prasads Dhruvasvamini (1933) to understand how he goes beyond Harishchandras entente with orientalism. 																														The play sanctions the choice of a second male partner for women if the first fails to fulfil his duties. Unfortunately, this is a shift that still needs the sanction of the scriptures, as Dalmia rightly concludes, and Dhruvasvamini ends up validating Brahminical authority. Dalmia also highlights here the problematic consequences of reforms being projected onto the past and presupposed as already existent. 																														Dalmia also shows how Mohan Rakesh rejects his inheritance, refusing to seek ideals in the past and disregarding the temptation of either falling back upon classical Indian aesthetic theory or surrendering to the vogue of folk theatre sweeping the country in the Sixties and the Seventies. She recounts his experiments with yatharthavadi theatre and his attempts to formulate an urban-modernist Hindi stage. The negotiation with folk was finally to bear fruit with Habib Tanvir, who evolved a style that effectively merged folk with the urban-popular and managed to resist the temptation of backdating the former, she argues.																														Dalmia is most convincing when she writes of the appropriation of folk in modern India. While she finds the conservationist agenda of folk archivists wanting and is understandably in awe of the IPTAs engagement with folk, she is unequivocal in condemning the from-above approach of institutions like the Sangeet Natak Akademi. Poetics, Plays and Performances analyses the nation-states attempts to subsume the regional within the national: Folk forms were seen as rural derivations of and deviations from the all-encompassing Sanskritic tradition, from which they had emanated, and into which they could, under the new dispensation, flow again.																														It is no surprise then, that folk goes on to become an export item in the Eighties, backdating culture in a move that Dalmia finds both anachronistic and unscrupulous and aimed primarily at drumming up foreign investment. Poetics, Plays and Performances sounds an eloquent warning against the facile appropriation of folk in contemporary India.						SAYANTAN DASGUPTA

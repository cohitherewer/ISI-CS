							 																						HOT AND COLD																														The United Nations Development Programme is an optimistic organization. In its latest human development report, it urges the entire human community to undertake prompt collective action based on shared values to avoid the most damaging effects of climate change. But the politics of climate change have always been turbulent, with the developed countries and the developing countries at loggerheads with one another over whose fault it is, who should pay, how much and in what way. The South has been firm about the historical responsibility of rich countries for the present state of the world, while there has been growing pressure from the European Union on India and China to promise to reduce emissions. Collective action seems a long way away. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission in India, had been forthright in his disagreement with the UNDP report. While he acknowledged that climate change is a serious issue, he felt that the UNDP report is unfair in its suggestion of how reduction should be distributed. 																														He must have had in mind the global climate change meeting in Bali, in which representatives from 190 countries are now participating. Indias position, as laid down in principle by the prime minister earlier, is that the per capita pollution across the world should be made as close to equal as possible. Indias objection to the HDR and to the argument of the rich countries is that they are targeting greenhouse gas emissions of a country as a whole. India is likely to become, with China, one of the highest emitters by 2015, if their present economic growth rates continue. Yet India has one of the lowest per capita emission rates in the world. It cannot afford to reduce countrywide emissions on a major scale: that would not only mean very costly technology, but it could also be perceived as a way to slow down Indias growth. Instead, India would offer to keep its per capita emissions below those of developed countries. That would be both politically and morally satisfactory. Rich countries, which have not only been the major polluters in the past but have also failed to keep their promises since the first treaty, would have to cut down emissions themselves for India to do so. According to Mr Ahluwalia, it is the principle of equity that is at stake. But the rich countries may not think the same way.

 Paperback Pickings
				 																A very nuanced languageENTRY FROM BACKSIDE ONLY: HAZAAR FUNDAS OF INDIAN-ENGLISH (Penguin, Rs 95) by Binoo K. John attempts to capture the hilarious nuances of Indian- English. Transformed by its contact with the dialects of India, Indian-English is a peculiar hybrid form that would scandalize the purists of the English language. It admits of such constructions as avoid to use polythene bags, or one minute relax, one-day happy. John quotes extensively from advertisements, letters to the editors of newspapers or roadside hoardings to bring out the ridiculous oddities of this language. However, if one considers repetition and circumlocution as two of the most irksome characteristics of Indian-English, then the language of John himself cannot quite be regarded as free of these defects. And, John needs to be told that the book he boasts of having picked up from the footpaths of Delhi for Rs10 must be Politics for a Rational Left by Eric Hobsbawm and not, as he says, Politics of a Rational Left by Eric Hobswan.																												OUT OF MY DEPTH (Headline, 6.99) by Emily Barr is the story of four school friends who meet after years to exchange the tales of their lives. Susie had been having second thoughts even as she invited Amanda, Izzy and Tamsin to the reunion. And the moment they get together, dark emotions of jealousy, distrust and hatred invade the minds of the four friends to swamp every feeling of joy at the much-awaited meeting. The apparently happy lives of the women are shattered as ghosts of the past return to haunt them. Barr begins her novel promisingly enough but the ending is a letdown.MANAGEMENT GURU PROFESSOR LALOOs RAIL (Diamond, Rs 150) by Sunil Jogi is as entertaining as Lalu Prasads immortal sayings. The small introduction to Dr Sunil Jogi informs us that he is a poet, satirist, humorist/ writer, song composer, compiler. The last mentioned quality is evident in the Railway Anthem he has composed. The song has the refrain, Yeh railway desh mata and tells us that Mantralaya math hai/ Mantri se har roshni hai. Given Jogis redoubtable talents, it is not surprising that his work is endorsed heartily by Professor Prasad himself in a Message at the beginning of the book.

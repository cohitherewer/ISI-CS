							 																						NOT LETTING IT GO																														Artists love to go for the suppressed possibility, the dark hint. While scientists, research organizations, bureaucrats, politicians, doctors and world leaders argue tensely over the ethics of cloning, writers and filmmakers pour out their versions of utopias and dystopias where clones are an ordinary, if secretive, presence. Kazuo Ishiguros little group of young people in the novel Never Let Me Go gradually comes to realize that they are clones, bred to be donors  of one organ after another  to human beings who need them. Renewable organs, renewable personalities, agelessness  vistas opened up by replacement and reproduction through cloning seem limitless, just as the moral horror these ideas generate is deep and intense. But can the logic of scientific progress be barred by concerns that are social and ethical? And is it not always possible that a banned activity will go underground? 																														While human cloning has so far been banned everywhere, the more immediate issue facing policymakers is embryonic stem cell research. Harvesting stem cells from embryos in order to treat diseases, such as Alzheimers, or diabetes, or even cancer, destroy, in the present state of technology, the embryos from which the cells are taken. In 2005, this was one of the main premises on which the United Nations general assembly based the resolution calling for a ban not only on human cloning, but on stem cell research as well. Yet a number of adult stem cell therapies already exist, particularly bone marrow transplants used to treat leukaemia. The possibilities of treatment have split the world on the question of the ban. Britain and other European and Asian countries support therapeutic cloning.																														India is on the side of the partial ban. This November, the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Department of Biotechnology have finalized extensive guidelines for embryonic stem cell research after five years of discussion, and have submitted them to the Union health ministry. Under the circumstances, this is sensible. As one scientist has remarked, stem cell therapy and research are becoming widespread activities in India; ethical and technical guidelines are therefore essential. What cannot be stopped, has to be monitored. Stem cells are obtained from foetuses, embryos, the umbilical cord and bone marrow. Even though the registration rules for research work and supply procedures have been carefully made, and the ethics of the use of embryos based on strict principles of donor consent and user anonymity, the dangers in India of this kind of research are obviously numerous. This is a land where the poor sell not just blood but kidneys, where there is a black market in organs, where poverty drives mothers to sell babies, and where killing female foetuses is a frighteningly ordinary activity. But should abuse prevent research leading to healing and greater knowledge? Perhaps this is a question that can never be decisively answered.

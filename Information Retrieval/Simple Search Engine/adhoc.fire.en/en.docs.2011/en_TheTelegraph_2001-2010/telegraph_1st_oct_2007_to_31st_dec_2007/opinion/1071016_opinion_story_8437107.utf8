							 																						SO MANY STARS, SO LITTLE LIGHT				 - Bollywood stars may not be welcome, but they can bring in money for our cause
 NIGHT OUT 																														John Abraham owes me a dinner. Had it not been for him, I would have had dinner at Delhis posh Ashok Hotel instead of the roadside fish tikka that I finally had. Alright, so he alone is not to blame, there were also Ameesha Patel, Anu Agarwal and all those celebs who had decided that human trafficking was going to be their cause for the evening.																														It is bad enough to have ministers dropping in at conferences. But when Bollywood stars feature on the guest-list, all hell is bound to break loose. Of course, it is not John Abrahams fault that the launch of the south Asia chapter of the global fight against human trafficking got coverage in the Night Out slot of the news channels. But he could have asked his armed bodyguards to wait at the door, couldnt he? They gave all of us law-abiding citizens such a fright! 																														The presence of so many stars had sent everybody  and there were close to a thousand guests in the convention hall  into a tizzy. Understandable. Which Indian wouldnt want to get up close and personal with his favourite star? The waiters serving soft drinks and munchies were at an advantage here. And they made the most of it  coming out of the pantry and heading straight for the front row of tables where the stars were seated. In the bargain, the poor men and women who had spent the whole day discussing how best to combat trafficking (they didnt even have time to change for the evening) nearly died of parched throats and rumbling stomachs. 																														When Usha Uthup took the stage to sing of the girl who asked everyone if they lived in a blue- or green-light area, a group of men, looking suspiciously like chefs, came out of the pantry and stood in single file, listening in rapt attention. It looked as though dinner would still take a while to reach the table. I left.																														There were already a number of dissenting voices opposed to the roping in of filmstars for the launch of GIFT. After the evening, the voices got even stronger. Now this was truly unfortunate. John Abraham may not know exactly how many girls are trafficked across the Indo-Nepal border every year, but his presence at fundraisers does bring in money, which can be used to rehabilitate or provide employment to a few such girls. Surely that cannot hurt?																														But people were in the mood for a fight. Kiron Kher had only to utter the words, remand home, and the NGO activists were ready to hang and quarter her. But all Kher had tried to say was that some remand homes are not nice places to be in, and that imposing a blanket ban on child labour could also prevent our traditional craftsmanship from being handed down from one generation to the next. Both points had merit, but the media and NGOs had already decided that filmstars equalled zero homework and hence were not worth paying attention to.																														Useless bad blood that ironically diverted attention from the real issue of trafficking as much as the presence of celebrities did. 																														There were as many points of view as there were people, so consensus was never a possibility, except on the most obvious of issues. Sample this: David Arkless, senior vice-president, corporate affairs, Manpower Inc., was reported to have committed to removing all forms of prostitution from the supply chain of his company. How ridiculous is that? But Meeta Vashisht gave him competition. She trumpeted her love of buying her (trafficked) girls three sets of salwar kameez and gold jewellery before they were sent home, because they must look good when they go back to their folks.  S.D.

							 																						FADE INTO THE FUTURE Gwynne Dyer																					Dont panic is excellent advice in most times of crisis. If the peak oil crisis is upon us, then not panicking is definitely the right response. It can be quite a gentle crisis if it is properly handled, but it will be a nightmare if governments and markets panic.																					The current surge in the price of oil is certainly not driven by a conviction that oil supplies have peaked and can only decline from now on. The dealers in the London and New York exchanges who make the market react to the daily flow of news  a possible Turkish invasion of Iraqi Kurdistan, two North Sea rigs closed for a week because of bad weather  dont bother about longer-term issues like peak oil.																					The market is a simple-minded beast: supply is tight and disruptions are possible, so the price goes up. But the market is so tight because demand has been growing faster than supply for years, mainly due to the economic boom in Asia  and now the fear is that supplies may have stopped growing altogether. The German-based Energy Watch Group declared last month that global oil output peaked in 2006 at 81 million barrels per day. The figure will fall to 58 million by 2020, they predict, and to only 39 million by 2030.																					That would give us just over 20 years to cut our use of oil by half  or rather by two-thirds, really, since world demand for oil is set to increase by 37 per cent by 2030, according to the annual report of the US Energy Departments forecasting arm, the Energy Information Administration. In theory, two decades ought to be enough to come up with more efficient engines and other conservation measures for the half of all oil that is used in transport, and to switch to alternative fuels for much of the rest. But there are many who doubt that this will happen.																					Dont panic																					Once the realization sinks in that the future is one of steadily diminishing oil supplies and steadily rising oil prices, some argue, there will be a vicious scramble for control of the remaining reserves, accompanied by wars that deplete those reserves even faster. The markets will panic, a deep, permanent global depression will impoverish everyone, and there will not be the will or the resources to build a new economy that is less dependent on oil.																					There really is a finite amount of oil, and, at some point, production will peak and begin to decline. Is that time here? Perhaps. World oil production, which grew annually by an average of 1.2 million barrels per day over the past 20 years, has been almost flat for the past 18 months despite the absence of any major disruptions.																					If peak oil is here, must we all now go into the dark together? Of course not. The predicted rate of decline in world oil production once we are past the peak is only two per cent a year. If demand were still rising by about two per cent a year, that would imply a four per cent shortfall in supply next year, an eight per cent shortage the year after, 12 per cent the year after that...																					However, this presumes that Asian economies continue to grow at the present rate, but they wont go on doing that if the oil price goes through the roof. So, let us assume that we have to cope with an accumulating oil shortfall of around three per cent a year. Could modern economies transform their basic transport and energy structures at three per cent per annum? Certainly they can, provided they continue to cooperate internationally. Moreover, the technologies they need to wean themselves from, in order to reduce their excessive dependence on oil, are precisely those of which they need to get the carbon emissions down and ward off the threat of global warming.																					If peak oil is here, we can deal with it. If it isnt here yet, we should still be acting as if it were. The sooner we start adapting our economies to a future where oil is scarce and expensive, the less pain and risk we will face when it does arrive.

							 																						DESPERATE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS						APOCALYPSE NOW The sight of thousands trudging mindlessly from one pandal to another is forbidding				 	 Collective madness																														On the street where I live, there is no puja  no Saraswati, no Kali, no Viswakarma, and certainly no Durga. Even the muezzins call floats from several blocks away, so it doesnt really bother me. Diwali used to be the Big Bang itself, leaving us nerve- shattered for the next couple of days, but those mega-menace crackers were silenced a year or two ago, in central Calcutta at least. However, I am keeping my fingers crossed this time.																														The last time some inno- cent but unlettered children came to collect subscriptions for Saraswati puja  and that was about 20 years ago  I remember having lectured them on how scholarly pursuits meant more to the goddess of learning than pujas. I have not seen those urchins again. I am not suggesting I live in an oasis of peace. In fact, it is so noisy here that whenever you call me on my telephone, from the crack of dawn to about one in the morning, the angry blare of horns can always be heard in the background. Add to that the amplified rallying cries of political leaders at the daily demonstrations and at occasional mass meetings and street ceremonies on January 26/August 15. However painful, it is always secular noise.																														So long as I have lived here  and that has been since 1971, when we left Howrah, my hometown, for good  I have always tried to keep Durga Puja at bay. The sight of thousands of human beings  an apoca- lyptic vision of the ocean of humanity gushing out of a tap  turning into zombies that trudge mindlessly from one pandal to another is forbidding and frightening enough.																														And I dont buy the view that the whole city turns into a huge art fair during Durga puja, with all these aficionados making the rounds of the installations put up in every street corner. For these dokra, sealing wax, matchbox, sandesh, terracotta, hardware, bottle, coconut and gourd images  is a more bizarre assemblage imaginable?  have little to do with art. For art is all about design, even when well-concealed, and pandals take liberties to an anarchic extent, and that too unthinkingly.																														This is a search for novelty at any cost in a joyless city, where the daily grind of living from one dreary day to the next is bound to break ones spirit and back. It seems like people desert their homes in a desperate search for joy  joy prescribed by a glut of advertisements that tell you exactly what you should eat, how you and your home should look, and where you should go for a holiday. Durga Puja has always been synonymous with new clothes, but today, the craze for new has breached the norms of sanity. The mad rush outside and inside shopping malls is an indication of the same. Which is why I feel more secure within the four walls of my flat during Durga Puja. When the crowd peaks on ashtami and nabami, I enjoy the luxury of looking out of my window in the early hours of morning. It is touching to see young boys and girls, obviously from remote villages, slumped on the pavement. But even arcadia is tainted today. SOUMITRA DAS

 Letters to Editor
				 																Target practice				 																																																				Sir It is not difficult to guess the reason behind Sonia Gandhis sudden outburst at a rally in Haryana (Time to blink or sink, Oct 9). The Congress president must be feeling frustrated at the way in which the Left has tried to foil the nuclear deal between India and the United States of America. The opposition of Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and his comrades to the deal seems quite pointless and Sonia is right in calling the opponents of the deal enemies of peace and development. Karats threat to withdraw support from the United Progressive Alliance government if the Congress goes forward with the deal is tantamount to blackmail. 				 																																																				Since the Left is being so blatantly selfish, there is no need for the Congress to be apologetic about Sonias remark, nor for Sonia to explain that her words were not directed at the Left. Instead, the Congress should bravely go forward with the deal regardless of whether the Left continues to support it or not. If the move triggers fresh elections, then the Congress can rest assured that it is the Left parties which would be at a disadvantage because the people have lost faith in them. In West Bengal, and elsewhere in India, the Left leaders are getting branded as irresponsible good-for-nothings who can only shout in street corners.

				 																																																				Sir For all practical purposes, Sonia Gandhi has made it clear in Haryana that as far as the Congress is concerned, there can be no going back on the nuclear deal. The Left should have understood by now that at this advanced stage of talks with America over the deal, it is impossible for the Congress to delay the 123 Agreement, leave alone scrap it. Faced with an either-or situation, the Congress would rather part ways with the Left than put the nuclear deal on hold. However, for all the threatening noises that the Left has been making, it appears strangely reluctant to back out from the UPA. Perhaps the Left is not so much above the politics of power as it makes itself out to be. While the Left looks pathetic, it is the Congress that will increasingly be calling the shots in the days to come.

				 																																																				Sir Common people, as well as Sonia Gandhi, seem fed up with the constant threats of the Left to the UPA government over the nuclear deal. Prakash Karats intimidations are in all probability false, since the Left, for its own sake, would not want the country to go for mid-term polls. Considerable sections of the electorate, disillusioned by the ways of the Left, would no longer vote for it. The Left knows this only too well and hence is trying to avoid taking a clear stand over the deal, asking the Congress to delay it for at least six months. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir Sonia Gandhis unexpected eruption in Haryana against those opposed to the nuclear deal was unwarranted and uncharitable. Although she has claimed later that the Left was not her target, her comment was certainly not in keeping with her image as one of the most sober politicians of the country. It is true that the Opposition, particularly the Left, has politicized the deal and has been trying to make the government bow to its wishes. Her speech also came when talks are still going on between her party and the Left. Had she been fair, she would have tried to convince the people that the deal would not affect the sovereignty of India, instead of blaming those she called the enemies of development.

				 																Whats the good word?				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph seems to be making the same mistake as the government of India in interpreting the word secular  by referring to the famous dargah in Ajmer as secular symbol (Blast rips through secular symbol, Oct 12). The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines secular as not spiritual or sacred, not concerned with religion or religious belief. At another place, the dargah has been referred to as a shrine, which the dictionary defines as a church, chapel, altar etc., sacred to a saint, holy person, relic etc. It is clear that the word secular is antithetical to the word religion. Yet, our nation, which proclaims itself to be secular, continues to interpret the term as giving equal recognition to all religions, whereas it should mean non-recognition of any religion for any purpose of the state. Simply because people belonging to different religions visit the Ajmer dargah and offer worship, The Telegraph has also considered it to be a secular symbol.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The blast in Ajmer certainly did not rip through a secular shrine. How can a shrine meant for religious prayer be secular, since the word bears no relation with religious or spiritual matters? Words such as non-communal, or non-sectarian could have been used instead. We always find politicians abusing words like secular and interpreting them to suit their political purposes. But a newspapers job is to call the politicians bluff, not to make the same mistake. A secular spirit may be displayed by people, but to call a mosque or a temple secular is a gaffe.

							 																						RUDE STRIKE																														If judges sit in court on a Sunday, it is a signal for people to take serious notice. A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled on Sunday that bandhs are illegal, in the context of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led alliance calling for what is virtually a bandh in Tamil Nadu. Rulings making bandhs illegal are not new. The Kerala high court, the Supreme Court, and then again the Calcutta high court and the Guwahati high court, have, in different contexts, ruled that bandhs are unconstitutional, and that the use of direct or indirect force upon individuals, or preventing them from travelling and from going to work, are violations of rights. In 2004, the Bombay high court penalized two political parties for calling a bandh. Yet parties continue to bring life to a standstill, apparently for noble causes but usually as a show of strength. It is their arguments and evasions that this latest order has addressed.																														The court seems to have made no bones about placing the rights of the individual above those of political parties. This is an essential step in the case against bandhs, because one favourite argument of political parties is that they call bandhs in the interests of the common man. Besides, no one can take away the democratic right of protest from political parties or anyone else. The court has addressed these arguments on two levels. It has distinguished between strikes and bandhs, making it clear that the games political leaders play by fudging strike with bandh will not work. A strike in protest against an organization is very different from the cessation of all work, the preferred form of protest by parties strongest in their area. This brings everything, including transport, to a stop. It is this kind of protest, organized by a political party or group, that the court regards as illegal, even if leaders call it a strike by workers or something similar. The second level at which the politicians arguments have been addressed is more general and obvious, and it has been the burden of earlier rulings too. This is the emphasis on the violation of individual rights  the latest ruling places the individual above the party  and on the enormity of the economic loss suffered by the state or country as well as by the poorest daily wage earner. Taken seriously, the rulings could bring about a difference in political culture. But for that, politicians would need to think beyond their noses.

							 																						CLASSICAL STYLE WITH MODERN MAGIC				 Dance Sharmila Basu Thakur				 	 Dazzling elegance				 																														Innovative choreography and experimental presentation of classical dance have become popular these days. Such a trend has both positive and negative effects. Young dancers with poor knowledge and insufficient training in the classical style may destroy a rich heritage in the name of innovation. With authentic guidance and proper understanding of the idiom, artists can open up a new vista, enriched and embellished with brilliant ideas. 																														Surya: The Sun God was staged by Samskritiki Shreyaskar at Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex on September 9 as part of their 12th anniversary celebrations. Conceived and choreographed by Rani Karnaa, eminent exponent of Kathak, the production focussed on Surya and his association with Hindu philosophy. 																														Rooted in the Kathak-style, the choreographer tried to capture the power and significance of the Gayatri mantra,which is chanted thrice every day: Brahmarupi Gayatri in the morning , Madhyanha Gayatri at noon and Sandhya Gayatri in the evening. From dawn to dusk, the changes of colour and mood were depicted by the dancers along with their guru. As Madhyanha Gayatri, Sohini Debnath was pleasing. With her expressive eyes and confident movements, she conveyed her emotions beautifully. 																														The most scintillating performance came from Debashree Bhattacharya as Usha. Her understanding of the form was remarkably complemented by strong footwork. Dressed in purple, Debashree, along with two other brilliant dancers, charmed the viewers with their high-speed chakkars, fluid motions and perfect precision. Ria Dawn as Pratah Gayatri was convincing. With synchronized group compositions and gradual elaboration of rhythmic patterns, the choreographer created an expansive canvas where colour, rhythm and pattern complemented one another. 																														The Surya Namaskar performed by the younger disciples was elementary. Costumes, an important part of any performance, were aesthetically designed by Rani Karnaa herself. The musicians made their instruments talk, weaving intricate bols and tunes. The melodic elaborations were stirring. Siddhartha Bhattacharya (tabla), Anjan Saha (sitar), Sunando Chatterjee (sarod), Jayanta Chatterjee (flute), Dishari Chakraborty (santoor), Sudakshina Chatterjee and Nirmalya Roy (vocal) gave able support, while Kanishka Sens lighting had the desired effect. However, the production should have had dancers more capable of maintaining the pace of the production.

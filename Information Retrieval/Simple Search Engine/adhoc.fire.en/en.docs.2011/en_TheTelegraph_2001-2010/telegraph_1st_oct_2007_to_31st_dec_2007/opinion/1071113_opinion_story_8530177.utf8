							 																						A FAILING NEIGHBOURHOOD It is in Indias interest to play a more active moderating role in south Asia. The return of normalcy and stability in Pakistan should be the immediate priority, writes Ashok Ganguly				 	 Impatient for peace				 																														The declaration of martial law in Pakistan on November 3 made the country a significant addition to the circle of failing states surrounding India. Myanmar under military rule is now in a state of continuous turmoil. The unresolved fate of the monarchy and the ongoing disagreement between the communists and the other political parties have led to instability in Nepal. Bangladesh is under the control of its armed forces, with uneasy promises of elections and return to civilian rule. Afghanistan remains in a state of anarchy and instability. Maldives, though stable on the surface, has strong and growing undercurrents of Islamic militancy. Sri Lanka has for many years been, and remains, in a state of civil war, China continues to blow hot and cold on our eastern borders, claiming Indian territory, which leaves only Bhutan as a stable neighbour. South Asia is now considered the most dangerous and unstable part of the world.																														In the shadow of its politically unsettled neighbours and porous borders, Indian terrorist groups like the Naxalites, Maoists, the United Liberation Front of Asom and several other minor formations exacerbate the environment of disorder and continue to receive moral and material support from Islamic terrorists and other extremists in Indias neighbourhood.																														The recent events in Pakistan, which, it is claimed, were provoked by Pervez Musharrafs inability to contain different terrorist groups, could spill over into India and make our battle against terrorism even more difficult. It is becoming clearer that the United States of America is not gaining an upper hand in the war in Afghanistan and its reliance on Musharraf in its war against terror has begun to unravel.																														In its own interest and the nations political economy, India can and has to play an important and moderating role in its neighbourhood. The importance of this is not always appreciated because, given the sensitivities of its neighbours, India has to conduct its regional diplomacy on a very low key. Whether it is in the Maldives or, more recently, in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Afghanistan, bilateral diplomacy and understanding on the part of India have played a more effective role than a high-pitched campaign to save democracy would have. Indias bilateral dealings with its neighbours, as also with China on the border issue, are likely to be long drawn out and will test the patience of all, but are the only means by which a semblance of stability may be restored.																														Unfortunately, Pakistan is the most intractable of Indias neighbours. It considers itself equal to India in economic and military terms. It has not been able to overcome the trauma of the separation of Bangladesh and considers the jihad in Kashmir as its retaliatory right. Pakistan derives its strength entirely from the unwavering support that Musharraf gets from the US, as a frontline ally in the war against terror, and grudgingly from Islamic nations as the possessor of the Islamic nuclear bomb. China remains a steadfast friend, thus making Pakistan the only nation where the US and China have become strange bedfellows.																														Musharrafs failure to contain Islamic terrorism in Pakistan and govern its border region with Afghanistan and the alarming growth of fundamentalist forces within Pakistan have now made the nation a hot potato in the hands of General Musharraf and George W. Bush. The current scenario in Pakistan is indeed an extremely dangerous one, since any sign of the US abandoning Musharraf  even though the US may claim it has other options  will bring about his fall from power and lead to the outbreak of anarchy in Pakistan, with grave consequences to its neighbourhood. This nightmare scenario poses a grave danger for India. A major neighbour with nuclear bomb which is increasingly driven by fundamentalists towards becoming a failing state conjures up alarming scenarios.																														Under the circumstances, Indias underplayed diplomatic response to the declaration of emergency in Pakistan must be seen as a mature and positive development. It is in our best interest to encourage whoever is in power in Pakistan to return the nation to some state of political and social calm and hope that those with power and influence over Pakistan do not feel tempted to spread the virus of terrorism, even more actively, across the border.																														India needs to be supportive of the efforts of the US and the European Union, who are engaged in persuading Pakistan to get back to its pre-emergency state. China is likely to do what will serve its own purpose. Chinas silence on the emergency in Pakistan is deafening.																														It is during such upheavals in our neighbourhood that the faultlines of Indias coalition politics begin to widen. The faultlines were clearly exposed during the past few months with regard to India-US civilian nuclear deal. There is no reason to believe that the same faultlines will not hobble India from continuing to extend a healing touch to a troubled neighbour, at a time when the US and other countries are willing to prevent Pakistan from becoming a failed state. A stable and democratic Pakistan is the only way to ensure Indias uninterrupted economic and social progress. It is, therefore, in Indias own interest to join the other countries in order to extend a helping hand to the restoration of normal civil society in Pakistan. 																														There is never a perfect outcome in the affairs of peoples and nations. Acceptable solutions in conflicts are achievable in a world which is becoming more and more multi-polar every day. What south Asia needs urgently is to return to a state of sustainable equilibrium. As far as India is concerned, Pakistans return to normalcy and cessation of violence must be a priority for peace and stability in south Asia.

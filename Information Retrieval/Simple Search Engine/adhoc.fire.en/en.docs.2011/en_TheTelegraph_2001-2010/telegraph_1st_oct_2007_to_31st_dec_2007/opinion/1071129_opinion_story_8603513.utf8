							 																						POORLY MARKED																														Growing fast is not the same thing as feeling well. If this sounds cryptic, there is Indias rank in this years human development report released by the United Nations development programme as explanation. While India now has the second highest growth rate in the world, it is ranked 128 among 177 countries in terms of the human development index. It seems stuck immovably in the same region of the list: it was ranked 127 in 2005 and 126 in 2006. And if two notches matter, then it is slightly worse off in terms of life expectancy, health, education and income  the combined measure for the rankings  than a year ago. Being rated 128 is not in itself an irreversible ill; India is at least better off than the many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, for example. These countries make up most of the bottom 20 in the class. It still may be slightly embarrassing that in adult literacy, India is lower than Malawi and Rwanda. Neither country can boast of second-in-the-world growth rate.																														It is not much use saying that Indias growth has been lop-sided so far, that its benefits have not percolated to the masses. The masses are huge enough to make the countrys economic growth rate look meaningless soon. The gap between economic growth and development failure indicates that the policies to address the issues that make up development indices are missing their target miserably. Public spending for education has been reduced from 12 per cent in 1991 to 10 per cent of government expenditure in 2005. For health the spending is 0.9 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product, compared to 6.9 per cent in the United States of America. Lack of health is one of the indicators in the poverty index rankings, in which India is 62 among 108 developing countries. These figures suggest a lacuna in thinking, and raise questions about the weight accorded to the fundamental rights of Indian citizens enshrined in the Constitution when policies are formulated. They also suggest that, given the size of Indias population, the real numbers of Indians who are illiterate, ill and poor are enormous. Yet India no longer sees itself as a poor country; it has some of the richest people in the world. It may be unpleasant for India to be placed under Equatorial Guinea and Solomon Islands in the HDI. But the results of skewed development will not be merely unpleasant, they may be dangerous.

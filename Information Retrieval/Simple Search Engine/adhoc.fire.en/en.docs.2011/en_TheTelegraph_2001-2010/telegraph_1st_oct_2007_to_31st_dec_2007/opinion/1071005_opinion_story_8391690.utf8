				 																Strike it down				 																																																				Sir  The two Supreme court judges, B.N. Agarwal and P.P. Naoleker, must be congratulated for quashing the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagams plan for calling a bandh protesting the slow progress made in the Sethusamudram project (Bandh loses strike fig leaf, Oct 1). After this ruling, politicians cutting across party lines should realize that bandhs go against the interests of the common people. Take for instance the plight of daily wage earners on bandh days; they lose out on their days earnings, thanks to our political parties. The courts ruling is unlikely to go down well with politicians. Hopefully, the din created by the netas would not deter the countrys apex court from carrying out its threat of sacking the state government on charges of contempt. That would stop politicians like Karunanidhi from flouting the ban on bandhs in the future.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  After the Supreme Court stayed the proposed bandh in Tamil Nadu, DMK leaders resorted to a hunger strike. Such a step may help the party achieve what it had hoped to attain by calling a bandh. 				 																																																				The honourable court has also identified the differences between a hartal and a bandh. In the eyes of the court, a hartal is directed against specific organizations and institutions, while a bandh aims at disrupting normal life in a city. D. Raja, the veteran Marxist, termed the injunction anti-democratic and wondered how else can political parties express their views in a democracy. One would like to know Rajas views on the sufferings brought on the people by bandhs. Indian politicians need to change their views on bandhs. Perhaps that can help them adapt to the changing times.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  It is heartening to note the Supreme Courts views on bandhs. The court has declared bandhs illegal and stated that individual rights are superior to those of political parties. The point made by the court is of critical importance as it deals with one of the founding principles of a democracy. The courts ruling is also significant because India, barring a few other countries, is perhaps the only nation in the world where people are subjected to the horrors of frequent bandhs. This is all the more embarrassing because our country is one of the worlds largest democracies, and now a key player in international affairs. 				 																																																				A bandh is hazardous in many ways. People are stopped from going to work, attending social functions or taking the sick to the hospital by unruly elements who are determined to disrupt normal life. Every citizen has a right to protest. But it should be borne in mind that no one has the right to disturb other people during bandhs. There is no need for politicians to split hairs over the definition of bandhs and strikes. This is because the Supreme Court has already made it clear what is and what is not a bandh. 				 																																																				In this context, one must also mention Benoy Konars response to the court ruling. After the judgment, Konar, a CPI(M) central committee member, wondered whether the apex court would be able to send five lakh striking employees to jail. This is certainly not a rhetorical question. Konars statement is unacceptable and he should be held guilty of contempt of court. The Supreme Court should set guidelines not only for governments but also for politicians so that they cannot get away with making condescending remarks. The court should also penalize policemen if they failed to ensure the safety of people during bandhs. There is no need to put five lakh employees in jail. The arrest of a few guilty personnel would serve as a deterrent and make politicians fall in line with the courts orders.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The Supreme Court order banning bandhs will be welcomed by the public only if it is implemented at some point of time. The first such order was passed way back in 1998. Political parties have predictably kicked up a storm over the latest ruling. The DMK-led alliance has already observed a hunger strike to protest the Supreme Courts decision to stay the bandh called by the coalition. What these political parties do not take into consideration is the fact that a complete cessation of work inconveniences citizens in any part of the country. The Supreme Court has rightly pointed out that the rights of the individual are superior to those of political parties. The sooner Indian politicians wake up to this truth the better.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  If in the opinion of the Supreme Court, preventing the plying of buses and forcing shops to stay closed amount to a complete breakdown of constitutional machinery, then the Gujarat riots in 2002 were worse than the DMKs plans to bring Tamil Nadu to a grinding halt for a day. 				 																																																				It is surprising to note that the apex court did not find it necessary to recommend the dismissal of the Narendra Modi government then, as it has done now in Tamil Nadu. It is this application of different yardsticks by the judiciary which makes people doubt its impartiality.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

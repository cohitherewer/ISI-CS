							 																						NUMBER CHANGE																														The announcement of the minister of telecommunications that numbers will become portable from next year was overdue and is still welcome. Subscribers are now daunted by the thought that if they change their telephone operator, they will have to inform all their friends and relations of the change in their number, and that they will lose contact with those whom they miss out on informing. In theory, number portability would mean that they could change the operator without this inconvenience. 																														If a subscriber wants to change his telephone operator now, he needs to get a new telephone connection. The termination of his old connection may be delayed indefinitely. After he stops using his old telephone, he may continue to get bills from the old operator  and they would mount with penalties if he contested them. A divorce from a telephone operator can be extremely messy. So some subscribers just buy another telephone, stop paying bills on the first one, and let their old telephone operator do his worst  which, in the light of the number of defaults, is often nothing. But many more, who do not wish to get into the rigmarole, stick with their operator however unsatisfactory his service may be. The lack of a satisfactory complaint redressal mechanism makes matters worse. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India does not entertain individual complaints. The subscriber is supposed to complain to his operator. If the operator does not address his complaint, the subscriber could then approach TRAI; TRAI is in theory expected to ask the operator for an explanation. How well this secondary redressal mechanism works is not known. But the fact that the quality of service of some operators leaves much to be desired is no secret; it is evident from TRAIs quality-of-service statistics.																														Making numbers portable will not by itself make the process of changing operators any simpler. For the old operator could still continue to make claims, justified or otherwise. What needs to be made easier is the termination of the relationship with an operator. And the simplest way to do so is to ban periodic (generally monthly) connection charges altogether. If all costs were included in call charges, then the payment of a bill would signify the settlement of all dues; it should then be possible to terminate a connection by not using it. It would still be necessary to inform the first operator that the subscriber has moved to another. TRAI would therefore need to create a record of all numbers in use, together with data about which operator a subscriber is currently using. This would be akin to share depositories in the stock market. It is to be hoped, however, that TRAI will not allow multiple number depositories, for that will only create forced marriages between subscribers and depositories, with all the attendant problems of poor service. TRAI must run the number depository itself.

							 																						ANIMAL INSTINCTS
																														No one can claim that there is a dearth of interaction between animals and their viewers at the Calcutta zoo, which sets both recreation and conservation as its cherished goals. Visitors have climbed down steep walls and crossed moats to garland tigers and, on less exciting days, they continue to dutifully feed elephants, deer and other seemingly hungry creatures by throwing food into their enclosures. Animals too play their part in this circus, but almost always as aggrieved parties. They have little ammunition against the barbarity that is unleashed on them each winter when the citys only zoo is flooded with visitors determined to get their moneys worth. Since angry growls have been seen to do little to discourage the irritants, two chimpanzees, fast learners that they are, rattled their cell door hard enough recently to break open the lock. After a failed attempt to escape the zoos tortuous precincts, during which they pushed and injured two women, they were forced back into their cell to undergo the routine humiliation. The zoos answer to their unruliness was simple enough. There would now be two locks on their door instead of one. And, expectedly, the crowd outside would ebb and flow as before.
																														Only rarely do the annoying habits of zoo-visitors and the complete lack of sensitivity on the part of the zoo-keepers complement each other so perfectly. At the Alipore Zoological Gardens, however, this is the usual story. The total lack of understanding of animal needs and rights is evident from the way animals are kept, fed and bred. If a world famous primatologist was appalled by the absence of any possibility of the chimpanzees enriching themselves through work and play in a sizeable social group, then the ordinary visitor feels just as dismayed by the shoddy exhibits of conserved animals. What kind of educative experience is the Calcutta zoo giving its visitors by displaying diseased, unhealthy, sorry creatures in cramped cages? And what kind of crowd behaviour is it inspiring in visitors by putting on show its own lack of concern for welfare and discipline?
																														It is unlikely that the zoo authorities are going to be overly exercised by such questions. Enterprising zoos around the world are usually found to balance the often-conflicting aims of recreation and conservation by hardselling themselves through cleverly-designed entertainment packages meant for the family or for children alone. Caught in red-tapism, it is unlikely that the Calcutta zoo will indulge itself in such brainstorming. The authorities continue to harp on the idea of resettling the zoo on the citys outskirts as a way out of the present mess. But if it carries with it this spurious idea of animal care, more space may not necessarily bring a more peaceable life for the caged, helpless creatures it tends to.

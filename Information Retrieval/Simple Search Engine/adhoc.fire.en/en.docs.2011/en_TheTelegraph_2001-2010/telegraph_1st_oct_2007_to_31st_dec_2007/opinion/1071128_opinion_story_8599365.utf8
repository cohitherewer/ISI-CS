							 																						DAY FOR LAW																														India is a land famous for its rituals. This may well be derived from the centuries of Brahmanical dominance. The modern version of traditional rituals is the creation of days assigned to a specific cause. Thus there is childrens day, teachers day and days devoted to the armed forces and so on. No one is quite sure what purpose these days serve and why men are supposed to bow and pray to these modern gods. Law Day is one such creation, however ironic its celebration might be in a country fast spinning into the orbit of lawlessness. It has become a common assumption among educated people, including most lawyers and judges, that the legal system is in dire need of reforms. But very little time and attention are spent on this very vital area of reform. One major casualty of the present legal system is the time taken in the disposition of the cases. Often the time taken is so long that the final verdict becomes meaningless to the parties concerned. One reason for this delay is that the number of judges is inadequate to deal with all the cases that come up for hearing. But it is also true that a large amount of the courts time, especially at the higher levels, is spent in cases that should not have been admitted at all. This refers to the public litigation cases that come up for hearing. There is a need to curb these by separating the genuine ones from those that serve only to waste the courts time.																														If Law Day is to have any significance beyond the mere ritualistic, it should also induce some introspection among legal practitioners at various levels of the legal system. The one alarming trend is the decline in ethics among legal professionals. It is ironic that a day prior to Law Day the Bar Council of India had to urge bar associations not to pass resolutions refusing to defend alleged terrorists in court. The fact that such resolutions were passed is evidence of the declining ethical standards. As lawyers should know, under the Indian legal system a man is innocent till proven guilty. And only a judge can declare a man to be guilty. An alleged terrorist has as much right to a legal defence as any other person. This should be the alpha-omega of those who have chosen to take up law as their profession. This points need to be remembered all the time rather than just on Law Day. There is the fear, not entirely baseless, that a modern ritual will be as devoid of meaning as an ancient one.

							 																						TALES FROM THE FIRST FAMILY This Above All - Khushwant Singh				 	 Nayantara Sahgal: dignified silence																					Without a doubt Indias first family is, and always has been, the Nehru-Gandhis. They produced three prime ministers, the first woman ambassador and the first woman to preside over the United Nations general assembly. Dozens of books have been written on them. But the earliest insider to write about them was Nayantara Sahgal, Jawaharlal Nehrus niece and the daughter of his sister Vijayalakshmi Pandit. Her Prison and Chocolate Cake was published half-a-century ago. It was translated into many foreign languages because people all over the world wanted to know about emerging India and the people guiding its destiny. The book is now being re-published by Harper Collins.																					Nayantara begins her narrative with her childhood years in the family mansion, Anand Bhavan, in Allahabad and vacations in a sylvan village, Khali, near Almora, bought by her scholarly and self-effacing Maharashtrian father. Anand Bhavan had become an open house for leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Azad, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Sarojini Naidu, Pandit Pant and others. A crowd would always wait at the gates to catch a glimpse of them. There was little privacy. After they had finished schooling, Nayantara and her sister were packed off to America in 1943. This was at a critical juncture in World War II. The girls went by troop ship which, to dodge German U-boats, took a circuitous route via Australia and New Zealand to the west coast of America. Nayantara took with her a scrapbook full of quotations from her uncle Jawaharlal Nehrus speeches and writings. One was pertinent: Wherever in this wide world there goes an Indian, there goes a piece of India with him, and he may not forget this fact...It lies within his power, to some extent, to bring credit or discredit to his country, honour or dishonour. Nayantara bore this message in mind during the four years that she was in Wellesley College and in her extensive travels across the United States of America on vacations. Homes of eminent personalities like Pearl Buck and Paul Robeson were open to her because she was Nehrus niece. She lived up to her uncles ideals. When she returned home, she was received by Indira Gandhi at Palam airport and stayed with her uncle, then Indias first prime minister. She was with him the day the Mahatma was assassinated. She ends her narrative with the tragedy of his death.																					Nayantara is careful not to allude to tensions that developed between members of the first family. Indira Gandhi never liked either her aunt Vijayalakshmi Pandit or Nayantara. When she became prime minister, she refused to appoint Vijayalakshmi Pandit as high commissioner to the United Kingdom though specifically requested by her British counterpart to do so. 																					When Morarji Desai became prime minister, he appointed Nayantara the ambassador to Italy. On resuming office, Indira Gandhi cancelled the appointment, exposing a streak of vindictiveness. Nayantara was too lady-like to allude to slights she had suffered at the hands of her first cousin. I hope some day she will write a sequel to Prison and Chocolate Cake and come out with the truth of the bitter family feud.																					Everyday guests																					J. M. Rishi, an industrialist from Jalandhar, is into making money, playing golf, Urdu poetry and spiritualism  whatever that means. He periodically puts his thoughts on paper and mails them to me. We have never met. In his last missive he wrote about Sheikh Saadis encounter with a Hindu divine during his visit to India. I was unable to grasp the moral of the learned Sheikhs message. He was invited to a feast laid out in his honour. Far from thanking his host at the end of the meal, Sheikh Sahib remarked: Daavat-e-Shiraz kuchh aur hai. (At Shiraz, a feast is something different.) Dismayed, the Hindu divine invited Saadi again and again, adding more tasty dishes to the lavish spread. But he got the same response every time  A Shirazi feast is something different. Some years after Sheikh Saadi had returned to Shiraz, the Hindu divine called on him and was invited to a meal. He was served dal (lentil) and naan(bread). The same fare was laid out at subsequent meals. The exasperated guest asked, Sheikh Sahib, what is the Shirazi feast you talked so much about in India? Unabashed Saadi replied, This is it. What a person eats every day, he should offer his guests. No formality, no showing off, no strain.																					I admit I dont get the message. At lunch all I have is a cup of vegetable soup and a raw cucumber and tomato. If I offered the same to my guests, most of them would leave early to eat a proper meal. J.M. Rishis story sounds very much like a Barmecide feast. King Barmecide was known to have banquets where gold plates and silver goblets were laid out for the guests. But no food was served. All he earned in gratitude was to have his name immortalized for meanness.																					More elevating than the story of Daavat-e-Shiraz in Rishis letter were a few quotes from Saadi rendered into Urdu: Voh ghum jis kay baad tujhey khushee hasil ho/ Uss khushee say achha hai jis kay baad too ghamgeen ho (Sorrow that is followed by joy is better than/ Joy which is followed by sorrow)																					And: Gauhar agar keechar mein gir jaaye toh bhee qeemati hai/ Aur gard agar aasmaan par charh jaaye toh bhee beqeemat hai (A jewel, even though it falls into the mud, remains valuable/ Dust, even though it goes up to the sky, remains worthless)																					Whats in a name?																					Gagan Deep Singh: Papa, can one have the same name and surname?																					Papa : No beta, it is not possible.																					Gagan : It is possible Papa, if film actress Lara Dutta marries the cricketer Brian Lara, then she would become Lara Lara.																					(Contributed by J. P. Singh Kaka, Bhopal)

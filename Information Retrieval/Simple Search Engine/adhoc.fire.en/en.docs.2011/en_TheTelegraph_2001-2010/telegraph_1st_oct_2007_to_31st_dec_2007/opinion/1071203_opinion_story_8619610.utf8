							 																						BEYOND THE CITY																														The popularity ratings of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, have slipped since its peak in July, this time right down below 50 per cent. But this was not directly related to the riots in Villiers-le-Bel, in the northern suburbs of Paris, which began with the death of two young men who crashed their moped into a police car. Rather, the riots were a symptom of many things that the people feel are wrong with France today, things that Mr Sarkozy promised to put right when he became president last May, but has so far failed to change. The main complaints are extensive joblessness and low purchasing power. The discontent thus engendered gains an extra-keen edge of frustration among the ethnically diverse young people in the housing blocks in the suburbs, who do not see any future for themselves except in crime and misery. The psychological roots of the recent riots may not have been essentially different from those of the riots of 2005, when Mr Sarkozy had been interior minister. His remark about rabble then had not helped matters. His decision to pursue and arrest all law-breakers this time, when close to 80 police personnel have been injured, may bring things under control, but may not quell the simmering discontent.																														Immigrants living in the suburbs, in some cases for three generations, have not only had numbers added to them in recent years from different countries, but have also become some of the worst sufferers of the shrinkage in Frances job market. Growing poorer has also meant slipping down the ladder of education and losing hold of their transplanted culture. While the law and order approach is certainly important, it would be as important to address the causes of the growing violence and criminality. Mr Sarkozy has not been able to communicate very well so far, but he will need both communication skills and the appearance of active interest if he wishes the atmosphere in the suburban housing blocks to change.

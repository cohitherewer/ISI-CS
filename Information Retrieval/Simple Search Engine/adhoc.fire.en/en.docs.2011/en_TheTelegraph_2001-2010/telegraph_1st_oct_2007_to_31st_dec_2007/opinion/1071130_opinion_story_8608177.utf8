							 																						WEAR AND TEAR																														Pakistan should congratulate itself for finally managing to drive some dress sense into the president. Pervez Musharraf, having resigned the post of army chief and having passed on the baton, with some difficulty, to General Ashfaq Kiyani, can no longer don the uniform. In giving up his claims to the army wear, Mr Musharraf fulfils a longstanding demand of both his political adversaries and well-wishers, who had been at pains to convince him of the impropriety and the dangers of a civilian president retaining the baton and the khaki. The much-promised dissociation from the army comes on the eve of Mr Musharrafs formal oath-taking as president, which, given the dices loaded against him, is itself an indication of his success as a master strategist. The former general did not let go of his baton till he was reasonably sure of his continued hold on the affairs of both the State and the army, the first through his presidency and the second through his loyal men in uniform  the two key constituents of the troika (apart from the elected prime minister) that will now rule Pakistan. Mr Musharrafs gesture is designed to rob the political opposition of its ammunition, and may be followed up by the more generous one of lifting the emergency. Both are supposed to establish his democratic credentials before the international and domestic audience. 																														There can be no denying that Mr Musharraf has taken a calculated risk in giving up the uniform. He will no longer have the army under his direct command, and, despite his generals loyalty, he cannot be absolutely sure of their commitment to his interests alone. There is also the possibility that a hostile elected assembly may push for the reconstitution of the supreme court, the reinstatement of the judges and a subsequent re-evaluation of his presidency. In other words, Mr Musharraf has placed himself in a vulnerable spot. But the crux of the matter is that this has been made possible not merely because of the international pressure that his Western allies have brought on him, but because of the increasing strength in the collective voice of his people who have incessantly clamoured for change and doggedly pursued the path towards the restoration of democracy in Pakistan. In the coming days, the elite and the establishment may try to usurp this voice, and try to co-opt it in their own scheme of things, but they can no longer ignore it.

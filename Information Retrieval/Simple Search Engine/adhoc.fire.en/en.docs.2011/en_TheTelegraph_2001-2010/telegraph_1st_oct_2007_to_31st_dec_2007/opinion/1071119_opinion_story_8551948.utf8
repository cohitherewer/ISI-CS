							 																						POSSIBLE FUTURES FIFTH COLUMN - GWYNNE DYER																					Pakistans current options were concisely evaluated by one Mohammad Sohail of Islamabad in a posting on the BBC website last Saturday. Under the heading Current Pakistan Sanario (sic scenario), he listed the possible outcomes of the present crisis in reverse order of desirability  1. Talibanization: worst case sanario 2. Mrs Benazir Bhutto: worse case sanario 3. Mr Nawaz Sharif: very very bad case sanario 4. Other Political Leaders: very bad case sanario 5. Mr Musharaff: bad case sanario 6. Power to the people: The best case sanario.																					Nobody doubts that talibanization would be the worst-case scenario. It would be dreadful for the long-suffering people of Pakistan, and it would trigger an extremely dangerous international crisis, if American, Indian and possibly Iranian forces launched rapid-reaction attacks aimed at keeping Pakistans nuclear weapons out of the hands of the crazies. Fortunately, it is a very low-probability outcome.																					Ranking another Benazir Bhutto prime ministership as the next-worst outcome is more debatable, but perhaps Mohammad Sohail was thinking about the monumental corruption that marred both of Bhuttos previous terms in office. Or maybe what troubled our intrepid guide to contemporary Pakistani politics was the fact that Bhuttos dramatic return from years of exile was really stage-managed by the US. Washington saw that the general, a generally obedient ally, was losing his grip on power, and calculated that an alliance with Bhutto could save him.																					The negotiations between Musharraf and Bhutto lasted many months, but Washington was never able to extract two key commitments from the general. One was that he would take off his uniform and relinquish command of the army. The other was that he would give up the presidents constitutionally entrenched power to dismiss the prime minister. So Bhutto came home without a deal. But the current confrontation between her and the general is largely shadow-boxing. The made-in-America deal could still happen, and that enrages many Pakistanis.																					Where salvation lies																					Then there is Nawaz Sharif, head of the other large opposition party and also twice removed from the prime ministership, most recently by Musharraf in 1999. He also tried to come home from exile last month, but since he was not a potential collaborator, Musharraf had him expelled again.. 																					We can pass quickly over other political leaders, and likewise over the general himself, who is not going to be running Pakistan much longer unless he can make a deal with someone who gives his regime some democratic legitimacy. That is why, having declared emergency rule on November 3, locked up most opposition leaders, and shut down the cable news channels, he still promises that there will be parliamentary elections before January 9. Even the army is starting to doubt that he can stay in office much longer without some kind of democratic approval.																					Which brings us to Mohammad Sohails last, best case: Power to the people. I dont know what he really means by that, so let me offer my own interpretation. What began this crisis was the revolt of the lawyers against Musharrafs interference with the independence of the supreme court. What precipitated the state of emergency was his fear that the supreme court would rule his own re-election as president invalid because he had not resigned as army chief of staff. This confrontation is really about the rule of law, and that is where Pakistans salvation lies.																					Democracy without the rule of law is a farce. With the rule of law, it can even withstand corrupt politicians and opportunistic generals. Pakistans politics has been bitterly disappointing for most of its history as there was no determination to uphold the primacy of the law. But now the judiciary is finally taking its role seriously. This crisis could still end well.

							 																						QUICK TURNOVER																														Jammu and Kashmir is the only place where a power-sharing agreement within the ruling coalition has worked in recent times. That says something about the inability of politicians to keep promises. The ability to stick to an agreement is becoming quite a rare virtue. But the Bharatiya Janata Party should not have been surprised at the refusal of the Janata Dal (Secular) section of the Karnataka government headed by the chief minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy, to hand over the reins to the BJP at the appointed time. The BJP has made quite a habit of being the loser in such power-sharing agreements; Mayavati managed to turn back on her word twice in Uttar Pradesh. For some obscure reason, the BJP must have thought 20 months ago that Mr Kumaraswamy was more trustworthy than Ms Mayavati. That must have cost quite a few contortions in reasoning: Mr Kumaraswamy had just tricked the Congress and then turned to the BJP, he belonged to a party that insisted on the parenthesis secular in its name, and his father, H.D. Deve Gowda, has never been known to be devoted to anything but power.																														 Since ethics on the one hand, and governance on the other, are far from the minds of those elected to govern, it is entertaining to see what the breakdown of the Karnataka government has thrown up. Mr Deve Gowda may be hoping for a stronger position for bargaining after the now possible midterm polls, although some members of Janata Dal (S) have expressed a desire to leave, because they are ashamed their party did not honour its word. These members are also Lingayats. Mr Deve Gowda must be aware that the BJP has an advantage in its Lingayat base, and B.S. Yediyurappa, the deputy chief minister now resigned, is a Lingayat too. The BJP is also hoping for a sympathy vote. That seems to lie behind its urging the governor not to give Mr Kumaraswamy till October 18 to get together a floor test; it is not just a fear of horse-trading. The BJP is adept at that, but it badly needs to keep a toehold in any one southern state. Neither the Janata Dal (S) nor the Congress would be playing their cards in Karnataka without taking into account a possibility of Lok Sabha elections too. Whether Mr Kumaraswamy would look for support towards the Congress and whether the Congress would try out another partnership with his party are bits of the entertainment yet to be revealed.

				 																Rough deal				 																																																				Sir  Ashok V. Desais argument that Indias nuclear deal collapsed because of the prime ministers failure to communicate the advantages of the deal to his allies is convincing (Cost of the reverse, Oct 23). But the premises on which Desai bases his conclusion appear to be deeply flawed. His first premise is that the United States of America is encouraging Indias inclusion into the nuclear club because it needs Indias help to contain and subjugate Pakistans nuclear ambitions. This assumption seems quite baseless, given Indias poor record in dealing with Pakistan. It is also, perhaps, fanciful to think that the US cannot deal with Pakistan on its own. It is contradictory that Desai encourages nuclear empowerment for India while at the same time drawing attention to the high capital cost of producing it. He does not explain how nuclear power will free India from its dependence on the import of energy sources and its helplessness at the arbitrary and volatile pricing of oil. It would be far more logical to establish our potential to generate power from the hydel and coal resources that we have in plenty, before dwelling on the merits of a source of power that is both expensive and has the capacity to demolish civilizations. Why dont we emulate Brazil, which has reduced its dependence on imported fuel significantly by harnessing its abundant sugar resources? One hears all the time of discoveries of oil fields in Assam, Gujarat and in the river basins of Godavari, Kaveri and Krishna. Before making use of available resources, why take decisions that fail to convince the people and threaten the government?

				 																																																				Sir  It is wrong to assume, as Ashok V. Desai does, that it is impossible to know what terms he [Jaswant Singh] was offered, it is likely they were not too different from those later offered to Manmohan Singh. It is on record that in June, 1998, the former US president, Bill Clinton, had sought Chinas cooperation to cap, reduce and finally eliminate Indias nuclear weapons capability. It was this stance that pressurized the National Democratic Alliance to nearly agree to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty.				 																																																				However, it cannot be denied that if the nuclear deal does not go through, it will not only hurt Indias future energy requirements, but also its technological transfers, both in civilian and defence fields. Those opposing the deal with the US should also note Chinas growing influence in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and some African countries, both in terms of trade and supply of weapons. It is also to be noted that with the decreasing production of fuel and the absence of any large oil finds, the cost of fuel will continue to increase in India.

				 																																																				Sir  The communists are certainly not the only ones objecting to the Indo-US nuclear deal. There are many others, including some eminent scientists, who have strong reservations about it. Interestingly, while criticizing the communists for pushing India into a foreign policy that would make it a brother of Russia, China and a motley crowd of developing nations, Desai himself advocates taking sides by aligning with the US  the hated Western alliance. There is no difference between the two approaches except that the communists still want to be brothers of their ideological mentors, while the Congress is ready to follow the US policy blindly.				 																																																				Desais oversimplification of the deal and reiteration that it is vital for Indias energy needs follows on to his controversial theory that the deal would help the US, through India, to establish its hold over Pakistan to the extent of immobilizing our neighbouring country. Irrespective of the diplomatic desirability or feasibility of this, the basic fact is that power projection by one country vis--vis another cannot be done riding piggyback on a third country.

				 																Colour decoded				 																																																				Sir  James Watson, Nobel laureate and scientist, has declared that black people are less intelligent than whites (Top scientist claims black people stupid, Oct 18). But he has excluded the stupidity of the browns. From buttons and zippers to space rockets and satellites, the great inventors have all been white. Of course, the concept of zero originated in India, but we have little else to write home about. The Chinese invented the abacus, the Incas gave us knots for calculations, but it is the white Charles Babbage who gave the world its first computer. Let us blacks and browns face the truth and try to find out if something is wrong with our genes. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  A Nobel Prize winner is unlikely to make controversial statements offhand. James Watsons statement must not be politicized and given a racist colour. Starvation and malnutrition in parts of Africa may have been behind Watsons theory. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

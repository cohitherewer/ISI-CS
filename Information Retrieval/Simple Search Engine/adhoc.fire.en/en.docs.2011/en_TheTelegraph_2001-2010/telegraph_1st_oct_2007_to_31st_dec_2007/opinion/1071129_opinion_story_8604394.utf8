							 																						CHANGE OF HEART																														Even between lovers, an apology rarely comes from the heart. So there is little reason to suspect it would do so in the cutthroat world of realpolitik. Japan could not have suddenly felt sorry, fifty years later, for its exploitation of women during World War II and its imperialist designs on China without sound political reason. Nor could Kevin Rudd, the brand new prime minister of Australia, for the past injustices committed against the indigenous people of his nation. The architect of Labours dramatic win over the Liberal government of John Howard, Mr Rudds intention is to show his desire to make a clean break with the previous regime. He hopes to do this by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, by removing the countrys combat troops from Iraq (and thereby locking horns with the Americans), and of course, by letting in winds of change in domestic matters. Apart from redrafting the countrys unpopular labour laws, reconciliation with the aborigines is now a major agenda of his government. But the last did not happen as spontaneously as the former. As a political rival, it was necessary for Mr Rudd to take Mr Howards invasive and much-maligned policy concerning the indigenous population by its horns. Mr Rudd did precisely that. He started by promising an apology to them some time in his first term, and has now been cornered into offering a definite sorry. 																														The recipients of Mr Rudds bounty could not have settled for anything less. Dispossessed and displaced from their lands by the settlers, exposed to the diseases they brought in and to their alien culture, the original inhabitants of Australia got steadily marginalized and then ghettoized. These people have, for the past three decades, campaigned for a formal apology from the government, particularly for the cruel State policy of assimilation that took aboriginal children away from their families to be trained as domestic labour or farm hands. An apology is seen as the basis on which claims for compensation can be made by the stolen generation. Successive governments, naturally, have shied away from committing themselves to it. Mr Rudds concession is thus significant. However, to tackle the deep-set problems of the community, such as those of health, crime, social and economic well-being, Mr Rudd has to show more sincerity to the cause than discharge his responsibility by mouthing a polite sorry.

				 																Learning to be penny wiseIndian Microfinance: The Challenges of Rapid Growth (Sage, Rs 350) by Prabhu Ghate is a comprehensive study of a subject which has entered drawing-room conversations after Muhammad Yunuss Nobel win. Microfinance is also an area in which India gets no chance to play the Big Brother. Andhra Pradesh features in a significant way in Ghates study, if only to point out how not to go about starting microfinance institutions. There are several tables giving useful and interesting data  MFIs in Bangladesh have registered a profit margin of 15.3 per cent, while for most other countries and regions the figures run in the negative. Another useful chapter is on diversification options for MFIs, such as health insurance, mutual schemes and money transfers. And there is some truth-telling too, such as the description of the Indian microfinance scene as having excellent field-staff, but inadequate management and atrocious governance.																												Durgesh Nandini (Indialog, Rs 195) by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, translated here by B.M. Bhalla, is the Bengali classic which tells the story of Jagat Singh, Tilottama, Usman, Bimala, Ayesha and others. The translation is too literal in places (We cherish each other with affection), the tenses somewhat confusing (for example, in the chapter titled The Recovery), and the punctuations a bit erratic (Tilottama is there already, isnt she.). But the book does give the flavour of the heroic romance and of Bankim Chandras vision which rejects narrow divisions, prejudices and discrimination based on religion, caste and sex.My Story: The Rough and the Smooth (Headline, 7.99) by Alan Rough may not appeal to an Indian readership at first glance, because of the unfamiliarity of this Sixties Scottish goalkeeper. But for its delightful, candid recounting, sparkling humour and wonderful photographs, it is worth picking up from the shop.																												Everybody is Different (Prachee, Rs 60) by Fiona Bleach is a book for young people who have brothers or sisters with autism. It addresses some of the most common (resentful) sentiments of such siblings  Why does my brother or sister always get his or her own way?or Why does my brother or sister repeat things I say?  and suggests ways of dealing with them. The illustrations by the author are a bonus.

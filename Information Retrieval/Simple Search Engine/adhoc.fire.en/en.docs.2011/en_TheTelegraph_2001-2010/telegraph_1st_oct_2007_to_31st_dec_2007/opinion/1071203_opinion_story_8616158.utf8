				 																In an unequal land				 																																																				Sir  What has been happening in Malaysia does not portend well for the people of Indian origin who have been living there for generations (PM worried but holds tongue on lay-off barb, Dec 1). The government of India must try and find out if the allegations of discrimination against ethnic Indians in Malaysia are true or not. If this is indeed the case, India must ask the Malaysian authorities to put an end to the prejudice. The Centre should also consider issuing an advisory note to tourists who are set to travel to Malaysia soon.				 																																																				Not just India but the international community must show some concern and condemn the ill-treatment meted out to the Indian community. Non-resident Indians seldom betray their motherland. Keeping this in mind, the Indian government must take suitable action to protect the interests of Indians in Malaysia. Although it is important for migrants to culturally assimilate themselves in their chosen country, one must remember that such an assimilation can only take place if the host nation chooses to respect their fundamental rights. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The rally on November 25, in Kuala Lumpur, by about 10,000 Indians (mainly Hindus) was not so sudden as it is being made to appear. Indians are being subjected to discrimination in every walk of life in Malaysia. Demolition of Hindu religious structures in the name of development is widespread; discrimination in the professional sphere is quite common as well. Being submissive by nature, Indians have tried to adapt to the conditions for long. But it seems that their patience has finally run out. The rallyists did not destroy property or attack passers-by. Nevertheless, the Malaysian authorities have decided to prosecute 80 of the participants instead of addressing their grievances. It is unfortunate that Indian secularists who vigorously appeal for the speedy implementation of the Sachar Commissions report or pray for clemency for Afzal Guru are now unconcerned about the plight of the Indian community in Malaysia. Does their indifference have to do something with the fact that most of the agitators are Hindus? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  How can we blame the government in Malaysia when our country itself is the heartland of reservations and other such discriminatory policies? Indian politicians have always framed laws so as to divide the population and maintain their hold on power. In India, candidates of one province are not allowed to sit for competitive exams in another province. Thus the outcry against discrimination of Indians in Malaysia on the part of our political leaders is nothing but crocodile tears. Malaysians have every right to get a better share of opportunities in their own country at the expense of immigrants. In this regard, the Malaysian government has rightly asked the Tamil Nadu chief minister, M. Karunanidhi, to keep himself out of Malaysias internal matter. Karunanidhi has taken a special interest in Malaysia since the majority of ethnic Indians there are Tamils. Karunanidhi does not, as a rule, show concern for Hindus in India. So why is he worried about tha fate of Indians in Malayasia, a majority of whom are Hindus? He had better keep in mind that Malaysia is a sovereign state and is within its rights to do what it pleases inside its own territory. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Garib C. Sharma, Burnpur

				 																																																				Sir  M. Karunanidhi appears to be troubled by the predicament of ethnic Tamils in Malaysia. However, it also appears that he is using this as a ploy to build pressure on the Union government. Most of the ethnic Indians in Malaysia who took part in the November 25 rally were Tamils. It seems that Karunanidhi has no idea why there are frequent problems involving Tamils, be it in Sri Lanka or even in some Indian states. This is because members of this community often refuse to adapt themselves to other societies. Nor do Tamils care to understand the problems faced by other Indian communities in their state. Non-Tamils who have to stay in Tamil Nadu for a long time have often been subjected to indifference, even hostility. As a result, compared to states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh or Gujarat, Tamil Nadu gets much less foreign investments. 				 																																																				Karunanidhis politics is somewhat different from that of other Indian politicians. Unlike his brethren, Karunanidhi tends to shower his love and concern on none other than Tamils. Nor is it a secret that many members of the Dravida Munetra Kazagham sympathize with the Liberation Tigers for the Tamil Elam. While investigating the cause of unrest in Malaysia, Indian leaders must first determine whether ethnic Tamils had kept their part of the bargain in their adopted country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

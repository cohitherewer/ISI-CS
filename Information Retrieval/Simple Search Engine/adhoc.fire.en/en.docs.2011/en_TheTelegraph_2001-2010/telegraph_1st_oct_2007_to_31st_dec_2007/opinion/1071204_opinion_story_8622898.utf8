							 																						UNDO THE BAD HABITS  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh																					The Delhi government has decided to impose a fine on jay-walking. This one move, if implemented properly and honestly, should generate vast amounts of money. Virtually everyone in India, be it in towns or cities, jumps over railings, mauls and twists them to make for easy, illegal, passage. Hardly anyone, whether on foot or travelling in a vehicle, believes in making a short turn around, as one should if one is to abide by the rules. This makes the public, shared space utterly anarchic and dangerous.																					This may also be the right moment to impose a fine on men who pee in public, on the streets, against any wall they can access, or on pavements. They make our cities and towns stinking urinals. Nowhere in the world do you see such a filthy habit among educated men.																					All legislators should address their constituents through public service advertisements on television and shame the pee-in-public population by exposing their habit and requesting them to control their bladders. The standard excuse  that there are not enough urinals  is a lame one because I have seen men peeing against the wall of a public loo. In contrast, I have never seen any woman, who too must occasionally have an urge to pee, squat on the street.																					This is one of the millions of little symbols that establish the reality of sloppy governance in a society that has lost its sense of personal and collective pride, and which has not yet turned the corner in the path of development. It speaks volumes about the inability to grasp the imperatives of living with others, sharing community spaces, protecting and conserving a culture, many cultures, to enhance a latent, plural civilizational strength. 																					Need to work hard																					Till this country disciplines itself by adhering to the laws that govern it, there will be no true progress. The two-steps-forward-four-steps-back syndrome will continue to haunt us. The ensuing status quo will stall us from becoming an economic, political and cultural world power to reckon with. The sad truth is that we are being restrained by political and administrative failures that could have been easily avoided had we, as a people, demanded and compelled good, clean governance. There is nothing else stopping India from becoming a dynamic, modern nation.																					With a generational shift and change in priorities and aspirations, we have another opportunity to shift gears and make radical corrections. If those public servants carrying the baggage of a restrictive past  in which creativity and personality were suppressed, where the self-serving administrators and political class dominated a helpless mass of people  are forced to abide by the law, be honest, live and work by the norms, be accountable, be made to resign if wanting, India will move away from the parochial and exploitative sensibilities of the present generation of rulers.																					When Rahul Gandhi speaks of building the Congress cadre across India, he is right in his diagnosis of the disease that has afflicted the party and in his belief that the medicine to cure the chronic ailment lies in addressing the base of the party. What leaders have done to the grand old party over the decades is criminal. Their personalized form of political governance kept out the best and brightest from the party, leaving it bereft of intellectual wherewithal. 																					The young in politics need to work at rebuilding the base. But additionally, and in parallel, they also need to deal with the present realities of a rapidly changing region and world. Time and tide waits for none, and to get off the bus to fix a puncture elsewhere would be disastrous. Therefore, this generation of politicians and administrators will have to make fundamental corrections and, at the same time, work the present dynamics positively.

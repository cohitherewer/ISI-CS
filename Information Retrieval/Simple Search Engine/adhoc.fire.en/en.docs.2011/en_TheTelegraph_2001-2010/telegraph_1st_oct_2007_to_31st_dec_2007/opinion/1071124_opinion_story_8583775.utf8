							 																						Lightness in layers 
 VISUAL ARTS - Aveek Sen																														What you are holding now, as you read this review, is paper. Yet, how aware would you normally be of the stuff between your fingers as you take in the words and images on its surface? Of all the things that make up our everyday lives, it is air and paper that most readily allow us to forget their material existence. In the fine arts, paper is the least self-important of media. Layers, showing Anupam Chakrabortys works in handmade paper (Galerie 88, until today), is a sophisticated exploration of the essence of this ubiquitous, versatile, but self-effacing medium. 																														Chakraborty calls this essence paperness, a quality that is physical as well as aesthetic. Inseparable from the raw materials and processes of papermaking, paperness is also formed and informed continually by inventiveness, thought and imaginative play. Hence the show creates its own lightness, which is the lightness of paper itself, and filling up just about one room and a half, Layers might even almost be risking slightness. But that, too, is of the nature of works in paper  to not press too heavily on the eye or obtrude upon the consciousness, but make the viewer look closely at, and reflect on, its textures, patterns, shapes and contours, and then stand back to contemplate the larger designs. 																														These are works in, rather than on, paper. And the prepositions are important. The shows title invites the eye to go beyond the habit of grazing the surfaces of paper in order to read whats on it, and look instead into the paper itself, to discover the layers that deepen and complicate its apparent thinness and flatness. Paper thus becomes, in Chakrabortys hands, a subtle and complex thing in itself. It is a process as well as a product, embodying its own making, its myriad relationships with natural and human forms and substances. 																														Earth places a pear and a dry wild fruit against a background of fig-and-cotton-rag-fibre paper. The fruits look real and solid, of a different texture and substance from the paper they are fixed to. Yet they are hollow and cast in paper too  shell-like paper structures that are created by a process that involves filling and emptying, soaking and drying, bleaching and dyeing. Similarly, the Victim series, Aftermath, Birth, Crche and In the Zoo create illusions of fleshed out forms and contours with, and within, paper by pressing and moulding the original pulp in different ways. 																														At one level, this is like sculpture or relief, exploring the shape and feel of fruit, leaf and fibre, of mangled hands, umbilical cords and the bodies and movements of caged animals, the plumpness of pillows and the firmness of mattresses. But their foregrounded paperness also turns these works into studies in the essential characteristics of the medium itself. What does it mean to be brittle, fragile, dry, flat, light, translucent, thick, thin, bleached or dyed? How, and out of what, are these qualities produced and varied? And how do they make up the spaces that we inhabit, the bodies we live in and the art we make? When the fruit, fibre, seeds, bark, leaves or stem of figs, pineapples, mulberry, cotton, bananas or ladies fingers are transformed into cityscapes lit by lightning, into English and Mughal gardens in blue, green and grey, or a couple making love in the moonlight, latticed windows lashed by rain, and the shimmering greyness of a storm, then the realms usually set apart as Art, Nature and Life become part of an organic unity. 																														There is, therefore, an implied vision of ecology in Layers that seeks in the art and craft of making paper a way of running together the artificial and the organic. Thus each work attempts to create a fluid and eclectic balance between idea and medium. Rain (picture) is a visual pun on a technical term in papermaking  the watermark. It places delicately coloured vessels out in the rain to suggest the harvesting of rainwater. A watermark can be seen only when the paper is held up against the light. And the flattened, translucently overlapping forms of the vessels are not painted on the surface of the paper, but are actually embedded in it as the watermark. So are the polka dots lodged within the material of the beds in Crche, or the uneven deckle-edges of the paper segments layered into one another in the Garden series. 																														Chakrabortys work is inspired, among others, by the Japanese-American artist, Isamu Noguchi, who started to make his Akari lamps in the Fifties, bringing paper, light and space into uniquely modern, yet traditional, relationships with one another. For Noguchi, akari or lightness connotes illumination as well as weightlessness. His words on this special quality of mulberry-bark paper are perhaps the best description of what Layers attempts to do with this poetic, ephemeral and tentative medium: Its very lightness questions materiality, and is consonant with our appreciation today of the less thingness of things, the less encumbered perceptions.

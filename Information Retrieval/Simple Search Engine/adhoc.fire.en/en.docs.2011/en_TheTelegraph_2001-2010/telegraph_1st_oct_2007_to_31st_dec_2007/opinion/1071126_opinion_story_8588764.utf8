							 																						NEW TARGET																														It was Friday again. But this time the lethal blasts did not take place in a temple or mosque, train, bus terminus, market or mall. A total of six time-coordinated explosions took place during lunch-hour in civil courts in Lucknow, Faizabad and Varanasi. The intelligence failure seems to have been total, since neither the state police nor Central intelligence agencies had any inkling of the bloodshed, deaths and devastation that were imminent. Yet, in the threat broadcast through a television channel from a source calling itself Indian Mujahedin minutes after the first explosion, there were suggestions of a clear-cut plan of revenge. The message claimed that the three extremists whom the police arrested in Uttar Pradesh recently on the charge of having plotted to abduct Rahul Gandhi were innocent. Besides, lawyers had physically assaulted them when they were produced in the Lucknow court later, and had refused to represent them. This is not the first time this has happened in UP; Faizabad court has been the site of debates over representing extremists and of the lawyers violent reaction to alleged terrorists. The price of that has been high.																														The routine has fallen immediately into place. The Bharatiya Janata Party is strident against the soft stand of the United Progressive Alliance, which, it claims, is giving terrorists an easy playground. Intelligence agencies are struggling with names and trying to decide whether the latest attack is home-grown or otherwise, or a bit of both. Politicians are competing with one another to announce compensation. But one question needs to be addressed. The aim of terrorists is to destroy the fabric of democracy. Does that mean that the principles of democracy should not apply at their trial? To bring suspected terrorists to court as a part of the process of justice, and then have lawyers refuse to represent them is to subvert the process: it is the very trap that the terrorists are setting. Once violence is repaid officially by disorder, the terrorists have won.

							 																						CAN LABELS HARM? WORDCAGE - Stephen Hugh-Jones																					This autumn has brought southern England an astonishing Indian summer of dry, sunny, even warm weather. An Indian one? Why? Plainly not from West Bengal. The Indians concerned, as in Indian corn  maize, that is are certainly the Red variety, from the early days of what is now the United States of America. But exactly what they had to do with this sort of weather no one is sure; google the phrase, and youll find umpteen theories, none very persuasive, to explain it.																					More interesting is the way it exemplifies the loose use of national adjectives. Leave aside the fact that there are two sets of Indians, and not only in English; in the Portuguese or Spanish of Latin America, indio normally refers to that regions aboriginal inhabitants. Even east of the Atlantic, and indeed in the Caribbean, Indian can at will mean a citizen of India or anyone of Indian descent  whom British yobs will in turn call a Paki, whether his citizenship be Pakistani, Indian, British or indeed Martian, so long as his face is brown.																					South Asia has hit back, more amiably, by describing any white face as European; which in Europe can equally mean from Europe or, increasingly, of the European Union; and in Britain, even now, it often implies, specifically, from mainland Europe. Americans, or at least their official documents, weirdly represent us white faces as Caucasian  a throwback to some barmy 19th-century race theorist that must irk real Caucasians, especially those from Georgia, whose own national adjective has been appropriated, in America, for the US state of that name, and in Britain for things, typically furniture, dating from the reign of George III.																					British English often makes uncomplimentary use of other nations adjectives.One may display Dutch courage (that given by alcohol), take French leave (to slip away, exactly repaid by the French in their filer  langlaise) or use a French letter (enough said). We use Irish for anything that works just the other way from what youd expect: like the electric kettle I once met whose warning light showed red when it wasnt switched on. Must be Irish, I said to my wife  and indeed it was. We make fun of a German sense of humour, Italian punctuality, American values (yes, granted there are Britons who take that phrase at its face value) or indeed British efficiency. Around 1970, we invented old Spanish practices for the arcane work-rules found in heavily unionized industries to minimize labour and maximize pay. 																					These ruderies are harmless enough. Not always so the confusion, mostly in non-English languages, between citizenship and descent. In many cultures, notably those of central and eastern Europe, a national adjective defines not just your passport but something much older, your ethnicity. The hyphenated American  Polish-American, say, or Irish-American  derives from this tradition. But to Britons it was bizarre to read, in English, of Hitler differentiating between two kinds of his countrys citizens, Germans and Jews. Not so in German. Nor even to some of his victims: I have a wholly pro-Jewish book published in Jerusalem in the Seventies that speaks nostalgically of pre-Hitlerian Germany and its many marriages between Jews and Germans. Look how that ended, and theres a warning to any Briton who thinks Paki just a piece of disagreeable but basically harmless mislabelling. THEWORDCAGEYAHOO.CO.UK

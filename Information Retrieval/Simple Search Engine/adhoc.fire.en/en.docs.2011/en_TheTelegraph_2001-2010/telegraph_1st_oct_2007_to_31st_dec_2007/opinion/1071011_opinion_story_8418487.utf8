 WHERE SPIRITS MAY KILL OR HEAL 
 - Purulias folk healers and their alternative system of  cure
 MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR In Purulia, the ojha is  a closely-guarded secret, the letting out of which to non-believers  is tantamount to sacrilege. More trusted than qualified  medics, these folk healers have been sustaining a system  of health that, in the absence of informed diagnosis, has  survived for generations on a sort of unimpeachable faith.  The two most common responses to the incomprehensible are  fear and awe. That explains the deification of the ojha,  and perhaps, why, seeking an interview with one ended up  being quite a quest. Politely shooed away by locals  at Bari, some way from Purulia town, for having enquired  about their ojha and expressed a desire to watch him at  work, we stopped at Kenda, a neighbouring village, but were  directed to the post office at Hariharpur. A handful of  clerks could hardly contain their disdain at the interest  of two city-bred women in their village seers. The ojhas  protect us with their lives. They transfer their inner power  to bring us back to life from the jaws of death. They suffer  a depletion of energy in the process. You may see the ojha  today, but tomorrow he may be gone, having given up his  life for the good of Man, exhorted Ajit Singh Patho, careful  not to disclose the ojhas location. The caution with which people  spoke in every village may have had something to do with  news reports mentioning, for instance, the death of snakebite  victims when ojhas had failed to revive them and had instead  delayed the administering of anti-venom serum at health  centres. A snakebite is hushed up for fear that the curse  of Manasa, the goddess of serpents, might have befallen  the family. An ojha must be called in and the curse dispelled  through a ritual appeasement of the goddess. Whether the  patient lives or dies, the ojhas word is usually final.  Since he is able to direct the communitys sentiments, blame  is attributed to the unknowable, or occasionally, to a particular  person. We were told that this could be a woman of substantial  means, who would be labelled daini (witch), and have  to pay compensation for a death she did not cause.  From diarrhoea to infertility,  the ojha claims to be able to cure everything. He depends  on spirits and chants for his treatment, sometimes complementing  them with herbal medicine. Nayan Mukherjee, a doctor and  the secretary of the Paschimbanga Vigyan Mancha (Purulia  branch), conducts awareness campaigns along with health  activists in the villages, trying to dispel myths about  miracle-working ojhas. They perform the same magic tricks  that the ojhas do and explain the science behind what is  perceived as supernatural. At Panipathor village, a group  of women debated among themselves whether we could be trusted  enough to be taken to their ojha. While one emphatically  denied the existence of such people, two others giggled  nervously. Finally, a young man offered to take us to an  ojhas dwelling. At last, seated on a charpoy, under the  enquiring gaze of nearly 50 villagers, we waited for Gopal  Mahato, the ojha.  He appeared, blushing at the attention.  Unwilling to explain the nuances of his discipline, he spoke  of chanting prayers to deities to get rid of ailments, and  proudly declared that hed had a 100 per cent success rate.  He practises a ritual called jhar-phuk, where the  mantra to the deity is used either to dispel evil  spirits that have entered the victims body or just as a  prophylactic measure. Different ojhas follow different schools  of treatment, and Mahato scoffs at those who beat patients  to drive away evil. Neither does he practise exorcism, though  there are others who do. I ask him what I must do to get  rid of my phobia of snakes, and the entire village cackles  in amusement. He doesnt offer a remedy, but says, Ki  bolbo? Aage bishwaash korte hobe. (What can I say?  You must believe first). As the people nod in agreement,  it is clear that there exists in Purulia a parallel system  of cure that survives primarily on the strength of belief.  Treatment can be trusted only when conferred with the legitimacy  of faith. ROHINI CHAKI

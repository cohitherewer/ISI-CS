							 																						LEARN TO TRUST GWYNNE DYER																					Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli defence minister, is not a fan of Mohamed El-Baradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In fact, he wants him fired. The policies followed by El-Baradei endanger world peace. His irresponsible attitude of sticking his head in the sand over Irans nuclear programme should lead to his impeachment, Mofaz said in Washington, in early November.																					Mofaz was getting his retaliation in first. As he foresaw, the IAEA directors report on Irans uranium enrichment programme, released on November 14, said that Tehran was years away from an ability to make nuclear weapons. 																					Not only that, he said that Iran is complying with a work plan agreed with the IAEA last August to clear up the remaining questions about a project that the Iranians insist was only ever about making fuel for civilian nuclear power stations. How can you bomb a country, or even impose serious sanctions on it, if the head of the IAEA wont accuse it of seeking nuclear weapons?																					Well, you can if you really want to. It was the same Mohamed El-Baradei who reported to the United Nations security council on February 14, 2003, that We have, to date, found no evidence of ongoing prohibited nuclear or nuclear-related activities in Iraq. The United States of America and Britain insisted that their intelligence said otherwise. Iraq was duly invaded, and nobody even apologized when no prohibited nuclear or nuclear-related activities were found.																					El-Baradei must feel a strong sense of dj vu as his reports on Iran, four years later, get the same treatment in the major Western countries. 																					Bad guys																					For the simple-minded, the White House spokesperson, Dana Perino, offered an even clearer proof of Irans wickedness. Iran, she said, is enriching and reprocessing uranium, and the reason that one does that is to lead towards a nuclear weapon. Case closed.																					Apart from the eight nuclear weapons powers, four other countries already have plants on their territory for enriching and reprocessing uranium under IAEA safeguards. Argentina, Australia and South Africa are also building or actively considering uranium enrichment facilities, again under IAEA safeguards. So there was some rapid back-pedalling at the White House when a journalist inquired if these countries are also seeking nuclear weapons.																					US National Security Council spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, clarified the statement, Each country is different, but obviously Dana was asked and was talking about Iran. In other words, the proof that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons is in the fact that we know in our hearts that it is evil. 																					Irans goal, by its own account, is precisely the same as that of Argentina, Australia or South Africa: to enrich uranium for nuclear power generation under IAEA safeguards. This is perfectly legal, and indeed the inalienable right of every signatory under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (which Iran has signed).																					This same ability to enrich uranium for nuclear power generation also confers the ability to enrich it much more for use in nuclear weapons. So long as the IAEA safeguards are in place that wont happen, but if a country quits the NPT and expels the IAEA (as North Korea did in 2003), it doesnt take long to start making bombs. Its really a question of trust. Nobody thinks Argentina will do that; lots of people fear that Iran would.																					That is why the issue was transferred, two years ago, to the UN security council, where Western powers can declare Iran a threat to peace and impose sanctions on it, with the support of the Russians and the Chinese. Moscow and Beijing have complied twice, but they are unlikely to accept the harsher sanctions that the US is now seeking. The next step for the US may be a unilateral attack on Iran. Most Iranians dont believe that Bush could be that foolish, but recent history is not on their side.

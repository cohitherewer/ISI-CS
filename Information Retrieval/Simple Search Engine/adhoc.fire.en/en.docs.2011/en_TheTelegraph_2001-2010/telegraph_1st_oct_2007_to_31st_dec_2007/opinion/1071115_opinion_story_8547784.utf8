							 																						COLDNESS AND BLIGHT IN A WARMING PLANET An extract from Hiding Behind the Poor, a report by Greenpeace on climate injustice, shows how the poor will be the biggest victims of global warming Climate injustice is greatest for those with incomes below Rs 3,000 and least for those with incomes above Rs 30,000 Climate change is man-made. The globe is heating up due to the emission of Greenhouse gases, the most prominent being carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels. Historically, developed countries are the biggest contributors to GHG emissions. However, over the last few decades, emissions of rapidly developing economies like India and China have surged. In fact, China and India are ranked at second and fifth respectively among the worlds biggest emitters. 																														The next round of negotiations for the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol, covering the period after 2012 should start this December in Bali. Governments are busy debating about who to blame and who must commit to drastic emission cuts to save the world from climate change. But India at this point of time is faced by two sharply contradictory realities. On the one hand, there is a rapidly growing rich consumer class which has made the country the 12th largest luxury market in the world; on the other hand, India is home to more than 800 million poor people who are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. 																														A combination of geographical and social factors make the poor, a majority of whom are concentrated in warm tropical regions, most vulnerable to climate change. While most areas in higher and medium latitudes will still experience an increase in agricultural production up to a temperature increase of 3 degrees, areas in low latitudes will suffer from a decline in production when average temperature rise exceeds 1 degree Centigrade according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes 2007 assessment. Decline in food production and water shortage will be most pronounced in Africa and Asia, home to most of the poor people in the world.																														Being unable to afford any better, the poor are forced to settle in marginal or highly vulnerable areas  either drought-prone, or close to rivers and creeks, exposing their shelters and farmland to floods. This trend is very pronounced in densely populated areas of India and Bangladesh. With climate change leading to a further decrease in already scarce resources like arable land and water, poor populations are going to be pushed further to, or even over, the edge.																														The poor lack the resources, and are unaided when it comes to governmental support, to adapt to rising temperatures. Infrastructure like shelters and sea walls to protect poor people from extreme weather events and sea-level rise do not get funding. 																														With little access to a functional health system, poor people are also more susceptible to vector-borne diseases like malaria or dengue. The aftermath of natural disasters and its impact on human health (for example, stagnant water after heavy rainfall and floods leading to the outbreak of diseases) affect the poor the worst because of their lack of infrastructure and access to emergency health services.																														While the rich can invest in diverse assets, the poor only own one shelter and probably a piece of land and some cattle, all of which are affected by extreme weather conditions. Experience tells us that recovery from extreme weather events like floods and storms in poor underdeveloped areas takes far longer than in affluent areas. More often than not, even before they have sufficiently recovered, they are hit by the next round of disasters. Often, governments of poor countries lack the capacity to effectively rebuild infrastructure and provide support and relief to the poor to recover from the impacts. On the other hand, the population has a very low potential to adapt and recover. With no access to reserves or insurance, recovery is often completely dependent on support from governments or from NGOs.																														Indias overall average per capita CO2 emission is 1.67 tonnes. Besides the assessed emissions generated from energy consumption in transport and household, the personal carbon foot print also includes CO2 emissions generated from food and non-food consumption and additional overheads due to public consumption. The average CO2 emissions per income group range from 335 kg for the income class below Rs 3,000 per month to an average of 1,494 kg for the income classes above Rs 30,000 per month. The richest consumer classes produce 4.5 times more CO2 than the poorest class, and almost three times more than the average (501 kgs).																														While CO2 emissions from cooking fuel increases only slightly with rising income, the increase in CO2 emissions from household electricity consumption and personal transport with rising incomes is very pronounced. 																														An increasing use of electricity for lighting is already starting at low income levels and stabilizes for income classes above Rs 5,000. A far sharper increase of CO2 emission from lighting between the lower- and the higher-income classes has been mitigated by the use of more efficient lighting systems like tube lights and CFLs, which are not accessible to the poor because of their relatively high price. The considerably low rate of increase in CO2 emissions from household lighting clearly shows that lifestyle induced increase in electricity consumption is buffered by the use of more efficient appliances. 																														The use of inefficient lighting is responsible for 126 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year (7 per cent of Indias overall emissions). Making CFLs, tubelights and other efficient lighting systems accessible to the poor by massive price reduction and prohibiting the sale of inefficient lights like incandescent bulbs could cut these emissions by 95 million tonnes, achieving a 5 per cent reduction of overall annual emissions. 																														Air conditioning today only makes up a small proportion of the overall household electricity consumption. Due to its high price, it only starts to be used by income classes over Rs 10,000, but remarkably enough, increases steeply by 6.5 times up to the Rs 30,000 class. 																														But by far the most pronounced increase in electricity consumption and thus CO2 emissions from lower-income groups to higher-income groups is in the use of other appliances  including all the small electronic devices that make living more comfortable for those who can afford them. They range from DVD players to kitchen equipment and from mobile phones to computers. None of these products account for a really significant share of the CO2 emissions, but together they add up to 49 per cent of the overall household emissions of the greater-than-30k income class. Even with an increase in efficiency of all these products, the constant addition of new goods that consume electricity would drive the lifestyle of the greater-than-30k class over the limits of sustainability. 																														Individual CO2 emission from transport were split into two-wheelers, cars, buses, flights and other forms of transportation. There is a gradual increase in the use of two-wheelers resulting in an increase from 11 kg to 98 kg of CO2 per person. Use of cars is starting at an income of more than Rs 10,000 per month, and there is a massive increase in air travel for the income class above Rs 30,000 per month A study by the DFID predicts that the overall CO2 emissions of transportation in India could increase to 1,200 million tonnes in 2030, which is comparable to 70 per cent of Indias total CO2 emissions today.																														Three developments are crucial to limit the massive increase of CO2 emissions from the transport sector. Mandatory fuel efficiency standards need to be put in place swiftly so that the new cars entering the market use as little petrol or diesel as possible. Public transport systems like underground railways and efficient bus networks need to be built at least in the metros. A high-speed train network between big cities needs to be established to curb the dependence on air travel within the country. 																														Though all the Indian income classes stay below the world average per capita CO2 emission, unfortunately such a view misses out the third dimension of climate justice  that the global distribution of CO2 emissions needs not only to be equitable, but also sustainable. Todays CO2 emissions already lead to a steady increase of global temperature, and with a global population still rising, an average CO2 emission of 5 tonnes would drive the planet into a state of climate crisis.																														To achieve the needed reduction of global CO2 emissions to check climate change, average world CO2 emissions need to be brought down to 2.5 tonnes per capita by 2030. In India, 150 million people who today earn more than Rs 8,000 per month already emit more than 2.5 tonnes CO2 per annum. To create the space for the remaining 980 million people in the country to develop without heating the planet above 2 degree centigrade, needs ways to reduce the CO2 emissions of the upper 150 million people.																														Indian climate politics falls short if it only refers to national per capita CO2 levels. Developed nations need to cut their CO2 emissions not only to prevent climate change but also to give space to the developing world to catch up. The same is true within India; if the upper and the middle classes do not manage to check their CO2 emissions, they will not only contribute to global warming, they will also deny the hundreds of millions of poor in the country, those who will be the most severely impacted by climate change, access to development. As long as economic growth is not decarbonized, the simplistic view that economic growth will automatically result in an increase in prosperity for all stands disproved. It is now accepted by scientists and economists that increasing CO2 emissions due to economic development will destroy the foundation of millions of livelihoods on this planet. In order to build social justice in the country, India not only has to put pressure on the developed world to cut their CO2 emissions, it also needs to do its share to mitigate climate change. 																														So does India need to stay poor and should the burgeoning middle class stop consumption and abandon the new-found upward mobility? Not necessarily, if India manages to decarbonize its development. For 2003, India was ranked as the country with the 14th worst Carbon Intensity of Electricity production in the world. 																														But the high carbon intensity of energy production is not by accident, it is a deliberate decision of the government. Between 1990 and 2003, the carbon intensity of Indias electricity generation has already increased by more than 15 per cent. If the government moves according to its plans, the future will look grim. A look at the 11th and the 12th five-year plans shows us that the government is planning a major expansion of power generation through the construction of coal power plants. A revision of these plans is clearly needed. India does not need mega coal power plants that generate 4,000 megawatts. What is needed is higher efficiency, combined heat and power generation, transforming the otherwise wasted heat into cold air for air-conditioning, and most importantly, the switch from fossil to renewable energies like wind, solar and biomass. 																														But the potential to decarbonize the economy and consumption does not stop with power generation. The adoption of minimum efficiency standards for all products needs to drive the consumer markets so as to only make available energy efficient products. 																														Last but not the least, the rich need to acknowledge that their wealth and freedom to consume add to the increasing crisis and poverty of the poor. Lifestyles with excessive carbon emissions are similar to a smoker smoking in a room: they not only affect the smoker, but others around as well. It impacts mostly the ones who have contributed least to the problem.

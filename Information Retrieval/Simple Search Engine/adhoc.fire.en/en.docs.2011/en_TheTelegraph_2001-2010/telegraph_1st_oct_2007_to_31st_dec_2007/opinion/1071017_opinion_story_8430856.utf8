				 																Get real				 																																																				Sir  The ongoing series against Australia has shown that the Indians have made a mistake by fielding a predominantly young team against their famed opponents (Aussies raise game, Indians fall flat, Oct 12). For long, the Board of Control for Cricket in India did not care to find suitable youngsters to replace the three ageing, but performing, seniors. Board members are baying for the seniors blood in the hope that a young team would be able to win matches for India, as it did in the Twenty20 World Cup. However, Test and one-day matches are difficult to win, unlike T20 games. If the BCCI does not invest more time and resources in grooming young talent, Team India will die a premature death. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anil Kumar Choudhury, Kalyani

				 																																																				Sir  It is true that every cricket team, including India, needs young blood. However, what is inexplicable is the way experts and fans have started to doubt the batting capabilities of senior players such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. It is not every day that two of the three seniors fail in the same match, as was the case in Vadodara. However, they still have a lot more to offer to Indian cricket. Winning the T20 World Cup prompted many fans to build castles in the air. This form of cricket may fatten the bourses but it contributes nothing to the game. Nor is it an indicator of a players ability. Indias young cricketers have never performed well enough for us to rely on them. Since Tendulkar, Ganguly and Dravid have delivered for so long, Indian cricket fans should continue to stand by them. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The Indians are having a nightmarish series against Australia. Indian players have nothing to show off except their designer-wear and the lone and lucky win at Chandigarh. If the umpire had not turned down the appeal against Tendulkar, India would never have scored 300 in that game. Indian players had lost touch with reality after a young team beat the Australians in the T20 semi-final. Now, with the series lost, it is time for them to swallow their pride and learn some harsh lessons. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

				 																																																				Sir  After the T20 World Cup, many people equated T20 matches with 50-over games and expected India to win easily against Australia. The results of the matches have belied such lofty hopes. T20 is a hard-hitting game in which an innings lasts for 20 overs, whereas in ODIs, a batting side is expected to last 50 overs. This requires a batsman to have a proper technique so that he can not only score runs but also stay at the wicket. Quality and experience are necessary attributes to win ODIs. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The excitement and expectations after Indias victory in the T20 World Cup have come to an unexpected end. The Indian team still has some outstanding batsmen, but it does not have good bowlers or fielders. India will not be able to defeat a team like Australia in the near future. This is simply because the Aussies did not become world champions by fluke. They excel in every aspect of the game  whether it is bowling, batting or fielding. Not just that, the Indians have been doing badly in the department of planning and strategy as well. For instance, why didnt M.S. Dhoni promote himself and Robin Uthappa up the order after Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly had posted a decent score in Nagpur? Ganguly had once admitted that there is a lot of difference between playing Australia and England. Andrew Symonds had also stated that the Indians would be tested by the Australians. Their predictions now seem to be coming true.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  On October 11, Sachin Tendulkar made his 400th ODI appearance. He also holds an extraordinary batting record in both versions of the game. Therefore, it is difficult to understand why some of our pundits are demanding Tendulkars removal from the side. Even today, whenever Tendulkar walks on to the field, he is focussed and determined. Although Tendulkar is not as fit as he used to be, he plays much more responsibly than the younger lot. Tendulkar is, and will continue to be, a cricketing legend. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arighna Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  S. Sreesanth continues to behave badly on field. He should know that no one is indispensable. The speedster should be banned from cricket for two years at least to make him realize that pumping fists alone does not turn cricketers into great players. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

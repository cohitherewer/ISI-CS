							 																						IN SILENCE																														It is a weapon newly discovered. The people of Calcutta, rejecting all special labels whether political or professional, had persisted with vigils and protests with posters, songs and candlelight and an endless stream of signatures against the unlawful series of events leading to the tragic death of Rizwanur Rahman. The protest went on till the state administration was compelled to back down in its defence of police impropriety and get the Central Bureau of Investigation to inquire into Rahmans peculiar death. It was the same weapon, of silence expressing protest, that a huge number of Calcuttas people  some of the media are placing the estimate at 60,000  took up in a march from College Square to Esplanade on Wednesday last, to protest against the violence in Nandigram.																														There were many unprecedented features in the march beyond the numbers in which ordinary people joined it. By its nature, it emphasized the rejection of violence. There were no political banners, for the parties that oppose the Left Front government had been requested to stay away. There were posters condemning the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s action in Nandigram, and accusing the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, of having allowed this to take place. The actors, artists, film directors, writers and singers who had initially called the march had tried to go through the posters and banners that were carried so that nothing undermined the unity and sobriety of the protest. Some of these artists had made public their turning away from the CPI(M) and had been vocal in censure much earlier, after the March 14 killings in Nandigram. A few groups in the procession sang, but for the most part it was silent. And people held up for hours as the walkers stopped traffic, watched without impatience or ire. Celebrities created the first impact by taking the lead, and they were backed by scientists, researchers, scholars, teachers, journalists, lawyers, students from schools and colleges, the elderly and almost immobile, many of whom had never participated in a march before. There was an unmistakable message to the state government in that march, to the government of the people, one which its leaders can ill afford to dismiss by claiming that the numbers were made up by anonymous Trinamul Congress cadre, or defy by a counter-march the next day. At least an acknowledgement of the value of peoples opinion in a democracy would have become the chief minister. It is not just sad, but rather frightening, that this did not happen.

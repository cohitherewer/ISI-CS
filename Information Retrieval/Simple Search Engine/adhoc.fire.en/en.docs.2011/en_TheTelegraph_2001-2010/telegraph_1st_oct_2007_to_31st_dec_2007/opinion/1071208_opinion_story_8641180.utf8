																														Young peoples theatre continues to flourish in Calcutta, its variety offering local audiences a wide table to taste from. Often the target of unjust patronizing remarks merely because its practitioners are apparently not old enough to merit viewers going to the auditoriums, it now commands a lot more respect for the unusual ways in which youth treat theatre.
																														Barely out of its encounter with Pinters The Lover, the band of college students calling themselves Miraje took up their most difficult task yet selecting Old Times (picture) by the same author, probably the first-ever staging in this city. One of his mid-career classics, on the ambiguous remembrance of times passed by three intimately connected persons, it poses a challenge to 20-year-olds portraying characters twice their age. Inevitably, it lost some credibility on this count but that problem was slight compared to two major shortcomings: first, director Jhelum Ghosh edited too much from the original, thereby losing many of Pinters nuances; and second, she neglected the pregnant Pinter pause, not realizing how fundamentally those silences contribute to his plays force.
																														But I have always maintained that both actors and spectators gain from the choice of such a work as opposed to a lightweight entertainer. And there was enough electricity in the triangle on stage to vindicate this stand. Aditya Banerjee and Sohini Saha played husband and wife with the correct degree of ennui in their relationship, while Neha Malik packed her comparatively greater experience into the tougher part of the wifes best friend who also shared a mysterious something with the man. Pinters central themes came across loud and clear, of imagined memories becoming reality, of memory used as a brainwashing weapon, and of factual truth fading away because it is forgotten.
																														St James School is the educational institution that has consistently promoted the cause of school theatre in English over the last two decades. It deserves a standing ovation for giving such support, particularly to the musical, which demands much more expenditure than any other theatrical genre. This year, it sprang another surprise with its maiden Bengali musical, Satyajit Rays Hirak Rajar Deshe, dramatized and directed by Indrashis Laharry, who updated the fairy tale to the politics of Bengal today, of oligarchic industrialization. Without being heavy-handed, it proved a bold statement for a school drama.
																														Like previous Jacobean musicals, it was spectacular, lavishly produced and well-performed. I noted specially the natural talent in youngsters Paul Mondal (as Bagha) and Ronojoy Banerjee (the mad scientist). The weaknesses lay in the induction of a few outsiders who had no links with the school (such projects should be fully in-house) and a recorded soundtrack to which the cast lip-synced. The latter is a fake device imported from cinema, not the trademark of a stage musical. However tough it may be to sing live to live accompaniment, Laharry should implement it, for it brings a warmth and charm that even a perfect soundtrack can never replicate.

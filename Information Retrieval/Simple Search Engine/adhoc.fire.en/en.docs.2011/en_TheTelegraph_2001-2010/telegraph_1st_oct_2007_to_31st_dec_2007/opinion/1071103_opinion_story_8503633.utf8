							 																						THE SKELETONS ARE OUT Ananda Lal											 			 Theatre																														Bengali theatre has outed homosexuality twice in quick succession. First, Theatron presented a translation of Vijay Tendulkars historic Mitrachi Goshta, on a lesbian student he knew in his youth. Next, Bratya Basu directed his own Krishna Gahwar (picture), about a married man who discovers a latent gay passion. Curiously, both follow a similar pattern of rejection by the object of love and consequent destruction of the protagonist, witnessed by an involved but choric character.																														Let us consider Lok-krishtis Krishna Gahwar first, as it is an original work. Basu is no stranger to controversial subjects; indeed, he became one of the future hopes of Bengali theatre because he seemed ready to take on difficult issues unflinchingly, without political compulsions or doublespeak. Here, too, he blazes a trail  as author, auteur and actor  that may go down as the first sensitive and truly anguished portrait of a homosexual in Bengali stage history. His fifty-plus hero has a happy family but begins to feel irresistibly attracted to a tutee of his wife, and they enter into a relationship. Since he cannot understand his own emotions, he seeks help from a psychiatrist, in whom he confides everything.																														Intellectualizing the play as a reflection of physicist Werner Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, Basu parallels the confusion in his heros life with the impasse in the fortunes of a theatre group to which his daughter belongs. I harbour serious uncertainties about the audiences being ableto connect the uncertainties as intended, and recommend dropping the rehearsal scene, which kills the drama post-interval after a taut first half. The uncertainties in the romantic lives of the other family members (the wife drawn to a colleague, the children with their own affairs) do the job sufficiently. The actors of these parts  Rumki Chattopadhyay, Simita Kundu, Prasun Bhattacharya  support adequately, though Bhattacharya appears decidedly older than his father.																														Design contributes some brilliant moments to the production. Sudip Sanyal lights one episode in the doctors chamber from outside through window blinds; the resulting barred chiaroscuro on the faces look ambivalent as well as ominous to match the mood. But one could wish for better paintings from the heros partner. Satrajit Sarkars audiography perceptively borrows tracks from Pink Floyds Echoes to Don McLeans Vincent, though Scarborough Fair as prelude sounds quite inappropriate.																														Mitrapuran, re-translated faithfully by Salil Bandyopadhyay from the English translation, receives delicate handling from the relatively young director Trina Nileena Banerjee, which her lead actress, Dola Chakrabarti, virtually scuttles after an intense start by a ear-shattering rendition of the disintegrating Mitra, nearly touching jatra levels. Strength of personality does not mean over-the-top shouting. Everyone else, by contrast, remains subtle: her heroine-worshipping narrator (Joyraj Bhattacharjee, who could work a little more on his ageing), his boorish braggart roommate (Arnab Banerji), Mitras nave love interest (Prakriti Dutta Mukherjee) and her threatened boyfriend (Abhijay Gupta).																														Banerjee falters, however, in detailing the larger canvas. She ignores Tendulkars preface, which sketches a clear picture of Mitras costume, meticulously followed in other versions that have come here (especially since Tendulkars own script provides a few clues): a white saree, a plain borderless blouse with a collar, and white tennis shoes never any colours. Evidently, Mitra wanted to stand out in the crowd, almost in male white attire, which Chakrabarti does not, sporting normal colours. She bravely attempts to wheel a mans cycle in and out, which would have been impossible for her to ride wearing a sari. The slides projected on panels do not add much to the production. And while Sudeshna Dutta Chaudhuri sings classical vocals eloquently, the repeated Babul mora on the soundtrack amounts to an overkill.																														Both productions treat homosexuality empathetically and should not be seen as defeatist just because they end tragically. On the contrary, they expose publicly the social stigma that hounds those who feel the love that once dared not speak its name.

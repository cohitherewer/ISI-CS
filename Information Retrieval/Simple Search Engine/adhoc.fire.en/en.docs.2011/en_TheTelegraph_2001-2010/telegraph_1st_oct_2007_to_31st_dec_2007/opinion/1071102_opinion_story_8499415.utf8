							 																						LIGHT READING 							 - A sudden density of life				 	 Daumier, Don Quixote Reading																																																													The Curtain: An essay in seven parts By Milan Kundera, Faber, Rs 395																														An inspired, coffee-and-cigarettes chattiness drives this motley essay on the great novels of Europe and Russia. The paperback edition is light to hold, each of the seven parts is divided into short sections, and there are lots of Bohemian anecdotes and quite as many emphases and exclamations. The setting for this Novelists Table-Talk  the original French trippingly Englished by Linda Asher  is not the lecture theatre or seminar room. It has to be a caf in Prague or Paris  the two cities between which Milan Kunderas mind and fiction have always moved with their peculiarly restive lightness. Those familiar with his earlier writings on fiction  The Art of the Novel and Testaments Betrayed  will not find much that is substantially new in the history of the novel charted out in The Curtain. But the key has changed. The focus on the essentials (what only the novel can say) is more direct, and the sense of a specifically Central European crisis of memory, and therefore of identity (Where shall we go to find our face?), more overtly anguished.																														The curtain in the title is the magic one, woven of legends and their ceaseless interpretation, which always already makes up and masks the world for us. Only a few intrepid adventurers manage to tear through this curtain of re-interpretation. For Kundera, the great hero of the torn curtain is Cervantes, the first modern novelist, who sent Don Quixote journeying and tore through the curtain: The world opened before the knight errant in all the comical nakedness of its prose. The comedy and the nakedness, together with the prose that must be forged as their vehicle, are of the essence of the novel in its relationship with the actuality, and banality, of everyday existence. The novel would, from now on, exist among the ruins of tragedy, in the underbelly of the epic, and in the perishing of the lyric moment in anti-climax.																														The genesis of the novelist is, therefore, a conversion story: Saul becoming Paul; the novelist being born from the ruins of his lyrical world. And the after-glow of the lyrical becomes the soft gleam of the comical, and the unobtrusive light of humour glows over the whole vast landscape of life. It is this landscape that opens up when Don Quixotes lingering death does not keep the niece from eating, the housekeeper from drinking, or Sancho from being of good cheer, or when Tolstoy ends Anna Karenina, not with Annas suicide, but with Levins unremarkably happy life with Kitty. Annas story is thus placed in the vast space of the world where she finally melts into the immensity of time governed by forgetting. What Cervantes and Tolstoy, and later Kafka (about whom Kundera writes most brilliantly in The Curtain), would hold the mirror up to is the experience of life as defeat: All we can do in the face of that ineluctable defeat called life is to try to understand it. That  that is the raison dtre of the art of the novel.																														It is, however, a defeat through forgetting of a more devastating kind that constitutes the sense of crisis informing Kunderas essay. It lies like a core of silence in its celebration of the babble of art. This crisis is both subjective and historical. It lies in how the history of the European novel, and of European art in general, is constructed and then assimilated by the contemporary Central European novelist, determined by his aesthetic judgments and historical circumstances. The novelist must, through new discoveries, advance along the inherited path (Kunderas emphasis). As long as that is possible, he adds, As long as the inherited path still exists. And it is here that Kundera inscribes his political and geographic trajectory  his journey from Prague to Paris, and his little kidnapped countrys journeys between the Slavic and the European  into his history of novel-reading and novel-writing. In this, he must be both true to the exiles sense of displacement and deportation, and resist the lugubrious myth of the East European exile with the naturally self-leavening irreverence of someone born on All Fools Day.																														Central Europe, as distinct from the Germanic Mitteleuropa, is excitingly multicentric. It is a multilingual hodge-podge born out of a golden chain of revolts that, over forty years, eroded the empire of the East. For Kundera, nothing can be more admirable in the Europe of the second half of the 20th century than this inexorable beating down of Russian domination. Yet, it leaves the Central European writer tragically alienated from both the Eastern, Slavic world (those great Russians) and his entirely Western history that had never anything to do with Russia. So, in order to reclaim both, make them his own in his own way, the writer must avoid provincialism of the large and of the small nations, the inability (or refusal) to see ones own culture in the large context. He must, like Kafka, elude German as well as Czech nationalism. When the Russian world was trying to reshape his country in its image, Kundera had worked out his own ideal of Europe as maximum diversity in minimum space. The Russians no longer rule his native land, but that ideal seems even more imperilled now, so that the question now is not What is Central Europe? but We in Europe  who are we? For The Europe of Modern Times is gone. The Europe we live in no longer looks for its identity in the mirrors of its philosophy and its arts. This then is the great forgetting, leaving the writer to watch over the great miracle of Europe  its arts turning into their own history.																														This elegiac note, repeatedly sounded towards the end of the essay in the name of a forgotten Europe, burdens the playfulness of Kunderas history and theory of the novel with a heaviness that sounds predictable and quasi-profound at its most anguished. It ends up framing some of the best things in this book: its readings of Musil and Kafka (who, in The Trial, wanted to go down into the dark depths of a joke) as Europes terminal solitaries exasperated with the lyrical, and of the joyful irresponsibility of Fellinis last films, or its libertine Bohemian reminiscences, like making love to three different women in a single three-woman day that suddenly brought home to him the beauty of a sudden density of life. Confronted with the same crisis, Kunderas Tomas was cleverer than his creator. He chose what he did best in the face of death and forgetting  lightness.						AVEEK SEN

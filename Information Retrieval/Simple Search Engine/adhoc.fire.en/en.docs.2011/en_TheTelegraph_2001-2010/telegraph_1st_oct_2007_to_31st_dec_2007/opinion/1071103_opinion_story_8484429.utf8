				 																Dangerous ride					Sir  On my recent trip to Darjeeling, I was appalled by the peoples driving there. Previously, the hill drivers were a focused lot. Nowadays, most of them seem to be in a hurry to overtake each other recklessly. They do not bother about honking at sharp turns and keep chattering on mobile phones. Worse, they hardly ever switch on the headlights while at the wheel. None of the vehicles has proper fog lights and wearing seat belts is never considered. Unless strict rules and disciplinary measures are enforced, the hills will remain prone to accidents.					Yours faithfully,					 Rupak Ranjan Roy, Calcutta
					 Leading by example					Sir  Mamata Banerjees walkout from her Kalighat residence has proved, once again, that she is an upright politician (Mamata walkout, from own house, Oct 23). Thanks to her cotton-sari-clad image, Banerjee has managed to turn herself into a true leader of the masses. In India, instances of powerful and corrupt women politicians are not hard to find. We all know about Mayavatis weakness for diamonds or the lavish way in which Jayalalithaa celebrated her foster sons wedding. Banerjee, on the contrary, has always led an exemplary and frugal life, devoting her spare time to poetry and painting. It is unfortunate that she has now been forced by her brothers to leave her own house. The media should be careful not to sensationalize such a personal and painful issue. 					Yours faithfully,																															
Surajit Das, Calcutta

					Sir  It is not easy for someone to leave ones home, especially for no fault of ones own. Mamata Banerjee has enough political clout to be able to throw her brothers out of her residence. But she chose not to abuse her power, and left home on her own. It is a shame that her brothers have been taking advantage of her status as an influential politician. However, Banerjee has shown rare judiciousness in this case by choosing to move out of her house. Such a step has undoubtedly bolstered her integrity before the people. For years, politics has been conveniently turned into a family business. The Congress at the national level and Karunanidhi down South are a few examples of this trend. The fact that Banerjee warned her brothers against using her name to obtain favours distinguishes her from her colleagues. Banerjee has rightly pointed out that public figures should not give in to unjust demands made by their families. One only wishes that other Indian leaders were able to steer themselves clear of any kind of nepotism.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Mamata Banerjee has an impeccable track record as an honest and dedicated politician. With most Indian netas having nothing but murky scams to show for their careers in office, people have come to equate leaders with corruption. These opportunistic politicians could take a lesson from the Trinamul leader.					Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

					Parting shot					Sir  The picture titled A march and a marathon: the great Indian divide was a telling reminder of the fact that despite six decades of independence, the country still remains sharply divided into Bharat and India. The healthy GDP growth notwithstanding, the problems of poverty and illiteracy still remain. True, no country is free from economic disparity. But the disparity between Bharat and India is overwhelming and the gap is constantly increasing. While India revels in lavish marriages and shows of wealth, the lesser mortals of Bharat continue to lead wretched lives with no one to care for their uplift.					Yours faithfully,																															
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

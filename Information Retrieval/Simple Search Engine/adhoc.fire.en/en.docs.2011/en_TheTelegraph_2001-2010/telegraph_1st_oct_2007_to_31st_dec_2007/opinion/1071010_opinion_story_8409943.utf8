				 																Old prejudices				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitras article, Beyond the veil (Sept 28), is speculative and fails to convince. That the United States of America stands to gain by the nuclear deal is irrelevant. India does not expect the US or any other country to enter into an agreement that is not mutually beneficial. If, according to the deal, India is going to have less than even 7 per cent of its power from nuclear sources, the question of India becoming heavily dependent on nuclear power or on the US does not arise. Mitras estimate of $150 billion orders that the US firms will win over 20 years is a small amount compared to Indias national income, which is growing in excess of 8 per cent annually. Mitras argument of $70 billion defence purchases is inappropriate too since these can take place even without the nuclear deal. Mitra could not cite anything better than an article in The Economic and Political Weekly on the cost of nuclear power. As it is, the article does not reflect specialist knowledge on power-generation costs. Mitra is also wrong about the American nuclear lobby trying to make nuclear energy the centrepiece of energy expansion. Perhaps Mitra has forgotten that Indias younger generation is educated and intelligent enough to avoid sermons that are based purely on blind anti-Americanism.

				 																																																				Sir  A person with a little common sense knows that the search for an alternate source of energy is guided by the fear that, in a few generations time, the worlds oil reserves would be exhausted. That inevitable disaster will affect everyone, the rich as well as the poor nations. As regards Americas present requirement for oil, Ashok Mitra may kindly note that Hugo Chavezs Venezuela and Osama bin Ladens countrymen contribute the largest share to the USs oil imports out of dire necessity. Venezuela supplies the US with oil since without the US oil market the country will starve. It is necessary for the USs arch-enemies to sell oil to America to ensure their own survival. Buying and selling of oil is a basic economic imperative. Hence, during such exchanges, the interests of both buyers and sellers are involved. 				 																																																				Mitra further says that the Indo-US nuclear deal will result in defence purchases from American ordnance companies worth billions of dollars. This is a puerile argument as the purchases would not have suffered had there been no controversy over the deal. Besides, Russia is still Indias biggest defence supplier while Israel is currently the second biggest. As for the perennial leftist fear of losing national sovereignty because of the Indo-US nuclear deal, Mitra should know that the political leadership in India is not that stupid. 				 																																																				Indian Marxists complain about the loss of sovereignty when a US warship docks at an Indian port with our permission. But why are they silent when China claims parts of Indian territory? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  In Beyond the veil, Ashok Mitra has echoed Prakash Karats views, albeit with a different argument. It is not Karats fear psychosis of imperialism that has overwhelmed Mitra. His is the story of the Enron Corporation, which happened to be a nightmarish experience for India. Thousands of dollars were spent for the sake of a crooked organization that was finally shamed before the world. In contrast, Ashok V. Desai, in Building energy security (Aug 14), pleaded for nuclear energy to support the increasing energy requirement of a growing economy. Given the poor performance of thermal power stations, nuclear energy could be a realistic bargain. Moreover, signing the nuclear agreement was necessary for India to gain access to nuclear resources and appear as a responsible nation before the international community. The Lefts old prejudices are preventing it from taking a dispassionate and pragmatic stand on the issue. Its confusion is evident in the manner Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, himself an advocate of clean energy, has been oscillating between his call for US investment in Bengal and echoing Prakash Karats anti-imperialist cries.

				 																Under a cloud				 																																																				Sir  Dilip Vengsarkar has very rightly called a spade a spade and asserted that no one can be assured of a berth in the Indian team by virtue of seniority and past performances alone (Vengsarkar talks tough, Oct 7). Those two factors will not hold water any more, especially after India won the Twenty20 World Cup with a young team. Retaining the oldies denies young cricketers a place in the side. Besides, in order to win one-day internationals, one needs sprightly, fit players, not ageing superstars like the Gangulys, Tendulkars and Dravids. Therefore, it is time to remove the senior cricketers from the Indian team. Only that will make it possible to groom fresh talent.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

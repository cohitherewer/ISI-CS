				 																Malaise within				 																																																				Sir  Police and education are the two test cases used by Dipankar Dasgupta to prove his point about the problems that surface when one party is given absolute power in a state for over thirty years. Incidentally, these are the two most maligned areas of West Bengals socio-economic model (Logic of rot, Oct 10). It is more than just a misfortune that the citizens of the state have to look to its most corrupt body  the police force  for their protection. Education, too, has not been able to reach all strata of society, and the poor and marginalized are yet to seize the opportunities that a properly functioning educational system would provide. For those who are content with the meagre opportunities of education provided by the state, uninspiring and sometimes violent teachers offer little encouragement and do nothing to build a base of trust with their students. Given that public money is utilized more for corrupt practices by those in high office than in areas needing development, Dasguptas proposition that the coffers of the privileged should be re-distributed among the less privileged sounds a bit too utopian.

				 																																																				Sir  Given the scenario drawn up by Dipankar Dasgupta, it would perhaps be advisable for law and order to be taken out of the control of the state governments, and to be vested only with the Centre. This would ensure greater transparency in police activities and perhaps control the heavy politicization of the police force that is evident across states. Recent events have made it amply clear that West Bengal has successfully overseen the ruin of its police force, one that was in the past comparable to Scotland Yard. No worthy candidates are joining the force because there is no longer any impetus for conscientiously carrying out ones duty, and those who do so are sidelined from holding offices of importance anyway. 				 																																																				An independent ministry at the Centre is needed to look after all aspects of law and order in the country. As a first step, the government must implement the recommendations of various committees on police reforms.

				 																Body bold				 																																																				Sir  Cambridge University students working as call girls to pay for their high tuition fees is not only shocking, but also a shameful example of the lengths to which one has to go these days for a good education (Call girl shock at Cambridge, Oct 11). 				 																																																				Cambridge has recently been voted the United Kingdoms top university and is a name to reckon with in academia all over the world. Students graduating from Cambridge land plum job offers. It is ironic, though, that the path to job security and success must be paved with such a degrading compromise of ones morals. Those selling sex for the sake of an education are setting a bad example for youngsters who will find this an easy way to make money. The British government should surely look into this matter and provide more opportunities for part-time employment to students so that they do not have to sell their flesh to finance their education. Parents sending their wards abroad for higher studies must keep a tab on their progress and make sure that they do not have to fall into similar traps for the lack of finances.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The news item about students of Cambridge University working as call girls and strippers in order to fund their education was petrifying. It is a shame that even in a highly developed and wealthy country like the UK, such incidents abound. The British prime minister should have demanded the immediate resignation of the education minister for being so woefully unaware of such a situation prevailing in a premier educational institution. It is a blot on the British educational system. The fact that the students engaging in prostitution were granted admission to Cambridge in the first place shows that they were meritorious candidates. Their drive to complete their education at whatever cost is admirable, but not the means they have had to adopt to achieve this end. The British government and university authorities should ideally waive the fees of financially backward but deserving students. Money matters must never be allowed to hamper ones education. However, some students get involved in prostitution for some extra pocket money. This needs to be discouraged. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  India is perhaps the only cricketing nation that persistently believes in ageing, malfunctioning limbs and torsos (and heads too) wielding bat and ball and strategizing on the field. The trio of oldies  Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly  should now either get the boot, or leave the pitch to a young and fresh team. Sports such as cricket and football demand both physical and mental agility. A slight slip, a moments lapse can be fatal. Older cricketers, therefore, find it increasingly difficult to maintain the highest levels of performance even though they are experienced. Younger players do need to be guided, but how long can a team accommodate rapidly ageing non-performers even if they are full of cricketing wisdom? It is time to sacrifice the talisman of experience at the altar of young blood.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.N. Ganguly, Calcutta

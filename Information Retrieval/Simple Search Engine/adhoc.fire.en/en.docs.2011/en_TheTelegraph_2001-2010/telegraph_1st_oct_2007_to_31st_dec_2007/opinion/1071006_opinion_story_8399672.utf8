							 																						ALLERGIC TO AMERICA this above all - khushwant singh 				 	 Anarkali Bazaar, Lahore																					I have always been a leftie and a fellow-traveller. I was an active member of the Civil Liberties Union, a communist front organization and my first foray into the literary world was a small booklet in praise of Stalin. I canvassed for a communist candidate against an Akali in the Punjab state elections during British days along with Sohan Singh Josh and Teja Singh Swatantra, both of whom occasionally milked me for cash. I gave shelter to communist leaders on the run: Dange, Ajoy Ghosh, and Danial Latifi. I mention all this as credentials of my being a communist sympathizer. I remain so to this day, as I share many of their views on subjects like the negative role of organized religions, revulsion against religious and caste distinctions, the need for revolutionary changes in society by levelling of classes, the unhealthy adulation of money-bags  and much else. But I no longer subscribe to the politics pursued by Indian communists and am particularly dismayed by the line chalked out by the general secretary of the CPI(M), Prakash Karat, on the proposed Indo-US nuclear deal and the joint naval exercises with other nations, including the United States of America. The Indian communists allergy towards everything American is juvenile; their enthusiasm for everything Chinese because China is ruled by communists is pathetic. Not only will it cost them dearly in the general elections to come, it will boost reactionary elements in our country. Prakash Karat, who has become the one-man thinktank of the party, will have much to answer for. I am sure many members of the party he leads disagree with him. The rigorous discipline they impose on themselves does not allow them to open their mouths. Even so, the communist chief minister of West Bengal and its legendary ex-chief minister, Jyoti Basu, have questioned Karats opposition to the deal.																					The problem is simple. We urgently need more electrical energy to meet our growing demands for civilian use. Neither thermal nor hydro-electric power can meet these demands. Nuclear energy, on the other hand can, and the US is willing to help us produce it. The deal in no way compromises our rights as a sovereign, independent State. On the other hand, the Chinese betrayed our trust, we fought a war against them, which we lost, and they still lay claims to some of our border territories. Is it not in our interest to have the worlds most powerful nation and democracy as our ally?																					The brouhaha created over joint naval exercises makes even less sense. All nations which have naval fleets periodically have such exercises to learn from each other. Many of them, including the US have more advanced techniques which our naval personnel can profit from. In no way do these gatherings of warships, aircraft-carriers and submarines encroach on the sovereignty of any country.																					Prakash Karat needs to think again; otherwise his tenure as general secretary of his party will be brief and forgettable.																					The alphabet, Lahore style																					I am an Indian Lahoria. Lahore was my home till August 1947; I would have been living there still but for the partition of the country. When Indian Lahorias get nostalgic about the city they lived in and loved, the first thing they recall is Anarkali Bazaar with its long rows of nondescript stores and eateries. What Chowringhee is to the Bengalis, Chandani Chowk to Dilliwallas, Mount Road to Madrasis, Marine Drive to the Mumbaikars, and Char Minar to the Hyderabadis, Anarkali is to the Indian Lahorias. Pakistani Lahorias dont share the same nostalgia for Anarkali with us. For them the heart of the city is Bhati Gate; its inhabitants the elite of the metropolis.																					I received this information from a Pakistani Lahoria settled and homesick in the US who has compiled an ABC for Lahoris. I quote some of them:																					A is for androoni shehr, the inner city. 																					B is for Bhati Gate. Anyone claiming to be Lahori has to come from Bhati Gate. This is where the kite-flying festival of Basant is at its highest pitch.																					C is for Cloney: Gulberg Cloney, Defence Cloney and so on. These are colonies where Bhati Gaters have settled.																					F is for Fackage. Though it sounds like a bad word, it is just the front of a building with backside being the backside.																					H is for Ho jayega Badshaoe. The moment you hear it, you can be reasonably sure it will not happen.																					J is for Jeevay Punjaab and if there is one person who knows how to live life to the fullest, it is a Punjabi from Lahore.																					K is for Koi gall nahi or never mind.																					L is for LhoRe, and Jinney LhoRe nai wekheya oh jammeya ei nahi  he who has not seen Lahore was never born.																					N is for No problem ji. The same as under H.																					O is for Oye which can be a surprise  Oyye!, a greeting  Oyy!, anger  Oyy! or pain, Oy oy oy.																					P is for punj mint, which is any length of time but never five minutes.																					W is for Whan, as in Whan (when) I was in Lundun.																					X is for many X-rated words that flow freely in all Punjabi conversations, mostly starting with teyree or ohdi and with the words for sister or mother often tossed in between!																					Y is for yaar  anyone who is wanted for help or free favours.																					High price for hero worship																					A policeman was suspended from 																					service																					For in violation of departmental																					bar																					He shook hands with and hugged																					Sanjay Dutt, his favourite filmstar.																					Everyone aspires to meet a celebrity																					May he be a godman or a thug																					No wonder, a friendly cop																					Went out of his way, a convict to hug!

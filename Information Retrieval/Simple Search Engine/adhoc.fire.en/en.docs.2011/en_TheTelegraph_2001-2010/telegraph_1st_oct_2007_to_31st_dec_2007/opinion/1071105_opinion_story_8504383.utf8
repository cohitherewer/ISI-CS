				 																Difficult times					Sir  Five years ago, Narendra Modi had recorded a thumping victory in the assembly elections. Things are different this time around though. The Gujarat chief minister is facing a tough challenge, both from a rejuvenated Opposition as well from his detractors in the party. What is also significant about this years polls is that the outcome may well have a determining effect on the general elections in 2009. Modi was once seen as the man responsible for the turnaround in the state. He is also revered by Gujarati Hindus for having taught the Muslims a lesson. The public opposition to Modi and to the Hindutva lobby is muted, not only because of the fear of a backlash but also because the claims made by Hindu fundamentalists have become received truths for many Gujaratis, thanks to years of indoctrination. Modi sounds confident of victory, possibly because his party has managed to make inroads among large sections of the electorate, including the Dalits and the adivasis. However, Modi cannot afford to be complacent. His past misdeeds will surely haunt him, till he gets to see the election results. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Today, Gujarat is facing another Emergency. Nobody can speak the truth in the state. Those who dare to speak their minds are termed rebels. The chief minister has turned a blind eye to the state of affairs in Gujarat. This has prompted even Bharatiya Janata Party old timers such as Keshubhai Patel to come out in the open against the chief minister and the party high command. The decibel levels are rising, and voices are being heard against Narendra Modis autocratic style of functioning. Some BJP members seem determined to throw Modi out, even at the cost of their political careers. Ironically, even the Hindutva brigade has now turned its back on Modi. The BJP high command may be heaping praises on Modi. But the fact remains that Modi will not find it easy to win the polls this time.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Narendra Modi is a shrewd politician. Modis cunning was evident from the ease with which he managed to evade questions on the Gujarat pogrom at a summit organized by a newspaper recently. Modi, apparently, is obsessed with peoples welfare in his state. Then why is it that the apex court once compared Modi with Nero for the formers indifference to the plight of riot victims? This time, Modi has been banking on the slogan of development to win votes. But, in Gujarat, development has not touched every life. Nearly 10 per cent of villages without electricity are dominated by Muslims, according to reports in the media. This certainly raises doubts about Modis notion of collective welfare.

Faridabad					Sir  Narendra Modi has done a lot of work for the people of Gujarat. Gujarat has recorded an impressive industrial growth. Its foreign exchange inflow and investment rate are better than that of many other states in the country. Yet, the Congress and its allies are hell-bent on tarnishing Modis image. Congress leaders have questioned Modis secular credentials and accused him of being biased against Muslims. But the truth is that Muslim leaders in Gujarat have seldom voiced their grievance against Modi. 					It is not difficult to understand the Congresss grouse. In Gujarat, the party has no record of performance. Hence, it invariably raises the boggy of secularism to try and catch votes before every election.The Congress is also guilty of instigating Muslims to oppose Modi and his party. Congress leaders have also sown seeds of dissidence in the BJP camp. Unsure of winning the elections in a fair manner, the party is now desperate to weaken the BJP by luring away its members. It has even enlisted the support of dissidents such as Gordhan Zadaphia, who was the home minister during the disturbances in 2002. The Congress has accused the BJP of playing with the emotions of the people. Nothing can be further from the truth. In fact, it is the Congress which is guilty of appeasing members of the minority community only over the years. 					Most political parties in this country are unconcerned about peoples welfare. They are only interested in exploiting issues such as that of development, secularism or even the nuclear deal to win votes so that they can come to power. In a country where criminals are not punished but welcomed into politics by leaders who, then, utilize them as potent weapons to pressurize voters, one cannot even imagine a free and fair election. As such, the words secular and communalism will continue to be misinterpreted for petty political gains. This has the potential to devastate the countrys social and political fabric. But does anyone care?					Yours faithfully,																															
Danendra Jain, Ranchi

							 																															A CHANGING MARKET				 Bookwise 				 	 Hit the target				 																														All authors, almost without exception, complain that their publishers havent done enough to promote and market their books. And the litany of their complaints have a similar refrain: their books are not visible in bookshops and libraries; there have been few reviews; field representatives do not always carry their books for promotion and so on. All of this is reflected in the annual sales returns and poor royalties. How much truth is there in these charges and what have been the publishers responses? 																														Authors and publishers have always had a love-hate relationship. The terms of endearment when the contract was signed cools off once the book is put on the market and the rumblings begin. Besides, the market is very fickle and changes almost like the seasons.																														Authors believe that price is the key factor to determine demand but it is not the only factor: relevance and timeliness matter as much, at least in India. There is no such thing as impulse buying; general reading for entertainment is for the marginal reader, who does not count for much. For the Indian customer, entertainment is provided by the television and DVDs; the pleasure of solitary reading is too antiquated a concept to be given any importance. However, authors firmly believe that their book is so unique that it will simply fly out of the shelves. And when it does not, they blame the publishers for the tardiness. 																														But this does not mean that the market for books in India is restricted. On the contrary, it is a constantly growing market and just two factors would testify to the dynamism of the book trade in the last five years. First, the presence in India now of every major British and American publisher: they have their offices here and own representatives to promote their publications and to scout for writers and professionals. Second, the very large number of new bookshops that have opened in the metros; they stock a very wide range of books on every conceivable subject. 																														What has made a huge difference in the book scene is the revolution in telecommunications. More and more books are being ordered online (which is why the best American and British bestsellers are available within a week of their publication in the West). Changes in printing technology have meant that books can be reprinted here under licence almost simultaneously with the original editions. 																														The changing market scenario, call it globalization of the book trade if you like, has one message for the publisher if he wants to survive here: the Indian buyer now demands quality, which means higher standards of book production, better intellectual content and more aggressive marketing. The old laid-back attitudes wont do any more. 						RAVI VYAS

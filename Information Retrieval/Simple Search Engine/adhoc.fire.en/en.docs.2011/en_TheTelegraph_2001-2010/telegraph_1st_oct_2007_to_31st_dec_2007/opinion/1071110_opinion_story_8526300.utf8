							 																						CANVAS IN CONTINUOUS MOTION Sujoy Das											 			 Photography				 				 A feel of the changing atmosphere 																														Photographer Soumitra Datta, who has been shooting landscapes for more than twenty years now, presents his current exhibition of colour prints, shot in both film and digital media, at the Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery. 																														These images photographed during the last four years  primarily in Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Sikkim, Karnataka and Gujarat  reflect the photographers keen sensitivity to the changing moods of nature. 																														In the style of landscape photographers of yesteryear, Datta mounts his trusted Nikon and Hasselblad equipment on a rocksteady tripod, stops down the lens for maximum depth of field and uses slow shutter speed to create a painterly effect. The soft luminescent light flatters the images.																														Interestingly, Datta has worked with slow speed colour negative film as opposed to transparency, which is the usually accepted medium, to take advantage of the greater latitude and tonal range of the negative that finds reflection in his prints. As a purist, Datta eschews computer manipulation of photographs and the digital images in the show have been displayed as shot. 																														An approaching storm over a flooded plain in Cachar, the patterns on the seashore in Orissa at dusk, the sun breaking through monsoon clouds in Purulia and the Silabati river at sunset in Midnapur  all reflect the photographers deep fascination with water and clouds, which form the mainstay of many of his images. Datta uses both pattern and texture to his advantage. The winter sun over the Jona falls near Ranchi and a view of backlit rocks reaching for the sky in Karnataka both stand out. Datta often prefers to use a low angle view with wide and ultra-wide lenses to create dramatic sweeping perspectives. However, there are a few hackneyed views of water gushing over rocks, which are a favourite with many photographers and might have been avoided. 																														There is a section of work shot on the Hasselblad XPan, which produces panoramic images eminently suitable for landscapes. A photograph of a river snaking its way across the plains of the Dooars in Bengal creates a feel of enormous depth, with the horizon stretching into a cloud-covered sky. Another view of the Teesta river and its banks ravaged by the harsh Sikkim monsoon portrays natures fury in eloquent tones of green and grey. 																														Datta says that the changing atmosphere merging into a place and disappearingputs the canvas in continuous motion. Indeed, to capture these fleeting moments, when light, colour, composition and form all come together, is special and Datta does it repeatedly with lan. 																														The exhibition continues at the Academy until November 11 and is worth a visit.

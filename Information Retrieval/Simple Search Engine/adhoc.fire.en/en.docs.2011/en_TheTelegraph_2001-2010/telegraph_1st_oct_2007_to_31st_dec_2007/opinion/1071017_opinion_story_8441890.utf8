							 																						ACT NOW																														One mans triumph is another mans exit route. The family of the late Rizwanur Rahman must be relieved that the Calcutta high court directed the Central Bureau of Investigation to inquire into Rahmans death. This has been the demand of Rahmans family ever since the tragedy took place. This actually provides an exit route for the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has procrastinated on the matter for far too long. It is significant that the high court has raised doubts about the legality of the only action the West Bengal government has taken on the issue  the inquiry by the Criminal Investigation Department. The judge, Soumitra Pal, observed that the CID was conducting the inquiry without registering a case and this was improper and unjust. The West Bengal government thus stands in a somewhat lurid light because of its perceived failure to act on the unfortunate incident with speed and propriety. The CBI investigation offers it a reprieve and an opportunity to retrieve a situation that appears to have spun out of its control.																														The West Bengal government has dragged its feet in instituting proper administrative steps to defuse the popular anger that has mounted after the mysterious death of Rahman. The time has come now to act politically. Mr Bhattacharjee must show the political resolution to act and punish the guilty. He should allow the CBI investigation to continue despite some of the valid constitutional reservations that might exist regarding a Central agency investigating into what is clearly a state subject. Simultaneously, he should not stay his hand with regard to punishing the police officers who have clearly abused their authority and may even be guilty of dereliction of duty. He should proceed against them swiftly, irrespective of whether the now invalid CID report lands on his table or not. Mr Bhattacharjee has done himself immeasurable harm by refusing to act. It probably took time for the gravity of the situation to sink in. His visit to Rahmans family was the first sign that realization has dawned. He should follow this up by acting fast and thereby establish control over the situation, which demands the exact opposite of masterly inactivity. There should be no need to remind him of the old injunction that justice must not only be done, but it also must be seen to be done. West Bengal expects the chief minister to do his duty.

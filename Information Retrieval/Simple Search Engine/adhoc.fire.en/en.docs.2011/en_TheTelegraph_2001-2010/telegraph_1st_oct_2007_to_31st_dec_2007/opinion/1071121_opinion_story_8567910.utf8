 Letters to Editor
				 																Sinister designs				 																																																				Sir  The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has been harping on the necessity of the Indo-US nuclear deal. However, he has remained silent on the non-nuclear energy potential that India possesses, but has hardly put in use (None can bend India, PM says to claps, Nov 18). Singh gives the impression that all would be lost if the deal fell through. However, the fact remains that our indigenous energy resources are immense, although the present output from these is relatively low. Our attitude towards indigenous energy resources has been one of indifference from the very beginning. This is evident from the fact that the ministry of non-conventional energy was set up as late as 1992 . The prime minister should create joint-venture projects involving the public and the private sectors and make them deliver the maximum quantity of energy from indigenous sources to secure Indias energy demands. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan have announced, much to the Union governments relief, that the Left will allow the government to start negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, the Left will not allow the agreement to be signed till it has studied the deal in detail. One fails to comprehend the legal and constitutional authority of Karat and Bardhan to involve themselves in such a strategic and sensitive issue. It is shocking to note Karat and Bardhan assuming extra-constitutional authority, and the government surrendering to their arrogance. The United Progressive Alliance has set a dangerous precedent by giving in to the Lefts pressure tactics, thereby jeopardizing Indias security. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subir Chaudhuri, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Left is confused, and, in turn, is confusing the entire nation. It has changed its stance on the nuclear deal a number of times and also threatened to pull down the government. Although Prakash Karat has allowed negotiations to start with the IAEA, the Left is unlikely to support the deal. Therefore, there is no need to waste time on such negotiations with the IAEA since the leftists will not allow the deal to be operationalized anyway. After all, they still oppose the Hyde Act. Karat and his friends are humiliating the nation and its government. The UPA should call for elections as that will be the only way to thwart the Left and punish it for its misdeeds. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Danendra Jain, Ranchi

				 																																																				Sir  Despite Pranab Mukherjees protestations, India has not only tilted but, in fact, has become prostrate before the United States of America. The US is so keen on the deal because it wants to dump reactors and technologies it does not use on our country. The deal would also give the US control over our nuclear programme through the Hyde Act. We are being told that India needs reactors for the required nuclear output. Then why is the government not accepting the Russian offer for reactors for the Koodankulam nuclear plant? The opponents of the nuclear deal and the media need to unearth the facts pertaining to the 123 Agreement and the Hyde Act. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

				 																																																				Sir  We do not yet know what good will accrue to India if the nuclear deal is signed in its present form, other than binding the country to norms imposed by the US. Such restrictions will be detrimental to Indias national interests. Buying a few outdated nuclear reactors that cannot be used in the US itself will not help us. Moreover, the costs of producing nuclear power are much more than those of thermal and hydro-electric power. The government should look at hydel, thermal and other unconventional power sources to meet our energy needs. Doing so will free India from perpetual economic and political subjugation. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.K. Choudhury, Kalyani

				 																																																				Sir  How can a political group with a nominal national presence hold a country to ransom for months? The Left has prevented the government from going ahead with the deal by threatening to withdraw support. The Lefts obstinacy implies that it is working against the interests of the nation. India requires a huge expansion in energy production to meet rising demands. Therefore, we have to harness energy from all conceivable sources. The UPA should do the needful in this respect and not worry about the Lefts threats. The parties that have compromised the nations security and exhibited a double standard would be duly punished during elections. But the Bharatiya Janata Party, which fathered the deal, should have the courage to stand by it now. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

				 																																																				Sir  The Left has cleared the grounds for negotiations with the IAEA only because the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is deeply embarrassed by the goings-on in Nandigram. India has long known the worth of the Left, which has always owed its allegiance to China or to the former Soviet Union. Left parties have also been guilty of using violence as a political tool. What is disappointing, however, is the prime ministers lack of nerve to confront the Left. He and his party did not have the courage to severe ties with the Left and call for fresh elections. 				 																																																				The Left had demanded a parliamentary debate on the deal all along. But it will not allow any such debate on Nandigram. Isnt that reason enough for Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi to call for the dismissal of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government? The Congress should go to the people and then press on with the deal after securing a fresh mandate.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R.K. Saxena, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Neither the UPA government nor the Left has bothered to tell us in detail about the pros and cons of the nuclear deal. Is it because no Indian legislator understands the deal in detail himself? Since The Telegraph has devoted considerable space to the nuclear deal since 2005, it would do its readers a service by enlightening them about exactly what we are to gain and what we will lose through the deal. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rabidra Nath Pandit, Calcutta

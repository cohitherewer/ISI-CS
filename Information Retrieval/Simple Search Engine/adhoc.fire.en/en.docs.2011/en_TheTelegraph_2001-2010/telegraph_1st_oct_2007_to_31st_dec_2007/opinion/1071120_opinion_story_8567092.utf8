							 																						ONE MORE TIME																														In a democracy, even a heated political controversy needs to follow certain codes  of decorum, propriety and taste. The comments on the governor of West Bengal by some leading members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have violated these codes. It is understandable that the CPI(M) leadership is displeased with the governors strong condemnation of what has transpired in Nandigram. But that should not give licence to public ridicule and abuse of the constitutional head of the state. There are available fora for the expression of displeasure. If the comrades are so angry with and so disapproving of the governor, the way is open to them to ask for his removal from the state. They made such a demand at least on one previous occasion when they had found the actions and statements of the governor not to their liking. But to publicly ridicule the governor is to demean the highest office of the state and is therefore unacceptable. The language used by Biman Bose and Benoy Konar against the governor was distasteful, and another example that even senior leaders of the CPI(M) have scant regard for the Constitution and its various norms and conventions. This malady seems to run rather deep within the CPI(M).																														The Telegraph has made the point in these columns that in West Bengal, the spirit and the conventions of the Constitution are being attacked from various sides and in various ways. It will not be an exaggeration to suggest at the present conjuncture that the CPI(M) has cast itself, in this regard, as the principal violator. Leaders of the party should be aware that a holder of gubernatorial office is above debate and the hustle and bustle of day-to-day politics. He cannot be treated as a political opponent and be subjected to the kind of unseemly humiliation and unparliamentary mockery to which a rival is, unfortunately, often exposed in Indian politics. It is the responsibility of every political party and every political personality to respect the dignity of the governors office. Too many people confuse the office with the person. The CPI(M) may not like Gopalkrishna Gandhi  although before March 2007, he was quite the partys favourite  but this should not be reflected in its attitude to the office of the governor. As long as Mr Gandhi is the governor of West Bengal, he has to be shown the respect that the office of the governor demands. There can be no excuse for doing otherwise.

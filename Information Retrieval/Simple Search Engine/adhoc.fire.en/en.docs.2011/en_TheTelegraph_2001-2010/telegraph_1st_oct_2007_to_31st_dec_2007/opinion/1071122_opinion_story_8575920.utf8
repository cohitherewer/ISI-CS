							 																						PEACE MUST RULE																														In a city notorious for its street violence, a mob on the rampage is not a new phenomenon. Yet yesterdays mob violence was different and ominous. Investigations will reveal what transformed an assembly in a part of Calcutta into a mindless exhibition of violence and destruction spread over a locality. It is ominous because the violence could easily have taken on a communal colour. This violence needs to be condemned in the strongest possible terms by everyone. There is no cause that can justify this kind of playing with fire. Those who can be identified as having participated in the violence should be given exemplary punishments within the legal system. The transition from assembly to collective violence is often the work of a handful of individuals. Such persons should be hunted out. The administration must be complimented for having acted with correctness and swiftness. It is never an easy decision in a democracy to call out the army to restore law and order, but the West Bengal government, realizing immediately the dangers inherent in the situation, did not hesitate to take the help of the army.																														There are moments that thrust responsibility on the people. Yesterdays violence was one such moment. While a particular locality of the city burnt, the rest of the city went about its daily business. This continuation of everyday activity reinforced what is the most urgent need of the hour: the immediate restoration of peace and normalcy in the affected area. All political groups and parties and all civil society organizations should work towards this end. As they will no doubt acknowledge, there is too much at stake here to nurture vested interests and to score petty debating and political points off one another. Calcutta can ill afford any show of violence, least of all any action that contains the seeds of inciting communalism. Public figures and groups, whether they like it or not, have a grave responsibility thrust upon them. They will fail in their duty if they fail this responsibility. There are welcome signs that parties and groups have already responded positively to this responsibility. In a democracy, the work towards peace and the restoration of the rule of law is always a continuous process. In a country like India, the process has many pitfalls. But to shirk from the challenge is to fail as citizens. Peace must and will reign in Calcutta.

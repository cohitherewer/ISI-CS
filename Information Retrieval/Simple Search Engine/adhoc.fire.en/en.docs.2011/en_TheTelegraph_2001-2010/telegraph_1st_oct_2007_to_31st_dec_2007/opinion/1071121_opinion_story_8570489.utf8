							 																						NOT SO DARK FIFTH COLUMN - Asfiya Aziz																					It is perfectly fine living under emergency in Pakistan. Everyone was quite apprehensive in the beginning, but then a few days passed and now nobody even remembers. At least not in Karachi. Of course, the leaders, barring a few, are protesting and fundamental rights remain suspended. We have also made a few adjustments to our lives. For instance, these days, my husband does not flash his press card at the traffic police ever so often. 																					Life without television news channels is quiet. For the first few days, we thought that we were being deprived of information. Two weeks into the emergency, I find that important news have their way of trickling in  from the internet, newspapers, through international news agencies, word of mouth or even via text message. What we have lost out on, in these two weeks, are mindless discussions and ideas being hurled at us like a vengeful meteor shower from outer space. 																					Is it a good idea to have 24-hour news channels? That too in a country where politics is the biggest live show? My friends in India can lose themselves in Bollywood. Here, in Pakistan, the most interesting thing the media have to offer are discussion programmes on politicians and politics. 																					I have heard politicians debating endlessly. Such exchanges end without a resolution, and seldom educate the viewer about the topic. Occasionally, there would be discussions on social issues such as an unresolved murder, or rising street crimes, or sometimes about a new commodity in the market, but prime time usually belongs to politicians. 																					Even politicians seem interested in putting their views across on television only. It wont surprise me to know that some of them have abandoned other forms of public appearances. I wonder how many times politicians in India have laughed and shed tears on camera, either sincerely or for effect!																					New questions																					I also wonder if the India media are as critical of the countrys government. I see how TV channels in Pakistan sometimes abuse their power by being unnecessarily critical of the governments performance. Perhaps it would be fair to say that we have imported the ideas of the press and its freedom, but not the associated notions of tolerance or the awareness which would make our people equipped to sift good press from bad. The scientific thought process required to carry on an argument until it becomes a well-formed opinion is also absent.																					Financially, we have improved. Economy is in a shambles...its only the aid money post 9/11 thats running the country, nothing else, says one knowledgeable bloke in my office. He must know, he has a major in finance. Yet, I find myself better off and able to afford luxuries that I could not even dream of under the successive democratic regimes of the Nineties.																					Street crimes have risen. Suicide bombings have arrived. Fundamentalists are rising in strength and numbers. The troublesome tribal areas are being alienated. Still, the vast majority of people in towns feel secure enough to attend social gatherings well past midnight. Every few weeks, a new company or service sets up shop or a merger is announced. The higher education commission claims to be richer by several million rupees. And only last week, my train-travel-veteran parents returned from an upcountry journey and informed that their trip was the fastest and the most comfortable in thirty years. 																					But I wonder why no one ever points these out and similar other facts, forcefully enough to matter at least, during the myriad discussions that take place round the clock in the media. So then, think of a discussion that leads to nowhere. Think of a question for the love of asking, not in the hope of getting an answer. Think of debate for the sake of it. And you have some idea of where we are. (THE AUTHOR WAS FORMERLY WITH THE NEWS, KARACHI)

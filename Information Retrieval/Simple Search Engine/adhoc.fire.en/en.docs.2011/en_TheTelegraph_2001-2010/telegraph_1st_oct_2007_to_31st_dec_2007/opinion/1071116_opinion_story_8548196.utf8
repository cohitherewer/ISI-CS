							 																															JUST A GLIMPSE OF THE MAN				 Editor's Choice 																														GRAHAM GREENE: A LIFE IN LETTERS 
																													 Edited by Richard Greene, Little, Brown, pound;10.99 																														There is a story made popular by the film producer, Alexander Korda, that Graham Greene wrote 500 words every day, irrespective of what he had done the previous evening. This explains the sheer volume of his output. Apart from the novels and the other creative things that he produced, Greene wrote a large number of personal letters. They run into tens of thousands and obviously form an invaluable source for understanding his life and his work. Many of these letters were previously unavailable even to Greenes official biographer, Norman Sherry.																														Many of these letters are brought together in this volume and are very meticulously annotated by Richard Greene, who studied at Christ Church, Oxford, and now teaches English at the University of Toronto. Apart from opening up aspects of Greenes personal life, the letters also offer a glimpse of Greenes many travels. He describes in some of these letters his journeys in Mexico, Africa, Malaya, Vietnam, Haiti, Cuba and other trouble-torn and obscure places. Greene loved danger as he chose to visit places that were engulfed by war, violence and disease. Many of these experiences then became part of novels that he wrote. It was this that gave to his novels a vividness that comes only from a direct exposure to reality.																														One of the great attractions of Greenes books is his mastery of the English language. His prose was in sharp contrast to that of his friend and contemporary, Evelyn Waugh. Greenes prose was austere and understated, while Waughs was rich and evocative. Yet Greene could convey passion and atmosphere  and in a few words. The plots and the settings of his novels were often grim and depressing, but this did not allow Greene to lose his sense of humour. He always noticed lifes little ironies and the bizarre dimensions. He could laugh at his own class: the public-school-, Oxbridge-educated upper middle class.																														Greene loved to take the viewpoint of the underdog. He wanted to be on the side of victims. He rejected, as the editor notes, all closed doctrines. He converted to Catholicism, but was never comfortable with Infallibility. His political positions shifted and changed. Despite all this, he claimed Kim Philby as a friend, even after knowing that Philbys treachery had caused many deaths. In a letter, he described Philby in the following terms: to me he was a good and loyal friend. Loyalty is not a word that one would readily associate with Philby. But Greene believed that loyalty belonged to the realm of the individual  he called it the human factor  rather than something impersonal like an idea, an institution or the State.																														The letters contain this humour in abundance. In his correspondence, Greene could often let himself go, more than he could within the confines of a novel. The letters are revealing, but they only offer a glimpse of Greene. The complete Greene continues to remain elusive.

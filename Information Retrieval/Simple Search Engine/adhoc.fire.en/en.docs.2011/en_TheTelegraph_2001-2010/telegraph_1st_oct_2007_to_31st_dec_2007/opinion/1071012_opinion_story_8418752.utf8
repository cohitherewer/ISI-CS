							 																						BROTHERS UNDER THE SKIN				 	 Richard Nixon: the madman																																																													Nixon and Kissinger: Partners in Power By Robert Dallek, 
																																																												 Penguin, 10.99																					They stand out as the odd couple. Richard M. Nixon, a Californian Quaker whose father worked as a conductor, farmer, gas station owner and small grocer, rose to prominence as a political slugger. The curriculum vitae of Henry Kissingers early years was very different. His middle-class Bavarian Jewish family fled Germany in 1938, relocating in Washington Heights, Manhattan, in an area called the Fourth Reich. Heinz morphed into Henry, and cruised into the front line of American academia.																					The political bruiser and the Harvard intellectual loathed each other. Nixon snidely dubbed Kissinger Sir Henry, called him a crybaby, a dictator and suggested that he should see a psychiatrist. Kissinger called Nixon a madman, a drunk, one unfit to be a president behind his back. 																					But Dallek shows that essentially the two were remarkably alike. Both wanted desperately to leave a deep imprint on history. Both were ruthless pragmatists who disregarded decorum, principle, and sometimes even the law, to get what they wanted. Nixon wanted to inherit the mantle of Woodrow Wilson as a great peacemaker, and indeed his foreign policy brought an end to the Vietnam war and opened dialogues with China. Kissinger wanted to bathe in the glory of brokering these deals, as a Metternich or a Bismarck  and more. He could not become the president as he was not born in America, but, as he once joked, he could play emperor. 																					For his book, Dallek makes extensive use of newly declassified material  pages of national security documents, Nixons secret tape recordings and transcripts of Kissingers phone calls. All these provide innumerable anecdotes and entertaining quotes,which are interesting to read. But the use of these materials is also the definite drawback of the work, as it seems almost entirely filled with anecdotes, which are stitched together to form a lengthy political picaresque. 																					Nevertheless, whatever opinions Dallek does express are sound. Nixon and Kissingers blend of ideological flexibility and monumental egotism produced bold advances in foreign policy, of which the most important is the opening up of relations with Communist China between 1971-72. Dallek praises the duo also for initiating dtente with Soviet Union, which, he argues, helped end the cold war by lessening Soviet hostility. 																					But the foreign policy scoreboard did rack up more than its share of lost opportunities and serious mistakes. The most disturbing facts relate to the way the end of the Vietnam War was timed. As early as in 1970, Kissinger saw that Vietnam was a quagmire, but sought to prolong the war to bring peace with honour. The ceasefire that was finally reached with North Vietnam in 1973 was not appreciably different from the one that could have been reached four years earlier. 																					Both Nixon and Kissinger seemed able to think of the world only in terms of the geopolitics of the major powers. Belatedly, Nixon and Kissinger pondered their response if the Soviet Union ever attacked China. So what do we do if the Soviets move against them? Start lobbying nuclear weapons in, is that what you mean?, Nixon wondered. Fortunately, China kept its troops in place, as did the Soviet Union, and the rest, as they say, is history. The third world war fortunately did not come about. 						SATRUJIT BANERJEE

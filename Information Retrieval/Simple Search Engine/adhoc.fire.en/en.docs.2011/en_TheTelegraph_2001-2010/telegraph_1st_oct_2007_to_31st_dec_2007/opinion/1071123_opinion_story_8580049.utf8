							 																						OF MANY NAMES																														The Gorkhas of Darjeeling have long debated who they are and how they can relate to Bengal or to the rest of India. Long before the rise of Subash Ghisingh, identity politics had been at the centre of public discourse  and popular movements  in the hills. But one politicians definition of a peoples identity can be a recipe for trouble by another. Mr Ghisingh thought he had decided, once and for all, who the Gorkhas were. He used his unchallenged supremacy in the politics of Darjeeling to persuade the Centre and the Bengal government to place the area under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. This constitutional provision has usually been applied to tribal-majority areas. Even when this was done, the application of the Sixth Schedule to Darjeeling raised serious questions about its wisdom. The manner in which a peoples ethnic and cultural identity was reduced to a political ploy was potentially dangerous. Neither New Delhi nor Calcutta thought it necessary to seriously assess the political and cultural impact of the decision. For both governments, it was primarily a political move that was expected to keep Mr Ghisingh from starting yet another violent agitation in a sensitive region on the Indo-Nepal border. 																														That large sections of the people of Darjeeling did not approve of Mr Ghisinghs move was never in doubt. The series of bandh calls by his party, the Gorkha National Liberation Front, and its opponents now proves how divisive the move has been. Politicians may have their own reasons for trying to exploit this division. Mr Ghisinghs failure to make the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council an effective instrument for transforming the areas economy has disappointed even his loyalists and strengthened the ranks of his opponents. But it would be a bigger disappointment for the people if they have to pay for the politicians games. The memory of Mr Ghisinghs violent agitation for a separate state must still be fresh. Both the Centre and the state government need to isolate the larger issue of the Gorkhas identity from local politics. They should discuss it not only with Mr Ghisingh but also with leaders of other parties and even non-political groups. It is immoral for politicians to use violence in order to force an identity on a people. It is even more so for a government to submit to such politics of blackmail.

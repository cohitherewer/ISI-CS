							 																						FALSE MAGIC																														Of the various kinds of quacks, some are more dangerous than others. But the witch-doctor is the most dangerous of them all. He trades on the darkest fears of the human mind. Villagers are easy prey, because poverty and the lack of education and exposure make them so credulous that it is almost impossible to budge them from their faith in the supernatural powers of the witch-doctor. The lack of medical facilities in rural areas in West Bengal has certainly encouraged this faith, so much so that a victim of snakebite is often taken first to the witch-doctor even when anti-venom serum is accessible. This happened recently in a village in Hooghly district, and the 24-year-old patient died because of the delay in taking him to hospital. Families prefer the violent, almost sadistic, ministrations of the witch-doctor or medicine man to the hospital. No lessons in popular science have helped so far. Like hospital facilities, these lessons too are simply not enough. 																														The darkest fears of the mind include those of evil spirits and of enemies. Just as he supposedly exorcises evil spirits, he can also accuse people he dislikes or is paid to accuse, of thieving, abduction or of causing deaths and illnesses among humans and animals. Disbelief can erupt into a mini-battle. In Arambagh, Nikhil Mahato, who had succeeded in ousting a rival gunin by accusing him of having become a witch, was challenged by Tarakeshwar, a local young man. Tarakeshwar, a magician, and his friend Mangal, have been working to rid the villages in the area of superstition. The challenge show was part of that. But it degenerated into a clash between two groups of villagers, the believers and the unbelievers. The only hopeful aspect of this is the fact that it is now local people who are fighting against superstition and the exploitation by quacks.

							 																						TIME FOR A DECISION BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh																					Vijay Chowk in New Delhi, the epicentre of temporal power in India, and all the centres of administrative power in the state capitals are totally disconnected from the rest of India. It is an India that has been suppressed by perverse norms, an India that is the bedrock of arrogant leaders and their minions who are obsessed with the need to control, are isolated from the truth and unwilling to address the realities on the ground. If they had put in that effort, it could have accelerated change and growth as well as freedom and creativity of the mind. The early Nineties opened a window and revealed the myriad possibilities that could enhance the development of a nation that had been held back by a colonial power, replaced thereafter by a native power that operated much like the oppressor.																					As the vitality of aspiration and entrepreneurship unleashes itself on to the social framework of India, the intellectually inadequate rulers and their staff feel intensely threatened by the opening up of India, and the resultant connectivity with the larger world outside the parochial confines we have been imprisoned in by our elected representatives. It is embarrassing to watch our senior parliamentarians debate the nuclear deal in the Lok Sabha. It is shameful to subject the citizens of India to this pathetic political game-playing at a time when the people are searching for support and a better infrastructure. 																					The minuscule dose of pride that lurks in many of us dies when confronted with the theatre of the absurd that is repeated each day by the parliamentarians. The damage that this lot of irresponsible inmates has afflicted on our country is almost fatal. They must be made to pay a price for the malignant virus they have let loose into the body politic. However, despite them, Indians are finding ways to move on, defeating the self-serving plans of those who make, abuse and sometimes protect laws and policies that never converge with the truth on the ground or with what the people of this country want. The leaders of this country leave one aghast by the low standards of their knowledge. There are no heroes, as far as Indian political leaders are concerned.																					Reach out																					The contrast between the reality of this young nation wanting to break away from the restraining past and those who determine our future is stark. There is a rapidly growing demand for the United Progressive Alliance to govern India and not to spend valuable time governing the coalition, trying to appease disparate groups within the government, as they settle personal issues with veiled threats and political blackmail. Indians have seen through these childish games and are sick of being taken for granted and manipulated by those they have elected to power. If the Manmohan Singh government believes in a policy that will do good to India, it should stand by its position and if the government falls, so be it. There is dignity in that. It is getting increasingly undignified to be bullied by all and sundry who threaten. Reach out to the people, tell them the truth about such coalitions where debate, dialogue and consensus are replaced by blackmail tactics. 																					If the predictable election rhetoric is put aside and if a new, honest language is spoken, then fresh energy could be injected into a frayed and tired polity. Another generation of unknown but raring to go youths must get tickets to fight an election. The aged manipulators of politics within parties need to be put to pasture. Give the people a fresh lot of faces to choose from and only if that happens will we be able to say  a country gets what it deserves! We, the people, and the UPA government do not deserve to be held to ransom by Rajya Sabha members who have failed to win a Lok Sabha election! Enough is enough.

							 																						EMERGENCY STEPS																														These are awkward times for Pervez Musharraf. He cannot let go of his iron grip on the nation, now that he has managed, with so much difficulty, to stop it from slipping out of his hands. At the same time, he cannot turn a blind eye to the compulsions of being partner to a global coalition, especially if that entailed a threat to his own hold on power. Mr Musharraf, as is his wont, has taken recourse to the best possible option under the circumstances. He has promised to hold elections to the national and provincial assemblies in January, but has refused to withdraw the national emergency. The promise alone is supposed to fob off his Western allies, who have constantly been at his back since the declaration of emergency and have even threatened a cut in financial aid. Mr Musharraf has been faulted not only for taking an offensive unilateral action, but also for waylaying a cleverly-orchestrated plan for the return of democracy piggyback on his most patient political ally, Benazir Bhutto, who has been projected as Pakistans next prime minister. By sticking to the election schedule, Mr Musharraf would assuage the Wests moral pangs, silence an increasingly restive Ms Bhutto, and also show his willingness to go by the book. The suspended constitution of the country apparently asks for the elections to be held within sixty days of the end of the parliamentary term. 																														With the judiciary disabled, the press gagged and the opposition disarmed, one does not have to think too hard to guess how much freedom the people of the country will have when they are called upon to exercise their political choice. Given the high price the martial law and the just-amended Pakistan Army Act may impose on those suspected of treason or sedition, the president should have no doubts about having pliant and obedient national and provincial assemblies returned to him. The elections will also go a long way in robbing the pro-democratic protests in the country and abroad of steam. But the fact that the presidents allies had a major role to play in his decision will be seen as a chink in his armour. That perception will continue to jeopardize his States operation against the jihadis on the borders and in the heart of the country. It may also reduce his position in the army, on whose unflinching loyalty he depends to maintain his seat in the government.

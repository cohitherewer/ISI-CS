																														A two-piano recital in Calcutta is a rare thing since we all know that there are no really decent two grand pianos to be found in any one place. The Calcutta School of music has several antiquated pieces: a truly ancient original Steinway seven-foot grand, in semi-dormant residence at room number 4, scorned by one and all as a white elephant in tortured casing, and the prestigious and once-splendid Bsendorfer in the auditorium which pianists, foreign and local, have grappled with and reluctantly admitted respect for its sonorous bass notes, if not much else. 
																														When the CSM announced the piano recital by the duo, BdB, in association with the embassy of Spain in India, there was a rush for passes and a full house on December 1 at the Sandr Hall. This was not only because the erudite Calcuttan loves the music of Ravel, Albniz and Infante, but also in anticipation of seeing compatible acoustic pianos on the Sandr Halls modest stage.
																														BdB consists of two elegant people, Maria Jos Barandiaran and Maria Jos de Bustos. The duo was formed in 1990 and has won fame and adulation all over the world. Defined by the critics as a luxurious artistic entity, the two have a vast musical repertoire. Their performance contains vigour, skill and musicality, elements that are typical of their native country.
																														The programme began with the music of Ravel. A contemporary of Debussy and a Frenchman, Ravel tapped into the great masters, from Mozart, Liszt and Strauss to Schenberg, Stravinsky and Debussy. He developed a unique and romantic style, often displaying a curious illogicality and incorporating themes such as fairy tales, magic and legend. His Rapsodia Espaola, written in 1907, clearly indicates that he drew from the songs, tales and folklore of Spain. It is written with a choreographic vigour which lost none of its brilliance in the two-piano transcriptions played by BdB. Their frequent eye contact and smiles lent a fair degree of accuracy and synchronization to their playing. This four-movement work was followed by La Valse, a valse perhaps only in its triple-time content but written in a difficult notation, which was played with seemingly musical ease and humourous elegance. A 15-minute-long interval followed.
																														Mention must also be made of their costumes and presentation. In the first half of the concert, BdB appeared in magnificent black silk haute couture off-the-shoulder gowns with exquisite spiky-heeled footwear. BdB appeared dramatically for the second time in matching creations of red taffeta  a style rather curious to define but definitely fun  right down to their spike-heeled red shoes which brought a collective gasp from the admiring audience.
																														The Spanish composer, Isaac Albniz, (1869-1909) was a remarkable musical prodigy, having made his debut by the age of five and travelled through Spain and the Americas by the age of 15. His music is familiar to most guitarists. It contains a distinctive Spanish flavour manifest through the essence of Moorish songs and picturesque dances and fiestas. Two exuberant works of the composer, Triana and Navarra, were played with intensity and grace. Lastly, the exciting Andalusian Dances for two pianos by Infante, a contemporary work, once again typically Spanish in style and difficult to play, was executed  all three movements, Ritmo, Sentimiento and Gracia  with brilliant wit and elegant technique. Then, to a sustained enthusiastic applause, they played an encore, the ever-popular Ritual Fire Dance by Manuel de Falla.
																														BdBs mastery of keyboard technique, their musical skills, including phenomenal digital power, vanquished the rheumatic ailments of the two instruments they commanded. The double glissandos as well as the beautifully articulated passages made the two old grand pianos sing as they havent been heard to in years. Perhaps this will inspire greater use of these instruments in the near future, even as we hope to hear such concerts again and again.

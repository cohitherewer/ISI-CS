							 																						BRIDGE ACROSS THE DIVIDE This Above All - Khushwant Singh				 	 Men at play																					Vagaries of the Indian calendar are such that two important events in the birth and development of Sikhism fall on the same day this year: the birthday of the founder, Guru Nanak (1469-1539) and the martyrdom of the Ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur in 1675. Both shall take place on the full moon night of November 24.																					An important facet of Sikhism is the manner in which the faith attempts to bridge the gulf between Hinduism and Islam. Guru Nanaks first disciple and his lifelong companion was the Muslim minstrel, Bhai Mardana, who incorporated the gurus hymns into different ragas of Indian classical music. Nanak has many hymns on Isla- mic themes. I will quote a couple of them:																					Mehar masit sidak musalla																					If you would be a Muslim true																					Let your life these rules pursue.																					Let your mosque be the abode of kindness																					In it, spread your prayer-mat of faith,																					And as you read the Quran think of righteous acts 																					Let modesty be your circumcision your troth with God.																					And gentle acts the fasts you keep.																					Let the reward of good deeds be your Kaaba																					And truth your preceptor.																					Let the Kalima be your acts of mercy.																					And as you tell the beads of the rosary																					Says Nanak: The Lord will preserveyour honour.																					And, the second one: 																					Mussulman kahavan muskal:																					To be a Mussulman is not easy																					Only he who is one should make the claim																					He should first follow in the footsteps of the holy																					And accept their bitter words as sweet																					Rid himself of worldly goods																					As sandpaper rids iron of rust.																					A Mussulmans faith is to follow his leader																					Caring neither for life nor death;																					To believe that there is a God above																					Whose will is law,																					And abandon all thoughts of self.																					O Nanak, if the Creator is merciful																					Will you become a true Mussulman.																					The attempt at bridging differences between Hinduism and Islam continued till the Fifth Guru Arjun, who compiled the sacred text of the Sikhs, the Adi Granth in 1601. He not only included hymns of Muslim bhaktas and Sufi saints but also invited the Sufi saint Mian Meer from Lahore to lay the foundation stone of the Harimandir (todays Golden Temple) in Amritsar. He became the first Sikh martyr to bigotry. The second was the Ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur who was beheaded in Delhi in 1675. I quote one of his hymns which his son, the Tenth and last, Guru Gobind Singh incorporated in the final edition of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib:																					Jo nar dukh main dukhnahi manai:																					He who in adversity grieves not																					He who is without fear																					He who fails not in the snare of sensuality																					Who has no greed for gold, knowing it is like dust.																					He who does not slander people when their backs are turned 																					Nor flatters them to their faces																					He who has neither gluttony in his heart,																					Nor vanity, nor attachment with worldly things																					He whom nothing moves,																					Neither good fortune nor ill,																					Who cares not for the worlds applause,																					Nor its censure,																					Who ignores every wishful fantasy, And accepts what comes his way.																					He whom lust cannot lure																					Nor anger command,																					In such a one lives God Himself																					On such a man does the Gurus grace descend,																					For he knows the righteous path.																					O Nanak, his soul is single with the Lord																					As water mingles with water.																					(This is in Raga Sorath, the ninth of 31 ragas in the Granth Sahib.)																					Akhond of Swat																					The northwestern part of Pakistan seems to be breaking loose from the rest of the country. It is tribal, traditional and overly masculine: all the men carry guns, while the women stay indoors, only to emerge occasionally, enshrouded in burqas. Shariat laws take precedence over the Pakistan Penal Code. Two semi-independent regions, Chitral and Swat, had chieftains of their own: there were the Mehtars in Chitral, and the Akhonds in Swat. Swat, located in the midst of high mountains, is rugged country, full of rugged, handsome men fond of a good game of polo. Their women, no doubt, are good looking but they are never to be seen. Their chief, if he is still around, was immortalized by the great composer of limericks, Edward Lear (1812-88):																					Who, or Why, or Which, or What,																					Is the Akhond of Swat?

				 																Medicine woman				 																																																				Sir  One wonders at the chutzpah of Brinda Karat, prescribing the dreaded Dum Dum Dawai for the Lefts political opponents in West Bengal (Dr Karat prescribes dose for Didi, Nov 5). Decency and decorum apart, one doubts whether Karats clan has the prowess to administer the medicine. It is the leftist cadre which is regularly tasting the Dum Dum Dawai at the hands of Maoists, the Bhumi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee and ration-deprived masses. The Left leaders, instead of providing them succour, are resorting to hollow rhetoric.				 																																																				If the people of Nandigram cannot trust Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees assurance that no land would be acquired for the chemical hub there, then they can hardly be blamed. The chief minister has failed to keep his word on several occasions, such as when he promised to make the Calcutta Maidan the permanent venue for the Book Fair. The people may be justified in feeling that Bhattacharjees party has a hidden agenda in Nandigram.				 																																																				Communists believe that some day, the State shall wither away. Isnt that exactly what is happening in Nandigram now? Karat and her comrades should stop complaining and rejoice at this development. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

				 																																																				Sir  From Welham to Miranda House (Miss Miranda to boot) to JNU and to the politburo  it cannot get any more romantic than that. And now, with the feather of being a Rajya Sabha member in her cap, Comrade Brinda Karat has come a long way. She owes it to the state which has adopted her to give a call for public mischief and incitement for the kind of violence practised by her party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Perhaps to emulate the agnikanya of the state, Karat put her dainty foot in her mouth, asking the people of West Bengal to give the Dum Dum Dawai for solving the Nandigram problem, created, incidentally, by her own party. 				 																																																				Since she was talking at a conference of women of her party at Dum Dum, she probably found it smart to recommend a local medicine, without knowing what the Dum Dum Dawai was all about. This dawai was not a part of either the food movement of the Sixties, nor was it remotely connected with any land problem. It was merely a localized action in a couple of vegetable and fish markets in Dum Dum by some local people  not organized or sponsored by any political party  when the prices of some vegetables and fish shot up following the machinations of some greedy traders. Some local citizens came together to force the vendors to sell their stuff at reasonable prices. Not much violence was required to prevent the buyers from shopping from such vendors, may be a blow or two, and in a couple of days the culprits were brought to heel. But the name stuck, may be because it sounded good. It is still invoked whenever market prices soar to a disproportionate high.				 																																																				As Rudrangshu Mukherjee points out in his article, Left off the Constitution (Nov 7), Karats suggestion that the political opponents of the CPI(M) should be made victims of public wrath implies that the anger of the CPI(M) cadre is deplorable and against the law of the land. But alas, Comrade Karat has prescribed a wrong dawai. She could have given a choice to her followers, to administer a Chhoto Angaria, Panshkura or Keshpur dawai, may be all of them together! When someone as important as Karat promotes hatred and violence in this way in the presence of the chief minister, how can the Prasun Mukherjees and Gyanwant Singhs be expected to respect the Constitution and the penal codes? When a defeat of the police commissioner in a sports body election is considered a victory of evil over good, it is no wonder that the said police commissioner and his minions will cease to care about the Constitution and the laws of the land. But if the wheel of political fortune turns the other way, where will all these trophy leaders run? Maybe towards the US or Switzerland where a dacha or two are kept ready for them.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Susanta Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is most unfortunate that the Indian political scene has nothing to offer save mudslinging and personal attacks by politicians of all possible hues (Woman at arms, Nov 6). There is no longer any sense of decorum, only the zeal to ensure victory using means fair or foul. Bengal has lost considerable ground in the sphere of culture. Now it seems that the class of people reverentially termed the bhadralok (or bhadramahila), is also on its way to extinction.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The behaviour and conduct of politicians are important determinants of the peace and prosperity of a country. Most politicians do exactly the opposite of what they say. Politicians, and Brinda Karat could well be considered an example, certainly require treatment for what is nothing short of madness. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Brinda Karats outburst has come at a most inopportune moment, when she should have suggested a potent dawai and dhulai for her own party, riddled as it is with corruption and mismanagement. Karat must realize  if from nothing else then from the results of the JNU elections in Delhi and the Rizwanur Rahman case in Calcutta  that the popularity of the CPI(M) is on the wane. It will be better if she tries to cleanse her own party before preaching to others.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

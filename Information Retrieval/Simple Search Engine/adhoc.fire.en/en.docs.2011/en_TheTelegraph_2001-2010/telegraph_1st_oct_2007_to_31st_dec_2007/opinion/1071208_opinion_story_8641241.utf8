				 																Shut down and reboot
				 																																																				Sir  The front-page photograph of our Laptop Leaders on December 7 was most amusing. Of course, the MLAs carrying heavy cartons of laptops and printers was a welcome change from the familiar picture of their toadies holding umbrellas on their heads. Still, one fails to understand the use of giving laptops costing over Rs 70,000 to a group of people, most of whom are computer-illiterate. The Speaker should send the MLAs for a crash course on computer basics, after which there should be a test. Only those who pass should be given laptops at State expense.
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  I am quite surprised to find some Indian politicians insisting that the government of India save the persons of Indian origin who have allegedly been discriminated against in Malaysia. Twenty-six of them have also been charged with attempted murder after a policeman was injured in a protest rally organized by ethnic Indians in Kuala Lumpur.
				 																																																				If the government gives in to the demand by the politicians  which is motivated no doubt by narrow political interests  a lot of Indian taxpayers money will be wasted. What about Indians in other countries? What if they cry foul too? 
				 																																																				Ethnic Indians in Malaysia (or their forefathers) migrated to the country looking for a better future. And now they are citizens of that country. Which makes the present crisis an internal problem of Malaysia. Many of these people habitually play the India card when it suits them. Given a chance, they will probably migrate to a more developed country but not think of coming back and serving the country of their origin. They should try to understand the responsibilities of becoming a citizen of another country and carry out their duties towards that country with complete sincerity. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraphs cautious and judicious approach to the plight of ethnic Indians in Malaysia is commendable. It is sad to note that the Hindi and English news channels have been distorting some of the facts, criticizing the Indian community in Malaysia rather than supporting them in their hour of crisis. The Indians only demonstrated peacefully and demanded equal rights, which they should have got without asking. It is the government of Malaysia which has misused its machinery and is trying to put down an entirely reasonable movement. At the same time that our electronic media are pointing fingers at the Malaysian Indian community, they are showing hours of footage on crackdowns on pro-democracy demonstrations in Pakistan. If it is alright to express solidarity with the people of Pakistan in their fight to restore democracy, what could be wrong in sympathizing with the fellow Indians suffering in Malaysia?

				 																Parting shot
				 																																																				Sir  The results of the Part I examination of Calcutta University have come out. The number of dissatisfied students is very high, as anyone who has seen the long queue of students waiting for their review forms will tell you. The review system under CU is a huge farce, and nothing but a source of income for the university. The authorities have declared, as they do every year, that a different professor will be assigned to review a paper from the original examiner. But what is the use? The reviewer will simply check if all the answers have been marked and the marks correctly tabulated. This is a job at which the universitys clerical staff are better than a professor. What is needed is a professor to assess whether the previous evaluation was fair.
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
Prakash Dutt, Calcutta

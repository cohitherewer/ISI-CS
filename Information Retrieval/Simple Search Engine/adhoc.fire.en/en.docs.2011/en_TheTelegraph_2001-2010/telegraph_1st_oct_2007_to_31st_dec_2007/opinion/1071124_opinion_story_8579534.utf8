							 																						A recital to remember
 Music -  Fauzia Marikar																														Adam Margulies  the 23-year-old graduate of the Manhattan School of Music, now studying at the Metropolitan Opera House  is the recent winner of the prestigious Unesco-sponsored Orfeo Competition. He has been in Calcutta for three weeks, conducting master classes at the Calcutta School of Music in a gesture of musical friendship and generosity. The culmination of his musical experience here was a modest recital at the Sandr Hall on November 19.																														Adams strong and beautiful voice shows great promise. His programme consisted of short arias from the Italian opera of the 16th to the 19th centuries, mostly on the theme of unrequited love and anticipation. But Adams control of the dynamics, his articulate ornaments and portrayal of the bel canto style were extremely pleasing.																														The programme consisted of operatic numbers by the great composers of the era, beginning with Giordani and including Caccini, Paisiello, Caldara and Monteverdi. Bellini and four Neapolitan songs by Paulo Tosti and Eduardo di Capua were sung in the second half of the evening. Adam was accompanied on the piano by Avijit Kundu, a bright and promising pianist who proved competent in his debut as an accompanist to a professional singer.

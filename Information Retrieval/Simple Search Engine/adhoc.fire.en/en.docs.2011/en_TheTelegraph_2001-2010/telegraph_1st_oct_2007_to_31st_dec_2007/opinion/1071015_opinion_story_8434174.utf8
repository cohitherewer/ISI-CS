							 																						WEAK LINKS																														Friday prayers were held as usual at the Ajmer Sharif, although two people had died and many had been injured the day before in a low-intensity blast just when the fast for the day had ended with evening prayers. The shrine that houses the 750-year-old mausoleum of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti has always been revered by Muslims as well as by people of all other faiths. Perhaps there was something symbolic in the extremist strike on people just before the ritual meal during Ramazan. It was symbolic of failure. Typically, the killers had struck during a holy time that would have culminated in Eid. This ties the attack with the earlier blasts in Malegaon during Shab-e-Baraat last year and in Hyderabad in the Mecca Masjid during Friday prayers last May. The pattern apart, there are other clues, such as cellphone usage to set off the blast, that link the series. The horror mounts with the rising number of deaths, and with the repeated betrayal of trust. Yet, the Friday prayers at the dargah would also suggest the refusal of the people to be cowed, to let murderers destroy their spirit. More important, repeated attacks on a particular community at their most sensitive and unprotected moments could have resulted in distrust and hostility between communities. That it has not happened shows the desire of all communities to distance themselves from the killers. It is immaterial which faith religious extremists lay claim to; hurting people and destroying life are not part of any religion.																														But killers cannot be defeated by spirit alone. They have to be caught and punished, with the same regularity that they execute their assaults. Even before that, their attacks must be foiled as many times as possible. The most disheartening aspect of the latest blast is the continuing failure of Indias intelligence and police network, which is so very quick to discover links and rattle off names, but is unable to produce a single crucial suspect. Somehow every mastermind is somewhere else, and the executors of the masterplan invisible. Of what worth are links when the methods to set off the blasts can be easily copied and the explosive devices put together with accessible ingredients? The recitation of known names has become routine, but a barren routine to cover up failure.

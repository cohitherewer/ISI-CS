				 																General chaos				 																																																				Sir  President Pervez Musharraf has behaved most audaciously by declaring a state of emergency in Pakistan (Self-coup in Pak, Nov 4). It is alarming how protesters have been imprisoned, freedom of the press curtailed and the rule of law suspended throughout the country. Of course, such actions should have been expected from a dictator like Musharraf, who came to power through a coup. Recently, he tried to negotiate with Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif so that he could continue in power after the general elections. Failing to come to any understanding with them, he was left with one option.				 																																																				An undemocratic man to the core, Musharraf can never be expected to conduct fair elections. It is also difficult to fathom the United States of Americas response to the crisis in Pakistan. From time to time, George W. Bush has talked about the highest standards of democracy before the international community. However, when it comes to Pakistan, and particularly to Musharraf, he forgets all his noble principles. Musharraf is spared all censure, while American funds continue to flow into the country to help him realize his nefarious ambitions. The irony in the situation is that Bush is trying to fight terrorism with the help of the general, who supports the Inter-Services Intelligence.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Danendra Jain, Ranchi 

				 																																																				Sir  The complete breakdown of democracy in Pakistan calls for the intervention of the United Nations. It is pointless to expect the US to withdraw support from Pervez Musharraf. The only agents of change could be the parliamentarians, who could put pressure on Musharraf to restore democracy. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

				 																																																				Sir  The emergency in Pakistan was an expected outcome of Pervez Musharrafs indomitable desire to stay in power. Summarily banning the media, arresting lawyers, removing the countrys chief justice and throwing the constitution into jeopardy, all point to his dictatorial strategies. True, the general has defended the emergency as his way of containing terrorism. But was such a drastic move necessary to achieve this end?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Senior officials of the US government may condemn Pervez Musharrafs imposition of emergency, wail over the collapse of democracy, violation of human rights, rise of terrorism and so on. But unless they take some decisive action about these, cynics may be tempted to suspect that the US has an interest in the coup  perhaps to ensure that Pakistans nuclear resources are not misused by extremists. Such a situation would spell danger for the US.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The emergency in Pakistan could turn out to be the first major step to fight terrorism. What started as Pervez Musharrafs attempt to keep power to himself has now turned into a blessing in disguise. Since the US would now be cautious about the support it extends to Pakistan, Musharraf too would tread softly in his dealings with terrorists. This is especially so because one of the premises of his declaration of emergency is to contain military power. If there is even a grain of truth in his claim, then perhaps the flow of terrorists into India would also ebb. For the people of Pakistan though, this is not a rosy picture at all. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

				 																																																				Sir  Pervez Musharrafs decision to impose emergency has clearly been brought on by the imminent verdict (now void) of the supreme court on his right to contest elections, and the prospect of his losing the general elections in January. He has followed in the footsteps of dictators from history  suspension of constitutional rights, cutting of phone connections, censorship of independent media, detention and harassment of political opponents, journalists and lawyers, and finally, replacing the supreme court judges with those he can influence easily. One cannot envisage how an emergency and suspension of the constitution can now change the state of affairs in Pakistan. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Pervez Musharraf has found it difficult to hand over power to a civilian government even after he proved unable to govern the country peacefully. If the political classes in Pakistan do not unite in their challenge to Musharrafs unconstitutional action, the people will continue to be deprived of democracy for a long time to come.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

				 																																																				Sir  That Pervez Musharraf was destined to play his last card has been obvious since October 1999, when he came to power in a dramatic way. The international community has been watching how the general, over the years, has been extending his roles  from being the president to becoming the sole arbiter of executive power, and finally ruling the nation with a combination of both privileges. All along, he has been projecting himself as a lover of democracy, while treading the steps of his military predecessors. The issues invoked by Musharraf in favour of calling the emergency  taliban, internal security, terrorism  were just smokescreens to smother the voice of the judiciary. The role of the judiciary has been unimpeachable over the last few years in the way it has tried to oppose the dictatorial politics. If the lawyers remain steadfast in their determination to bring democracy into the country, the peoples war against the tyrant may be won one day.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Surajit Das, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  While it is a fact that Pakistans internal security is being threatened by Islamic militants  evident in the Lal Masjid episode Pervez Musharrafs decision to impose emergency only shows his desperation to cling on to power even as it was slipping out of his grips. 				 																																																				Benazir Bhutto conveniently flew to Dubai a few days after her dramatic comeback to Karachi, on the very day that emergency was imposed. The relative softness of the US administration also proves that the general continues to enjoy the support of George W. Bush, and that after the situation stabilizes, he will join hands with Bhutto to rule Pakistan together. The only hope is that the people may not take things for granted this time.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

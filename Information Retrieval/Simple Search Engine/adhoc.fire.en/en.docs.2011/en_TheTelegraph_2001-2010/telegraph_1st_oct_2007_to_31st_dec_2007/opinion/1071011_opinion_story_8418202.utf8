							 																						BETWEEN HELL AND HOPE Anusua Mukherjee finds that an umbrella, a makeshift bed and a hurricane lamp are essential for medical treatment in Purulia				 	 In the middle of nowhere																														Standing at the portals of the Bari block primary health centre in Purulia, I speculated whether this place was supposed to treat animals or humans. For there were at least eight to ten scruffy stray dogs on the premises  some scratched their mangy coats vigorously while others sauntered around or growled at the human population. I was told that these dogs are a menace to the PHC. So much so that among the three essential commodities patients visiting the centre come armed with, one is an umbrella that doubles up as a stick to ward off the strays. The other two are a khatiya and a hurricane lamp. The khatiya is brought to serve as a makeshift bed, since there is a perennial shortage of beds and the hurricane lamp is needed when the electric lights go off, which, it seems, they often do. 																														The presence of the dogs is alarming because a sizeable percentage of the patients brought to the centre are victims of dog-bites. But the patients and their relatives do not seem to be overly bothered by the dogs. I believe they cannot afford to bother because the dogs are only one of the many perils they have to take in their stride if they are to be treated at the PHC. It was dismally dark inside the building because, we were told, bad weather had cut off the power supply. There also seemed to be water everywhere. The medical staff complained that Brishti holei bhetore jol pore (water leaks in whenever it rains), since the roof has been in a state of disrepair for quite some time now. The umbrella that the patients bring gets the opportunity to serve its actual purpose after all. Given the situation, it is ironic that the PHC suffers from the lack of water supply. 																														The health centre also does not have a proper latrine. We found a patient of diarrhoea lying on a bare khatiya, with a pool of vomit beneath his bed. Just a few inches away from him was the flooded and stinking corner of the building that serves as the toilet.																														The resident doctor at the PHC, Ananda Mukherjee, obviously has to brave quite a few odds to treat the patients. His mobile phone keeps ringing repeatedly as he talks to us. He says apologetically that in the absence of a landline in the PHC, his personal mobile links him with patients from remote areas. Surrounded by health workers and harried relatives of patients, Mukherjee says that he conducts operations by the light of hurricane lamps or by torchlight when there is no electricity. He hastens to add that an NGO working with the PHC has provided the place with an inverter. But it stops functioning when the load-shedding continues for days. Mukherjee carries out all operations in the labour room because there is no operation theatre in the PHC. Only local anaesthesia and strong sedation are administered during surgery because the state health department does not permit the use of general anaesthesia for operations performed in PHCs. 																														Mukherjee emphasizes that health conditions have improved considerably over the years. As a result, rural people today would come to the PHC rather than visit the village quacks or the ojhas and gunins, as was their practice even a few years ago. Of course, entrenched belief systems take time to change, but if Mukherjees words are to be taken at their face value, then the joint effort of the gram panchayat and the state health department has succeeded to a large extent in dispelling superstitions and luring patients to the health centres. The prompt diagnosis of certain common ailments like tuberculosis, diarrhoea or malaria has helped in the containment of outbreaks of these diseases. 																														Mukherjee thinks that the problems that we see plaguing the PHC are there because the health system is now going through a transitional phase. The difficulties will soon be sorted out, he believes. Mukherjee asserts that he is helped in his work by a dedicated and motivated nursing staff and that community cooperation is excellent. But I wonder why he kept his eyes averted while mouthing the last phrase.																														Notwithstanding my cynicism, I couldnt but feel optimistic when I visited Purulia Sadar Hospital. Since Purulia is one of the poorest districts of West Bengal, I had prepared myself to face scenes here even more horrific than what I had witnessed in the Behrampore Sadar Hospital. But I was clearly in for a surprise. We saw a patient being carried in a trolley and by the hospital lift to the general ward on the second floor. Here suddenly things were as they should be and I couldnt believe what I saw.																														The deputy superintendent of the hospital, Tapan Maiti, says that the hospital has 65 to 70 general duty medical officers, besides having specialists for diseases like cancer. There are 506 beds but patients are accommodated on the floor if need be. In each of the wards we visited, we found a single patient to each bed. The patients were well-attended by nurses, who seemed clean, kind and capable. 																														The maternity and neo-natal care provided by the hospital is one of the best in the state, claims Maiti. A 12-bed neo-natal ward, which is the first of its kind in West Bengal, has been opened in 2003. Babies born with problems of any kind are kept in intensive care till they get better. While patients below the poverty-line get this service for free, others have to share the expenses 50-50 with the hospital and this comes to no more than Rs 75 a day. The babies who get better are shifted to the adjoining high dependency unit till they recover. The infant mortality rate in the district has fallen considerably, thanks to the facilities provided by the Sadar Hospital. 																														The blood bank of the hospital is well stocked, and this showed on the faces of the parents of the two children we saw being treated for thalassaemia in the general ward. The hospital has also created a fully air-conditioned 12-bed burns unit, which, however, has not yet been opened owing to the shortage of group D staff. 																														Maiti glowed with pleasure when we praised the way in which the Sadar Hospital is being run. But he is quick to warn us that things are not as sunny as they seem. He thinks that his capabilities as a degree holder in management studies are wasted in this place because the hospital employees refuse to be managed by him. Most members of the group D staff would prefer to sit and gossip or get drunk than do the work for which they are paid. But the slightest protest against their ways by the higher authorities could make all the workers go on strike, jeopardizing life in the hospital and putting the jobs of the officials at risk. The tendency to shirk duty is the vice of not only the group D team but of the doctors as well, who would rather see to their private practice than treat the patients in the hospital. 																														Maiti says that his plans for the hospital are also thwarted by the system of rules and protocols that makes the passing of even the simplest order a hopelessly long-winded process. A pile of mattresses in front of the maternity ward has been gathering dust, damp and urine for the last three years because the papers instructing its removal have not yet been cleared. 																														As we prepare to leave Purulia Sadar Hospital, I look back and discover the line May I help you? written in bold letters over the entrance. In the context of the dreadful sights we have been witnessing in the hospitals and health centres of both Behrampore and Purulia, this mundane line suddenly acquires a special poignancy. Are patients coming to the Sadar Hospital somewhat cheered up in their misery if they happen to read these promising words, I wonder. I search the faces of the people for an answer and find a blankness that seems to signify the abandonment of hope.

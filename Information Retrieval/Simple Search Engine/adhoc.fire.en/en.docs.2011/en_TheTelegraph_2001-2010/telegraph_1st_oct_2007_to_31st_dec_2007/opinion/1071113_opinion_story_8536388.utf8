The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor
				 																Tall tales					Sir  One cannot discount the need for fair journalism, which seems to have inspired The Telegraph to carry the Todi familys version of the Rizwanur Rahman case (The Todi story, Nov 7, 8). However, the account of the Todis seems hollow and untruthful. The Todis are eager to present themselves as ordinary people caught up in a sordid tragedy not of their making. But the version leaves many questions about the Todis active involvement in the affair unanswered. For one, it is doubtful if Ashok Todi ever had any plans to settle the couple in Delhi or Mumbai later. Had he such plans, he would not have filed an abduction case against Rahman. Besides, were the good intentions ever communicated to Priyanka and Rizwanur? Second, while Priyanka was being taken away to Tirupati, why did she not tell her husband about the development? A few words from Priyanka while she was in Tirupati surely would have soothed him. 					Readers will continue to remain unconvinced by the Todi story until the Todis themselves clear some of the confusion created by its telling. Till then we will continue to believe that a hapless young man was coerced towards a ghastly end in which money and muscle power played their role.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  At a time when people had nothing but only negative feelings for the Todis, their version of the story served to turn the tide in their favour. The account of a few days reveals that Ashok Todi was a loving father who was devastated by the news of his daughters marriage to a stranger. One shudders to think of his ordeal on August 31, when Priyanka did not return home from her class at the Arena Multimedia centre on Chowringhee. Till it is proved that Ashok Todi is responsible for Rizwanur Rahmans death, we must refrain from blaming him. 					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  To suggest that the Todi story has some holes would be an understatement. It appears to be a sieve. I am sure that Ashok Todi, apprehensive of the future of his younger daughter after Priyankas marriage to Rizwanur Rahman, could never have thought of settling the couple in any other city. I am also sure that Ashok Todi wants no member of his community, who, in all probability, share his mentality, to believe the story. The story should have carried a note saying, Exclusively for the consumption of the unbiased, middle class of Calcutta.					The Todi story is not without humour. We are familiar with rich and powerful men like Ashok Todi threatening to finish off poor suitors. But in an amusing reversal in the story, it is the Todis who seem to have received threat calls from a faceless man called Sadique. And in truly filmi-style, Ashok Todi conveniently fell ill when his daughter refused to leave the Tiljala home. Predictably, he got well when she returned. 					Poor Priyanka is getting crushed between facts and fiction. Her father snatched away her future and her in-laws are not sending the photographs that could have provided her an opportunity to revisit a happier past.					Yours faithfully,

					Sir  Each and every line of the story as narrated by a person close to the family of the Todis seems geared to the specific purpose of attracting public sympathy. But the gambit has failed. Priyanka appears to have agreed to stay on with her parents after Ashok Todi asked her to think of the future of her unmarried younger sister and cousin. She, strangely, also believed that her separation from her husband would last only as long as her parents confirmed his credentials. Why then did she tell Rizwanur that he would have to wait indefinitely (even forever)? Was she testing his love or had she suddenly become unsure of her own intentions?					It is unfortunate that The Telegraph has published a story that aims at justifying the Todis actions. The Todis are perhaps trying to influence the ongoing investigation, and the media seem to be helping them. 					Yours faithfully,																															Dibyendu Chakrabarti, Calcutta					 Sir  The man close to the Todis says, We as a family were desperate to get Priyanka back home, even if it was for a few days. The statement is baffling. If Priyanka was happy with her husband, why should she have been brought back even for a few days? She could be claimed back by her family only if the marriage had been annulled or the husband had died. As it turned out, the latter happened. Priyankas story seems to have worked out precisely the way Ashok Todi had wanted it. The Todis cannot absolve themselves of their responsibility for Rizwanur Rahmans death by publishing misleading stories. 					Yours faithfully,

					Dark thoughts					Sir  Badrud Doza, senior lecturer in genetics at Amritsar, has re-confirmed the obvious  skin colour is among the most significant factors that influence attractiveness in India (When she sways hips, dont be swayed, Nov 9). But the pragmatism behind the obsession is more economic than evolutionary. Indian men, over the ages, have fancied dark girls. From Draupadi to Bipasha Basu, most sex icons in India have been dark. But Indians are yet to get over the colonial hangover, and thus the preference for fairness. 					Yours faithfully,

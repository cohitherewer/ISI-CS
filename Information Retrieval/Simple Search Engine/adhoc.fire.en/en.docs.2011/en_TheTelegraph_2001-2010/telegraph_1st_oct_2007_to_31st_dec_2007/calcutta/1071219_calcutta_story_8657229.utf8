 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC), known for producing the best brains in finance, has turned to the industry for a course on a new branch of marketing.
																								From the second week of January, three senior managers from Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) will share their experience with final-year postgraduate students at Joka for a paper on relationship management in marketing. 
																								The idea is to expose students to relationship management, which is a new area, not only from a theoretical perspective but also in terms of practical application, said Rohit Varman, a visiting professor at the B-school.
																								The CTS managers will take up case studies and provide industry insights over 14 sessions in the sixth semester.
																								The executives will also provide inputs on how technology is adapted to meet management needs and tools of relationship management in real life, added Varman.
																								Classes by working executives are not new to students of marketing at the institute. Senior level managers from Hindustan Unilever are taking classes on marketing in practice.
																								The course tries to help students develop an appreciation for decision dynamics in the practical world of marketing in India. It exposes students to the dilemmas faced by managers in making decisions in a competitive environment. 
																								Marketing in practice focuses on topics that are not traditionally covered by theoretical courses.
																								Supply chain management is taught under operations but it has a marketing interface. The interface between marketing and finance is also not taught. Through the classes with the executives, the students get hands-on experience in these areas, said Ramanuj Majumdar, who teaches marketing at IIMC. 
																								Workshops have also been conducted by members of the Chennai chapter of the IIMC Alumni Association in which the students dealt with real-life situations.
																								Such initiatives are excellent opportunities for the students to pick up pointers from industry stalwarts, said Anindya Sen, dean (programme initiatives), IIMC.

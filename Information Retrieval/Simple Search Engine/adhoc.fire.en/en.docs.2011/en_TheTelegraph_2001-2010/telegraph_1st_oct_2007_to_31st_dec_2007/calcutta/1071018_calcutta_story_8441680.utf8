		 A charred consciousness																																	The gestation period of the play, Surjo-pora Chhai (meaning sun-burnt ash), began when director Debesh Chattopadhyay was teaching the concept of radioactivity to some of his students. He claims that teaching the structure of the atom reminded him of a family and this eventually metamorphosised into the play, based on the interlocutions among two daughters, their mother and the grandmother. Riddhi, the elder daughter, is of a subdued nature and engrossed chiefly in her studies. At school, she conducts experiments on the effect of gamma-rays on sunflower seeds. Rimona, the younger one, is restless and is actually suffering from a psychological crisis. The invalid grandmother moves on a wheel-chair and is hardly able to speak, while the mother is an outwardly impolite person. The motif of the burnt, perished seeds becomes a commentary on the existence of these characters who are torn between what they inherit and what they propose. This evening also has a performance of the play, Mouna-Mukhar (dir: Satya Bhaduri).

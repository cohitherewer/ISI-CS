				 Uncle and colleague questioned
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rizwanur Rahmans maternal uncle Taj Mohammad and his colleague at Arena Multimedia, Mohammad Rafique, were questioned by CBI officials on Sunday.																								A team of officials, led by Zaki Ahmed, asked Taj Mohammad if Rizwanur had spoken to him about his problems. He could not provide any lead, said a CBI official.																								Rafique was questioned for an hour and a half from 11am. We found his cellphone number on Rizwanurs phone. He had spoken to Rafique a couple of days before he died. We will not disclose what they discussed for the sake of the investigation, said another official.																								The officials said they might visit the office of Nazrul Islam, the inspector-general of police (enforcement branch). He had heard sub-inspector Krishnendu Das threatening Rizwanurs student Sadique, added the official.																								The CBI on Sunday also questioned Indranil Ghosh, a youth who claims to have witnessed Rizwanurs kidnapping at the Khanna cinema crossing on September 21. 																								We spoke to him but did not record his statement. There are many people trying to mislead our probe, said CBI joint director Arun Kumar.

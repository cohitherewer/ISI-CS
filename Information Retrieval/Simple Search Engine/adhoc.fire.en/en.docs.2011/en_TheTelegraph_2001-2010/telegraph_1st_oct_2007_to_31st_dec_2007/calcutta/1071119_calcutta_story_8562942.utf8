				 French consulate opening soon 
 SOUMITRA DAS				 	 The new gallery of Alliance Francaise du Bengale, which opened last Friday. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								A French consulate will in all probability be set up in Calcutta by this year-end, and it will hopefully attract an important French minister, said Philippe Martinet, cultural counsellor at the Embassy of France in India, on Friday, when the French Association was renamed as the Alliance Francaise du Bengale.																								After the original Alliance Francaise closed down following a fire in Park Mansion in 1998, where it was located, the organisation has for some time functioned out of Khaleel Manzil at 217 AJC Bose Road. The first floor of the house with a wooden staircase will now be the new media centre and culture hub that will function as a gallery as well. 																								The gallery opened on Friday evening with an exhibition of the paintings of Susmit Biswas, and this will soon be accompanied by a caf. Films will be screened here too.																								Martinet, who has visited the city five times, said there was a new impetus to French presence in Calcutta. The new French ambassador, Jrme Bonnafont, who was posted in Calcutta 20 years ago during the golden years, has taken the initiative on this count.																								The French government seems to be going out of its way to woo prospective Indian students, to which end it is announcing attractive scholarships in fields other than IT  culture, for example  and introducing French courses with special objectives aimed at the hospitality industry and engineering. Martinet, who seems to take a keen interest in the Indian contemporary scene, said although his government was not overflowing with money, two scholarships will be instituted targeting students of art from Bengal at Santiniketan. These will be competitive and in collaboration with a private foundation.																								Another scholarship three in number  in collaboration with a Bengal-based foundation and open to students from all over India is for admission to the prestigious Institut de Sciences Politiques de Paris, better known as Sciences Po, to study political science and sociology.																								Martinet was surprised at the enthusiasm of students at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute to study in France. Femis, the most reputed school of cinema, will admit two students from India instead of the norm of a single student, for cinema is a wonderful tool to bridge cultures.																								There is more in store for Indian students. A scheme is being worked out to allow 10 Indian students to be admitted to Femis for five to six weeks.																								A big dose of French culture will be administered via photography exhibitions. Calcutta will get a chance to see the Magnum and Tendance Floue stills and the entries of the Indian pavilion at the photography show in Arles.

				 Mouse to facilitate study of science
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Girls from four city schools have been initiated into the joys of using computers to learn physical sciences.																								IBM Calcutta organised two camps for Class IX girls from the schools from October 24 to November 2 to educate them on the potential of careers in science and technology.																								We have seen that women dont tend to take up science. In fact, compared to men, there are only a few women in the technology and software industry. The camps will help improve the ratio, said Prithwish Mukherjee, the location head of IBM. 																								The IT giant itself is a witness to the skewed workforce ratio. The ratio is definitely not 50-50, pointed out Mukherjee.																								This is the third year in a row that the camps, part of the companys Women in Technology programme, are being held in the city. 																								More than 60 students from schools including Our Lady Queen of the Missions, Loreto Day (Bowbazar and Elliot Road) and Auxilium Convent attended the the three-day camps and learnt the basics of chemistry and physics using computers. 																								The girls also worked on projects related to radio frequency identification and and robotics.																								When we were told about practical classes in physics, we thought we would be taken to a real lab. But the experiments were all done in a virtual lab, instead, which was great fun, said Ishita Sen, a student of Loreto Bowbazar.																								The students also had the opportunity to experience a three-dimensional virtual world, which turned out to be the biggest hit in the camps. 																								They were introduced to women employees of IBM, who would mentor them throughout the year. The employees will keep in touch with the students online.

		 Labour of love																																	Though the philosopher may live remote ... the genius of philosophy, if carefully cultivated, must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society...  David Hume. It is very difficult, nay impossible, to actually categorise a multi-faceted talent of the stature of Buddhadeva Bose. A major author of the post-Tagorean period, Bose was versatile and was comfortable in every literary genre. He could consciously alienate himself from the much-practised, weather-beaten tract and legacy left behind by Rabindranath Tagore and venture into unknown territories. His intellect and genius helped him to tread those risky territories and then emerge a winner all along. A trend-setter, Bose was a brilliant poet who also wrote novels, short stories, plays in both prose and verse, and non-fictional prose such as travelogues, memoirs and literary essays. He was also an editor-publisher, a translator, a consummate critic who also penned childrens books. His style influenced an entire generation of authors in Bengal. In 1935, Bose founded Kavita, a quarterly magazine of poetry that he edited with utmost care for a quarter century. He introduced many new poets and new trends through this magazine, which was the first of its kind in the country. He introduced readers to the beauty of Kalidasas verses in Meghdootam as he translated the book in verse form. His translations of Baudelaire, Holderlin and Rilke effected a sea-change in the Bengali sensibility, and his well-written prefaces and scholarly notes to the translations enabled readers to contextualise the new concepts. Soon these French poets ceased to be foreign poets and became household names in Bengal. A renowned educationist, he founded the department of comparative literature at Jadavpur University in 1956. His death in 1974 has left a void in Bengali literature. On his 99th birth anniversary, the Buddhadeva Bose Centenary Committee (BBCC) has planned a series of programmes to celebrate the genius birth centenary. The programme begins with a formal Shraddharpan by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, Sibnarayan Ray (president of BBCC), Bangladeshi author Shamsul Haq, Boses associate Prof. Naresh Guha, and author-economist Dr Ashok Mitra. This will be followed by Lopamudra Mitras musical rendition of Boses poems, set to tunes by his wife, late Protiva Bose. Gautam Haldar will present a recitation and Nandikar will stage Boses one-act play, Pata Jhore Jaye.

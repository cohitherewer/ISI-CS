		 Divine Muse																																	Durga is a concept whose birth, according to the Puranas, is shrouded in mystery. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, the triumvate who symbolise Creation, Stabilty and Destruction, respectively, united to create Shakti to fight against the all-pervading powers of Evil. She is imagined as a gracious beauty who inspires both awe and pity. She is the mother of the universe, the symbol of the infinite power of the feminine to create as well as to destroy. She is also known by the names Parvati, Ambika and Kali. Gallery Kolkata hosts A Brush with Durga, a show that celebrates this deity through the works of renowned artists Jogen Chowdhury, Prakash Karmakar, Shuvaprasanna, Shyamal Mukherjee, K.S.

		 New strokes on eternal canvas																																	An artist by virtue of his worldview and profession, Aloke Kumar Paul is always inspired by the unlimited strength of nature, whether in the form of creation or destruction. From the pages of history, he discovers his source, his roots, and he also learns the influence of God to create man, of man to create civilization and ensure its continuity. What appeals to Paul, therefore , is cultural dynamism. His preoccupation with myths, history and archetypes is because of the impact they have on people, regardless of religious, ideological and geographical differences. His involvement with art thus is his attempt to reach out to the essential humanity in all of us, something that is part of our collective identity. Pauls works, like Blessed (right), can be described as spiritual rather than religious or mythical. Through his works Paul wishes to uphold the values that are on their way to oblivion. The mixed media paintings are done in acrylic, dry pastel, ink and oil on paper and canvas.

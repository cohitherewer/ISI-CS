				 Hitch in temple revamp
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 DESIGN DISCORD: Revamp of the Kalighat temple will be delayed. A Telegraph picture																								The renovation of the Kalighat temple has been delayed, with Kalighat Development Monitoring Committee (KDMC) rejecting the International Foundation for Sustainable Developments blueprint for the project.																								The planners did not keep the requirement of the devotees in mind. The architects did not consult us, said Ajoy Kumar Mitra, the president of the Kalighat Temple Committee and an ex-officio member of the KDMC.																								Mitra said the plan did not show the entry and exit routes clearly. It is also vague on remodelling of shops in the area and storage of water for the devotees to wash their feet before entering the temple.																								The temple committee has appointed another architect to draw up a fresh plan. The new architect has surveyed the temple and noted down our requirements. We will start work when we get the design, said Mitra.																								The project, taken up by the state government in 2004, has been delayed several times. The pilot project envisages re-development and restoration of the temple, construction of an administrative building and development work on and outside the premises, such as construction of a hospital and rehabilitation of hawkers.																								The cost of the project has been estimated at Rs 79 crore. In the first phase, an administrative building-cum-guest house will be constructed at 35A Kalighat Road, adjacent to the temple, at a cost of Rs 1 crore.																								The Union tourism ministry handed over Rs 5 crore to the state tourism corporation in April 2005 for the project. The civic body has been assigned to carry out the construction. It floated a tender and awarded the contract to city-based Kalimata Enterprises. The International Foundation for Sustainable Development, an organisation of NRIs, has agreed to provide the rest of the funds.																								According to a civic survey, at least 50 million pilgrims visit the temple every year.

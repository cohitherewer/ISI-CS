				 Crackdown on crackers
 															- DECIBEL DEVILS ABOUND A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Children stock up for Kali puja and Diwali at the Baaji Bazaar on the Maidan. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Banned fireworks from Sivakasi, in Andhra Pradesh, have flooded the city and its adjoining areas.																								Many such banned items have been seized in the city and its neighbouring districts  North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly, said state environment secretary M.L. Meena.																								In Mahestala, South 24-Parganas, state pollution control board teams met with resistance from local traders while trying to seize the fireworks.																								The fireworks look like they emanate only light. But in reality, they produce sound much more than the limit  90 decibels at the source  set by the pollution control board.																								A board official said the sound produced by some of the fireworks touch 120 decibels. We came to know about these fireworks last year. A couple of months back, I wrote to the association of fireworks producers in Sivakasi, asking them not to send the banned items to Bengal. But the association did not pay heed to our plea, said Meena, who is also chairman of the state noise pollution monitoring committee.																								We became aware of the presence of banned fireworks in the local market on the night of the Twenty20 final, when the city celebrated Indias victory by bursting crackers, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the senior law officer in the environment department.																								The noise-monitoring panel has been requesting police since June to take action against the manufacturers and retailers of banned firecrackers, but we are yet to get any feedback, said Mukherjee, also convener of the noise-monitoring committee.																								Sources said the state pollution control board started taking action against the violators last week. The police have promised to try their best to fight the noise nuisance.																								We are trying our best to cut both the demand and supply channels, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti. 																								All police stations have been put on alert. Around 3,000 kg of banned fireworks were seized in October. On the festive nights, we will keep a close watch on silent zones, like hospitals, he added.

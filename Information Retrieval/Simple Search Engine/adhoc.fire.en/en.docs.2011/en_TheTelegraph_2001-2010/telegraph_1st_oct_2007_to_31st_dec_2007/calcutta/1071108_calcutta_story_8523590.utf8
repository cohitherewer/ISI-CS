				 Raids yield crackers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Tonnes of banned crackers, worth more than Rs 1.5 crore, were seized from several parts of the city and its surrounding areas on Wednesday. The raids were carried out jointly by police and the state environment department.																								Thirteen persons were arrested in south Calcutta and 10 by North 24-Parganas police.																								The environment department has written to the director-general of Tamil Nadu police, asking him to stop the supply of banned crackers from the state to Bengal.																								Our officials found out during the raids that most of the banned crackers were from Sivakasi, in Tamil Nadu, said environment minister Sailen Sarkar.																								The minister hinted that the department, helped by the police, will take a tougher stand this year to fight the noise nuisance. There will be a special vigil on Kali puja and Diwali nights around hospitals and other silent zones, Sarkar added.																								A cracker factory in Nilgunge, near Barasat, was sealed after banned items were found in its godown. Factory-owner Nurul Hasan was fined two years ago for the same offence, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the senior law officer in the environment department.																								Among the places raided were Baruipur, Thakurpukur, Behala, Uluberia, Baranagar and Lake Town. The pollution control board said complaints of noise norm violations can be lodged at 1800-345-339, 2335-3913 and 2335-8212.

		 All for a pooka																																	Mary Chases play Harvey narrates the delightful story of Elwood P. Dowd, a gentle and amiable bachelor, who has imagined for himself a companion, Harvey, a white rabbit that is over six feet tall and, interestingly, can be seen by none except Elwood himself. This has made the situation unbearable for Elwoods widowed sister, Veta Louise, and her daughter, Myrtle Mae, who have come to stay in the Dowd mansion. Elwood regards Harvey as a pooka, meaning a mythical being that can change shape and appear to certain people, often playing pranks. When Elwood starts introducing his pooka friend to guests at a party, his society obsessed sister decides to have him committed to a sanitarium to spare the family any further embarrassment. However, a comedy of errors results in Veta Louise being mistakenly regarded as the patient. When Elwood resurfaces at the sanitarium looking for his friend, his delusion evokes sympathy from two renowned doctors and the head-nurse, Miss Kelly. Just before Elwood is about to be given an injection that will make him a perfectly normal human being, as Dr Chumleys driver says, and you know what bastards they are!, Veta realises that she would rather let Elwood remain the person he is, even with his friend Harvey. The play won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1945. Produced by Stagecraft and directed by Rohit Pombra.

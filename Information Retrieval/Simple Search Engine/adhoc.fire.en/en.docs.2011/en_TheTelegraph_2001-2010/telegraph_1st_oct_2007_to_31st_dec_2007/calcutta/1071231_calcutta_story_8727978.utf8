				 Green chart for book fair

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The Publishers and Booksellers Guild has formed a cell to ensure that the damage to the environment during Book Fair 2008, on the Park Circus Maidan, is minimal.
																								Metro speaks to a number of experts and prepares a green guideline.
																								Dust control: Dust precipitation should be controlled by ensuring that visitors walk as far as possible on metallic roads, green patches or covered stretches, said S. Bala, the regional in-charge of the Central Pollution Control Board.
																								Water should be sprinkled on the ground at regular intervals to avert resuspension of dust, the main cause of air pollution at a fair, said Arun Biswas, of the National Environment Engineering Research Institute. Parking should be at least half-a-km from the fair site and the pollution status continually measured and displayed.
																								Save the green: Stalls will not be allowed on the green patches, said S.M. Ghosh, a member of the Guilds green committee. Digging should be avoided on the green, felt environmentalist Subhas Dutta.
																								No-plastic zone: Ideally, plastic should be banned on the fairground. If that is not possible, at least bags thinner than 40 micron should be avoided, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the senior law officer in the state environment department.
																								Urinals and toilets: Enough urinals and toilets should be set up, not just during the fair, but also while construction goes on, said Dutta.
																								Noise control: The noise level on the ground should be monitored, as several hospitals and educational institutions are in the vicinity. Microphones should be fitted with sound-limiters and the loudspeakers should be so aligned that the noise does not escape the ground, said a pollution control expert.
																								Post-fair restoration: Care should be taken to restore the ground at the earliest.

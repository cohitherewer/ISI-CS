				 Noise norm flout during immersion
 															- Cops remain spectators				 	 BIG BANG: Fireworks light up the path of a Kali puja immersion procession. Puja organisers have been accused of bursting banned fireworks. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								Violation of noise norms by Kali idol immersion processions was the rule rather than the exception on Sunday, with police remaining mute spectators.																								Bamunpara Club, on Palm Avenue  close to the chief ministers house  was among the hundreds of clubs whose members burst banned firecrackers by the dozen on the way to the Hooghly on Sunday evening. The policemen deployed on the clubs route did not stop the members from lobbing crackers that landed on the balconies of roadside houses and on cars.																								What can I do? asked a police officer at the Broad Street-Gariahat Road crossing after being pointed out that the revellers were flouting noise norms. The Noise Act, 2000, however, empowers the police to take action against violators. Moreover, the state pollution control board officials claim that policemen are trained every year how to prevent violation of environmental norms.																								The highrises were the major source of noise pollution on Diwali night. Their place was taken by the processions on the weekend evenings. While the highrise residents burst expensive but banned crackers, most of them from Tamil Nadu, locally manufactured chocolate bombs and kalipatkas dominated on Saturday and Sunday. The situation has worsened since Friday evening and is gradually becoming unbearable, said Joydeep Kundu, a resident of Hatibagan, on Sunday evening.																								I have received several complaints about banned crackers being burst during immersion processions in Calcutta, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the senior law officer in the environment department and member-secretary of the state noise monitoring committee.																								The boards special control room to receive noise-related complaints does not remain open during immersion. Mukherjee expressed concern that the situation might deteriorate further during Chhath puja.																								Those who took out the immersion processions not only burst banned crackers but also used loudspeakers above the permissible decibel level, alleged environmental activist Subhas Dutta. According to him, monitoring of banned firecrackers should have started earlier than it did this year. The state environment department made the plea several times.																								Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said: The crackdown on banned crackers will start early from 2008. We will chalk out a plan in consultation with the environment department and the pollution control board.					  A STAFF REPORTER

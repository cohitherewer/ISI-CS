				 At work on the campus
 A STAFF REPORTER																								 Sabyasachi Tripathy worked in a landscape upgrade project at Rabindra Sarobar as a second-year postgraduate student of economics at Jadavpur University (JU). The experience more than made up for the lack of field surveys in his course.																								 Ranjit Maity, a second-year postgraduate student of JUs architecture department, saw his designs take shape at South City. He was the only student in his batch selected to help with the landscaping of the estate.																								JU students are gaining work experience before leaving the campus, thanks to the universitys industry-institute partnership cell.																								We had to develop on designs by a Singapore-based firm. The challenge was to satisfy the customer while adhering to specifications by the local authorities and without deviating too far from the original plan. The project exposed me to the problems of fieldwork, said Ranit.																								Water resource engineering of South City, including rainwater harvesting, is also being carried out by JU.																								An official of the Calcutta Improvement Trust said: We had asked JU to provide a plan for the landscape upgrade of Rabindra Sarobar. It is a Rs 50-crore project.																								Six departments of the university were involved in it, said project coordinator Parthapratim Biswas, of the construction engineering department. The plan included an underground observatory and boat-ride facilities to generate revenue.

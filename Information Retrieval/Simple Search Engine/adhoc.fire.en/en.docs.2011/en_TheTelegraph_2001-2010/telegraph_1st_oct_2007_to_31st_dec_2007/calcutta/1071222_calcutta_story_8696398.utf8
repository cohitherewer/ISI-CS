 															- SHUNNED ON FRIDAY, DUO STORM INTO PLEXES
 A STAFF REPORTER
				 	 Aamir Khan and child co-star Darsheel Safary in Taare Zameen Par: Its a deal
																								Call it the storm after the lull.
																								After shunning the two big releases of Friday, Taare Zameen Par and Welcome, over a profit-sharing dispute, multiplex chains across the country struck a deal with the national distributors and by evening, there were long queues for the films at the plexes.
																								Forced to play just Kailase Kelenkari in the morning, INOX and Fame bounced back with the Bollywood biggies and lined up nine daily shows of the Akshay Kumar-Katrina Kaif comedy and six daily shows of Aamir Khans directorial debut.
																								This is traditionally a peak holiday period and we had to screen the new films, said Vikas Syal, the general manager of INOX (Forum). Yes, we might have lost out on the Friday collections, but there is a huge rush for both the films and we hope to make it up in the coming days.
																								Earlier in the day, the two movies were released only at standalone theatres. It didnt affect Welcome much, since the Anees Bazmee comedy got a thunderous welcome at single screens like Paradise and Menoka. 
																								But Taare Zameen Par received a cold response in Roxy and Jyoti, which were largely empty.
																								It was important for Taare Zameen Par to be released at the plexes because not only is Aamir Khan synonymous with the cinema of the classes but the very theme of the film seems to be niche, said a Bollywood trade analyst.
																								Now, both the films will enjoy an extended weekend, starting from Id Friday and stretching till Christmas, which is on Tuesday.
																								And if the winter vacation in schools is added, its party time for the movies. We already have as many as 25 block bookings across Forum, City Centre and 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi), revealed a source at INOX.

				 Truck mows down cyclist
 															- PROTEST HALTS TRAFFIC A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 The mangled remains of the cycle that was hit by a truck on Maniktala Main Road on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta																								A truck speeding down the busy Maniktala Main Road mowed down a 30-year-old cyclist on Tuesday afternoon. Another cyclist had a close shave, with a fracture in one of his legs.																								Local residents blocked the road twice for 30 minutes, disrupting traffic in several parts of north and east Calcutta. The truck, carrying garbage for the civic body, was impounded, but the driver fled.																								Mithun Chakraborty, a Bagmari resident who earned a living selling audio and video cassettes, was cycling towards Maniktala when he was crushed by the truck.																								While the truck was trying to overtake Mithun near the Kankurgachi underpass, it suddenly veered left from the middle, forcing the cyclist to move closer to the footpath, said an officer of the Shyambazar traffic guard.																								Mithun was struggling to find space but the truck came so close that he fell and was run over by its rear wheels, the officer added.																								As Mithun lay on the road, bathed in blood, local residents ran after the truck. Some local youths did stop the vehicle but the driver managed to flee.																								The residents then reported the matter to a traffic sergeant, who took Mithun to NRS Medical College and Hospital. He died on the way, said a resident.																								Another cyclist, who was behind Mithun, was hit by the rear wheels of the truck. He fractured a leg.																								Local residents blocked the road, protesting slack traffic policing in the area. The blockade was lifted after senior police officers intervened.																								But soon after the police team left, the protesters gathered again on the road. This time, they were joined by the traders of the Bagmari market and traffic on the stretch came to a standstill. The blockade was finally withdrawn around 1.15pm, following the intervention of the police.

				 Central note on varsity upgrade
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The upgrade of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) is on track, with the Centre preparing a letter informing the state government of the admission procedure and the governance structure to be followed at the institute. 																								Besu and four other institutes will become Indian Institutes of Engineering, Science and Technology, according to recommendations by the Anandakrishnan Committee.																								Officials in the Union ministry of human resources development said the state government would receive the letter within a week.																								The ministry is also preparing a note on the upgrade that will be circulated among Union departments concerned, said a secretary of the ministry. The suggestions of the other departments will be incorporated and a final note will be sent to the cabinet.																								The process will take at least two months, said the ministry official. Once the cabinet approves the note, a bill will be tabled in Parliament.																								The teachers union secretary at Besu, Partha Chatterjee, said: We want the upgrade time frame to be announced right away. According to the Anandakrishnan Committee, the first session of the upgraded university should start in April next year. For that, the admission process should begin this month, but it cannot because of the inordinate delay by the Centre.

				 Mystery of missing bond
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 ACP Sukanti Chakraborty																								With the role of top cops coming under the CBI scanner on Tuesday, the spotlight is on a bond signed by both Rizwanur Rahman and Priyanka Todi at Lalbazar on September 8, the day the two were separated.																								While interrogating Sukanti Chakraborty, the former assistant commissioner of police (ACP) of the anti-rowdy section, CBI officials sought details about the missing bond, which was apparently a police guarantee of Rizwanurs safety.																								The existence of a second bond  the first one was signed to ensure Priyankas return to Rizwanur within seven days  had been made public by Rehan Waris in a diary he had penned for Metro about the last days of his friend Rizwan.																								Rizwan had told me about a second bond that he and Priyanka insisted the cops harassing the couple sign as a guarantee that Rizwan would not be harmed till his wife returned to him. But the policemen had refused to give him a copy, said Rehan, who told the same thing to the CBI officers who met him last week.																								According to CBI sources, ACP Chakraborty was supposed to sign the bond stating that police would ensure Rizwanurs safety till Priyankas return from her parents house.																								Both Rizwanur and Priyanka signed on the second bond but Chakraborty refused and kept the document with him, said a CBI official.																								The second bond was vital, as Rizwanur and Priyanka, fearing foul play by her father Ashok Todi, had insisted on it.																								Priyanka, in fact, is learnt to have agreed to sign the first bond about her seven-day stay with her parents on the condition that the police give them an undertaking that no harm would come to her husband during her absence. 																								On the couples insistence, Ajoy Kumar, the then deputy commissioner of the detective department, had asked them to write out a second bond and get it signed by ACP Chakraborty.																								During questioning, Chakraborty admitted that there was a second bond and added that he hadnt signed it or given a copy to the couple under instructions of his bosses. When we asked what steps he had taken to provide security to Rizwanur after September 8, he failed to provide an answer, said a CBI official.																								Rukbanur Rahman, Rizwanurs elder brother, said ACP Chakraborty had threatened to arrest us when we had asked for a copy of the second bond.

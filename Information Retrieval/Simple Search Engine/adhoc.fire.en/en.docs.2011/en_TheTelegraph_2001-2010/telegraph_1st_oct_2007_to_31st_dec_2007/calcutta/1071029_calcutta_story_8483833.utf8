				 Runway closed for repair
 																											- Poor bitumen cover peeling off repeatedly in touchdown zone A STAFF REPORTER																								The primary runway of Calcutta airport will remain closed during the day till October 31. Flights will take off from and land on the secondary runway during the period. 																								The main runway is being closed down between 10.30am and 5.30pm since Saturday for preventive maintenance work, said a senior airport official. According to airport sources, frequent damage to the runway surface has necessitated the maintenance work.																								While the minimum visibility required for a flight to take off from or touch down on the primary runway is 350 metres, the corresponding figure for the secondary runway is 3,000 metres. Jumbo aircraft find it difficult to take off from the secondary runway, which at 2,399 metres is significantly shorter than the main runway (3,627 metres). 																								On Sunday, the Calcutta-London Air India flight was to take off around 1pm. But since it is a large plane and the visibility had dropped below 3,000 metres, the repair work had to be stopped to allow the flight take off, stated the official.																								The primary runway surface is peeling off regularly. Since the runway was operational throughout the day, we could not carry out the maintenance work earlier, added an official.																								Earlier, the runway had been closed down for an hour for patchwork but that proved inadequate. Even parts of the secondary runway surface had peeled off a few times.																								Most of the incidents of peeling off have so far taken place in the touchdown zone of the primary runway. The touchdown zone is the area where the aircraft touches the ground. If a wheel of a plane falls into a pothole while landing, a serious mishap might occur, said another official. 																								A number of factors are behind the peel-off incidents, according to officials. The planes are supposed to take the Alpha taxiing bay to the main runway. From there, they are supposed to backtrack to the threshold of the runway, where there is adequate space to turn, before gathering speed and taking off. Because of increase in traffic load at the airport and to save fuel and time, many pilots are taking a sharp turn at the intersection of the taxiing bay and the runway. 																								We are keeping an eye on aircraft movement now. If any aircraft is found to damage the runway, it will be penalised, said an air safety official. Hourly inspections have also been started to spot runway damage.																								Low-quality bitumen used for resurfacing could be another reason for peel-off incidents. Heavy rain and the weight of aircraft damage surface made of sub-standard bitumen.

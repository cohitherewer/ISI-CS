				 Puja art and industry
 															- Wordplay draws visitors SUDESHNA BANERJEE 				 	 QUIBBLE ON ABAN: The deity at the Selimpur pandal. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees industrialisation drive and the consequent controversy have unearthed another facet of Puja innovation  wordplay. And it is happening at the expense of the curious pandal-hopper. 																								A hoarding at the Selimpur bus stop is a case in point. It screams out in bold lettering the chief ministers favourite word  Shilpayan. That is enough to get the tail up of the crowd that is ever on the look-out for new sensations.																								As one gets into the alley and then walks down to the clearing housing the pandal, visitors discuss in urgent tones: See that figure of Ma Kali on the wall. That is a symbol of destruction. Remember Nandigram? But the idol in the pandal is only a beautiful piece of art. 																								Where is industry in the theme? the question forms on every lip. But what you see is all that you get. 																								Our puja is based on an essay by Abanindranath Tagore called Shilpayan, artist Tamal Krishna explains, deflating the balloon of expectations. We mean to point out how the Bengali language has not evolved two separate words for art and industry. So, in an age where shilpa has come to mean industry, art is taking a backseat, the clubs assistant secretary, Indrajit Bhattacharya, says.																								Abanindranath himself was all for renaissance of indigenous traditions in Bengal when, in the early 20th Century, the wealthy babus became inclined towards European art. The idol is derived from an 18th Century sculpture of Durga, preserved at Gurusaday Museum in Thakurpukur. The original statue is in monochrome. We have added colour, says the artist. 																								But since one cannot disregard todays context, what of the confusion created among pandal-hoppers? If people take the term to indicate something else, we are not to blame for that, says Bhattacharya, insisting that a gimmick was furthest from their thoughts. 																								Balak Sangha, on Motilal Nehru Road, is more forthcoming on the score. Its hoardings ask the question fundamental to progress in Bengal  Krishi bonam shilpa na krishi-vittik shilpa? (Agriculture versus industry, or agriculture-based industry?)																								It is true that we have deliberately used words from the state governments campaign. Yes, there is scope for confusion, but when has a little publicity harmed anyone? smiles secretary Soumen Sen. 																								The confusion in this case had reached the party cadre. Faced with questions, we had to explain that the slogan was meant to insult none, nor does our slogan have any political message, says Sen.																								Instead, a coconut tree holds court there. We are showing how in a coconut tree, the dichotomy between agriculture and art dissolves. 																								So, the puja shows through eight panels made of various components of a coconut tree, from bark to chhobra, how each part has a commercial value in the market. If on one panel, narkel naru is being prepared, in another, coconut oil is being produced, in yet another broom sticks are being made out of its leaves. Yet the pandal is itself a creation of art, as is the idol made of coconut stalk and covered with leaves. 																								Never in our 28 years of puja have we received so much attention, Sen confesses, flashing a wan smile. Who says pandal art cannot be artful?

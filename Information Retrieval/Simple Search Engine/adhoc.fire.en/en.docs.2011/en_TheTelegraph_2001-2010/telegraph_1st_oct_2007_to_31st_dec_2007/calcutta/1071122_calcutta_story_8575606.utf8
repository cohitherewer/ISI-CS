The collection of physics, chemistry and biology textbooks for sixth, seventh and eighth standard students of the ICSE board aims at making learning science a part of everyday classroom life.				 				 																															What these books aim to do is to encourage the child to get involved in scientific activity in the classroom everyday rather than at the labs once a week, said P.A. Paulose, the author of the book on biology.				 				 																															The series was first launched as Oxford Modern Science in 1978 and later revised in 1980 and renamed New Oxford Modern Science.				 				 																															The 2007 edition launched in early November has incorporated a number of new features to make the books more attractive to children.				 				 																															The language used in the books has been made more lucid and child-friendly, said Priyadarshini Bhattacharyya, the educational product manager (east) of Oxford University Press.				 				 																															There are fact file and tech file boxes that highlight the technical points about each of the concepts explained in a particular chapter. The section titled Think Quest lists problems that the child will have to solve. This will stimulate the child to think and therefore help develop the thinking ability of the child, said Bhattacharyya.				 				 																															Each chapter also has a section titled Fun Time, which aims to teach the children using the play method where children are given projects they can do either at home or in the class. A key word and summary section defines the most important words and a synopsis of the chapter for easy recapitulation. Each chapter also has tips for teachers which work as guidelines for the teachers.				 				 																															For the more inquisitive learner, each chapter also provides a website reference where a student can find more information regarding the concerned topic.				 				 																															A series of workshops are being organised in the city to introduce the books to the teachers. The workshop for biology was held on November 20. The chemistry workshop is scheduled for December 4 and the physics workshop is scheduled for December 7. The idea of the books is to discourage spoon-feeding in the class and introduce the students to the concept of learning by doing, said Paulose.

		 In tune with nature																																	Tribal art reflects the creative energies running through man. This form of art is marked by a disarming candour and the simplicity it possesses shows that the artist is perfectly in harmony with his surroundings. In India, it has progressed considerably due to the constant encouragement and support of the government. All great art is undoubtedly an imitation of what is found in nature, and tribal art therefore, qualifies as the truest art form, unaffected by the compulsions of any civilisation, by any tutoring of tradition. Even early man with his uncouth existence found the need to express in art what amazed him in nature, thereby showing that an artistic aptitude is intrinsic in man. Basudev Malis rendering of this art is remarkable as it comes from the point of view of an outsider, and being what it is, manages to impress considerably. Mali documents not only tribal art, but also the tribal artist, perceiving both the creator and the creation in the same mood of amazement and wonder. Through his sculpture, he renders tangible the deep thoughts embedded in the collective human psyche; countenances that point to the essential identity of man.

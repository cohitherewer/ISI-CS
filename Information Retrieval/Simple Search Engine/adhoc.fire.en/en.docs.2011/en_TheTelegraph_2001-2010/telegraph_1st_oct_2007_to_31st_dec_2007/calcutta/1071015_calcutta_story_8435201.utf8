The police have identified at least four girls sold by Dutta to various brothels.

The brothers were admitted to hospital. A complaint has been lodged with Chatterjeehat police station but no one has been arrested.																																																		Tension spread in a Belghoria neighbourhood after the Durga idol at a local pandal was found broken. A preliminary police probe pinned the blame on a feud among the organisers.

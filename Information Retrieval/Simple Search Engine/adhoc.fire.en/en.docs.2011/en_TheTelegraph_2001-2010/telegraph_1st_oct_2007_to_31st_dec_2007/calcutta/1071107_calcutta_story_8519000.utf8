				 Puja row assault nets duo
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two members of a Kali puja committee were arrested on Tuesday for the alleged assault on Minati Dutta, 52, at her Bally home, after she refused to pay subscription. Both were, however, released on bail.																								The duo  Bittu Pal and Shyamal Chakraborty, members of Udayan Sangha Kali puja committee  denied the allegation, saying Minati had got herself admitted to hospital only to implicate them in a false case.																								Minatis family members said she was admitted to TL Jaiswal Hospital with a head injury and severe pain in the abdomen on Sunday night, hours after she was allegedly assaulted. A medical examination could not spot any injury marks.																								N.K. Singh, the superintendent of police (Howrah), said: Two members of the club have been arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by the woman. But a probe has revealed that the womans role was controversial. We are looking into the complaints lodged by both sides.																								Minatis younger son Raju, who runs a fast-food shop in North Ghoshpara, said: The club members had kicked my mother in the abdomen. She was critically injured as she had undergone an abdomen surgery two years ago.																								He denied the club members allegation that his mother had attacked them while they were collecting subscription at a neighbours home. The members attacked my mother when she refused to meet their demand for Rs 101 towards Kali puja subscription, said Raju.																								Club secretary Dilip Roy said: We have been organising Kali puja for the past 38 years and have never collected subscriptions forcibly.

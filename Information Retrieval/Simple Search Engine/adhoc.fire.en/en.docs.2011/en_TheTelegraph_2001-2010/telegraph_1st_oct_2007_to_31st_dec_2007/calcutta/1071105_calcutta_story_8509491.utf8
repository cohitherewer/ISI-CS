 															- CESC THE TELEGRAPH TRUE SPIRIT PUJA AWARDS A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Organisers of the 41 Pally Sarbojanin Durgotsav with their Model Puja 2007 trophy. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								The auditorium was chock-a-block. So, an aged woman, on walking in late, had no option but to stand at a side and scan the dark without hope. Two men quietly stood up, offered her their chairs and joined those enjoying the proceedings on stage on their feet at the back.																								This eye for others comfort was assured from every member of the audience gathered at Spring Club on Friday night. They were all puja organisers who have participated in the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja movement and, therefore, are pledged to show concern for fellow-citizens.																								True Spirit Puja 2007 was rounded up with a fun-filled awards night featuring performances by folk band Nao and singer Raghav. But drawing no less applause were two elderly women who walked up on stage to accept the Four Star award for Senhati Durgotsab Samiti. We women do everything in our para puja, from collecting subscriptions to canvassing for advertisements. The men, of course, help us out, smiled Kanika Mukherjee.																								A special round of applause was reserved for Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatty Durgapuja Committee. They have made it to the finals of each of the five editions of True Spirit Puja, pointed out anchor Rituparna. Ashok Jaiswal has already decided how to make use of the Five Star prize amount of Rs 25,000. We will sponsor the education of five underprivileged boys in our neighbourhood, he said, on coming off the stage.																								The other Five Star puja, Naktala Udayan Sangha, too, has pledged help to some thalassaemic children who need regular blood transfusion. With winter coming, we will soon be out on the streets at night, placing blankets on those sleeping without one, said club secretary Anjan Das.																								The stage was now set for the moment of reckoning. Two dhakis worked up the rhythm to a crescendo and the ticker tapes went flying in a burst of colours. Model Puja 2007 recipient 41 Pally Sarbojanin Durgotsav was taking the stage, to wild cheers in the audience. This is the moment that makes all those months of sweat worth it, said Sujit Datta, clutching on to the trophy. 																								The giant replica of the Rs 50,000 cheque was being carried down by the 25-strong team that had come from Haridevpur. We dedicate this honour to the children who stay in our orphanage and those we teach in our club, he added.																								Beaming behind Datta as he spoke was an organiser from Three Star Vivekananda Park Athletic Club. The Model Puja title going to Haridevpur is a matter of pride for the entire locality, said Chandan Biswas, lending his voice to a year-round camaraderie that sees boys of one para rushing to help people of another.																								And watching it all was a member of Tangra Yubak Sangha. We are a small puja and do not come in contention for awards. But being a part of the True Spirit movement is something that makes us feel good, said Subhrangshu Bagchi, speaking for the 225 puja organisers, most of whom did not take a star home but are all shining brightly as part of a caring Durga puja constellation.

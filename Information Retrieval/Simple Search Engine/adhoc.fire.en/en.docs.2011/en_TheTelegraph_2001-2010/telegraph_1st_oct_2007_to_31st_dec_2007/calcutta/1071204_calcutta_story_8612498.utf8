				 Park upkeep pitch
 															- 300 per cent hike in budget A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A view of Millennium Park. A Telegraph picture																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has increased its budget for upkeep of parks and gardens by 300 per cent. 																								The civic authorities maintain 24 parks. The civic body is also planning to involve private nurseries for the cultivation of seasonal flowers in the parks.																								The CMC now spends nearly Rs 6 crore annually for the maintenance of parks. Following a discussion with the mayor, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay hiked the figure to Rs 24 crore.																								We will not only maintain the existing parks but will also take over vacant plots that have been in use as parks or playgrounds for over a decade and beautify them. Most of these plots are privately owned or are disputed. They have become eyesores, said Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.																								According to a civic estimate, over 150 open spaces in the city need to be taken over. In several city pockets, particularly from ward 1 to ward 100, children hardly have any place to play.																								The CMC has the expertise to cultivate seasonal flowering plants in the parks, pointed out mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, but cannot do so for want of gardeners. There are only six gardeners on the CMCs payroll.																								Bandyopadhyay said private nurseries that have been running businesses by encroaching on pavements on Beleghata Main Road will be offered the chance to cultivate flowers in the civic parks. 																								They may be allowed to grow saplings in specified areas of the parks, he offered.																								The CMC has already taken up a Rs 4.5-crore scheme for the facelift of Deshbandhu Park, in north Calcutta. The swimming pool will be refurbished, and a dressing room and pathways will be constructed.

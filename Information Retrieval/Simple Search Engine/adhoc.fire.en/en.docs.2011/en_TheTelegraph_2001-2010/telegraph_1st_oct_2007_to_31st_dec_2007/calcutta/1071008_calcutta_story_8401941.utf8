				 Industry guide at IIM
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								From a workshop on Nokias recent challenges to a session with ad guru Prahlad Kakkar on entrepreneurship, the industry is very much in focus at IIM Calcutta.																								And the budding managers have industry stalwarts, some of them alumni of the institute, along with the professors to teach them the tricks of the trade.																								The last workshop on real-life cases was conducted over the weekend by the Chennai chapter of the IIM Calcutta Alumni Association.																								Interaction with companies, apart from what takes place during placements, provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an insight into the industry they want to get into. It helps them form an idea about companies before they take up jobs there, said Lakshmi Iyer, a first-year postgraduate student of the B-school.																								The students are exposed to real-life scenarios through case studies that are taken up in the classroom and in sessions with industry bosses, said Sudas Roy, a professor of marketing strategy at IIM Calcutta.																								Companies are also coming forward to interact with students. Proctor amp; Gamble and Nokia are two of the big names that visited the Joka campus recently.																								Projects taken up by the members of the consultancy club and marketing research and analysis festival Census also promote interaction of the industry and students.																								It is not possible for a company to identify prospective employees through such interactions, but the bosses get to know what they can expect from them, said Vijay Menon, a second-year postgraduate student at IIM Calcutta.																								Finance, consultancy, marketing, entrepreneurship and other clubs on the campus are also there to provide platforms that promote student-industry interaction beyond the curriculum.																								Such platforms are more useful for first-year students, who know where they want to go but dont know what to do once they get there, said Iyer.

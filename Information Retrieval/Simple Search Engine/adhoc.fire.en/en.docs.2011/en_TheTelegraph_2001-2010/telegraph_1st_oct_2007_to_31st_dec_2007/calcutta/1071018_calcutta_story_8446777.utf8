				 Mumbai police arrest duo
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A team from Mumbai police arrested two youths in the Girish Park area late on Tuesday on charges of hatching a conspiracy to blow up the Mumbai stock exchange. The team left the city with the duo on a morning flight.																								An officer of Girish Park police station, who helped the six-member Mumbai team, said the city cops had no information about the youths  Mahabir Prasad and Rajesh Prasad. They did not even inform us before coming to the city. The team turned up at the police station and sought our help, the officer added.																								The duo had reportedly sent a mail to one of their accomplices in Mumbai a couple of months ago and told him about an impending blast at the stock exchange. The cyber crime wing of Mumbai police chanced upon the mail and informed the crime branch, which tracked down the duo holed up in the north Calcutta neighbourhood, said an officer at Lalbazar.																								Before leaving the city, the team-members said they would come again in search of other suspects. They did not disclose the names of the suspects, the officer added.

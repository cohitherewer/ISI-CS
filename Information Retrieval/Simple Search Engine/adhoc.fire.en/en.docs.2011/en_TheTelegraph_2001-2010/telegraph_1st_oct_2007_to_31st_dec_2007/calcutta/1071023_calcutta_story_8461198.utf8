				 Todi camp plays cool
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 Ashok Todi: In no hurry																								The CBI has turned the heat on Ashok Todi and his family by registering a murder case, but the Todi camp is putting up a brave front.																								We do not even have a copy of the FIR, said one of the lawyers representing the Todi family, making it clear they were in no hurry to lay their hands on it.																								The central investigating agency filed the FIR on October 19 on the basis of the petition moved by Kishwar Jahan, Rizwanur Rahmans mother, in the high court.																								In its FIR, the CBI brought charges of murder, conspiracy and threats against Todi and others under sections 302, 120 B and 506 of the IPC.																								A copy of the FIR, in a sealed envelope, reached the metropolitan magistrates court in Calcutta on Sunday.																								The accused can get a copy of the FIR from the court against an application and a nominal fee.																								But lawyers of the Todi family have maintained that they are in no hurry. We are not moving any application to get a copy of the FIR, they clarified. 																								Lawyers representing the Todi family have also made it clear that they would not move the court with an anticipatory bail plea. There is no question of moving the court seeking anticipatory bail for our clients at this moment. They are not at all apprehending arrest, they said. 																								According to a CBI special court judge, the agency has to approach the court to seek permission to conduct search and seizure at Todis Salt Lake house. And if anyone is arrested, he or she has to be produced in this court within 24 hours, added the judge. 																								The procedural hurdles in arresting Todi and his associates are ensuring the apparent calm in the Todi camp. 																								The CBI investigation is limited to the scope of finding out the truth behind Rizwanurs death. How can they arrest any person in this case without ascertaining the reason of death? asked a lawyer. 																								The businessman, he added, is willing to extend full cooperation to the CBI. Our client is ready to answer all queries in connection with the case.

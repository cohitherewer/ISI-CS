		 Evidence of life																																	Vitalism is an essential point of departure in the works of Niranjan Pradhan. Involved with the creative arts since the Sixties, he is always committed to nature and to life, which are the source of inspiration and storehouse of his creativity. He transforms these vitalistic elements into formal structure. Nature gets liberated into form. This transformation of nature into form is the essence of all art. Modernity stresses on formalistic values. Meditation for the form itself is its basic characteristic. Pradhans sojourn towards this form itself contains not only the evolution of his creativity, but also his world outlook. Most of his works contain a lyrical beauty. He derives forms, but goes beyond physical attributes of life in works like Mother and Child, Pregnant Mother and Gossiping Couple (right), ressurecting the vitalistic elements towards pure beauty. In this formalistic transformation, he is more committed to both life and art. Pradhan uses wood, terracotta, marble and principally bronze in all his works that are born out of deep contemplation and inspire the same in all of us.

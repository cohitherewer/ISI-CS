				 Cops get layout of book fair

 A STAFF REPORTER 
																								The Publishers and Booksellers Guild on Thursday submitted a ground plan to Calcutta police for organising Book Fair 2008 on the Park Circus Maidan.
																								Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti called us on Thursday to discuss certain issues about holding the fair. We submitted the layout and the map for organising the fair on the Park Circus ground, Guild general secretary Tridib Chatterjee told Metro.
																								We told the police chief about our plans and the proposed arrangements on the ground and outside. The ground plan includes the number of exit and entry points and how much area on the ground will be taken up by the stalls. A copy of the plan has been sent to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Chatterjee added.
																								Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyel said the police would assess the ground situation before taking any decision.
																								They have provided us with a map and we will study it. There are several issues that need to be sorted out before the fair is allowed, Goyel said.
																								The most important thing is parking. There has to be adequate parking lots around the Park Circus Maidan, so traffic movement is not disrupted. After studying all aspects, we will decide how many exit and entry points should be set up, the deputy commissioner said.
																								Asked whether the police have given permission to the Guild to organise the fair on the Park Circus Maidan, Goyel said: We have neither said yes nor said no. The Guilds plan has to be studied... We have also given them some suggestions.

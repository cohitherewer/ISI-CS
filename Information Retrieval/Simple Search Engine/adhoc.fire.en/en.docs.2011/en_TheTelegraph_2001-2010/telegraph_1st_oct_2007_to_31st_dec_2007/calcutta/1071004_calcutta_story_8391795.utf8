				 Celebration of special spirit
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Schools in Calcutta are taking part in a global celebration of the spirit of children who cannot communicate verbally or in writing because of impairment.																								The Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP) is observing the International Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Week in the city from October 1 to 8, in collaboration with seven educational institutes.																								The AAC Week is being simultaneously celebrated across 14 countries, including the US, Australia, France, Italy, Egypt and Argentina.																								AAC comprises communication methods that can be used to add to the usual methods of speech and writing. Unaided AAC is related to signs and gestures, while aided AAC involves the use of various props, from picture charts to computer technology.																								AAC can help users understand what is said to them, as well as to express what they want to.																								The focus of the AAC Week is on children who face problems in speaking or writing because of conditions like autism and cerebral palsy. The goal is to help the impaired people interact with the help of AAC and also to spread awareness about AAC, said Subhra Chatterjee, the head of communications at IICP.																								IICP, a national institute providing training, therapy, and diagnostic and counselling services to people with disabilities, has conducted sessions on AAC in institutions like Birla High School, Vivekananda Mission School, Joka, and Apeejay School.																								The response from the children has been very encouraging. They have contributed actively to the sessions. The children now have a clear idea of the concept behind AAC, said Debashish Biswas, the coordinator of the advocacy group of IICP.																								The team that is conducting workshops at schools includes AAC users and care-givers who act as facilitators in the process. The AAC users are young men and women, who conduct interactive activities with students of classes VII, VIII and IX.																								Most students who attended the sessions had no idea of AAC before. 																								The sessions were also used to discuss conditions like cerebral palsy and autism in detail.																								Role-plays and idea-generation are two of the other tools being used by the facilitators to spread awareness about AAC among the children. The students came up with suggestions on how to make their schools more accessible to people with disabilities.																								The students were asked to record their responses and ideas in sketches or paintings that will be sent to the International Society for Alternative Communication.																								We were initially concerned about the childrens reaction to the concept of AAC but the response has been very encouraging so far, said Biswas.																								The IICP will conduct workshops for students of Modern High School for Girls, Ballygunge Government High School, Loreto Day School, Sealdah, and NIOS (National Institute of Open Schooling) on Thursday and Friday.

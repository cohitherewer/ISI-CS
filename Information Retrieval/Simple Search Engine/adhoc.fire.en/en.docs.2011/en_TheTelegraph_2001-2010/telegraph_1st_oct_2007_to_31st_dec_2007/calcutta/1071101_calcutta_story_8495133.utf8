 															- Green scribe urges battle on climate change JAYANTA BASU 				 	 Paul Browns book																								Its now or never, warns British environment journalist Paul Brown. If we dont act quickly, cities like London, Miami, Mumbai and Calcutta may be submerged in another 40 years and it is a science-based finding.																								Brown, in town recently for the launch of his book Global Warning: The Last Chance for Change, urged India not to stand on the sidelines of the environment issue, like China, but to pitch in with all its resources to counter the climate change.																								Global warming was triggered by the high-toxic emission of advanced countries like the US, but its the developing countries like India that will suffer the most, Brown told Metro. Past is past. All countries now need to look forward to the future and contribute to the cause of combating climate change.																								Brown feels depressed at the inability of most of our leaders to lead the nations in the war on global warming. I was in Greenland a month ago and saw how numerous holes have been created within the ice caps and how glaciers are slipping faster than they used to.																								Browns book  spread across 14 chapters, supplemented with around 300 photographs  depicts the threatened future of humankind if countries across the globe do not rise up to the challenge of climate change.																								Scientists may still be discussing what caused the disappearance of dinosaurs, but there is no doubt amongst them what is causing the current round of mass extinction It is mankind, Brown wrote in the preface of the book.																								In Calcutta, Brown also attended an international workshop for environmental journalists, organised by the British Council. Journalists from across the country, Sri Lanka and Maldives took part in the workshop.

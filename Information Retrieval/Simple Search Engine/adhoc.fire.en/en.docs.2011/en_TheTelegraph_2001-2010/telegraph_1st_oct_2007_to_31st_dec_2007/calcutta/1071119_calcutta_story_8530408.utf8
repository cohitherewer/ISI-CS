				 Five mini-flyovers for traffic flow
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								The civic authorities have earmarked Rs 100 crore to build at least five mini-flyovers at important intersections in the city.																								In the first phase of the project, aimed at improving traffic flow, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and police will undertake a joint survey at three busy intersections next month.																								The Shyambazar five-point crossing, the Moulali four-point twin crossroads and the Ballygunge Phari six-point intersection have been shortlisted by civic road department engineers for the survey, which is expected to help work out a better traffic management plan.																								The CMC and the police will search for ways to improve traffic flow and shorten the wait at signals. They will also dwell on feasibility of mini-flyovers and scope for widening roads.																								Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay  who is in China to study traffic management, rehabilitation of displaced people and slum development systems practised there  announced the project last week.																								Better traffic management infrastructure is the need of the hour as the number of cars is growing very fast. The traffic master plan predicts that over 300,000 cars will ply in the city by 2025, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.																								The civic engineering department is in touch with a traffic management expert at IIT Kharagpur about the project, added the municipal commissioner.																								Civic deputy chief engineer Soumitra Bhattacharya said: I have held preliminary discussions with Jyotindra Moitra, associate professor, traffic management, at IIT Kharagpur.																								Apart from flyovers, several measures are being considered to reduce the wait at signals. Waiting at intersections is a major irritant for motorists, said principal chief engineer (project and development) Nilangshu Bose.																								Four flyovers have come up in the city  Gariahat, AJC Bose Road, Chowringhee and Lockgate Road in Chitpur  with foreign assistance in the last four years. Because of faulty planning they have only shifted traffic congestion from one part of the city to another, said a traffic police official.																								For example, after commissioning of the Gariahat flyover, the traffic snarls at Gariahat have eased but those at Gol Park and Ballygunge Phari have intensified. 																								According to a town planner, if the flyover had stretched over Ballygunge Phari, the problem could have been avoided. It is just a matter of proper planning and foresight, which is sadly lacking, he added.																								The AJC Bose Road flyover is another example of myopic design, with bottlenecks at both ends. After spending Rs 100 crore on it, plans for ramps are finally being chalked out.

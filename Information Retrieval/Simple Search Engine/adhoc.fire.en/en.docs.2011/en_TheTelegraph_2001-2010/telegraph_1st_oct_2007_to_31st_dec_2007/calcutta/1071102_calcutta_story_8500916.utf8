				 Light rain off weak trough 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The Met Office on Thursday said the city and its adjoining areas could receive scattered rain in the next 24 hours.																								G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, said heavy rain is unlikely, as Wednesdays trough of low pressure off the Bengal coast had weakened.																								Calcutta on Thursday experienced a few sharp showers in pockets but there was no downpour like on Wednesday.																								A cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) has, however, formed over Bangladesh and adjoining Gangetic Bengal. This could cause scattered rainfall, light to moderate, on Friday, said Debnath.

				 Held for Salt Lake snatching
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A youth has been arrested for robbing the gold necklace of a 45-year-old woman in Salt Lake early on Thursday. Two youths have been detained for questioning.																								Mitali Mitra was robbed of the necklace by a gang of five near a park in BH block, while she was out on a morning walk. Ananta Chowdhury, 60, a cardiac patient, came to her rescue and caught hold of one of the criminals, but was stabbed in the arms.																								The leads indicate that the criminals had come from somewhere near the locality. We are keeping a watch on certain pockets on the outskirts of the township that are known as haven for criminals, said an officer of Bidhannagar (East) police station.																								The police on Friday summoned Chowdhury and Mitra and showed them a dozen photographs of criminals who have been active in and around Salt Lake.																								We had provided the victims with photographs of several criminals. If they can help us identify those who attacked them on Thursday morning, we will crack the case faster, said an investigating officer.																								I and Mitra went to the police station twice since Thursday afternoon. Two youths were produced before us, but we could not recall whether they were in the gang, said Chowdhury, who put up a fight against the criminals despite having undergone an angioplasty in April.																								A preliminary investigation has revealed that at least one member of the gang has a criminal record, said an officer.																								A senior officer of the North 24-Parganas police said security has been stepped up in the township following Thursdays incident.

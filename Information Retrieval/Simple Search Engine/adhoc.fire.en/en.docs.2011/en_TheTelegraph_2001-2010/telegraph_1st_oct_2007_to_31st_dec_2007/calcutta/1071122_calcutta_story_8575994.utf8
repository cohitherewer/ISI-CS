				 Affidavit on strike in courts
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The high court division bench on Wednesday directed the state bar council to file an affidavit stating why its executive committee called for Tuesdays ceasework in courts across Bengal, violating a Supreme Court ruling that imposed a ban on strikes by lawyers.																								Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh gave the council three weeks to file the affidavit. The council had called the strike to protest violence by CPM supporters at Nandigram.																								The order was passed on a petition by high court bar association member Basabi Roy Chowdhury. Her counsel Subrata Mukhopadhyay argued: According to the Supreme Court ruling, lawyers do not have the right to cripple courts by calling a strike. Being the highest body of lawyers in the state, the executive committee has violated the ruling. The court should start contempt proceedings against the committee.																								He claimed that the executive committee decided to call the strike at a meeting attended by only 10 of the 26 members. Three members opposed the decision. Only seven people brought work in 202 courts across the state to a halt.																								The lawyer representing the bar association said: All the 101 bar associations across the state voted for the ceasework in court.																								The vice-president of the bar council said the CPM-affiliated Democratic Lawyers Association was behind the case.

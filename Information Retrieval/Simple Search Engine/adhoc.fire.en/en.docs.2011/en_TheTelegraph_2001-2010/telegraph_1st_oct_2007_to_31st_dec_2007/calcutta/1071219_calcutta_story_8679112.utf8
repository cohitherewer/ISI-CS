		 Triumph of truth
																																	Dance-drama Duhshasana Vadham narrates a brief scene from the Mahabharata. After 13 years of exile, the Pandavas have returned to ask for their rightful share, which the Kauravas have strongly denied. To avoid the war of Kurukshetra, Dharmaputra decides to send Lord Krishna to bring some conclusion to the deadlock. The Pandavas are willing to compromise  if they do not get half the kingdom, they would settle for five villages; if not, then five houses; if not, then one house. Meanwhile, Draupadi also reminds Lord Krishna of the humiliation she has suffered at the hands of Duhshasana. Krishna tells her that her grief shall be avenged; she has to wait for the auspicious hour. Krishna reaches the palace of Duryodhana at Hastinapur where all his efforts fail and Duryodhana remains adamant. When Duhshasana tries to bind Krishna in a piece of cord, the lord assumes his cosmic form, Viswaroop, and one by one, the Kauravas fall off their seats. When Bhima comes face to face with his arch-rival Duhshasana in the battlefield, he rips him open and drinks his blood, avenging the humiliation of Draupadi. The dance-drama, based on Kathakali, shall be performed by Kalamandalam Murali (in picture), Kalamandalam Venkitt, Kalamandalam Vasunni, Kalanilayam Mukundan, Preetha Venkitt and other artistes form Kerala, Delhi and Visva Bharati. The evening begins with a Rabindrasangeet chorus recital, conducted by Manoj Murali Nair, and a solo recital of Tagore songs by Mrinmoy Roy.

				 Alert on viral attacks
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Doctors have warned of an outbreak of viral fever in the city. A number of malaria and typhoid cases, too, have been reported in the past few days.																								We are getting patients with symptoms of viral fever daily, said Subrata Maitra, a critical care expert. The symptoms include high-medium fever, severe joint pain, skin rashes and respiratory distress, often as severe as an asthma attack.																								Such viral attacks are common during season changes. Those susceptible to cold and bronchial attacks can take preventive influenza vaccines, Mitra said.																								The virus is attacking a patients gastro-intestinal system before spreading to other parts of the body, said Milan Chetri, a consultant in internal medicine at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, where around 20 patients were admitted with fever and other discomfort in past few days.																								Doctors are banking on symptomatic treatments. The fever usually lasts for a week, but can also drag on. In some cases, it took four to six weeks for the fever to subside, said Chetri.																								Along with viral fever, malaria cases are being reported from across the city, including Kidderpore, Ekbalpore and its adjoining areas.																								We have started detecting malaria cases after the monsoon withdrew from the state. But the number is much less than last years figures, said a senior official in the Calcutta Municipal Corporations health department.																								Doctors have come across indications of the malaria virus becoming resistant to chloroquine. We have to prescribe other anti-malarial drugs, said a doctor. 																								A few typhoid cases, too, have been reported.

				 South City 
gets nod

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER
																								Calcutta High Court on Wednesday put its seal of approval on the South City project on Prince Anwar Shah Road.
																								The court dismissed a petition filed by Trinamul Congress councillor Javed Khan, who had challenged the Calcutta Municipal Corporations (CMC) decision to sanction the project.
																								The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Tapen Sen, however, said the project promoters should comply with the provisions of the Environment Act.
																								The bench said the petition was not maintainable, as Khan was a mayoral council member in the civic body when the project was approved. He should have protested the decision then. Instead, he filed the case after the CMC sanctioned the plan.
																								Bhaskar Dasgupta, a local resident, had filed another petition against South City, claiming that the project authorities were violating environmental norms. Both petitions were heard together.
																								An inspection found the allegation to be true, following which the court ordered construction to be stopped. It later allowed resumption of work after the project authorities submitted that it would restore the waterbody. 
																								Environmentalist Subhas Dutta said: True, Khan had delayed filing the petition... As an environment activist, I would like to urge all project authorities to religiously abide by green norms.

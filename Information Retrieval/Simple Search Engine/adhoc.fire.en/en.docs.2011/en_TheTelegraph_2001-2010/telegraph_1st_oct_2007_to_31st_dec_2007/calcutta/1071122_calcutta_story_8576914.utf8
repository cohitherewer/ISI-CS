				 Protest pitch
																								We strongly condemn the disruption created in Calcutta on Wednesday by the All India Minority Forum, who blocked roads to protest several issues. We believe that a demonstration to cancel someones visa is uncalled for. And we condemn those who are spreading violence across the city in the same way as we raised our voices against the violence in Nandigram. We believe violence can never be the means to any desirable and responsible end.

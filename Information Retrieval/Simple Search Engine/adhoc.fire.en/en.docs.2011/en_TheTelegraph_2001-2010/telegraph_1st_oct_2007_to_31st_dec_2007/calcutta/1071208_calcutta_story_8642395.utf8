				 Delhi purse for flyovers

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The Centre has in principle agreed to provide Rs 150 crore for the construction of three flyovers in the city, state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Friday.
																								The list covers a flyover at the Dunlop crossing, a high road from the EM Bypass to Baruipur (via Kamalgazi) and two ramps from the AJC Bose Road flyover.
																								All three projects are crucial to ensure smooth flow of traffic, Bhattacharya said.
																								Around Rs 80 crore will be spent on the Dunlop flyover, Rs 50 crore on the Bypass-Baruipur flyover and the rest on the twin ramps.
																								The Dunlop and the Bypass-Baruipur flyovers will be constructed by the public works department and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, respectively, while the ramps will be set up by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners.
																								The state government, however, is worried over the Centres decision to exclude the proposed high road from Parama Island to Park Circus Bridge No. 4 from the list.
																								The state will chip in with funds if the Centre refuses to sanction money for the Park Circus flyover, said Bhattacharya.
																								The four-lane flyover, to cost Rs 330 crore, has been designed to ease the bottleneck on the Park Circus connector.

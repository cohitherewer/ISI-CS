		 A question of faith
																																	Adapted from Molieres French play, Tartuffe, Acharya Tartuffe deals with the theme of appearances and seeming goodness. The story is of an irreclaimable hypocrite, who is received as some great holy man should be. His apparent goodness gives him access to all places that a normal person would not have. The only redeeming feature is that he himself knows and admits he is unworthy. Girish Karnads Flowers is based on the folk tale of a devoted and pious priest. The play is in the form of dramatic monologue where the priest narrates to the audience, how he violates both his bhakti and his dharma because of his love for a courtesan. Torn between his love for God and courtesan Chandravati; between his duty to his King and his wife, the priest narrates his dilemma and the course that his life takes when one night he has to attend to all the calls of duty and love simultaneously. The pulls from diverse directions are equally intense and strong and the man is totally baffled. In both plays, the script revolves around the notion of faith being used to further ones own interests and of it being commodified. Todays show at the Nandikars 24th National Theatre Festival shall also include two of its own productions, Pakhi and Dulia.

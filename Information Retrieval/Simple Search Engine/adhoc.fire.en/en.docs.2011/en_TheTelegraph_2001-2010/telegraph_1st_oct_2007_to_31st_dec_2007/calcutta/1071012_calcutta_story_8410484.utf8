				 Flight queue set for a trim
 															- RUNWAY EXTENSION SANJAY MANDAL				 	 TIME-SAVER: With the extension of Calcutta airports secondary runway, take-off and touchdown will be swifter. A Telegraph picture																								Take-off and touchdown at Calcutta airport will become faster by the end of this year, after the extension of the secondary runway.																								Simultaneous operations on both runways, however, will still not be possible, as the two are closer than the stipulated minimum separation distance.																								A flight will be able to take off from one runway immediately after an aircraft lands on the other, said airport director V.K. Monga. This will reduce the waiting period in the take-off or landing process.																								The primary runway at the airport is 3,627 metres long and the secondary runway extends up to 2,399 metres. Post-extension, the secondary runway will be 2,839 metres long.																								An official said around 450 flights take off from and land at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport. For taking off, aircraft have to wait in a queue during peak hours in the morning and evening.																								Priority is given to landings. Only after an aircraft lands on the main runway and is towed out can another roll in for take-off, explained an airport official.																								On Sunday, the inaugural flight of Air India Express from Calcutta to Singapore was delayed by more than half an hour to make room for an incoming flight. Sources said the Air India Express flight was fourth in the queue, waiting on the taxiing bay while three flights landed.																								However, once the secondary runway is extended, a flight can wait on the runway itself before taking off. It can take off immediately after an aircraft lands on the main runway, the official pointed out.																								Now, an aircraft takes 15 minutes to take off in a no-traffic condition. The period will come down to around eight minutes once the secondary runway is extended and a new link between the two runways becomes operational.																								Take-off from the secondary runway is now allowed only during daytime, with visibility not below 3,000 metres. Following the extension, the runway will be equipped with the Category I Instrumental Landing System. 																								Flights can then take off  and also land  at any time of the day, even when visibility is as low as 550 metres.																								Monga said electrical work on the extended part of the secondary runway has been taken up.

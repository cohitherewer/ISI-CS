				 Infection in blood, donors unaware

 SANJAY MANDAL
																								Kanad Majhi (name changed) had donated blood at a camp organised in his locality, on the citys northern fringes. During the mandatory screening of the blood sample at Medical College and Hospital, Kanad was found to have contracted Hepatitis B.
																								Hepatitis C virus was detected in the blood sample of Swapan Nag (name changed), a regular blood donor, during a screening at a private blood bank.
																								None was informed about the infection.
																								Like Majhi and Nag, blood donors are never told whether they are carrying any infection. Hence, there is always the risk of them unknowingly passing on the infection to others.
																								Year after year, millions of blood donors are being deprived of their right to be informed and counselled about the transmittable diseases they are carrying.
																								Both state-run and private blood banks stand accused of violating a guideline of the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco), which states that the donor has the right to know about his health and should be counselled if he is found to be carrying any disease like HIV and Hepatitis that spreads through blood.
																								An infected donor, if not informed about the disease, can infect others unknowingly, said Sharmila Chanda, a consultant haematologist. If the infected donor gives blood for the second time and the reagents used for testing the sample are faulty, the infection will go unnoticed.
																								Nacos guidelines on blood safety state that every donor at blood donation camps must be asked to fill up a form and specify where he would like to be informed about disorders in the blood, if any. The donor is supposed to mention his contact numbers and address on the form. 
																								No blood bank ever gets back to the donor even after a virus is detected in the blood, a state health department official said.
																								Every year, on an average, 5.5 lakh units of blood are collected at camps across the state and brought to the blood banks. Health department statistics said that of the total blood samples, 0.6 per cent are found to be HIV seropositive, 1.6 per cent infected with Hepatitis B and 0.4 per cent infected with Hepatitis C.
																								These donors do not get to know about the infection unless there is some manifestation. The infected samples and the corresponding blood pouches are destroyed and the responsibility of the blood bank ends there, said the official.
																								Officials in charge of blood safety said a rule is being framed, making it mandatory for HIV positive persons to be informed about their status through confidential counselling. Informing donors individually is a problem. On certain days, there are huge collections and it becomes impossible for the banks to track down the donors and inform them about the infections, argued Bhaskar Bhattacharya, the deputy director of blood safety in the state health department.
																								We ask donors to contact us if they want to know about their blood status, said Abhijit Banerjee, the medical director of Ashok Blood Bank.

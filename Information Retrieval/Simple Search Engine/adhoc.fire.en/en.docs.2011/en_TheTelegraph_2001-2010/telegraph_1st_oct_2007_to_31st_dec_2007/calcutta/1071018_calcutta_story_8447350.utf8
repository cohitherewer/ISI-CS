				 Top cop trio in last meet
 A STAFF REPORTER																								It was to be their last meeting at Lalbazar as the three top cops in town.																								For two hours on Wednesday afternoon, from 1.15pm to 3.15pm, deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh and deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar were closeted with police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.																								Were they discussing their future or mulling over what had gone wrong in the Rizwanur Rahman case?																								By then, news of their ignominious transfer had reached Lalbazar and the countdown to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees announcement at 4pm at Writers Buildings had begun.																								The corridor in Lalbazar  where all three top cops accused of playing a part in separating Rizwanur and his wife Priyanka Todi had their offices  was deserted. As was the visitors room, normally full of people waiting eagerly. The guards and peons were the only ones in attendance.																								First to emerge from the police commissioners room was Gyanwant Singh, in uniform, followed by Ajoy Kumar, in plain clothes. It was 3.20pm. Their time was up.																								The two went into their respective rooms for the last time. At 3.35pm, Gyanwant Singh stepped out of his room, walked down the stairs, got into his car and left.																								A few minutes later, Prasun Mukherjee walked out of his room and headed straight for the lift, refusing to answer questions from reporters. His guards hurried after him and as he got into his car, they saluted him  one last time as the citys police chief.																								The last to leave was Ajoy Kumar. A guard first carried his uniform to the car and then the deputy commissioner followed.																								The corridor of power fell silent as the other senior officers waited to hear from the chief minister.																								Senior officers maintained that the commissioner and the two deputy commissioners had gone out and refused to field further questions.																								Minutes after 4pm, when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced the transfers with immediate effect, the corridors of Lalbazar came alive with two key questions  who would be the next police commissioner and who would replace the two deputy commissioners?																								The focus shifted from the departed to the incumbent. Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti is the new police commissioner and he will be visiting Lalbazar soon, was the buzz.																								The peons swung into action, readying the police commissioners room for its next occupant.																								By 8pm, when Chakrabarti arrived at Lalbazar, the police headquarters was ready to receive its new boss.																								The nameplate reading Prasun Mukherjee had been hastily replaced by Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.

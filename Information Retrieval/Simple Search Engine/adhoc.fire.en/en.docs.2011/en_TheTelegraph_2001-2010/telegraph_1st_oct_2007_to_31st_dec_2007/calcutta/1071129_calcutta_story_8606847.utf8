				 	Young visitors in the Arctic Room at the exhibition at Kangaroo Kids. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray				 				 																															Pre-school Kangaroo Kids has been putting up exhibitions every year. For the ongoing exhibition (November 28-30) at the Alipore school this year, the theme was marine life. 				 				 																															Eight rooms at the Alipore kindergarten school wore a marine look, each illustrating different forms of marine life. From dolphins and sharks to walruses and penguins, this exhibition had it all. There were beluga whales suspended in a room decorated to appear like underwater scenery, replete with corals and sea weed, while puppet shows in several rooms jazzed up the atmosphere.				 				 																															In the Arctic Room, visitors could dress up in penguin gear and shake a leg to some peppy music, with parents joining in enthusiastically. The entire exhibition was very well-organised. It seemed as if we were underwater in a glass boat and looking at the sea creatures, said Shalini Karnani, who had dropped in with her two daughters, both students of Loreto House: 				 				 																															Forty-five teachers have worked for the exhibition for the past five months, staying back after school to provide the finishing touches. The models  made of pith  have been designed by an artist, while the rooms have been decorated by the teachers using pith, tinsel and hand-made paper. 				 				 																															In the last two years, the themes at Kangaroo Kids have included farm animals and festival of fairy tales, said principal Malika Verma. Visitors from prominent schools in the city, including Don Bosco Park Circus and St Xaviers Collegiate, have been dropping in.

			 				 																															 Mothers control tears in their magnolia eyes 
			 				 																															 and brothers face howitzers in dreams..... 
			 				 																															 Breathing becomes impossible 
			 				 																															 in the piquant air..... 
			 				 																															 a repeat of provenance. 
			 				 																															 Masturbating in despair, 
			 				 																															 and planning escape routes in heaven 
			 				 																															 at the same time. 
			 				 																															 The feud leads to resonance in time 
			 				 																															 and leads the way, taming hundreds....

			 				 																															 involving in fracas,

				 Roof of rail quarters falls 
 															- Tagged UNSAFE for long  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The roof of the four-storeyed railway quarters that collapsed on Sunday morning. Picture by Aranya Sen																								The roof of a four-storeyed railway building in Kamardanga, near Tangra, collapsed around 8am on Sunday. A woman was injured.																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had declared the 70-year-old building  used as staff quarters  unsafe long ago.																								Fire brigade officials said the roof was severely damaged during the last spell of showers in September.																								The CMC director-general (building), Gora Chand Mondal, said the responsibility for the upkeep of the building rests with the Eastern Railway, which owns the property. 																								Residents alleged the railway authorities never took any initiative to repair the building.																								Around 300 people live in 13 buildings in the Kamardanga railway colony. 																								In February, a team led by CPM parliamentarians Basudeb Acharya and Sudhangsu Sil had submitted a memorandum to the Eastern Railway general manager, urging him to take immediate steps to repair the building. But nothing has been done, said local CPM councillor Joysree Deb Nundy.																								A senior Eastern Railway official said the authorities were investigating the collapse.																								Another official said on condition of anonymity that there are around 100 unsafe railway buildings in Calcutta and Howrah. 																								Repairs cannot be undertaken as we do not have enough funds, he added.

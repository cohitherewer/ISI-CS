				 Grandmaster and the champ
 															- City youngster recalls May camp in Chennai with Anand RITH BASU				 	 Sandipan Chanda. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								The first undisputed chess world champion in 14 years was helped on his way by a young grandmaster from Kudghat. For 10 days in May, Sandipan Chanda traded moves with Viswanathan Anand at a practice camp in the run-up to the Mexico world championship.																								Anand and I were the only ones at the camp in Chennai. We used to practise openings for eight to nine hours a day on an average, says Sandipan, who played his part to perfection. Sometimes, we would take a stroll on the beach in the evening.																								Sandipan shot off a congratulatory email to the champion as soon as he got the news of his victory in Mexico. Its a great achievement for Anand and the Indian chess fraternity. Its quite something to be the World No. 1 and win the world championship, says the 24-year-old, who became grandmaster in 2003.																								How much of Anands moves in Mexico could be traced back to the camp in Chennai? Not exactly, but one of my games with Anand at the camp closely resembled the world championship game he played with Boris Gelfand of Israel. That was satisfying, says Sandipan, who flies off to France this month for the Corsica Rapid Chess Tournament.																								The May camp wasnt his first with Anand. There was another camp in 2002, which we attended with three others. It was a pleasant surprise when he asked me if I would be interested in doing the Chennai camp. He later called to say that it would start on May 1. It was a huge recognition, coming from him, says Sandipan.																								The champion ensured that the youngster would benefit from the exchanges. I have been able to pinpoint areas where I need to improve through my interaction with him, says Sandipan.																								He also describes the world champion as a great team-man. I was a part of the Indian contingent for the Chess Olympiads in Spain in 2004 and in Italy in 2006. Anand would give youngsters like Surya (Sekhar Ganguly) and me valuable tips. He also has a great sense of humour.

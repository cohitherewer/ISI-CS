				 SIDR sets sights on the coast
 															- 800km off Calcutta, a cyclone of 500km diameter, 200km tall clouds OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								A cyclonic storm, described by the weatherman as very severe, is threatening to hit the Bengal-Bangladesh coast near Sagar Islands on Friday morning.																								Named SIDR by the Indian Meteorological Department, the cyclonic storm lay roughly 800km south of Calcutta on Wednesday and was moving north.																								The cyclone is very strong and has a diameter of about 500km with a wall of clouds about 200km tall. It is travelling at about 18 to 20 kmph, said L.R. Meena, the deputy director general of meteorology at Alipore. As of now (Wednesday evening) the cyclone has a 60 per cent chance of hitting Bangladesh and a 40 per cent chance of hitting the Bengal coast, added Meena.																								Such a cyclone can have a strike speed of 120-220 kmph. Met officials said SIDR was the strongest cyclone over Bay of Bengal since the supercyclone that hit Orissa in 1999 at 220 kmph. A cyclone alert has been issued for Calcutta, South and North 24-Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, East and West Midnapore. Met officials said that if SIDR, now hovering over south-east Bay of Bengal, retains its intensity, widespread rain is expected over the coastal districts in the next 24 hours. Squally winds of around 50-60 kmph could hit the Bengal coast by Thursday afternoon.																								 ldquo;From around Thursday noon, the sky is expected to turn grey followed by rains. There may be heavy rains in Calcutta and the coastal areas on Friday and Saturday, rdquo; said G.C. Debnath, the director of weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre.																								 The Alipore office has alerted Writers rsquo; Buildings. ldquo;We have been told by the weather office that a cyclone is heading for the Bengal-Bangladesh coast and can hit at a speed of 120km per hour. We have alerted Calcutta, its adjoining districts, East and West Midnapore, rdquo; said home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray.																								 Met officials said the supercyclone of 1999 was initially heading towards the Bengal coast but at the last moment it veered off towards the Orissa coast, leaving a trail of death and devastation.

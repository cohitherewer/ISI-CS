Picture by Amit Datta (Below): Justice Chakrabarti after he assumed office. A Telegraph picture																								The chief minister called off the judicial investigation into Rizwanur Rahmans death on Friday, a month after he had announced it, and after the one-man commission had run up a bill of Rs 10 lakh.																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had declared on September 27, three days after the CID launched its investigation, that Justice Aloke Chakrabarti would find out how Rizwanur died and probe the role of police.																								The money power involved in the case and its communal aspects needed investigation, the chief minister had said. 																								Today, I am withdrawing the judicial probe, as it may overlap with the CBI investigation. Moreover, there have been certain developments since the judicial inquiry was ordered, Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings on Friday afternoon.																								Three factors had contributed to the withdrawal of the judicial investigation  the public sentiment against it, the media campaign against it and the sentiments of Rizwanurs family, added Bhattacharjee. 																								The office of the commission was set up at Jalsampad Bhavan, in Salt Lake. A clerk, a typist, a receptionist and an assistant were appointed to help the judge. 																								Chakrabarti took charge on October 1 and attended office from October 5. His remuneration was Rs 70,000 per month, commensurate with the last salary he had drawn as a judge of Calcutta High Court.																								The commission had already purchased furniture, including a stand for witnesses, and computers, by drawing money from the Rs 20-lakh fund allotted by the state government.																								It is for the state government to decide whether the probe will be continued or not, Chakrabarti said on Friday. The chief minister had consulted him before making the announcement, he added.																								The commission had advertised in newspapers stating that the accused in the case, including the police officers, Priyanka and other members of the Todi family, and anyone else willing to depose before it, would be examined.																								According to government sources, the probe was a non-starter, with the Rahmans and the public not responding to the notice.																								A home department official said Bhattacharjee was prompted by the Rahmans petition in the high court on Thursday, challenging the validity of the judicial inquiry.																								Asked why it took so long to call off the probe, Bhattacharjee said he had to wait to consult officials, leaders and lawyers. We have a policy-making process.																								Kalyan Banerjee, the Rahmans lawyer, described the withdrawal of the probe as a moral victory.The chief minister has realised that his government would suffer a second legal defeat and quashed the commission, he said.

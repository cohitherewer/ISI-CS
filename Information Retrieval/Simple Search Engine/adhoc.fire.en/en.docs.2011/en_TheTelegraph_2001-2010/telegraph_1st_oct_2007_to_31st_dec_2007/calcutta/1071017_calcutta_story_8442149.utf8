				 Principle over prize
 															- Bonding in para, steps for safety OUR BUREAU																								It is one award, striving for which takes Durga puja ahead by miles, in terms of serving the community. So while in the past four years, many pujas have been decorated with CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja (TSP) Stars, many others have gifted Calcutta a caring puja simply by conforming to the TSP norms. 																								Take the Interact Club of Chowringhee High School. The puja, organised by the students of the Chowringhee Lane school, has been a fixture in the contest for the past three years. The fact that they have never managed to make it to the awards list hardly dissuades them from enlisting the next year.																								The nature of the True Spirit Puja is in tune with the principle of our school. The fellow-feeling the award focuses on is something that we take seriously. Students from different communities come together to celebrate the puja, says Parminder Dasani, administrator of the school.																								For pujas like Hatibagan Sarbojanin, with decades of history behind them, contests are a recognition of overall organisational ability. And what better way to celebrate the true spirit of the Pujas than holding up the para feeling so prominent in north Calcutta? 																								Here, people are always ready to come forward and join in, be it in celebration or in emergencies. This is where we score over others, smiles Abhijit Bose, treasurer of the club.																								But the claim draws a sharp rebuttal from the general secretary of the AK Block puja, in Salt Lake, which is debuting on the True Spirit platform.																								Come to our pandal on Saptami, and see how hundreds of people meet and greet each other before sitting down to eat, says Umapada Chatterjee. There is more community feeling here than in Beleghata, from where I came here, he says, adding that Salt Lake, being a planned township, would score in traffic control, another TSP criterion.																								Many take the TSP award so seriously that they get into a competitive spirit, which serves the pandal-hoppers just fine. Alapani in Howrah, a new entrant, is banking on proper arrangements to get them initiated in the true spirit mode. The pandal, made of wood, has adequate fire-fighting equipment and is preparing for drinking water and toilet facilities. 																								We have appointed volunteers for security management. We have also arranged for a separate gate that can be used in case of emergencies, says Santipriya Ghosh, the secretary of the club.																								But at the end of the day, as Dasani points out, True Spirit Puja is not about winning or losing, but about participation. Heres to a growing breed of organisers who vouch for that.

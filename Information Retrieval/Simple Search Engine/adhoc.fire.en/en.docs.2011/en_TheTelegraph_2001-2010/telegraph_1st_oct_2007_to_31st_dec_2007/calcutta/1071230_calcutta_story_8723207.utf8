				 Santa among malls

																								The urge to be out of home on a festival or a special day has not changed. But the destination has. No longer is the Puja pandal, Park Street, Millennium Park or Victoria Memorial the only haunt of Calcuttans during Puja, Diwali, Christmas and New Years Eve. The mall is where the crowd is, not just on the weekends, but even during festivals, when one would traditionally expect people to wander away to other venues. 
																								The footfall on Christmas Day was approximately 64,000. On an average weekend it is only about 30-40,000. Thats a huge rise, says Hirak Kar, COO, City Centre.
																								At Forum, too, there has been a distinct rise. Last year on Christmas the footfall was 25,000. This year it was 35,000, says Khushboo Saraf of Forum. 
																								Saraf says that for a section of the city, the mall has become an alternative hang-out destination on a special day. Not the club-going crowd so much, but for families, its a good place to spend an entire day. They usually pack in a movie, lunch or dinner out and some recreation, she adds. 
																								Accordingly, a shopping mall is not just a shopping mall. I like to call City Centre a destination, a place like Park Street. You have shops and you have entertainment. It is a place that people head to when they want to have a good time, says Kar. 
																								It helps that the malls are decked up to exude the festive feel, with everything from the decor to the food and the choice of events. For Christmas City Centre put up a huge Christmas tree. Everyone at the food court donned cute Santa caps.
																								We did not have a special event on Christmas because we were expecting a mediocre turn-out. We thought people would prefer traditional hubs like Park Street. But we were in for a surprise, admits Kar. A winter carnival or Winterval is also on at City Centre, with different musical shows and other events planned through the year-end. 
																								The idea is to give visitors a feeling of festivity as soon as they step in, says Saraf.
																								During Puja, we did up the mall in a traditional Bengali way and there was a lot of Bengali cuisine on the menu at the food court. For Christmas, we had a wish tree where people could buy angels and tie it on the tree and the proceeds will go to charity, adds Saraf.
																								City Centre went to the extent of getting dhakis who roamed the mall on Puja days. Its a very conscious effort. We have to make the mall attractive for the visitors. We have a website where we keep posting details about upcoming events at the mall, says Kar. 
																								The mall-goers cant be thankful enough. I spent Christmas at City Centre, having ice creams and pizza and watching people. It is a place you can go to with your entire family and there is something for everyone there. And on festival days the malls are even more enjoyable, be it with a DJ or live music or some other events, smiles Atrayee Banerjee, a service industry professional.

				 Puja adda on Riz
 															- Revellers visit vigil venue A STAFF REPORTER																								Rizwanur Rahman remained in the minds of people through the four days of Puja revelry. Between discussions on fashion and the changing nature of the crowds, his name cropped up over and over again in pandals across the city, among both the young and the elderly.																								I was sure that people would forget the Rizwanur case at least for the four Puja days. To my surprise, I and my friends kept discussing it, said Debjani Bhattacharya, who works in a private company.																								Some even took time off their Puja plans to troop down to St Xaviers College, the venue of a 21-day apolitical candlelight vigil demanding justice for Rizwanur.																								A friend of mine took part in the vigil last Wednesday. We had an intense discussion with him about the incident. We talked about the role of the media in the case and how matters did not take a communal turn, added Bhattacharya.																								Most of the discussions centred around what was right and what was wrong, but some tried to solve the mystery behind the 30-year-old computer graphics teachers death.																								We had long debates but could not reach a consensus on the matter, said Shuddhashil Mallick, a student of economics at Calcutta University.																								The discussions were not limited to the baroari pandals. During Navami lunch at our housing estate, we spoke about what the CBI charging Ashok Todi with murder means, said Ritoban Das, a musician.																								But not everyone is happy with the hullabaloo over the death. A pandal-hopper at Maddox Square was heard grumbling that Calcuttans did not show as much concern after what happened at Nandigram.																								I dont know why so much noise is being made over this case, when the Nandigram incident was much more significant, said the middle-aged man.

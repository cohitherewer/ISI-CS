				 Fog blanks out flights, trains 

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Flight operations at Calcutta airport were halted for several hours on Thursday morning, as dense fog engulfed the city. Some long-distance trains, too, were delayed.
																								Airport officials said 30 flights were delayed by more than three hours on an average. The ripple effect was felt throughout the day on all sectors. Several incoming flights had to hover over the airport for 45 minutes to an hour before they could land.
																								The much-hyped Category II instrumental landing system, installed this year, could not help flights to take off or land as visibility dropped below 350 metres, the minimum requirement for it to be functional.

																								The Met office in Alipore has warned of light to moderate fog in the next 24 hours. Wind from the Bay in the middle and upper atmosphere is drawing in a lot of moisture. But its cold at the ground level, causing condensation of moisture, leading to fog, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Alipore office.
																								In the terminals, thousands of passengers were stranded for three to four hours. Inadequate seats and long queues at the security check-in points added to the woes.
																								IndiGos Chennai-Calcutta flight, scheduled to land at 7.30am, was diverted to Guwahati. It finally reached Calcutta at 10.25am. Deccans Calcutta-Dimapur flight, scheduled for 8.50am, was cancelled.
																								Jet Airways Port Blair-bound flight rolled out of the parking bay at 8.20am but congestion on the runway left it stranded for nearly half-an-hour before it could take off.
																								Air India had its first flight (Guwahati-bound) airborne at 9.50am, four hours behind schedule. The airlines Bangalore flight, scheduled to leave at 7.20am, finally took off at 10.35am. The Delhi-bound flight of Kingfisher was airborne at 9.15pm, more than three hours behind schedule.

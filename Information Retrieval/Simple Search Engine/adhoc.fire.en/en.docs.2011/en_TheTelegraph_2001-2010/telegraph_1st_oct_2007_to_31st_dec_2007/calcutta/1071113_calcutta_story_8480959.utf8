				 CMC wakes up to hawker ouster order
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 EVICTION THREAT REVIVED: Brabourne Roads pavement encroached on by hawkers. A Telegraph picture																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has finally decided to carry out a high court order, issued three years ago, to remove hawkers from eight roads in the central business district.																								In an affidavit filed in the high court before the puja vacation, the civic authorities had said the drive, with active backing from police, would be launched after the festive season.																								A senior civic official told Metro on Monday that the eviction drive could be launched in a couple of weeks.																								The drive will cover Strand Road, Brabourne Road, KK Tagore Street, Rabindra Sarani, Netaji Subhas Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kalakar Street and AJC Bose Road.																								In March 2004, the high court had given the civic body and the police three months to remove encroachments from these roads.																								The authorities were also asked to keep a strict vigil after the eviction to ensure that the hawkers did not return to the pavements.																								But since then, the CMC had filed three affidavits praying for time. It had submitted that it was waiting for the Centre to announce a National Hawkers Policy before launching the eviction drive.																								The policy is not yet ready, but the civic authorities have informed the court that they are now ready to drive away hawkers from the eight roads.																								The CMC also mentioned in the latest affidavit that the state government was seriously considering providing a police force to help civic workers remove hawkers and demolish unauthorised structures.																								CMC lawyer Aloke Ghosh said: The main problem behind removing hawkers was lack of coordination between civic employees and the police. Illegal traders are often evicted from footpaths, but they invariable return the next day. It is difficult for civic employees to keep a constant vigil on the roads to prevent hawkers from encroaching on the footpaths again.																								Ghosh, however, said the state government has agreed to the CMCs repeated requests to provide a special force to help CMC workers carry out their job. 																								A regular vigil will be possible if such a force is made available to the civic body, he added.

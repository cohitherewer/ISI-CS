		 Remains of the day																																	No. 8, Shorts Bazaar/ Short Street? is Paula Senguptas pet project that attempts to re-construct a bygone era with special focus on the domestic periphery and the feminine gaze. In doing so, it critiques the current preoccupation with the conservation of heritage, and questions the twin concepts of conservation and heritage. To execute her project, Sengupta uses the No. 8 Short Street house and the resident family as a case study. The house also happens to be the ancestral property of Senguptas in-laws. Situated in the heart of the city, the century-old house was purchased some four generations ago from a Jewish businessman. In this exhibition, Nuptial Chamber, Sengupta uses a large bed with enormous curtains. The bedspread is intricately hand-embroidered and on the walls are life-size portraits of family members. There is a table with sets of teacups and table-mats. Besides, eight bodices and eight leather-bound books share the room space. Sengupta uses antique furniture, genuine period-piece linen and handmade paper along with pins, thread and cloth to reproduce these objects as faithfully as she finds them. The whole atmosphere is one of a colonial mansion of the 19th century, reminiscing fondly the glorious days of the Raj.

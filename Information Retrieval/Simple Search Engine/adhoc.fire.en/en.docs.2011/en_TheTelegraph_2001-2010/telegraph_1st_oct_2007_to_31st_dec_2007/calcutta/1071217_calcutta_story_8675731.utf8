																								Radial Leathers and Radial Rubber Industries, at 9P and 9Q Abinash Chowdhury Lane, in the Topsia police station area, went up in flames around 2.20am on Sunday. Both units were allegedly operating without proper licences. It took 16 fire tenders and more than 80 firemen nine hours to control the blaze. 
																								The cause of the fire was not ascertained till late on Sunday. Residents of the neighbouring buildings, however, said the workers of the factories would light up leather and rubber strips at night to keep themselves warm. Both are highly inflammable items, pointed out Farzand Ahmed, a resident of 9P/1A Abinash Chowdhury Lane. 
																								Krishnendu Kundal, the station officer of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services, Gariahat, said: We have not been able to trace the owners of the factories. No papers were found to prove that the factories were running on a valid no-objection certificate from the fire department. 
																								The blaze gutted an estimated 4,000-sq-ft area, which contained highly inflammable leather and rubber articles. The factories had concrete walls and asbestos roofs.
																								At 2.30am, we suddenly saw tall columns of flames leaping into the air. We thought that our building was on fire. We rushed downstairs to discover that it was the twin Radial factories that were burning, Farzand recounted. 
																								Though nobody was injured, four employees of the leather unit were trapped inside and rescued by the firemen. 
																								The fumes and ashes suspended in the air made breathing difficult for residents of the densely populated area. Physician Iqbal Ahmed, who lives in a building next to the factories, complained that he couldnt breathe properly. The faces and limbs of most were blackened.
																								Mumtaz Ahmed, wife of Iqbal, said: How can they run such dangerous factories in such a congested residential area? My husband fell ill as the smoke and ash blew into our rooms, blackening the utensils, windowpanes, computers and air conditioner.
																								According to Snehansu Roy, the CPM councillor of Ward 59, the factories might have been operating illegally. So far, nobody has come forward to show me the papers declaring the units legal, he said. 
																								A senior officer of Topsia police station said though no arrests were made on Sunday, a forensic investigation would be conducted on Monday.

	 Our aim should be to stop polluting the river. The chemical colours that are increasingly being used are the main pollutants, not the clay or the hay. If puja organisers want to continue the tradition, they should ensure that the idols are painted with organic colours. Even if it is costlier, they can surely cut down on other expenses. After all, no price can be too high for saving the Hooghly. Otherwise, let them stop immersion in the river and sprinkle holy water on the idols, like the priest does on devotees as shanti jal.

 A STAFF REPORTER			Sourav Bardhan in hospital and (below) the playing field. Pictures by Gopal SenapatiA 14-year-old boy was admitted to hospital after being allegedly beaten up by neighbours when he entered their Shibpur house to retrieve a cricket ball. 																								Brothers Tarasankar Mandal, 42, and Rabisankar Mandal, 40, were arrested on the basis of a complaint by Sourav Bardhans father Badal.																								The Class IX student of Chittaranjan Adarsha Vidyamandir, who lives in PK Roy Choudhury Second Bylane, was playing cricket with his friends in the compound of Jasadamoyee School. Around 11am, the ball landed in the courtyard of the Mandal home.																								According to Sourav, when he entered the courtyard to get the ball back, Tarasankar and Rabisankar started hitting him on his face, chest and stomach. They then dragged me to the playground and beat me with a stick and an iron rod. I lost consciousness within a few minutes, said the boy.																								Other neighbours rushed to the aid of the boy and chased away the brothers. They fled inside the house and bolted the main door.																								The neighbours took the boy, who was writhing in pain, to South Howrah State General Hospital. On the advice of the doctors there, he was admitted to the Howrah Divisional Hospital. 																								Tarun Dey, one of the neighbours, said: Had we not chased away the brothers, they would have killed Sourav.																								The Mandals will be produced in court on Saturday, said district police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh.

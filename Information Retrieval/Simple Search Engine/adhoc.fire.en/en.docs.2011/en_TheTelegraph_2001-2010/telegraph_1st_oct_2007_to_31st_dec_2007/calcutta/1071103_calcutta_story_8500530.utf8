				 In a fix over home centre
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) is in a fix over its decision that the students of most of its affiliated colleges will not be allowed to write their tests in their own institutions.																								The students of the 120-odd private engineering and management colleges affiliated to the university have announced that they will boycott the exams if the rule is not applied to all institutions.																								The university, however, pleaded helplessness in enforcing the rule on all colleges. In the districts, especially in north Bengal, a college is so far from another that the students cannot be asked to write the tests in an away centre.																								The university has called an emergency meeting next week to find a solution. The next semester exams are due in December-January.																								We are in a fix over the issue, admitted WBUT registrar Syed Rafiqul Islam.																								The students are not ready to accept our decision, announced in June, unless it is applied to all 120-odd affiliated colleges at one go. But we cannot do so because of the distance factor. It is impossible for students in north Bengal to write their tests in colleges other than their own, he added.																								The university felt the need to abolish home centres in 80 per cent of its affiliated colleges  most of them located in Calcutta and its neighbouring districts  after it found a section of students indulging in malpractices in examination halls.																								There was another reason, though  several companies have informed the university that they will not recruit students from the affiliated colleges unless the authorities ensure transparency in the examination system.																								We are not against the universitys move to make the examination system more transparent. But this can be done through other measures. For instance, they can step up vigil during examinations and also send inspection teams to the colleges, said a student of a south Calcutta college.																								Registrar Islam, on the other hand, urged the students to appreciate the universitys problems. We should not be pressured to enforce the rule on all colleges. At least 20 per cent of the colleges, located in faraway places, will have to be exempted. At the same time, the transparency factor cannot be ignored as well.

				 B-School rings in winds of change
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Indian Institute of Management Calcutta will ring in a slew of academic and administrative changes, ranging from revamping curriculum to redrawing faculty recruitment norms.																								The board of governors of the B-school approved the changes on Thursday. The new curriculum of the institutes flagship course  postgraduate diploma in management  will come into effect from 2008.																								The number of compulsory courses, which will have to be completed in the first year, has been reduced in the revised syllabus.																								This will enable students to take up more electives in the second year. Also to be added is a compulsory course on communication skills, which will include foreign languages.																								The electives will be clubbed under various groups. For example, sociology, regional development and environment will be under one group, said the official.																								This is the first change in the syllabus since 1999-2000. The new curriculum will be more attuned to the changes taking place in finance, information technology and other fields, an official said after the board meeting.																								The board, which met under chairman Ajit Balakrishnan, also agreed to provide funds  up to Rs 10 lakh  for research projects to be taken up by faculty members. Research is important to upgrade an institute to international standards, but a lack of funds often becomes a hindrance. We hope the new policy will act as an incentive for research, the official said.																								The board also decided that the process of selection and recruitment of teachers has to be completed within 60 days. The initial screening will be done by a committee comprising teachers of the institute. The director will conduct the final interview.																								Leena Chatterjee and Arijit Sen, voted best teachers on campus in 2006-2007, laid the foundation stone of Academic Complex III during the day. The programme was attended by Balakrishnan, an alumnus of the institute and chairman and CEO of Rediff.

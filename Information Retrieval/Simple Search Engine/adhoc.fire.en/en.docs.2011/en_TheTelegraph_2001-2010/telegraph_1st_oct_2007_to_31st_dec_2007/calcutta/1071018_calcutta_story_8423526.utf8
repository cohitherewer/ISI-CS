				 Bypass new hospitality hotspot
 															- Hotel double bill due SUBHRO SAHA				 	 The JW Marriott property in Mumbai																								The Bypass billed as the Chowringhee of tomorrow, is fast becoming Calcuttas hospitality hotspot.																								Emaar-MGF Land Pvt Ltd, which made real-estate history in Calcutta by quoting a record Rs 213 crore for a 6.24-acre plot on the Bypass, is doing a double-bill  bringing in both JW Marriott and Holiday Inn.																								The company has entered into an operating agreement with the Marriott Group to develop a 250-room JW Marriott property, the most luxurious brand in the Marriott bouquet. There are 39 JW Marriott Hotels worldwide.																								Emaar-MGF Land, a joint venture between Emaar Properties PJSC of Dubai and New Delhi-based MGF Development Limited of India, also has a management agreement with the InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) to develop Holiday Inn Bangla, with approximately 250 keys, next to JW Marriott. Both hotels are expected to open doors in fiscal 2009-2010.																								The two-in-one address is coming up next to DLFs Rs 500-crore, 600-room hotel with Hilton. Neighbour ITC Sonar Bangla is poised for expansion, while the five-acre plot in Chandra Garden, opposite Science City, tendered by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, could also house a hotel. Further down the Bypass, the 200-room Taj Gateway hotel is coming up opposite Ruby General Hospital.																								The reason why the Bypass is emerging as the preferred corridor for hospitality chains is location. It is equidistant from both the old economy areas of Park Street/Camac Street/Shakespeare Sarani/BBD Bag/AJC Bose Road and the new economy zone of Salt Lake and New Town, Rajarhat, feels Abhijit Das, the regional director of Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj, international property consultants.																								It is also true that there arent large parcels of land in the city core areas any more. So, large-format international hotel chains can only come up on the Bypass, where the governments nodal agencies have created large land banks, points out an industry expert.

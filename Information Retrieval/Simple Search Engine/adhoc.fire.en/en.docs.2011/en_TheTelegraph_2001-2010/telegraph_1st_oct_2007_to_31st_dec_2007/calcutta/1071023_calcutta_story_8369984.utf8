				 Fish harvest on Net
 															- Dedicated mall with delivery facility ZEESHAN JAWED																								Internet access is all you need now to procure prawn, hilsa and bekti for a festive feast. Your order will be delivered to your doorstep  fast, fresh and neatly packed.																								Freshchingri.com is the first, dedicated online fish mall in India and it deals with all types of fish  local, seasonal, freshwater and sea.																								Freshchingri.com is a marriage of retail with e-commerce, says Gunjon Dasgupta, the director of the portal and one of the brains behind the venture. Almost every household in Calcutta consumes fish. But with nuclear families and working partners, few have the time to visit the market and buy their favourite fish. This is where an online fish mart comes in handy.																								The idea originated a year back. The next few months were spent in streamlining the back-end operations, such as setting up a hub  where fish is brought from various centres and sent to the customers  and working out the logistics of procuring various types of fish.																								The hub is located in the Howrah fish market, the biggest wholesale market for fish in the state. We procure the seasonal fish from centres in Digha, Diamond Harbour, Kakdwip, Namkhana and Raidighi. The other fish are procured from the wholesale market, adds Sanjoy Dey, another director of the portal.																								Freshchingri.com accepts an order for any amount between 500g and 100kg. Larger orders need to be placed 12 hours before the fish is needed.																								The best thing about Freshchingri.com is that one does not need to pay extra for home delivery. Also, we deliver fresh fish, without preservatives, says Dasgupta.																								Currently, orders need to be placed over the phone. The website is under construction. Once we are done, customers will even be able to order specific portions of a large fish, adds Dey.

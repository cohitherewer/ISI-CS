				 Wives put cops in grievance cell dock
 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI																								 A constable with the Reserve Force of Calcutta police has married thrice, but none of his wives knew about the others. On learning about the exploits of her husband, his first wife has lodged a complaint with the Lalbazar grievance cell. An inquiry has been ordered against the constable.																								 A sub-inspector of the city police deserted his wife last year and moved in with his second wife, on the sly. Unaware of this, his first wife lodged a missing diary. Late last month, she lodged a complaint with the Lalbazar grievance cell against her husband.																								The grievance cell in Lalbazar, opened on November 18 to allow the common man to lodge complaints against policemen, is already overflowing with complaints about cop misdemeanours, most of them too close for comfort.																								We have received several complaints about the personal lives of policemen. It is shocking, admitted a senior IPS officer at Lalbazar.																								The grievance cell was the brainchild of police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, who took office on October 17.																								After the cell was formed, complaints are pouring in from family members of policemen, said a senior officer.																								Take, for example, a constable with the Reserve Force, living with his wife and a child in the police quarters at Narkeldanga. Last year, he married again and moved into the house of his second wife.																								When his first wife came to know about it, she demanded a monthly amount as maintenance, which he refused. Once the grievance cell was formed, she approached it. I felt this was one place where I could voice my grievances and be heard, she said.																								The most common complaint against the men in uniform  many of them constables hailing from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh  is that of multiple marriages, levelled against them by their first wives.																								A probe has revealed that these policemen had come to Calcutta leaving their wives in villages or small towns. Here, they would get married again, keeping the first wife in the dark, said the senior official. 																								Additional commissioner (1) Subrata Narayan Sarkar, supervising the functioning of the grievance cell, played down the personal angle. We have got such complaints but there is nothing really serious. An inquiry will be ordered against the policemen mentioned in the complaints and action will follow against those found guilty, he told Metro.																								We have also received some complaints of police inaction and those related to civil matters that do not come under our purview, Sarkar added.

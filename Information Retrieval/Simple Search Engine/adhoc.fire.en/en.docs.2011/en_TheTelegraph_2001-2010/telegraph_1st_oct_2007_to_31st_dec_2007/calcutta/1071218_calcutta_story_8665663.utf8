																								This Christmas, munch-happy Calcutta will get its largest food and beverage zone.
																								A 60,000 sq ft spread  including a 30,000 sq ft food court, Foodtalk, and four speciality restaurants  is ready to lay the table at the South City Mall on Prince Anwar Shah Road.
																								This will be the most comprehensive line-up of fast food and proper dining under one roof in the city and we have had to look at such a scale, given the mammoth footfall expected, says Sanjeev Mehra, the vice-president of mall operations, South City Projects.
																								A second Mainland China outlet seating 160, and a 90-cover Sigree, serving food of undivided India, will mark the presence of Anjan Chatterjees Speciality Restaurants. The address will also host another restaurant and a lounge bar.
																								To be run by Blue Foods of Mumbai, the cuisine counters at Foodtalk will include Gelato, Not Just Dosa, Sizzlers, State of Punjab amp; Bengal, Mexican, Hotwich, Mr Potato, Bread Bazaar, Coffee Blue amp; Juice, Chaat Bazaar, Republic of China, Pizza amp; Pasta and Yatra Express
																								The food zone will also have a Caf Coffee Day and a Kookie Jar. A live bakery and gelato factory are being set up and Blue Foods has recruited chefs from Calcutta to add a regional flavour to the F amp;B fare.
																								The island-shaped food court on the third level of the South City Mall can be accessed from four sides through glass bridges. It has been designed by Bentel Associates of South Africa and city-based Dulal Mukherjee.
																								The South City Mall will have the biggest Shoppers Stop outlet at 83,000 sq ft, a 71,000sq ft Pantaloons, a 72,000sq ft Spencers hypermarket  again the largest in the chain  and a six-screen Fame cineplex as anchors.

				 CU to miss results date
 																											- Examinees will have to wait till November for marks OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The results of Calcutta Universitys B.A. and B.Sc exams (Part I and Part II), under the new 1+1+1 system, will not be declared before the Puja.																								Judging by the pace of the evaluation process, university sources said, the 1.30 lakh students who took the tests will have to wait till November for their results.																								The exams started in the third week of June and were scheduled to end in July. But some of the papers had to be deferred till the first week of August because of rain, leading to a delay in the publication of results. The last written test was held on August 3.																								There is little chance of the results being declared before the Puja vacation, admitted Debashis Biswas, the deputy controller of examinations. In the interest of the students, we are trying to complete the process at the earliest.																								The university rules state that results should be declared within 90 days of the last exam. We are trying our best to meet the deadline, Biswas said.																								The examinees, many of whom were expecting their results in the first week of October, are stumped by the delay. Those who had appeared for the Part II exams  more than 75,000  are worse hit.																								The delay in the publication of the results means we will have less time to prepare for the Part III exams, said Oindrila Ghosh (name changed), a B.Sc Part II examinee from a south Calcutta college.																								The Part II examinees will be the first batch to write the Part III test, in April-May next year, under the 1+1+1 system.																								We have no idea what type of questions will be asked in the Part III exams. We need to study the entire syllabus thoroughly, for which we need time. We are not being able to concentrate on our studies, said Souvik Basu (name changed), an examinee from a central Calcutta college.																								The university authorities blamed the delay on the rain and the failure of a large number of examiners to complete the assessment. The university is yet to get the marks of several thousand students from the examiners.																								The prolonged downpour in July-end led to the deferment of some of the tests. The last written test was held on August 3, while the practical exams continued till much later. The postponement led to a delay in distribution of answer scripts to the examiners, said deputy controller Biswas.																								He said the results of the Part I and Part II examinations of the arts and science streams will be declared simultaneously.

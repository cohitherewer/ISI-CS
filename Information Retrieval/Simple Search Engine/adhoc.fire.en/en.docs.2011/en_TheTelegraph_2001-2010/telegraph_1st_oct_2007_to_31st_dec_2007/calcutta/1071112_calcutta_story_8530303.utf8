				 School session talks Jan. to Dec. session plan 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTThe state government is likely to decide by next week the proposed change in the academic session in schools.																								Senior officials in the state school education department are slated to meet the secretaries of various education boards on Monday to finalise the change.																								The government had announced last year that it wanted to revert to the January-December academic session up to Class X from 2008, replacing the May-April schedule.																								The education department has also received some other suggestions, including one from the CPM-backed All Bengal Teachers Association.																								We have met several times since February to discuss the issue. The final meeting is scheduled for Monday, said Debarshi Mondal, the secretary of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education.																								He is a member of a committee set up by the government last year to suggest a session that would best suit the teachers and students.																								Apart from Mondal, those who will attend the meeting include Swapan Sarkar, the secretary of the state council of secondary education, and Debashis Sarkar, the secretary of the state council of Higher Secondary education.																								The government wants to advance the academic session from May-April to January-December to enhance assessment standards.																								In the present system, the annual school exams, held between March and April, almost coincide with Madhyamik and Higher Secondary and also the Class XI test.																								The teachers engaged for marking Madhyamik and Higher Secondary answer scripts get overworked while assessing the scripts of the schools internal tests. This affects the evaluation standards, said a senior official in the school education department.																								The meeting, the official added, will mainly discuss three proposals.																								A section of teachers has suggested that the government introduce the change in a phased manner. Most schools will find it difficult to switch to the January-December system for all classes at one go, a teacher pointed out.																								This group of teachers feels the session should start from March in 2008 and the January-December schedule can be adopted in 2009.																								The All Bengal Teachers Association is opposed to the December-January system and has, instead, suggested that the session start from April and end in March the following year.																								Another section of teachers, also opposed to the January-December model, has recommended a March-February schedule.																								A final decision will be taken after examining all the suggestions, said a senior official in the state education department.

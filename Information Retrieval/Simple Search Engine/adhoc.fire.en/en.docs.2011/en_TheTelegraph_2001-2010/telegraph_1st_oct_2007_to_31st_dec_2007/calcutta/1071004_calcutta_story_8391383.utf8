				 All-woman store
 															- Debut for eight-city roll-out A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta will soon have a retail store manned entirely by women, close on the heels of an all-woman petrol pump and bank branch.																								Pantaloon Retail India, of Kishore Biyanis Future Group, plans to pilot the first such store in the city. The store could be in any of our retail formats, from Big Bazaar to the Pantaloons stores. We have started a scheme to employ women who require flexible working hours. The store will employ women at all levels, from shop floor assistants to managers and above, said Kripesh Hariharan, the general manager (human resources), Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. 																								Pantaloon Retail is looking at launching such stores in seven other cities.																								Pantaloons has tied up with head-hunting agency Avatar I-Win to recruit women who have had to give up work for various reasons. 																								Our research says there will be at least 10,000 such women  mostly trained  in each metropolitan city. Even smaller towns harbour potential waiting to be tapped, said Saundarya Rajesh, the chief executive officer of Avatar I-Win. 																								Pantaloons plans to recruit 300-400 women from Calcutta who will work in various capacities at its outlets.																								This is welcome news to people like me, who have had to take a long break from their professional life because of family commitments, said Nandini Bandyopadhyay, a former geologist and mother of two.																								Women feel motivated in an environment where taking a break is not considered to be a setback in ones career, said Rajesh. Corporate houses and banks like Standard Chartered, Cholamandalam, Unilever and Thompsons Financials are looking at tapping such a resource base in the near future.

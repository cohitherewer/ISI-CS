		 Beyond love																																	Majid Majidi is one of those few internationally-reputed Iranian filmmakers who portrays a gentler picture of Iran than was commonly held in the West after the Islamic Revolution. At the same time, his films use stories about children and families as a way of metaphorically dealing with larger political and social issues. Majidis latest offering, Baran, is being screened at Cinema Asia film fest, conducted by the Eisenstein Cine Club. Baran deals with the story of 17-year-old Lateef, who cooks for labourers at a construction camp. When one of the labourers is hurt, his young son Rahmat comes to work in his place. In his aversion, Lateef spies on Rahmat only to discover that she is a girl. Lateef falls in love with her and from here begins his ordeal as his efforts to protect, trace and help this Afghan refugee girl cost him his belongings, his peace and eventually his greatest possession  his identity card, that is proof of his Iranian citizenship. Circumstances are such that Baran (alias Rahmat), will have to leave for Afghanistan. While boarding the truck, her shoe gets stuck in the mud and he helps her. She leaves and Lateef stares at her footprint which is being washed away by the rain. The film won the critics award at the Montreal Film Festival 2007. To be preceded by the screening of A Journey to the Silk Island (dir: Soumya Banerji).

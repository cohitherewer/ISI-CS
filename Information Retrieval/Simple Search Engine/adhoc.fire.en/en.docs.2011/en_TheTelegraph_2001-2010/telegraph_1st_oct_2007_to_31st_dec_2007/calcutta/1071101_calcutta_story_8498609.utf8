Picture by Aranya Sen				 				 																															Ajay Jadeja came to the city on October 30 to pick a team for the India-Pakistan match in Gwalior. No, the dimple-cheeked ex-cricketer has not turned selector for Team India. He would be accompanying 10 kids, led by Ninja Hattori (the character from the popular cartoon show telecast on the channel Nick), to the galleries of Roop Singh Stadium on November 15. 				 				 																															Ninja and Ajay are looking for a cheering squad of 10 kids and their dads or mums. There will be no jury or judge, said Nina Elavia Jaipuria, vice-president and general manager, Nick India. 				 				 																															Jadeja was full of cheer as he appeared in an orange T-shirt, carrying the channels logo. It was my five-year-old son who insisted that I accept the Nick offer. I never thought there is life in a stadium outside the cricket pitch. But recently I took my son to see a match in Chandigarh and both of us enjoyed it thoroughly, said Jadeja. The flamboyant all-rounder also discovered one advantage of life in the galleries  You can make your own posters! 				 				 																															The same entertainment awaits the parent-child duo who qualify for the high-voltage match. All that they have to do is tune in to Ninja Hattori on Nick India from 6.30pm to 7pm on weekdays and answer some simple questions asked during the show. Answers are being accepted over mobile phone, landline and the Net till November 12, informed Jaipuria. The winners will be flown to Delhi and from there to Gwalior. 				 				 																															Once the other prizes were announced (cellphones, television-sets, notebooks and likes), Jadeja took the field with Ninja himself. The toon star with a heart of gold and super powers, who sleeps upside down, was present in a larger-than-life avatar. But the bowlers whom Jadeja was up against were a bunch of city kids in cricket gear. After an over or two at a side of the hall on an artificial wicket, Jadeja was back to speaking on the real thing  selection of Team India. 				 				 																															You ask me if they did right to drop Rahul Dravid? A few months back, the same people made him captain, saying they were grooming for the future. Saal bhar woh groom hua, phir chala gaya bechara (The poor chap got groomed over the year and then he went away), he said, making the room break into peals of laughter.

	 Dabbawallahs in town		Manish Tripathi at ICFAI Business School. Picture by 		 Aranya SenAfter Kharagpur it was destination Calcutta. Manish Tripathi and Raghunath Dondhiba Medge came all the way from Mumbai to recount their experiences and explain their strategies to a group of students from a city business school. 				 				 																															ICFAI Business School (IBS), Calcutta, in association with The Telegraph, invited the duo at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre in Salt Lake. 				 				 																															The Mumbai dabbawallahs, the men who ferry lunches to countless people there, have been the focus of management academicians for the efficiency of their marketing, customer service, logistics and supply chain. Cycles and local trains of Mumbai form the backbone of the dabbawallahs service. If the supply of the crude oil dries up someday, the price of everything will go up except for our dabbahs, said Manish Tripathi.				 				 																															The interactive session with the dabbawallahs at ICFAI was an open forum for all students. They explained each query with such expertise that one can hardly find any loophole in that, said a second year management student of IBS. 				 				 																															It has already seen huge response from Jadavpur University and IIT Kharagpur who participated at ICFAIs meet. Response from corporate houses like Descon and Nestle was also quite impressive. BCCI will invite them to the city and that time the forum will be open to a bigger audience, said Santanu Ray, director, IBS, Calcutta, who is also the chairman of the education sub-committee of BCCI. Very soon students from ICFAI will go to Mumbai to work with the dabbawallahs, he added. 				 				 																															Their system rarely suffers breakdown. The dabbawallahs function almost without any modern technology other than SMS. The association even runs a website for the benefit of their clients. 				 				 																															According to a study by Forbes Global Magazine, dabbawallahs have made as few as one error in six million deliveries in the last 100 years.				 				 																															The dabbawallahs have been travelling to business schools to talk of their experiences. In March this year, they visited Vinod Gupta School of Management at IIT, Kharagpur, to meet a 40-member team from the University of Nebraska, Omaha, in the US. Their system has been studied at Harvard Business School. Berkeley University in California also teaches the logistics of dabbawallahs in its business management programmes.

	Setting sun and I				 				 																															The clouds hung as fumes from a cigarette end, 
			 				 																															 The sky lay vulnerable, fearing darkness. 
			 				 																															 I stood still in the middle of the sea. 
			 				 																															 But you should have stayed, 
			 				 																															 If not for me, 
			 				 																															 Then for the dim-lit sun to perform its duty. 
			 				 																															 The sun going down 
			 				 																															 Was a lullaby to my weary soul. 
			 				 																															 The ray of divinity, hope and power, 
			 				 																															 Offered the last kiss of bliss on earth. 
			 				 																															 It was the vision of God on earth, 
			 				 																															 A poem of Tagore to the ear, 
			 				 																															 It was the morning dew on your face. 
			 				 																															 And you could have stayed, if not for me, 
			 				 																															 For the sun which looked a little red. 				 				 																															Asijit Dutta				 				 																
	Mystery of life				 				 																The rain fell unheard, 
			 				 																 For its a sin to proclaim its worth, 
			 				 																 The spring song of the bird, 
			 				 																 Encompassed the barren earth. 
			 				 																 Beauty walked down an empty lane, 
			 				 																 It was a sordid sight, 
			 				 																 For truth lay abandoned in helpless pain, 
			 				 																 In the countless hours of the lonely night. 
			 				 																 Mysteries rode the tides of time, 
			 				 																 Undeciphered, they still grew stranger, 
			 				 																 The golden silence still in pantomime, 
			 				 																 While he nursed a babe in the manger. 
			 				 																 He pondered where the babe should take birth, 
			 				 																 Once it was time for it to part, 
			 				 																 To quench the thirst of the parched earth, 
			 				 																 He cursed humanity with a heart. 				 				 																															Aditya Vikram Mehrotra,

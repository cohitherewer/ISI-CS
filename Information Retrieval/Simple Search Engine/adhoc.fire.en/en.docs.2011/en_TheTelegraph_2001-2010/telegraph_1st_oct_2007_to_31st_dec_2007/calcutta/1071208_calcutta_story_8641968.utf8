				 Bail and jail for Idris

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER
																								Idris Ali was granted bail on Friday in a case related to instigating violence in the city, only to be rearrested for creating trouble elsewhere.
																								The All India Minority Forum president was held in connection with the Park Circus violence on November 21 and charged with attempt to murder, rioting, causing injury to police and public and damaging public property.
																								Soon after Sealdah court granted him bail in the Park Circus case, the North 24-Parganas police sought his custody on charges of creating trouble and organising a blockade in Amdanga on November 10.
																								Since Amdanga is not under my jurisdiction, I cannot release Ali, said the judge, turning down defence counsel pleas to ignore the arrest warrant of the district police.
																								An officer in Amdanga police station said Ali, also a Congress leader, had led a demonstration on November 10, demanding action against the publisher of a book that has allegedly maligned a religion.
																								The charges brought against Ali by the North 24-Parganas police are baseless. We will soon move court for his bail, said Shahid Imam, one of Alis lawyers. 
																								The leader has been accused of being party to the Park Circus violence by Park Street, Entally and Beniapukur police stations. On December 5, Bankshal court had granted him bail in the case lodged by Park Street and Entally police.
																								The Congress, which had suspended Ali for his alleged role in the violence, has taken the leader back in its fold.
																								He was made a scapegoat, said Pradesh Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

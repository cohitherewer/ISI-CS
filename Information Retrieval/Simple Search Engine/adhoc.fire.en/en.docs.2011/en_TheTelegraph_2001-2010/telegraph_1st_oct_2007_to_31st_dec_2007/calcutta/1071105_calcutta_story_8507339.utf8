		 Frozen frames of ephemerality																																	Soumitra Datta is an acclaimed photographer, specialising in landscape photography for the past 20 years. The photographs at the ongoing show, presented by Jara Parijaee, portray some magical moments and moods of nature. The exhibits present an array of shades and lights, of patterns of innumerable designs, born in the ephemeral realities of natural surroundings. Through his lens, Datta rediscovers the beauty of things we observe casually, admire and eventually become oblivious to. Dattas efforts are not limited to only depicting natures beauty, but also making us aware of what treasures we have and what exactly we stand to lose if we meddle with nature and disturb the ecological balance.

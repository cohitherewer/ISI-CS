				 Airport upgrade from January 1
 SANJAY MANDAL																								The Rs 2,000-crore airport modernisation project will take off on January 1, 2008.																								Our first task will be to construct the integrated terminal building. Work will begin on New Years Day, said S.P.S. Bakshi, the regional executive director (east) of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the director of the modernisation project.																								The revamp is scheduled to be complete by January 2010.																								The AAI is now setting up infrastructure support for the mega project. We are trying to ensure that work is not hampered by the lack of power, water or drainage services, explained Bakshi.																								The detailed project report for modernisation has been finalised by the AAI headquarters in Delhi. The report has been submitted to the civil aviation ministry for its approval, said K. Ramalingam, the AAI chairman. 																								The plan envisages two terminals at the airport  the large integrated one for domestic and international flights and a smaller one for international flights. The facilities at the terminals will be on a par with some leading international airports, including ground-floor arrival and first-floor departure.																								The terminals will have the capacity to handle 20 million passengers annually, stated Bakshi.																								Once the terminals are ready, work will start on a modern air traffic control (ATC) building. The current ATC office is situated between the international and domestic terminals. It will be shifted to the other side of the runway. This will ensure that even if a third runway is built, the ATC will be able to control air traffic movement from its strategic location, said Bakshi. 																								A grant of Rs 200 crore has been sanctioned for the modernisation of the ATC. A major portion of the funds will be used for upgrade of equipment. State-of-the-art LCD monitors will replace the sets that are being used for almost 10 years. New software will also be installed to automatically feed aircraft code and call sign information into the radar system. 																								In addition, several modern aerobridges will be built. The road network around the airport will be improved with the help of the public works department. 																								Underpasses and flyovers will be constructed to ensure smooth traffic flow to and from the airport.

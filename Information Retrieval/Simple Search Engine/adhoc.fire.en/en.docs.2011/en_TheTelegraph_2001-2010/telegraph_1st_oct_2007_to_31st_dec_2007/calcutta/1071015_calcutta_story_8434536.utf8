				 Rally to press for justice
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Over 200 Tiljala residents took out a rally on Sunday morning, demanding justice for Rizwanur Rahmans family. The rally was announced before the Id namaz on the ground adjacent to the Rahmans Tiljala Lane home.																								The participants, many of them women and children, marched down Samshul Huda Road to Suhrawardy Avenue, before making their way back to Tiljala Lane down Darga Road. They carried banners and posters demanding punishment for the police officers involved in the case. 																								Mamata Banerjee and some Trinamul Congress workers, including local legislator Javed Ahmed Khan, joined the rally on Dilkhusa Street. Theatre personalities Saoli Mitra and Bibhas Chakraborty joined the procession near Park Circus Maidan.																								Banerjee met Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan after the hour-long walk. 																								Mamatadi promised my mother that she would carry on the movement for a CBI probe into my brothers murder, said Rukbanur.																								Homemaker Sehnaz Khatun, who took part in the rally, said: If the chief minister knows of the polices involvement, why isnt he suspending the officers in charge, so that there can be a fair inquiry? He is visiting the Rahmans and placating them, while the governments lawyer is defending the police officers in court.

 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Partha Mitter during his lecture at Victoria Memorial Hall on Monday evening. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								The Luddites were the English workers of early 19th Century who opposed mechanisation and destroyed machinery. A few decades later, both Rabindranath and Gandhi advocated the simplicity of rural India as the antithesis of the colonial cities like Calcutta and Bombay whose economies were buttressed by capitalism.																								London-based art historian Partha Mitter, who gave a lecture at Victoria Memorial Hall on Monday evening at the launch of his new book, The Triumph of Modernism, Indias Artists and the Avant-garde, 1922-1947, contended that three Indian artists in the 1920s had consciously chosen primitivism as a mode of expression, thereby gaining entry into the global avant-garde.																								The naivety of primitive art is, of course, a myth, as the structure of African art goes to show. Mitter was trying to move away from the art historical obsession with influence as the cultural context of the Indian avant-garde was far removed from the avant-garde in the West. 																								Print culture had already brought the centre  the West  and the peripheries  such as India  together and created what Mitter called virtual cosmoplitans  those who are exposed to the world through literature. With the entry of Gandhi in the freedom struggle, for the first time peasants joined the movement.																								The three Indian artists Mitter had chosen to prove his point about primitivism were Amrita Sher-Gil, Rabindranath Tagore and Jamini Roy.																								Sher-Gil, who had launched a virulent attack on the pallid Bengal School, depicted the melancholy of rural India and avoided effeminacy through flatness and a formalist technique. Mitter stressed that her bi-sexuality played a pivotal role in her body of work.																								The primitivism of Rabindranath, who began to doodle after 60, was an inner journey that questioned his mimetic literary vocabulary.																								Jamini Roy sought out the robust art of village painters as a profound rejection of the hollow life in the cities. For him art had a communal function and so he subverted the notion of individual inspiration by collaborating with students.																								Art historian Pranab Ranjan Ray, however, pointed out that Roy was too sophisticated to be labelled thus.

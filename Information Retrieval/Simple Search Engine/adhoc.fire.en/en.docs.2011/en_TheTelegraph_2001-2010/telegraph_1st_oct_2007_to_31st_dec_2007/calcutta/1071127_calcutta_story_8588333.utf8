		 Delineating the design of desire																																	Vasana (picture right), is a performance where the varied arts of dance, drama, poetry, music, yoga and martial skills commingle to take a look at the concept of desire or the will. The concept has under its purview all forms of desire, beginning from that of Almighty Himself. It was Gods desire to create that put into shape this whole cosmos: God is constantly making love to Nature and the whole universe thus runs. This same formidable will is seen in an artist who creates an artefact, providing a tangible validation of his or her idea. The dance-theatre addresses the significant issue of the equation between the creator and the created  a question that has spawned millions of debates from ancient times to the present day. The performance will be preceded by Manan, another dance-theatre that has no definite structure and depicts the maxim of all art  improvisation. Manan thus becomes a celebration of art. The dance-theatre performances have been conceived by Ritusri and Suman.

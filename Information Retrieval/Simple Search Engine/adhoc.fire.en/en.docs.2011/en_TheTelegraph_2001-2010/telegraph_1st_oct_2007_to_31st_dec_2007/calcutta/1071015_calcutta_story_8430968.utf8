				 Puja help for horses
 															- Riding schools old animals get life-long care SUBHRO SAHA																								Its a rare reprieve for 14 retired horses of the Police Training College, Barrackpore, before the Puja.																								These ageing animals, unfit for police duty, wont be put down for want of resources and stable space. Instead, they will be taken care of unto death by an NGO, with the fodder funds coming from Writers Buildings.																								The state finance department has okayed a proposal from the riding school of the Police Training College, which had sought to stop the practice of putting to sleep the infirm horses in its fold.																								The animal hospital-cum-shelter, Ashari, in Mukundapur, off the EM Bypass, run by People For Animals (PFA), will take care of 14 of its retired horses. PFA pledged to take total responsibility of the animals, while suggesting that the police provide the feeding expenditure of Rs 32 a day per horse.																								We have received a letter from the finance department, sanctioning six months maintenance cost, and directing us to move the horses to Ashari, inspector Dilip Kumar Sarkar, riding master at the Barrackpore institute, told Metro on Sunday.																								In August last year, G.C. Dutt, then deputy inspector-general of police (training) of the Police Training College, had written to PFA, asking for the cost of taking care of these horses until death.																								This is a heart-warming gesture and should be an eye-opener for many other institutes saddled with infirm animals, said Debasis Chakrabarti, the managing trustee of PFA Calcutta. Chakrabarti added that the transportation of the horses would be completed as soon as the formalities are over.																								The horses will be kept in an exclusive, free-roaming, 5,000-sq-ft paddock with a 1,000 sq ft shed, with provision for walks on the Ashari campus, spread over 4.4 acres.

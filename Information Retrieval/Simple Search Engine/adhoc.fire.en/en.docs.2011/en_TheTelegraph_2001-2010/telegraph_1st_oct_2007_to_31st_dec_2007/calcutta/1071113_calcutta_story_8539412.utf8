				 Joka jitters over campus job meet
 															- SHADOW OVER SUMMER PLACEMENTS, STARTING THURSDAY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 PLACEMENT PANGS: The Indian Institute of Management Calcutta campus at Joka. A Telegraph picture																								The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta is getting pre-placement jitters of a different kind.																								With summer placements starting from Thursday under the shadow of Nandigram, the students on the Joka campus are worried that this will turn out to be a winter of discontent.																								A number of companies come from outside the state and if this uncertainty continues, they might not be able to reach the campus, feared Anindya Sen, the dean of programme initiatives at IIM Calcutta.																								The students are hoping for some kind of normalcy being restored by Wednesday, following two days of disruption.																								The weeklong process on campus sees companies like Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan coming in. Last year, 85 companies had touched down in Joka for the summer placements.																								Students are busy making travel arrangements for company representatives coming to Calcutta for the summer of 08.																								The placement cell representatives kept up a brave front on Monday, stressing that the political unrest would not hit placements.																								Things are proceeding according to plan, but who knows what will happen if things take a turn for the worse over the next couple of days? said Vijay Menon, the external relations secretary of IIM Calcutta.																								The companies, on their part, have not expressed any reservations yet about coming to the campus from Thursday. 																								But the impact of Mondays bandh was felt at Joka. The institute buses could not ply normally and so many professors who do not stay on the campus were unable to take classes. Making up lost ground is almost impossible, rued dean Anindya Sen.

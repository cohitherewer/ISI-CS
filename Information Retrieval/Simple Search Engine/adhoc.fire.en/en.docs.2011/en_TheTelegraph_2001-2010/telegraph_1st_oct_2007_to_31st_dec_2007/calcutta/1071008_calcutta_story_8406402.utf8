				 Twenty20 delights deity
 															- Yuvrajs sixers, Sreesanths match-winner catch as pandal illumination POULOMI BANERJEE				 	 Yuvraj powers one of his six sixers in the match with England. (PTI)																								The boys who brought the Twenty20 World Cup home have scored big with Puja organisers. The win came too late to become the main theme of pandals, but the Men in Blue will be seen across town, in light.																								Our pandal is modelled on Delhis Akshaydham. We will bring in the Twenty20 victory in the lighting. After India won the World Cup, we went to our electricians in Chandernagore and placed fresh orders, said Gautam Basu, the secretary of Ekdalia Evergreen Club.																								Yuvrajs six sixes off Chris Broad will be the highlight. Balls of light will streak across the sky from the Team India vice-captains bat to the roofs of six buildings in the area, added Basu.																								If big-hitting Yuvraj is the chosen one at the south Calcutta puja, fiery Sreesanth will occupy pride of place at College Square, in north Calcutta. 																								Our pandal is modelled on the Puttaparthi Sai Baba temple and the idol is traditional. We always try to bring in something topical in our lighting, and this year is no different. Apart from the Twenty20 victory, we will show Sunita Williamss space voyage, said Badal Bhattacharjee of the College Square puja committee																								Here, too, the order for lights was changed at the last minute to show the exploits of the Twenty20 champions. The catch by Sreesanth that gave India the cup will be the main attraction. Since it is Dhoni who led India to victory, we want to show some of his performances as well, added Bhattacharjee.																								Babu Pal of Pal Electric Company, in Chandernagore, is racing against the clock to incorporate the changes: I am working on the lighting for the Sreesanth catch. The rain and the last-minute changes have slowed us down. There are also Puja orders from Jharkhand to show the Twenty20 victory. We are confident of doing a good job.																								Now, all that is needed to ensure that the lights are a hit is a victory or four against the Aussies.

				 Network jam cuts off callers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Network congestion stood between more Calcuttans on Wednesday than rioters.																								The GSM cellphone networks collapsed, unable to cope with a large chunk of over 40 lakh subscribers calling their near and dear ones to find out if they were safe.																								We have a margin of 30 per cent over our load, but the traffic went up by 50-60 per cent in the areas affected by rioting. You cannot plan for such a situation. However, many subscribers got through on the third or the fourth attempt, said Ajay Puri, CEO (mobility), Bharti Airtel. The company has over 15 lakh subscribers in the city.																								If a traffic hike is expected in a particular area, for example in and around Eden Gardens when it hosts an international match, the capacity of the towers there is boosted, according to the cellphone service providers. On Wednesday, the call traffic peaked in the troubled areas, which were out of bounds for the companies.																								On special occasions, such as Durga puja, the networks often struggle to deal with the traffic. The number of text messages sent on a network in a day can then go up from 10 lakh to 25 lakh. 																								The thumb rule for service providers is that the call traffic is twice the SMS traffic.																								No one can plan for a day like this. We have the infrastructure to serve our 16.3 lakh customers. On Wednesday, most of them made twice their usual number of calls. The route to the switches that process the calls got blocked, said Sridhar Rao, CEO (eastern region), Vodafone Essar.																								The company claimed that it has a margin of 50-60 per cent over its load. 																								BSNL, which has nearly eight lakh GSM subscribers, adopted a novel strategy. Calls from key zones, such as BBD Bag, were treated preferentially, said an official.

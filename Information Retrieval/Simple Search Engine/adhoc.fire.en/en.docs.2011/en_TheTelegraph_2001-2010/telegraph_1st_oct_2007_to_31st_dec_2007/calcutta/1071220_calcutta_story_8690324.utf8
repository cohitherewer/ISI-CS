 Breathing life into art

 It was an evening in which creative juices flowed, as students of animation academy Ready To Go Animate sketched away on their drawing boards developing story ideas for projects.
 The intermingling of various media, along with inputs from artists Shuvaprasanna, sculptor Niranjan Pradhan and film-maker Goutam Ghose, offered students a chance to broaden their horizons and share ideas.
 ldquo;Colours and sounds exist all around us. It is up to the artist to draw meaning and create music and art out of these sensory impressions, rdquo; said Shuvaprasanna.
 Goutam Ghose agreed: ldquo;The most important thing is the imagination of the artist. With the skill of animation, you can take it a step further. rdquo; He suggested that the animators of tomorrow could draw on the rich history and techniques of east European schools of animation, especially the Zagreb school, along with the Walt Disney tradition.
 ldquo;We should draw on the rich treasure of motifs in our own country with its folk elements and mythology and create our own icons like Sukumar Ray did in Abol Tabol, rdquo; stressed Ghose. 
 Based on their impressions to the background music, students had an hour to sketch their ideas, forming an entry point into the script for the animation project.
 ldquo;My sketch fuses the idea of war with the birth of a new warrior, drawn from the high and low pitches of the music, which to me signified the intensity of the battlefield on one hand and the gentleness of the child on the other, rdquo; said Shaumyabrata Roy, one of the students at the academy.
 With the advent of technologies like rotoscopy and motion capture, used in Robert Zemeckis rsquo;s Beowulf and Richard Linklater rsquo;s A Scanner Darkly, and with India coming into its own with productions like Hanuman and Krishna, there is a boom in the animation industry. ldquo;We hope to equip our students with the skills necessary to provide the kind of content demanded by the industry. Studies predict that more than 20,000 animators will be needed by 2010, rdquo; said Arjun Jindal, managing director, Ready To Go Animate.
 Here rsquo;s hoping that art keeps coming to life in the hands of this bunch.

 Hearts of gold
 From quiz to cartooning and one-act plays, the students of Hartley rsquo;s School made Little Hearts 2007 bloom. More than 11 schools participated in the fest, organised recently at Rabindra Sadan.
 Students of Classes III-V took part in the fest. The event was inaugurated by theatre personality Dolly Basu. 
 Little Hearts began with one-act play Operetta. The theme for the day was ldquo;global warming rdquo;. The dance event Fandango added colour to the ambience. Hartley rsquo;s bagged the first prize, followed by Mahadevi Birla School for Girls and South Point High School.
 ldquo;The best part of the event was the cartoon-drawing contest. Some of the characters like Tintin, Power Rangers and Tom and Jerry, were exciting, rdquo; said Nupur, a Hartley rsquo;s student. Students also showed their expertise in thumb-painting, dry flower arrangement and collage. Hartley rsquo;s won the fashion event Fantasia, with MB Girls and National High School for Boys coming in as runners-up and second runners-up, respectively.
 The quiz comprised audio-visual rounds and subjective questions. 
 The fest wrapped up with the prize distribution ceremony. Hartley rsquo;s expectedly emerged champions. Being the host school, it handed over the trophy to runners-up MB Girls.

 BD Memorial Institute, as a part of its awareness initiatives, organised a two-day long event on global warming from December 1 to December 3.
 On the first day, a quiz contest was organised, with Classes IX and X of the school competing against each other. Class IX-2 emerged the winner after a neck and neck contest, with Class X-3 ending as the runners-up. 
 Cultural events marked the finale on December 3. The school auditorium was decorated beautifully with posters and placards on global warming made by the students.
 Nivedita Sen, the secretary of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, was the chief guest. She stressed on the importance of creating awareness at the school level to pressure corporate houses to manufacture non-polluting products. 
 A fusion dance recital depicted the severity of the problem. The programme ended with a dance drama highlighting the need to preserve the environment. ldquo;It rsquo;s the students who can make a difference, rdquo; remarked Sen.

		 Speaking canvases																																	Gen Next II brings together 40 young Indian artists from the contemporary art scene. With articulate narratives, drama of colour and subtle shades of passion, these works hint at what to expect from the next generation of Indian art. The creative energy is conveyed through various media like fibre glass, bronze, aluminium, paper pulp, leather, foam and wood in combination with canvas, along with oil, acrylic and watercolour. While some explore the tender joys of childhood, others look for hidden meanings in forms of objects. Yet some works evoke the lurking primitivism in all of us. Some use metaphors on the definite dimensions of the canvas to recreate the larger abstract realities. Humour is also a part of some works. Playing with the language of art, these works make the artist and the viewer delve into layers of psychological insight, into the collective human subconscious. With the wide range it addresses, the exhibition has become a confluence of creative minds, ideas and generations: old and new. On view: one of the works at the ongoing exhibition.

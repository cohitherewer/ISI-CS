		 Ode to melody and passion																																	One of the most significant contributions of the Mughal rule to Indian art and culture can be seen in the musical genre of ghazals. Combining the less complex strains of Hindustani music and the very best of Urdu poetry, ghazals represent the refined tastes in Indian music. Besides the verse of Amir Khusrau, Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, Daag Delhvi and Iqbal, the ghazals are often composed with verses from the greatest of Sufi saints and other great socio-religious reformers. Vinod Kumar, who also happens to be the director of the Hindi Sangit Institution, New Delhi, presents a series of ghazals which he has composed, laying emphasis on the classical form of Hindustani vocals. He has hand-picked most of the lyrics from literary compositions and all songs are based on classical ragas, thus enabling him to do justice to the words he has put to melody.

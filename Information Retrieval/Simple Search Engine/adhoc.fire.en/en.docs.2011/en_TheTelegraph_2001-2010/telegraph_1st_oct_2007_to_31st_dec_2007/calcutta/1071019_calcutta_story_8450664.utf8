				 Top cop calls Rahman
 A STAFF REPORTER The day after he took over as police commissioner, Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti called Rizwanur Rahmans brother Rukbanur on Thursday morning and enquired after him and other family members.																								Chakrabarti assured Rukbanur of all help and promised to provide security to all family members if they ask for it.																								He gave Rukbanur his phone numbers and asked him to get in touch if the family required any help.																								We were pleasantly surprised on receiving a call from the new police commissioner. We hope he will consider our demands, Rukbanur said.																								Chakrabarti then went to Writers Buildings to meet home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray.																								The two had a brief meeting, following which Chakrabarti left for Lalbazar.																								At the city police headquarters, the commissioner met all the divisional deputy commissioners and sought reports on the Puja security arrangements.																								He asked the deputy commissioners if they were facing any problem in ensuring a peaceful Puja.																								Among other things, he discussed the traffic situation and the measures that were being taken to ensure that there was no major snarl, said a senior officer.																								He reportedly told the officers not to get demoralised following the transfer of the three senior IPS officers in the force.																								Later in the afternoon, around 4pm, Chakrabarti again went to Writers Buildings to meet finance minister Asim Dasgupta.																								Stepping out, he told reporters that his first priority was the Puja.																								He added that if required, he might call on the Rahmans any time.

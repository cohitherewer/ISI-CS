				 Festive footfall amp; traffic trouble  															- Shoppers beeline to New Market gladdens traders, maddens motorists ZEESHAN JAWED				 	 The chaos on Chowringhee, caused by festive shoppers at New Market. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Footfall and frenzy, crowd and chaos  welcome to New Market in the countdown to the festive fortnight. With Id and Durga Puja serving up a rare double bill of revelry this month, the traditional shoppers stop has come alive to trade push and traffic snarls, pedestrians and pickpockets.																								We are happy that so many shoppers have returned to New Market for this festive season. Business is booming, but so is traffic trouble and a general sense of chaos, says Abbas Ali Iqbal of Magic Shoe Gallery, on Lindsay Street.																								This Puja, the 133-year-old market has the citys first fully automated Parkomat to show off, but shopkeepers allege it is hindering rather than helping traffic flow. The entire system works so slowly that it gives rise to a long queue of cars outside, alleges one.																								With no-entry and no-parking signs being regularly flouted and shoppers clogging Lindsay Street and even a portion of Chowringhee, the drive from Esplanade to Park Street is now a dreaded one. Hundreds of people are entering the New Market area from various entry points. As the crowd is slow-moving, it is causing bottlenecks at all entry and exit points. Managing peak-time traffic here is really tough, admitted a sergeant on duty in front of Oberoi Grand.																								But most shopkeepers of New Market, back in business after a lengthy lull, are not complaining about the crowd crush. The festive season is generally good for New Market, but this year the turnout is unprecedented, smiled Ram Manglani, the additional secretary, SS Hogg Market Association.																								And this comes after the worst few months for New Market, with shoppers deserting the user-unfriendly zone for swank malls. With Id and Puja separated by just a few days, the tide has turned dramatically for New Market and the infrastructure-strapped zone is groaning under the strain.																								The Id shopping continues for three weeks and Puja shopping for six weeks. The combination has triggered a mini revival of the entire New Market shopping zone, says shopkeeper Abbas Ali Iqbal.																								With the invasion of shoppers has come the influx of pickpockets and shoplifters. As the pavements are overrun by hawkers and there is a constant jostle, it is impossible to guard against pre-Puja thieves, said a cop on duty.

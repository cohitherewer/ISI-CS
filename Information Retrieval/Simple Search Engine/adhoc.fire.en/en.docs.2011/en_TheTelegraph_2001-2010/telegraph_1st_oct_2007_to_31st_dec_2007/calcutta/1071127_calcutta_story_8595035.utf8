				 Fresh cry to save Memorial
 															- MAIDAN RALLY BAN PLEA OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								To save Victoria Memorial Hall from pollution, environmentalist Subhas Dutta has pleaded with the high court to ask the state government and the army not to allow any rally on Brigade Parade Ground.																								The prayer, filed on Monday, is likely to come up for hearing on Wednesday before a division bench headed by Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya.																								Dutta has also pleaded with the court to ask the government to identify a site outside Calcutta where rallies could be held.																								Till the site is identified, the authorities could allow rallies on the greens, but only after imposing certain conditions on the organisers, Dutta has submitted.																								Not allowing vehicles carrying rallyists within three km of the monument, banning smoking on the Maidan during a rally and setting up adequate toilets for the participants are some of the conditions proposed by the petitioner.																								Dutta cited an affidavit filed by the army in 2003, in which it stated that rallies should be banned on the Maidan to keep air pollution of the area under check. Any pollution on the Maidan will affect the Memorial, Dutta claimed.																								On September 28, in an attempt to save the Memorial from pollution, the court had directed the government to shift the Esplanade bus terminus and regulate traffic in the area. The court had also banned car parking outside the Memorial and asked the government not to issue licences to open hotels or restaurants in the area.

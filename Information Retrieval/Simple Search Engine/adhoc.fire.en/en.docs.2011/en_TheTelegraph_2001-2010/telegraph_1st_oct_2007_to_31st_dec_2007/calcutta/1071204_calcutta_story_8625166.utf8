				 Cop assault cry at Eden
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Policemen posted at Eden Gardens are in the middle of another controversy, with a spectator accusing them of beating him up on Monday.																								Sheikh Ziyauddin, 28, alleged that he was beaten up while waiting for the crowd to thin in L-I block after end of the fourth days play. The incident took place around 4.10pm. 																								Ziyauddin said he was standing near a flight of steps on the gallery when an assistant sub-inspector asked him to leave the ground immediately. I told him that I was waiting for the crowd to clear out a bit, but the officer first pushed me and after a heated exchange of words, slapped me.																								According to Ziyauddin, he repeatedly tried to reason with the sub-inspector and the other officers who had gathered, but they did not listen. 																								The officers held me by the collar and asked me to move. I said I would like to speak to the police commissioner. They said I could call up anyone I wanted to after leaving the spot.																								The spectator called up a senior police officer from his mobile phone but he didnt help. Ziyauddin then called up the police commissioner. Only then did an officer come to my rescue.																								According to Ziyauddin, the police commissioner had asked an officer of joint commissioner rank, posted at Eden Gardens, to help him.																								We have heard of the matter and have asked the spectator to submit his complaint in writing. We will definitely probe the incident, said joint police commissioner Sudhir Mishra.

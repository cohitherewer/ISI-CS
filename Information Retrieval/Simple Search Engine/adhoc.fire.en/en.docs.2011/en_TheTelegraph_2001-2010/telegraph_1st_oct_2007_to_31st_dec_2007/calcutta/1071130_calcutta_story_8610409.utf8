				 Maoist calls to demand money 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								The owner of a Shyambazar shop has been receiving extortion calls from someone claiming to be a Maoist.																								The calls came on Tuesday and Wednesday, prompting shop-owner Arghya Kundu to lodge a complaint with Tallah police station.																								This is the first time someone claiming to be a Maoist has demanded money from a city-based businessman. Security around the utensil shop has been beefed up, said a police officer.																								The caller first demanded Rs 20,000, saying the money was needed for a cause which he did not specify. The amount was scaled down to Rs 10,000 after Kundu said he could not pay more than Rs 500, the officer added.																								The first few calls on Tuesday were received by shop employees, who reported the matter to Kundu. On Wednesday, Kundu installed a caller line identification machine. 																								Three calls came on Wednesday, two of which were traced to a Sealdah phone booth.																								In the last call, the man asked Kundu to carry the cash in a bag and leave it near a lamp post at one end of Khardah station. The caller assured Kundu that there would be people to help him keep the bag at the designated spot. The man said he would make a call soon after, confirming whether he had received the money, said a Tallah police station officer.																								The police said they are trying to find out if the caller is a Maoist or a business rival of Kundu.																								nCracker FIR: The state pollution control board on Wednesday filed an FIR against a city-based industrialist for bursting banned crackers within the East Calcutta Wetlands area during a wedding at a Bypass hotel. Environment secretary M.L. Meena said the cracker burst was reported from 9pm to midnight on Tuesday. We inspected the site on Wednesday morning and found remnants of the banned items, said a board official.

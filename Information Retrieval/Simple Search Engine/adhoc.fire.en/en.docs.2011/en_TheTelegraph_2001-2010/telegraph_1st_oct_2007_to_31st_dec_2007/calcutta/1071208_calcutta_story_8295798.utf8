				 Helpless against nexus

																								After exposing the licence racket in the public vehicles department (PVD), Metro threw the floor open to the readers. Excerpts:
																								I had to go to the PVD 11 times, just to remove a banks name from my registration certificate, as I had paid back my loan amount. I found it impossible to get any job done without paying a bribe. Each and everyone there seemed corrupt. They asked for bribes openly. Some even said: We are government employees, you cant do anything. I really felt helpless. Even the policemen posted there are corrupt.
																								Even after 11 visits, the file didnt move. I paid a tout and the job was done!
																								Nabendu Sinha 
																								Why even have this department? We should just be able to fill up a form and they should send the licence by mail. God save our roads!

																								You have shown how easy it is to get a driving licence without knowing how to drive. This is really sad and shocking. Blood is being spilt on our streets because of the corruption of PVD officials. I would like you to highlight the plight of the law-abiding citizen and to try and stop this wrong.

																								Every motor vehicles officer is corrupt. I had a brush with Barasat Motor Vehicles, where I just failed to get a driving licence renewed without paying a tout.

																								When I approached a tout outside the PVD building for a new licence, he said if I paid Rs 2,500, I would get it without appearing for the test. The nexus is so strong that one cannot approach any staff member directly.

																								I got my International Driving Licence within a week without appearing for a test at Beltola in 1998. I had tried to get a licence the proper way but I was really harassed. Fed up, I gave in to the tout raj. Then, everyone was happy.

																								A 42-year-old man has been working in my workshop for the past 14 years and I know he can ride a bicycle. Last week, he approached me for help to get his driving licence renewed. It had expired in 2000. I was shocked that he had a driving licence in the first place. More was to follow  he wanted to be enlisted in the heavy vehicles category on his two-wheeler eligibility.
																								So, why do you need the additional enlistment?
																								On Sundays, I learn to drive a minibus in Howrah. But now they are demanding a licence! I vowed never to step into a Howrah minibus.

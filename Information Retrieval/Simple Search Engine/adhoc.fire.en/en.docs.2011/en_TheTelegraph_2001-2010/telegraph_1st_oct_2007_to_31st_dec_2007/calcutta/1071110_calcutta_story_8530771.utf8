				 Warships on view in city
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Four warships and a patrol ship will be on display in the city next week, ahead of Navy Day on December 4.																								INS Karmukh, INS Kirch, INS Khanjar and INS Sukanya will be open to the public at Kidderpore dock on November 14. INS Kulish can be explored on November 14 and 15 at Man O War jetty, next to Prinsep Ghat.																								This is the first time we have managed to bring four warships to Calcutta, said wing commander R.K. Das, the spokesperson for the defence ministry.																								While INS Karmukh, INS Kirch, INS Khanjar and INS Kulish are warships, INS Sukanya is a patrol vessel. The warships carry missiles and have helipads on board.																								INS Sukanya is also used as a presidential ship.																								The ships will reach Calcutta in the afternoon of November 13. INS Karmukh will dock in Calcutta for the second time this year. It had come to the city in February.																								It is difficult to bring four warships to the Calcutta port. Being deep-sea vessels, they cannot make their way to Kidderpore because of silt on the Hooghly bed. But we have somehow managed to organise the visit, added Das.																								The navy wants to create awareness about ships among people, especially youngsters, by bringing them to Calcutta. Many people dont know even the basics about ships, said Das.

				 Pandals put back the clock 
 															- Clash of civilisations at community Pujas SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 				 Egypt at Bhowanipore; (above):			 				 the 41 Pally idol, Inca-style. Pictures by				 				 Aranya Sen 																								While the nation was in a frenzy to elect the Taj Mahal among the New Seven Wonders a few months ago, many Puja organisers were getting into a huddle. As a result, at many a pandal, the clock is being turned back by centuries.																								Bygone civilisations are back this Puja and different localities are leaping across continents and ages to bring alive pages from history books. 																								At the Defence Unit puja, off Sadananda Road, in Kalighat, a pyramid has come up. We had thought of doing the Taj Mahal itself, but it would have taken more space, says Surajit Mullick of the club. Instead, there are panels depicting Pharaohs being coronated, ordering a pyramid, worshipping the sun, going to war and being mummified. Outside the pandal, scenes of domestic life of the Egyptians have been etched out. The lighting will also be linked to the theme, said theme-maker Saikat Chatterjee.																								Around Haridevpur, further south, its a clash of civilisations. If established player in the theme game 41 Pally is depicting the Incas, close-by new comer United Club is bringing alive the Indus Valley. 																								We had voted for the Taj, says United Club joint secretary Debashis Roy. If they did not choose Taj as theme, the reason is accessibility. The Mohenjodaro remains are beyond our borders, in Pakistan. But one can visit Taj Mahal any time, says Roy. 																								Models of familiar finds in the relics  the mother goddess, a bullock cart and the dancing girl  will greet visitors who will walk into the complex, resembling the Great Bath. The goddess will bear the bronzed look and ornaments of the age.																								Machu Picchu in Peru is where Durga will be worshipped at in 41 Pally. We have procured a lightweight stone called siporex to create the broken wall of the temple. Three of the famous figures are also being created, says Dipankar Chatterjee. 																								So which club in the area influenced which? We are happy that Machu Picchu has become topical but anyone can tell by looking at our pandal that we started work earlier, comes the retort.

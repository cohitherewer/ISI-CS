				 Cops tense, mum
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The high court order of a CBI probe into Rizwanur Rahmans death has stunned the top brass in Lalbazar and the CID. Few in the force thought the case would be handed over to the central agency so soon.																								While deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh refused to comment, deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar said: Let the truth come out. 																								The senior officers in Lalbazar appeared tense on Tuesday evening, trying to figure out who among them would be summoned by the CBI.																								The CBI probe ruling is a bolt from the blue, said a senior officer at Lalbazar. We did not expect this.																								Another officer, fear writ large on his face, said: Who knows whose head will roll tomorrow?																								What is also worrying the city police is the prospect of being summoned and asked to depose before officers of the central agency, who are likely to be from other states.																								While the CID was probing the case, four officers of the city police had to record their statements before sleuths from the same cadre as theirs.																								The CID bosses, on the other hand, were disappointed that their inquiry might finally amount to nothing and also outraged at their probe being declared illegal.																								Most CID officers could not accept the fact that their probe into the mysterious death of the 30-year-old computer graphics teacher was not in accordance with the law.																								All our hard work during the probe has been dubbed illegal, said a CID officer on the case. We hope the state government will appeal against the order, at least the part of the ruling that described our probe illegal.																								Some of the officers involved with the probe even quoted the law in an attempt to defend their role. 																								If Rizwanurs family thinks todays high court order has brought them justice, we hope we, too, will get justice one day, said a senior CID officer.

				 Faces everybody wants to gaze at
				 				 																															College Square: The Satya Sai temple has a top draw in a 27-ft chandelier, modelled on the Puttaparthi original. Youngsters thronged to see the illuminations of a demon emerging from the pool, as well as Sunita Williamss space journey and Dhonis six from the T20 World Cup, says puja committee secretary Bikash Majumdar.				 				 																															Mohd Ali Park: The theme here is a protest against female foeticide. A girl lies at the feet of the goddess alongside Mahishasur, ready to be killed, with a doctor showing her parents the sonography report. We have put up statues of female professionals to show that a girl, too, can make it in life, says vice-president Dinesh Bajaj.				 				 																															Ekdalia Evergreen: The pandal, modelled on Delhis Akshardham Temple, features a 30 ftx30 ft chandelier, which has returned on popular demand. The lighting, depicting Yuvraj Singhs six sixes in the T20 Cup, is a big draw. People are trooping in round the clock, said joint general secretary Gautam Mukherjee.				 				 																															41 Palli: The Haridevpur puja has recreated the Sun Temple of Perus Inca civilisation. Two truckloads of Siporex, a material used mainly for interior decoration, was brought from Mumbai. Now, it seems worth it. The footfall has never ebbed since the inauguration on Tritiya, said Dipankar Chatterjee, chief coordinator.			 		Sreebhumi: Brass rules at this crowd-puller. The 75-ft pandal, an imaginary temple, has a copper finish with brass decorations. The idols are decked in brass ornaments. The lighting by Chandernagore craftsmen targets children. People have been flocking to our pandal since Chaturthi, said secretary Prasun Ghosh.			 		FD Block, Salt Lake: Hogwarts is drawing Muggles and non-Muggles alike. Facing Durga is Harry Potter, flanked by Hedwig and Dumbledore. People came all night. The crowd is more than the Titanic year, says Santanu Biswas, secretary of the puja which won a suit against J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros over use of the theme.

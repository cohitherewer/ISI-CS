				 Married, but apart
 							 - Girls rich father drives a wedge SUBHRO SAHA				 				 Farnaz Aly and Sheikh Mohammed Amir 																								A city couple who have tied the knot legally are being forced to stay apart, as the brides father is opposed to the marriage.																								Sheikh Mohammed Amir, 24, married Farnaz Aly, 19, on September 5, 2006, under the Muslim Marriage and Registration Act. Fearing a backlash from their parents, they kept the wedding secret, and Farnaz went back to her fathers place at 17 Colonel Biswas Road.																								Amir and his father Md Akram, who accepted the marriage, are now accusing Farnazs parents of forcibly keeping her away from her in-laws, in collusion with police officers and a few members of the community, an allegation echoed by the bride before police.																								Farnazs father Jamshed Ali Molla is a rich promoter, who never accepted this marriage, and is using his connections to defy the law. She was whisked away to Umrah (in Saudi Arabia) in September and we have learnt they are now planning to take her on Haj on November 30, says Akram.																								Farnaz, who managed to come to her in-laws place at 8/1 New Kasia Bagan Lane on August 2, had earlier gone to Karaya police station to record her statement: I am 19 years old... Im in love with Amir and my parents know about it. They have been threatening me that if I marry Amir, he and my in-laws will be mired in court cases since they know top-ranking police officers.... She also accused her parents of torturing her and confining her to a room.																								We were under pressure not to accept the complaint but we didnt yield and helped her reach her in-laws place, said a police officer.																								On August 2, Molla communicated through a relative of Akram that he had accepted the marriage and would like to hold a reception. On his request, Farnaz agreed to return to her parents home.																								At a meeting in ex-MLA Sultan Ahmeds house on August 8, it was decided that the reception would be held on August 26. Since then, Amir has failed to establish contact with Farnaz.																								Her cellphone was switched off and their house locked from outside, said Amir, who deals in leather chemicals.																								On September 4, he received a call from Farzan from an unknown number. She sounded nervous and said she was being taken away to Umrah, recalled Amir.																								Molla hasnt kept his word, admitted Ahmed. 																								Molla refused to comment when contacted by Metro.																								On October 1, Amir lodged a complaint with then deputy commissioner (south) Jawed Shamim. Let the girl come back and we will take action, said Shamim.

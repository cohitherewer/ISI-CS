				 Scan on quality of research
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Jadavpur University will overhaul its Ph.D rules to ensure that the quality of research doesnt decline.																								The authorities are considering making the selection process more stringent, sources said. The engineering faculty of the university discussed the proposed changes at a meeting on Friday. 																								We will have to discuss the changes with all three faculty councils  engineering, science and arts. It will take some time to finalise the changes, said vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh.																								The current Ph.D rules were framed 20 years ago. Several changes have taken place in higher education in the past two decades. The scope of research has increased and there has also been a steady rise in Ph.D enrolment. In the changed situation, quality control of research has become important. The new rules are being framed keeping that in mind, said a member of the engineering faculty council.																								The proposed changes are also aimed at checking malpractice among research scholars. The university was rocked by a controversy last year, when the authorities came across identical theses by two senior teachers who had carried out research under the same guide. Both teachers were punished.																								Such malpractices were reported from other institutions, too.

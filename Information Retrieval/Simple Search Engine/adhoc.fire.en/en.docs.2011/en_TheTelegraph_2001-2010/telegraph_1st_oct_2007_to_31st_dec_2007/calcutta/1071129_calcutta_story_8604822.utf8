 SOUMITRA DAS				 	 Sharmila Tagore: Autumn sonata. Picture by Aranya Sen																								The CIMA Gallery opening of Paresh Maitys current paintings, drawings and sculpture on Wednesday evening brought together beauty in the form of the ageless Sharmila Tagore, business in the avatar of Nandan Nilekani, and creativity as represented by artist Jogen Chowdhury and auteur Rituparno Ghosh.																								Ganesh Pyne, who had first spotted the star in the young artist, walked in once the festivities were over.																								The cameras could not take their eyes off Sharmila, ravishing in the tints of autumn, never failing to flash a dimpled smile that could still hold its own against any pretty face come lately.																								Paresh Maity, the boy from Tamluk, belonging to a region which has been in the news of late, has come a long way from the days when he was a student at the Government College of Art and his transparent watercolours of landscapes and langurs would sell for the princely sum of Rs 2,000  a price that nobody would have sniffed at in the 1980s.																								Maitys drawings in pen and ink on paper depict the umbrellas of Varanasi, the towers and gondolas of Venice and the waterways of Periyar with a few clever strokes and a flurry of dots. There are angular female profiles and a shy nude.																								In the early years, Maity had made a name for himself as a watercolourist and he has two works in that medium depicting the Victoria Memorial Hall and the cave shrines of Orissa.																								Maitys paintings on canvas have become larger and the warm tints he uses have become hotter, burning bright against the black brushwork in striking contrast.																								Maity has been taking photographs for a long time and there are two beautiful black-and-white prints. His bronze heads could be from Easter Island.

  Second hand originality: Moments from Umrao Jaan and Ram Gopal Varma ki Aag The proposed system of setting deadlines for providing civic services, if implemented properly, will come as a major relief to Calcuttans (Roster of rights, services, September 5). The system holds the promise to improve the work culture at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).  There should be a cut-off date for every kind of civic work. And the system of setting the deadline should be clear to civic employees and those who approach them for work. When files do not move in the civic offices, people suspect that the workers will not render service without a bribe, even if thats not the case. Deadlines could help put such doubts to rest.  The common people are often forced to call up or visit civic offices repeatedly to find out if a service has been rendered. Deadlines will spare people the harassment. The civic staff, too, wont need to spend time answering queries.  Once civic employees are accountable for doing work in time, they can be punished for unnecessary delay.  Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
 Behala.  Umrao Jaan failed miserably at the box office, earning lead stars Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai a bad name. Sholay, under the name Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag, too, has turned out to be an even bigger flop (Ramus Aag fades to solitary show in plexes, September 10). It seems remakes are not liked by the audience. They would not even pay to watch Amitabh Bachchan act in one. Instead of wasting crores of rupees on meaningless remakes, a trust could be set up to provide assistance to people from the industry who have fallen on bad times.  B.N. Bose,
 Dum Dum Park.  Apropos the report Rs 1,000 a month for morning walk, August 25, it is disheartening that the high court has directed the Victoria Memorial authorities to collect Rs 1,000 from morning-walkers every month. The existing entry fee of Rs 100 per month can be doubled. But Rs 1,000 a month is exorbitant. It puts morning walk beyond the reach of the common people. Isnt it disgraceful that the central government needs to collect entry fee from visitors and morning-walkers for the upkeep of a historical monument? The initiative to collect Rs 100 as spot fine, however, seems reasonable.  Sukumar Ghosh, 
 Mukundapur  Apropos the report Plea against Victoria fee, September 1, the high courts decision to increase the entry fee for morning-walkers at Victoria Memorial is distressing. Most morning-walkers are aged and would be hit by the steep hike.  Prahlad Agarwala, 
 Majdia, Nadia  Apropos the report Determination conquers adversity, August 29, the struggle of Shiba Kundu to help her sons establish themselves reminds me of the saga of Mrs Thurlow in H.E. Batess The Ox.  It is encouraging that a family with meagre income has not lost faith in education. It is even  more encouraging that The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence has recognised the dedication and perseverance of the two boys and their mother. Many would draw inspiration from their story.  Ratan Kumar Halder,
 Behala  Apropos the report Ride with a burly rogue, September 10, many women in the city face the ordeal that Saheli Mitra went through. The only difference is that most of them do not lodge a complaint with police the way she did. That a vast majority of the autorickshaws ply on the road is a violation of rules. It is only natural those who drive them would have scant regard for the passengers. They dont even fear the police or the administration, which has taught them that rules can be broken.  D. Ghosh, 
 Salt Lake.  Apropos the report Baby sale clinic case bail denied, September 7, several nursing homes in the city have become crime dens. The authorities of Everest Nursing Home were caught redhanded while trying to sell a baby born to an unmarried woman for a hefty sum, but numerous such rackets thrive at other nursing homes. It will be rational to allow nursing homes to allow childless couples to adopt babies born there for a fixed payment.  Govinda Bakshi,
 Budge Budge. Apropos the report Bombs slipped into court, August 30, how could two crude bombs be hidden in a plastic bag and smuggled into Barrackpore court by an undertrial lodged in Dum Dum Central jail without laxness on part of the police? The officers in charge of security in the jail and at the court did not even perform basic security checks while taking the prisoner to the court. The undertrial confessed that he had brought the bombs to court with the intention of hurling them at the judge. The matter needs to investigated thoroughly.  Sunil Banerjee,
 VIP Road.

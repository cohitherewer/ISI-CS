				 10-yr jail for VIPs tenants
 A STAFF REPORTER			The Biswas tenants after their arrest. A Telegraph picture		A Barasat court on Monday awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment to the four tenants arrested from the ground floor of former CBI joint director (east) Upendranath Biswass house in Salt Lake.																								The arrests were made in 2003 in connection with manufacture of narcotics in the house and possession of illegal chemicals required for the purpose. The raid had blown the lid off an international drug racket.																								The four tenants, Wen Delong, Chan Fulong, Lal Thang Puta and Lal Sanga, have been charged with illegally possessing the chemicals and working for an international drug racket, said public prosecutor Hiralal Bhattacharjee.																								The four were produced before Justice Sambhunath Chatterjee of the sixth court in Barasat on Monday afternoon. In a packed courtroom, the judge rejected their plea for mercy, saying that they had committed a heinous crime. 																								The fifth person arrested in connection with the case, Baitha Kima, managed to flee Dum Dum Central jail in September 2003. Wen and Chan are Chinese nationals, while the rest are Myanmarese. 																								Officials of the Narcotics Control Bureau had raided the ground floor of the CG block house of Biswas on May 17, 2003, and arrested the five. Nearly 24 kg of ephydrine hydrochloride, a controlled drug mass produced in the country, mainly for preparing medicines, was seized. The gang was using it to make ATS, needed for the manufacture of a heroin substitute.																								The gang illegally procured the substance from some suppliers, who have also been arrested, said a bureau official present in court.																								The arrest of the gang had sparked off quite a controversy with Biswas, his son and wife being questioned and their house being raided several times.

				 School as residence
 AMRITA GHOSH																								A CPM leader in Bally has illegally allowed a family to occupy a room in a local primary school. 																								Tushar Kanti Sinha Roy and his family members have been staying in a room in the two-roomed Nischinda GSP Primary School for over a month.																								According to residents of the area, Madan Manna, a CPM local committee member and the secretary of the school managing committee, allowed the Sinha Roys to stay in the school after they handed over a four-cottah plot with a room to a promoter close to him. 																								Mannas wife Abha, the chairman of the village education committee, put her seal on the proposal to accommodate the family in the school.																								Manna said: Tushar requested me to find an accommodation for him as the building he stayed in has been demolished for reconstruction. We have allowed him to stay in the school on compassionate grounds. We do not accept rent from him.																								Sinha Roys wife Krishna, however, said: Madan Manna allowed us to stay in the school. We pay rent for the accommodation. She denied that the family had been allowed to stay in the school room after agreeing to hand over the plot to the promoter.																								Smritis Bandopadhyay, the chairman of the district primary school council, said: Under no condition, can a room in a school be rented out. I shall look into the matter. If somebody is found to be guilty of breaking the law, I will take action against him.																								Nearly 150 students currently attend classes in the only other room of the school. The room where the family is staying was built six months ago.																								Classes were being held in the new room till the Sinha Roys moved in, said Manna.																								Mullick Bag, the head teacher of the school, refused to comment on the matter.																								Babul Haldar, the secretary of the CPM local committee, said: I have no knowledge of any member of our party allowing a family to stay in the school. I shall look into the matter.

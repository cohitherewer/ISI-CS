				 Alumni aid for literacy

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The 17th batch of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, has pledged Rs 1.5 million for the education of the mess workers on the Joka campus.
																								The 1982 batch will donate the money over two years to the Initiative for Community Action, being run by the students of the institute.
																								The money will be deposited in a bank and the project will run on the interest to accrue from it. Depending on the success, the alumni will decide whether to continue with the support, said Vikas Munjal, a student who is a member of the team that organised Reminiscence, the reunion of the alumni.
																								The plan for the literacy programme was announced at Reminiscence 2007, held on December 24 and 25.
																								The programme will be piloted by Inca, a social service initiative of the institute that offers free consultancy to voluntary organisations.

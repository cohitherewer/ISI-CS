				 Twin bids to scale bridge 
Atop the bridge, clamour below

 															- Mentally ill man brought down once is second time lucky

																								Once beaten, twice as determined. After being taken to the police station midway through his first attempt to scale Howrah bridge, 20-year-old Puram Murmu returned and clambered to the top. 
																								Having got there, he danced and ran on the iron beams, holding up traffic on the bridge for nearly three hours on Friday afternoon till firemen brought him down. 
																								The mentally ill mans attempt to climb up a bridge pillar around 2pm was also cut short by firemen. He was taken to Golabari police station, where he dived under the table when an officer approached him for a fingerprint.
																								He came out and gave his fingerprint only after the officers promised to feed him rice and dal. However, as soon as he was released, a taxi outside the police station caught Purams fancy. He ran after the vehicle  forgetting the meal  and tried to hold on to it.
																								After local residents persuaded him to let go of the taxi, Puram lay on the road for some time, before running away. 
																								Little did the onlookers know that he was about to mount his second attempt on Howrah bridge. The young man (picture below by Pradip Sanyal) had taken the place of a kite atop an eastern pillar by 4pm. He celebrated his success with vigour as the crowd below held its breath. People craned their necks through the windows of vehicles for a look. 
																								An hour passed, but Puram ignored the entreaties of the scores of policemen and firemen to remain on top. My son called me to tell me about the incident. I left office and rushed to the bridge, said Howrah-resident Dipak Saha, one of the hundreds who watched the drama unfold.
																								After darkness fell, firemen tracked the young man with focus lights. A team of fire brigade personnel climbed up another portion of the bridge but could not make their way to Puram, in the absence of Calcutta Port Trust officials, who know the detailed plan of the bridge. 
																								Finally, around 6.30pm, the young man decided enough was enough and climbed down a ladder put up by the firemen, to the thunderous applause.
																								Psychologists said the festive spirit of December might be one of the factors behind the incident. People tend to give in to their impulses at this time and do things they would not otherwise do, said Atashi Gupta, a city psychologist. 
																								Lopamudra Goswami, another psychologist, said: Freak accidents and fights increase at this time of the year.

		 Tagore in symphony																																	Rabindranath Tagore lived up to his name. Like the Suns rays the myriad-minded Great Sentinel never failed to dazzle with his creative genius, enlightening us with his sagacious insight. Tagores vast creations take us through his personal reflection of reality, which soon become our own because they touch the core of our heart, bonding us with nature. His writings are a heartfelt appeal for universal peace, love and harmony. But general consensus is, for most GenNext teens, Rabi Thakurer Gaan is an alien concept. So, to familiarise them with this veritable treasure trove, a novel programme is slated this evening. The idea is to bring Rabindrasangeet closer to Gen-X by presenting it differently, with a different kind of arrangement, without tampering with its purity or essence. The selected numbers will be rendered by a group of singers, including veteran artiste, Mohan Singh. A host of contemporary singers  Manoj Murali Nair, Manisha Murali Nair, Indira Bandopadhyay, Lopamudra Mitra, Saheb Chatterjee, Sromona Chakraborty, Sraboni Sen and Chandraboli Rudra Dutta  will relate to GenNext as they interpret Rabindrasangeet in their individual ways. Tagores own vision of crisis in civilisation will run like a leitmotif in the selection of songs. Backing up the vocals will be a rich and colossal symphonic orchestration comprising a 64-member Symphony orchestra. Musicians from Latelier de Musique de Calcutta, Bangalore School of Music, La Martiniere Orchestra, Frank Anthony Public School (Bangalore) Symphony Orchestra and band Shohor will perform in unison to provide the musical back-up and the entire orchestra will be directed and conducted by Abraham Mazumder. Presented by Anandabazar Patrika.

				 Study calendar in disarray
 																											- Colleges fear quality slip in frequent calls for disruption OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								More than 100 teachers turned up at Jadavpur University on Monday, defying shutdown calls by opposition parties, but could not attend work.																								All academic and administrative activities came to a standstill at the university, prompting the authorities to postpone Tuesdays mass communication exam. The new date will be announced later.																								The undergraduate and postgraduate classes of the university are scheduled to resume on Tuesday after the puja vacation.																								Most educational institutions have expressed concern over the frequent calls for shutdowns or bandhs.																								The UGC has made it compulsory for every college and university to prepare an academic calendar that they must follow rigidly, said Bangabasi College principal Asitmoy Sarkar.																								Classes are often disrupted because of agitations by students, teachers and non-teaching employees. Frequent bandhs called by political parties have made the situation worse. How are we going to follow the academic calender in this situation? he wondered.																								As part of a drive to upgrade its undergraduate courses, Calcutta University has asked colleges to hold four unit tests in an academic year.																								It is impossible to carry out the directive if political parties and other organisations call bandhs so frequently, said D. Kundu, the bursar of Scottish Church College.																								Calcutta Universitys law faculty could not resume its undergraduate and postgraduate classes after the puja recess on Monday.																								We do not know how long this turmoil will continue. Academic standards will surely decline if classes are disrupted so often. Besides, its becoming difficult for us to organise the minimum number of classes, as stipulated by the Bar Council of India, said D.P. Dey, the secretary of the law faculty.																								Mondays shutdown has also delayed the publication of the Calcutta Universitys BA and B.Sc Part II results under the 1+1+1 scheme.																								The results should have been declared before the puja vacation. But the process got delayed as some of the exams were postponed because of rain. The shutdown will further delay publication of the results, said an official.																								We appreciate the students anxiety and are trying our best to announce the results at the earliest, said Debashis Biswas, the universitys deputy controller of examinations.

				 Bengali meet shifts base
 															- Canada, not US, to host annual conference in July 2008 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Pandit Ravi Shankar will be felicitated at the North American Bengali Conference 2008. A Telegraph picture																								For the third time in its 28-year history, the North American Bengali Conference (NABC) is moving out of the US. The biggest gathering of Bengalis across the Arabian Sea will be hosting its annual conference in Toronto over three days next July.																								The sprawling Metro Toronto Convention Centre, Canadas best convention and trade show facility, with over 600,000 sq ft of exhibit and meeting space, has been booked for the event that is expected to draw 8,000-plus people. Of this figure, about 70 per cent will be from the US, 25 per cent will be from Canada, while the rest will be from other continents, said Bejoy Das, president of Prabasi Bengali Cultural Association. 																								Some of the organisers are currently in Calcutta to put things in place for the invitees to reach Canada. The two earlier editions that were held in Toronto  in 1992 and 1998  raised the bar in terms of organisational excellence. We intend to maintain that record, said Jaydev Sarkar, the principal chairman of the NABC 2008 team.																								An invitation has been extended to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, as well as the lieutenant-governor of Ontario. But the star attraction promises to be Pandit Ravi Shankar, who will be felicitated after the inauguration. Panditjis wife Sukanya Shankar has given the consent, said Ganadev Sinha, the assistant executive chairman.																								Toronto-based Sukalyan Bhattacharya, who has choreographed a number of Tollywood films, will put up the inaugural ceremony. The day before, July 3, though, has been reserved for a business seminar. The focus in 2008 will be on IT, finance and some technology that has not been decided yet. About 200 people from the industry will be present to discuss how we can improve trade ties between the two countries, Sarkar said.																								A group of 50-60 artistes will be flown over from India to perform from July 4 to 6. We will put up a comedy at NABC, though we have not decided which production it will be, said Manoj Mitra, who will be travelling along with Meghnad Bhattacharya, Bibhas Chakraborty and Rupa Ganguly.																								Author Sunil Gangopadhyay, who will go as well, recalled how the NABC has grown from an intimate affair in a little New York church in 1981 to the largest congregation of Bengalis. The focus has shifted from literature to performing arts, though.																								The shift in venue across the border has sparked competition. Wed like to do better than the US editions. Our strength lies in time management, said Das.

				 Severed head in litter vat
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rag-pickers came across a severed head in a garbage vat at the intersection of Sultan Alam Road and Deodar Rahman Road, in Lake Gardens, on Monday morning, causing a flutter in the area.																								Police said the head belonged to a man, aged about 50-55 years, who had died a few days ago. The eyes, nose and the lips had almost dried up, like that of a mummy and there was no trace of the rest of the body. 																								The head appeared to have been chopped off and deliberately dumped there, said an investigator. Charu Market police have started a murder case along with attempt to tamper with evidence.																								It is difficult to say who had dumped the head in the garbage vat. We also have no clue about the identity of the deceased. We have provided the details of the head to adjoining police stations and asked the officers there to get in touch with us if there is any lead. We are now waiting for the post-mortem report, said the deputy commissioner of police (south), Jawed Shamim.																								The rag-pickers informed the local residents about the head around 10.30am. The residents alerted the councillor and then the police.																								It is clearly a case of murder. It appears that the head had been carefully removed and dumped at a place far away from the body to ensure that nobody could get to the bottom of the matter easily, said a senior officer of the police station.

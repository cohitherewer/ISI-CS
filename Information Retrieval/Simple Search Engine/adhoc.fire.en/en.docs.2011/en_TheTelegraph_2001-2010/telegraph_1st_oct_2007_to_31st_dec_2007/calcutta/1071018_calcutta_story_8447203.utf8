				 Transfer no balm, kin want officers sacked
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Heads have finally started to roll, but not the way the Rahmans had wanted.																								The family members of Rizwanur Rahman at their 7B Tiljala Lane home listened in silence to the chief ministers announcement at Writers Buildings on Wednesday afternoon, that all five tainted officers would be transferred.																								But they have not yet been removed. This is just a transfer, lamented Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan. They have killed my son. Woh log jahan bhi jayenge, aisa hi karengey. Shayad woh phir dhamkayenge (Wherever they go, they will plot something similar. Perhaps, they will again threaten someone else).																								Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur, too, felt transferring the top cops was not punishment enough. Well breathe easy only when the guilty officers are all punished. They should at least have been suspended. What is the guarantee that they will not try to influence the probe?																								Had the government really been sincere in investigating the truth behind the death of his younger brother, added Rukbanur, it could have taken action against the five police officers much earlier.																								The decision was probably prompted by Tuesdays high court order for a CBI probe into my brothers death, concluded Rukbanur.																								Rizwanurs uncle Wahidur was wondering what the chief minister meant when he said that the transfer was a sort of punishment.																								The mere transfer of a few officers will not stop our fight for justice. Rizwanurs soul will not rest in peace till the guilty are punished. The entire state has been demanding the suspension of the officers, but that is yet to happen. So, our fight will continue, asserted Wahidur.																								In a field outside the small house, neighbours started pouring in soon after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees announcement. Most of them expressed disappointment over the government action.																								The high court order for a CBI probe into the death of Rizwanur was a huge step forward but by transferring rather than suspending the officers, the chief minister has acted more as a police minister going soft on his boys, argued a neighbour.																								In the midst of all this, film-maker Mahesh Bhatt arrived at the Rahmans doorstep. Born of a Hindu father and a Muslim mother, he expressed solidarity with the family and hailed Calcutta for uniting against injustice.

				 Top cop plea for Riz
 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI																								A senior IPS officer had informed Gyanwant Singh of the harassment of Rizwanur Rahman and Priyanka Todi at the hands of police and asked him to ensure the couples safety.																								N.K. Singh, who works for a central intelligence agency, had called up Singh, then deputy commissioner (headquarters), on September 1, a day after Priyanka moved in with Rizwanurs family. 																								N.K. Singh told Metro that he had got to know of the harassment of the recently-married couple through one of his sources, named Pappu.																								Pappu, whom I know for several years, requested me to intervene in the matter on September 1. He explained that the couple were married and had shown their marriage and birth certificates to the police, but were being harassed by them as well as criminals, said the officer, who has served several years in Calcutta police.																								I called up Gyanwant Singh, who knew about the matter. He said nothing would happen to the couple. I left the city soon after, added N.K. Singh.																								Pappu, a family friend of the Rahmans, said he had contacted N.K. Singh after Rizwanur visited him on September 1 and narrated how he and his wife were being harassed. Rizwanur was very scared. I called up Sir (N.K Singh) and pleaded with him to help the couple, said Pappu.																								On September 2, Gyanwant Singh called him up and asked him to visit Lalbazar. I went to Lalbazar along with Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur. Gyanwant Singh gave me a four-page letter from Priyanka telling her parents that Rizwanur might convert. Gyanwant Singh wanted me to show the letter to the Rahmans, added Pappu.

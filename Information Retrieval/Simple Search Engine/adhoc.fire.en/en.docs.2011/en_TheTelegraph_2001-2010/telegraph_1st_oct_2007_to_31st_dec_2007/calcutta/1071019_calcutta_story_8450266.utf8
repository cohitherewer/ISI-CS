				 Ransack at hospital
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A mob ransacked the emergency department of MR Bangur Hospital and heckled doctors and other employees on Thursday, after a patient died due to their alleged negligence.																								Six persons have been arrested and a police picket has been posted at the hospital.																								Bibhas Mukherjee, 32, and Chattu were admitted to the hospital early on Thursday with critical injuries after the motorcycle they were riding rammed into a road divider in Dhakuria.																								Mukherjee, a resident of Thakurpukur, was injured in the head and Chattu in his legs and face.																								Hours after they were admitted, Mukherjee died and Chattu was shifted to NRS Medical College and Hospital, as his condition deteriorated.																								Immediately after Mukherjee was declared dead, his relatives accused doctors who were treating him of negligence. They also damaged the furniture in the emergency ward and heckled the doctors and some other employees of the hospital.																								The private security guards tried in vain to rein in the mob . The hospital authorities called Jadavpur police station. A police team soon arrived on the spot and arrested six of Mukherjees relatives.																								The superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), Praveen Kumar, said a police team has been posted at the hospital to prevent any untoward incident. We will interrogate Chattu after he is declared fit. We would like to verify whether they had taken all precautions while riding the two-wheeler.

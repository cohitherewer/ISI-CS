				 Bath a month for city trees
 															- DUST REMOVAL DRIVE A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 New leaves sprout on a roadside tree. With a monthly bath on the anvil, the citys trees should look less dusty. A Telegraph picture 																								Roadside trees in the city are set to get a regular bath, at least once a month.																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has taken the decision to supplement its move to deploy eight more mechanical sweepers to suck up dust and small trash from the roads.																								If the trees are not washed after the mechanical sweepers are put to use, there will be a repelling contrast between clean roads and dust-covered roadside foliage, said mayoral council member (solid waste management) Chandana Ghosh Dastidar.																								We have asked the conservancy department to wash trees along the main roads at regular intervals, said mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.																								A civic official said a monthly wash will suffice, as once the sweeping gadgets are deployed, deposition of dust on the leaves will be minimised.																								This is the third time in the past 10 years that the CMC is taking up a tree-washing drive. The first drive started in the late-1990s and continued for two years. The roads that were covered included AJC Bose Road, Park Street, Gariahat Road, Rashbehari Avenue, JL Nehru Road and Shakespeare Sarani.																								The second attempt, in the BBG Bag area earlier this year, was aborted after the civic body was criticised for wasting filtered water.																								The new sweepers will soon be pressed into service on AJC Bose Road, APC Road, Shakespeare Sarani, Park Street, CR Avenue, Bhupen Bose Avenue, Grey Street, Beadon Street, MG Road, BB Ganguly Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Free School Street. One sweeper has long been in operation on the EM Bypass.

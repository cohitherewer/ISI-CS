				 Priyanka says shes sad, hurt
																								Priyanka Todi wrote to mother-in-law Kishwar Jahan on Thursday, her first communication with Rizwanur Rahmans family since his death on September 21. This is a translation of the letter, that was written in Hindi...																								Dear Ma,																								Pranaam.																								Ma, I have not been able to get over whatever has happened. I will surely come and meet you, but at present, the circumstances are not favourable.																								I had come away leaving behind my mother, father, brother, sister and everyone for your son Rizwan (who I loved dearly). I wanted to spend my entire life with him.																								The loss I have suffered because of this tragedy is probably more than what anyone else has suffered. No one has paid heed to that. Instead, every day, a new story about me unfolds in public.																								I feel very sad and hurt to find my personal belongings, which were in your safe-keeping, being displayed to the world. Just one photograph of mine would have been enough to identify me, but now, my childhood pictures and my personal diaries are also on display. Is this right? I have been deeply hurt by all this.																								Also, after the tragedy, I was too shocked to think clearly or decide what to do. Later, I found Rukbanbhaiya making inappropriate remarks about me on TV, which caused me great pain. You know quite well what kind of relationship Rukbanbhaiya and Rizwan had from the beginning. You know it better than me.																								Given todays situation, it would not be proper for me to come and take away my belongings. That is why I request you to hand over my articles to the bearer of this letter (employees of father Ashok Todi). 																								I would beg you not to allow any of my belongings to be shown to the media. Please also send me a copy of the list of articles seized by the CBI.																								I respect you a lot; please do give me your blessings, always. Please forgive me if I have hurt you in any way.																								Your daughter,																								Priyanka

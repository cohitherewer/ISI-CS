				 Court glare on CID
 															- RAP FOR MISHANDLING CASE PAPERS OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 Swastika Mukherjee. A Telegraph picture 																								The CID has come under the high court scanner for its handling of documents and evidences in a case between actor Santu Mukherjees daughter Swastika and her estranged husband Pramit Sen.																								Swastika, an actress, separated from her husband, son of late Rabindrasangeet exponent Sagar Sen, in 2000 after filing a complaint of torture against him.																								Justice Soumitra Pal on Friday asked CID deputy inspector-general Niraj Nayan Pandey to file an affidavit, stating why documents and a list of evidences in the case are not being handed over to Pritam Sen, brother of Pramit.																								The order followed a petition by Pritam, who alleged that Pandey was not handing over the documents and the list to him despite appeals under the Right to Information Act.																								The probe was handed over to the CID as political leaders were trying to influence the case, said Smarajit Roy Chowdhury, who appeared for Pritam. But my client apprehended foul play by the CID and in July last year, sought the documents and the list under the Right to Information Act.																								Roy Chowdhury alleged that the CID was not conducting an impartial probe. We have a document to prove that some senior officers had ordered J.N. Khairi, who is handling the investigation, to tamper with the deposition of five witnesses.																								When contacted, state lawyers denied the charge. We will inform the court that the probe will be hampered if the petitioner gets the documents and the list.

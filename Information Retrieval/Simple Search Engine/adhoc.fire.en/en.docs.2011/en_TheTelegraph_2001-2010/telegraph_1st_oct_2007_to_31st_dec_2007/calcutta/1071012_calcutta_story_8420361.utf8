				 HIV boy thrown out of school
 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA				 	 The school that segregated the HIV-infected boy. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								In a glaring, illegal case of discrimination, as a health department officer put it, a primary school on the southern fringes of the city allegedly drove a Class I student out of the institution and humiliated him by segregating him from his classmates. His crime was that he is HIV-infected.																								The 11-year-old boy, a resident of the Baruipur area, was detected with thalassaemia when he was nine. He receives regular blood transfusions at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.																								About 18 months ago, he was detected with HIV. He was running a high fever, had a racking cough and became emaciated. The hospital referred him to Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, where it was found that he was infected with HIV, said his mother.																								The boys parents are illiterate and the father is a daily wage-earner. They admitted him to Bhanta Bairampur Prathamik Vidyalaya.																								During admission I had told the school authorities about my sons ailment, said the mother. She alleged that initially, the school authorities were reluctant to admit her son. Finally, under pressure from Bengal Network for People living with HIV/AIDS (BNP+), a government-authorised body of HIV-positive people- of which the boy is a member, and some local CPM leaders, the school gave in and admitted the boy in Class I about 20 days ago.																								But he sat on a separate bench and his classmates were told to shun him. Last Saturday, the school authorities allegedly called his mother and asked her to take her son away. 																								This is a glaring, illegal case of discrimination and goes against the law of the land. If we receive any formal complaint from BNP+, we will probe the matter, said D.N. Goswami, a programme officer of the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society. Somnath Das, the headmaster of the school, however, denied all charges. 																								An officer of the Paediatric HIV/AIDS Clinic, Apex Referral Centre of Medical College Hospital, Calcutta, where the boy is being treated, said he was fit enough to lead a normal life.

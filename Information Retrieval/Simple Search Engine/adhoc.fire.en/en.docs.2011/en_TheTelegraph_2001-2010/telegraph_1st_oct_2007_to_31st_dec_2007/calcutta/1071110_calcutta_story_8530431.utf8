				 State spanner in Besu upgrade
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								State higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri has written to the Centre, opposing its proposal to upgrade Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) by modifying the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Act.																								The state government wants a separate central act, as recommended by the Anandakrishnan Committee, for the upgrade.																								Kindly recall that the Anandakrishnan Committee had recommended creation of separate clusters of elite institutions, to be named Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), under a statutory act of Parliament, Ray Chaudhuri had written to human resources development minister Arjun Singh on November 6.																								It may be observed that the IIEST Act may be similar to the IIT or NIT Act, but specific provision for admission as well as the governance mechanism were agreed upon by both the central and state governments, the letter read.																								The Union ministry had principally agreed to upgrade Besu to an IIEST by enacting a separate piece of legislation. But sources said the ministry later scrapped the idea of a separate act, and was, instead, considering amending the NIT Act to include the IIESTs within its ambit.																								The NIT Act, which came into effect on August 15, was created to upgrade the Regional Engineering Colleges to National Institutes of Technology. The colleges, tagged Institutes of National Importance (INI), focus primarily on undergraduate technical education.																								The IIESTs, however, have been planned to integrate undergraduate and postgraduate studies, with an aim to create more research scholars. The Anandakrishnan report stated: IIESTs shall be predominantly postgraduate institutions, offering five-year integrated dual degree (B. Tech-M. Tech) programmes.																								Besu teachers fear the IIESTs would lose their research-oriented focus if they are equated with the NITs.																								The Besu teachers union said the issue will be discussed at its special general meeting on Monday.

				 Last-ditch bid to boost sales
 															- Ambassador in gear ANASUYA BASU				 	 The Ambassador is still the car that government officials prefer. A Telegraph picture																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may still ride a bullet-proof Ambassador, but the government fleet, which till recently was made up only of the wide, tall-boy car, is now seeing additions like Scorpio and Esteem.																								We have tried out the Scorpio and many ministers have liked the car, said Dilip Bakshi, the joint secretary of the state transport department. 																								While this is an ominous sign for Hindustan Motors (HM), the government still does its bit for the Uttarpara-based company by making it mandatory for taxis to be only Ambassadors. We had introduced Fiat and Maruti Omni taxis some time ago. But we have stopped that, said Bakshi. 																								Despite such backing from the state government, the Ambassador doesnt seem to be faring well, with sales plummeting from 30,000 units a year in the 1970s, which was an all-time high, said Ravi Santhanam, the managing director of HM.																								On an average, we are selling 15,000 units a year. Till September this year, we have sold 6,000 cars, said Santhanam.																								Probably as a last-ditch effort, the company has introduced a scheme under which an used car of any make can be exchanged for a new Ambassador diesel with a minimum discount of Rs 50,000. 																								We are doing this for a cleaner Calcutta and also keeping in mind the festive season in Bengal, said Santhanam.																								The Ambassador also enjoys the central governments patronage. About 20 per cent of our sales comes from the government. It is still the preferred official car. Central and state governments today have the option of buying other cars. Yet, the Prime Minister still rides an Ambassador, added Santhanam. 																								The car has also retained its taxi sales across the country. Sixty-five per cent of our cars become taxis. Foreign tourists especially like to discover India in an Ambassador.

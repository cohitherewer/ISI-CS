				 Mediator admits to money deal Cops amp; kin under scan
 															- Brother defiant as CBI turns scanner on Rizwanur friend and family OUR BUREAU				 	 Syed Mohiuddin (Pappu) and Saidur Rahman																								Syed Mohiuddin, alias Pappu, has admitted to the CBI that a money deal was struck to separate Rizwanur Rahman and Priyanka Todi. Sources said Pappu, a family friend of the Rahmans, claimed that part of the amount he had taken from Pradip Todi, Priyankas uncle, had been passed on to Rukbanur Rahman, Rizwanurs elder brother.																								On November 19, The Telegraph had blown the lid off the cash deal struck behind Rizwanurs back. The report carried details of the transactions  Rs 5 lakh taken by Pappu on September 13 for his NGO and Rs 6 lakh taken by Pappu on September 19 allegedly for some members of Rizwanurs family. During the lie-detector test conducted in Delhi, Pappu confirmed the deals. But the results of the polygraph will come in next week, said a CBI official.																								Back in Calcutta, Rukbanur denied any involvement in the murky money matters. Let the CBI tell the court that the family has received money from the Todis. The charge is baseless. The CBI is not the last word. The agency has to furnish evidence, he told Metro late on Friday.																								Rukbanur also made it a point to distance himself from his friend Pappu and his uncle Saidur Rahman, who had taken around Rs 21,000 from the Todis to pass on information about the Rahmans. I cannot say anything about anyone else. I have not met my uncle for many days and I have had no dealings with Pappu, he claimed. Pappu and Saidur could not be contacted.																								Following The Telegraph expos and the admissions of Pappu and Saidur, the buzz in the CBI headquarters in Delhi is that their names are being added to the list of those to be chargesheeted in the abetment to suicide case being prepared for the death of Rizwanur Rahman.																								A CBI official said one of the Todis, Pappu, Saidur and two Calcutta police officers will be charged with abetment to suicide. Another CBI official, however, hinted that Rukbanurs role was also coming under the scanner.																								According to him, four Calcutta police officers former deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh, former deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar, former assistant commissioner (anti-rowdy section) Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das  will be booked for threatening and harassing Rizwanur. The police officers put too much pressure on him. He felt hemmed in from all sides, said the source. 																								The CBI is treading carefully regarding revelations about the alleged role of Rizwanurs family.																								The Telegraph had reported on November 19 how Pappu had promised to make Rizwanur sign the divorce papers on September 19. Uncle Saidur had later told the Todis how Rukbanur had confronted Rizwanur with the papers.																								When the 30-year-old computer graphics designer refused to sign on the dotted line, his elder brother had shouted at him and even hit him, Saidur added.																								Priyanka had, in her first letter to Rizwanurs mother, referred to the strained relations between the brothers.																								When quizzed about his uncles role in the affair, Rukbanur said on Friday: There seems to be something fishy, as he has been avoiding us ever since the report of his taking money came out.																								The CBI, meanwhile, is putting the finishing touches to its probe report. We are through with the investigation and the report will be submitted to the court soon, said Arun Kumar, the joint director of the CBI.

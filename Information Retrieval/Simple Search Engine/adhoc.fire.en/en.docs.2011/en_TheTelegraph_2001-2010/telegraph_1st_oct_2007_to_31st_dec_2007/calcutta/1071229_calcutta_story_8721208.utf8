				 Ustad in song, cops halt soiree

 A STAFF REPORTER
				 	 Rashid Khan
																								An open-air performance by Ustad Rashid Khan on Outram Street, behind St Xaviers College, was stopped by police before midnight on Thursday.
																								The police said the action followed repeated complaints from local residents.
																								The vocalist was in the middle of a song at 11.45pm, on the fourth day of Outram Clubs annual festival, when sub-inspector Amal Ghosh of Shakespeare Sarani police station came on stage and asked the organisers to stop the show.
																								The officer threatened to take me to the police station and confiscate my musical instruments.... This was an insult to our culture, heritage and music, Khan told Metro on Friday.
																								Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti called the singer on Friday afternoon. He was shocked that someone could behave like this with me and promised to look into the matter, Khan said.
																								Club secretary Bitan Chowdhury said: We have papers with the seal of deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyal, allowing us to continue with the bar with music till 2am. An officer, however, said the permission was for the bar alone. Open-air functions are not allowed after 11pm.
																								Chowdhury said the officer had come to the spot earlier and asked the organisers to lower the volume. We did so, but he returned half an hour later and ordered that the show be stopped.
																								But the police said the club had twice ignored their plea to stop the soiree.

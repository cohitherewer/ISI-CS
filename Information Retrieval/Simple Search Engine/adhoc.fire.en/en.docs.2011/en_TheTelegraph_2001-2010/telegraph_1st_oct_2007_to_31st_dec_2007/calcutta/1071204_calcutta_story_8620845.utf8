				 OSO goes the bride  															- Retro chic holds sway in wedding look this season ANUMITA GHOSH				 	 Deepika Padukone as Shantipriya in Om Shanti Om																								Pretty as a picture in a pink drape, hair tied back in a raised bun and dazzling smile in place, she steps into the... shaadi mandap. Shantipriya has travelled far and wide from the red carpet of Om Shanti Om as the Deepika Padukone brand of retro chic invades wedding venues around town this winter.																								Its all about going back in time with beauty and femininity. The look, the colours, the embroidery, the pinks and peaches are all very refreshing, says Manish Malhotra, who has designed Deepikas look for the film.																								Make-up artist Aniruddha Chakladar confirms the craze for the OSO makeover: Whether the face is oval or not, every bride in the city wants to look like Shantipriya.																								Pinky Agarwal (name changed on request) will be one of the many wannabe Shantipriyas on her wedding day this weekend. As soon as the promos of OSO started flashing on TV, I was determined to model my marriage look on Deepikas. I am tall and slender, so I hope to carry off that look to perfection, she says in all seriousness.																								More than 70 per cent of would-be brides are opting for the 70s look, concurs beauty expert Priscilla Corner. The look is in, big time, with the young generation finding it hot and happening. Gone are the days when brides wanted to look anything but filmi. Today, they want to replicate the exact look that catches their eye on screen.																								Poulomi Basu opted for the retro look at her wedding reception in end-November. My husband suggested I do something different. I went for the bouffant and extended eyeliner. My family and friends loved it.																								At the Bridgette Jones Fashion Salon, girls come in with photographs and printouts for the exact look  a blend of yesteryear charm and contemporary flair  to be replicated.																								Sabina Yah at Sunflower is doing the Deepika look every other day for girls tired of the typical bridal makeover.																								Sixty to 90 minutes at the salon can give you the Shantipriya look. The eyes are distinctly lined, from the inner corner to about a quarter inch past the outer corner. The hair is done in an exaggerated back-combed bouffant. Shimmer on the lids, cheeks and nude tone on the lips complete the look.																								If June Tomkyns charges Rs 700-plus for the hairdo and Rs 3,000-plus for the make-up, the bill at Bridgette Jones Fashion Salon comes to Rs 2,500-plus and at Sunflower Rs 5,000 (approx), including a special draping.																								Its not just about brides and bridals either. The look is amazingly popular with the 20-to-mid-30s age group for any big occasion, says Bridgette Jones.																								Doel Kar, 24, for instance, has been heavily influenced by Shantipriyas eyes. I have been doing it for every traditional occasion. Its dramatic and neat.																								Both Aniruddha and Bridgette recall Aishwaryas Devdas as the one Bollywood look in the recent past that became a craze.																								And theres more retro in store. With Soha Ali Khan sporting the 1950s-60s Bollywood look in Khoya Khoya Chand (releasing this Friday), turning the clock back is the way forward for fashion this winter.

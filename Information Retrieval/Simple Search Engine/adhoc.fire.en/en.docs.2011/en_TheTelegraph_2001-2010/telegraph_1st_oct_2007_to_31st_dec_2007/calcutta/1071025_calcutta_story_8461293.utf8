				 Return of kosha mangsho 
 A STAFF REPORTEROne of Calcuttas favourite food haunts is back, serving its signature spread, Kosha Mangsho, after remaining closed for more than a year.																								New Punjabi Hotel, popularly known as Gol Bari, reopened on October 5.																								The foodstop at the Shyambazar five-point crossing had downed shutters on September 3 last year, following the death of a waiter and a face-off between owner Kishan Arora and the restaurant hands.																								The workers had temporarily taken to the sidewalk to vend their popular spread.																								The items at the 85-year-old eatery remain the same, though the chop and kabiraji cutlet will take some time to reappear  till there are enough workers.																								The Puja rush helped set the pace for Gol Bari, which had done brisk business till the wee hours on all four festive days.																								Kosha mangsho and chapati continue to be the hot favourites. Chicken masala, mutton keema and fish fry are also in demand, said an eatery hand.																								The chairs in the restaurant have been replaced with stools, though several people are being made to taste their favourite dishes standing.																								We had to make this arrangement because there are not enough waiters. In a couple of months, we will be able to provide seating arrangements like before, said Mahadeb Hajra, the cashier at the eatery for the past 32 years.																								There are some other changes, too  the earthen bhaar for takeaways have been replaced with plastic containers and the price of most items have been hiked a few bucks.

		 Awaiting the miracle
																																	Age does not protect you from love, but love to some extent, protects you from age  Jeanne Moreau. If only something happens, if only someone comes, if only the door opens.The melancholy days melt into forlorn evenings, youth fades away and age creeps in, silently. Creativity shrivels and shrinks, love dies...and the eternal hope for some miracle to happen keeps us going despite the clock ticking away silently. Aparesh and Bonani wait, with this unspoken refrain hanging heavily in the air. And then suddenly, their world is transformed into a dream-like place as the strangers come. With them comes laughter and song, unheard yet familiar, and flowers of loved yet forgotten fragrances, and promises of eternal sunny days where the future is something to look forward to. As if with the slight movement of the magic wand, the Fairy Godmother ushers in a world where no conflicts exist, all discords fade and eternal happiness reigns.... Based on Buddhadeva Boses Nepathya Natak and being staged as part of Buddhadeva Bose Centenary Celebration, this Theatron production is directed by Saswati Biswas.

				 IIT boost for budding biz-wigs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Create jobs, not job-hunters is the aim of Entrepreneurship Summit (E-Summit), organised by the IIT Kharagpur entrepreneurship cell in association with Intellisys Technologies and Research.																								The three-day event, which has attracted more than 200 participants, was inaugurated on Friday by P.R. Agarwala, the president of Bharat Chamber of Commerce. 																								We need more and more educated entrepreneurs to further the economic development of the country, said Agarwala in his address.																								The new attraction at the summit this year is the BarCamp, on the theme of emerging entrepreneurial opportunities on the Internet. The camp is meant for information technology professionals, students as well as entrepreneurs.																								The highlight is Concipio, the business plan competition. The focus is firmly on the ideas and not on the economics of the plan. Thus, those without knowledge or expertise in the financial aspects of business can take part.																								Ideas will come in handy at Envision, a product designing competition for students. The products can range from software to hardware. Experts from the academia and venture capitalists will evaluate the designs. 																								Pensez, a case-study competition, will see students striving to come up with practical solutions to problems, while Eclairez will test their social entrepreneurship skills.																								The entrepreneurship cell has also organised lectures and workshops on Saturday and Sunday. The workshops and lectures will help to hone the skills of an entrepreneur, said Piyush Khemka, a member of the cell.																								Ideation, writing business plans, entrepreneurial finance, innovation and opportunities in IT and raising funds for venture exit plans are some of the topics of the workshops.																								The speakers at the E-summit include Biswajeet Sahrawat, the vice-president of Nasscom, and Anand Sen, the vice-president (flat products) of Tata Steel.

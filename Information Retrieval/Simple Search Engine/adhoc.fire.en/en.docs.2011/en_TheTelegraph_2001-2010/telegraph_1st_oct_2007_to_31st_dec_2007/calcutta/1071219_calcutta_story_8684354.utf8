				 Judge demand for pilot car 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER
																								A high court judge is angry with Calcutta police for failing to provide a pilot car when he went to attend a wedding last Saturday. 
																								The judge asked police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti to meet him in his high court chamber on Tuesday.
																								According to sources, the judge asked the commissioner to take action against the officers who refused to give him a pilot car.
																								Chakrabarti said after the meeting: It is a fact that a Calcutta High Court judge had called me to his chamber today. I dont want to name the judge or disclose what we discussed. 
																								After the meeting, Chakrabarti visited advocate-general Balai Ray and informed him of the incident.
																								A state law department officer said: The police generally provide high court judges with pilot cars for attending state and central government-sponsored programmes. The cops also provide pilot cars to judges on special occasions but they are not bound to do so. There is no clear rule.
																								An officer of the Lalbazar traffic department said: We grant requests for pilot cars by judges according to our discretion. It is not possible for the police to provide pilot cars to judges all the time. How will the commissioner take action against an officer when there is no law in this regard? 
																								Other judges of the court refused to comment on the matter. It would not be wise to comment without knowing the facts of the case, said a high court judge.

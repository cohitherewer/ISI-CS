																								Science City is setting up an Earth Exploration Hall, which will be thrown open to the public by March 2008.
																								The new centre, a dome-shaped structure with a diameter of 27 metres, is being set up to mark the International Year of Planet Earth, as declared by the 60th UN General Assembly. 
																								The hall, at the southern end of the park, will provide all information about the planet, from topography to climate changes, said Ingit Mukhopadhyay, the director-general of the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), at the first graduation ceremony of the students of science communication, which was started in July 2005.
																								Calcuttas Science City is the biggest and the most popular among the 27 centres set up by the NCSM across India. It records more than 1.3-million footfall a year. The target is to increase it to 1.8 million by the end of the 11th Plan, said Mukhopadhyay.
																								The council is also planning to enrol students from other countries in the science communication course from the next academic year. 
																								Many countries in south and southeast Asia are interested in sending students for the non-formal science training that the course offers. We will try to accommodate them from the next academic year, he said.
																								The course  run jointly by the council and BITS Pilani  covers a wide range of subjects, from making exhibits and management of museums to taking care of artefacts. There is a surge in the demand for trained curators and science communicators but there are not enough people to fill the posts, said Mukhopadhyay.

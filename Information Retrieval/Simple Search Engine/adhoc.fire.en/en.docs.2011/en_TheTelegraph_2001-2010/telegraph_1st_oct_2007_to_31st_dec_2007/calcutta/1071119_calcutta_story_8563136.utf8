 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 30-year-old man was found dead under mysterious circumstances in his room in a hotel on Mirza Ghalib Street on Sunday morning. He was found hanging from the ceiling with a bedsheet tied around his neck.																								We did not find a suicide note. The body has been sent for post-mortem. We will have a clearer idea about the incident after getting the report, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner (south division).																								According to the police, Rakesh Kumar Sahu checked into the hotel on November 15. He had paid Rs 500 and said that he would clear the rest of the bill before checking out on Sunday, added Shamim.																								The employees of the hotel did not see Sahu since morning. He was supposed to vacate the room in the morning and clear his dues, so we started knocking on the door of his room around 11am. There was no response, said a hotel employee. The staff alerted Park Street police station.																								A team of four policemen reached the hotel. One of the officers said: We broke open the door and found the body hanging from the ceiling. 																								The hotel employees told the police that they did not notice anything suspicious in Sahus behaviour on Saturday night.																								While filing up the hotel register, he mentioned that he had come from Orissa on a business trip. We are contacting our counterparts in the state to get in touch with Sahus relatives, said another officer of Park Street police station.

				 Coin in girls food pipe
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 50-paise coin that stuck in the food pipe of a seven-year-old girl and remained there for the past nine months was removed on Monday.																								The doctors said Charmina Khatun was in a critical condition and would be kept under observation for 48 hours. A team of seven doctors, led by Arunabha Sengupta, conducted the surgery.																								Charminas father Sheikh Asaruddin, a resident of Nalhati, in Birbhum, said his daughter had swallowed the coin accidentally.																								We took her to a local doctor, who gave some medicines and said the coin would naturally come out of the body. But a week later, Charmina started coughing and ran a high temperature, said the father.																								The family took the girl to another doctor, who did an X-ray that revealed a spot in the food pipe (oesophagus). The girl was referred to a government hospital in Burdwan, from where she was sent to SSKM.																								The doctors at SSKM, where Charmina was admitted on Saturday, found that the coin had made a dent on the right wall of the oesophagus.																								The coin had made a pocket on the wall of the oesophagus and remained there for nine months. We conducted an oesophagoscopy (a special endoscopy used to detect and treat diseases of the oesophagus) on Monday and took out the coin, said Sengupta, an associate professor and surgeon in the ENT department.																								The girl could not eat much for the past nine months and her weight was 12 kg. At her age, the weight should be at least 25 kg, said the doctor.

																								Two students of Class XI, Dhiman Parekh and Akshay Doshi, heard the horn of a Santro that wouldnt stop blaring near Minto Park on September 22, 2006.
																								The two students of La Martiniere for Boys ran to the car, to find a man slumped over the steering wheel. They opened the door and checked his pulse  the man was unconscious. The teenagers rushed the man to Belle Vue clinic, where doctors said that had the man not been brought to the healthcare unit, saving his life would have been difficult.
																								Both Parekh and Doshi shook hands with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and received a pat on their shoulder.
																								In an annual programme organised by the city police to felicitate men of the force and others for their bravery and honesty, Bhattacharjee awarded seven Calcuttans on Thursday evening in a packed auditorium of National Library.

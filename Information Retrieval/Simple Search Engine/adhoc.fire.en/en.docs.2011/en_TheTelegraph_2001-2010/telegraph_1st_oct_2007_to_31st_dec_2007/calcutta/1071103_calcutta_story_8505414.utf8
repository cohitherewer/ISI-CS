				 Man dies on train as others look on
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An elderly man died in the compartment of a local train at Dum Dum on Friday, close to an hour after he had collapsed. Passengers and railway officials failed to react fast enough to save him.																								The Barasat-bound Prinsep Ghat local pulled into Dum Dum station around 2pm. The man, who has not been identified, was standing near the doorway. 																								Witnesses said he suddenly slumped to the floor of the compartment.																								Before we could react, the train began to move towards Dum Dum Cantonment station, said Asim Ghosh, a trader in hosiery goods, who was returning to his Barasat home.																								It seems that the man might have suffered a cardiac arrest and needed immediate medical attention to survive. But no one thought of stopping the train and providing medical help, a railway official later said.																								After the train pulled into Dum Dum Cantonment station, some passengers sprinkled water on the face of the man, who was shivering by then.																								Some others went up to the drivers cabin to draw his attention to the medical emergency. The driver consulted the guard, before the station master was alerted.																								The train was detained at the station. It took the railway employees a full 40 minutes to carry the man off the train. By then, he had died, said Ghosh.																								The Government Railway Police officials of Dum Dum station have registered a case of unnatural death.

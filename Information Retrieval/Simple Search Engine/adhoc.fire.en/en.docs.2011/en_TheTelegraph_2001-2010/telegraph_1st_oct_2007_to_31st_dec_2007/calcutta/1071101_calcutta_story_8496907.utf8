				 Bandh city bathed
 OUR BUREAU				 	 A tourist tests the waters on Sudder Street on Wednesday. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Heavy rains lashed Calcutta and its adjoining areas for about three hours on Wednesday morning, resulting in waterlogging in many pockets.																								The city recorded 68 mm of rain from 11.30am to 2.30pm. Scattered showers are likely in the next 48 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.																								We expect the sky to remain cloudy and scattered rain is likely in the city and its adjoining areas on Thursday, said Debnath.																								Among the waterlogged pockets were Ballygunge Circular Road, Gurusaday Dutt Road, parts of Chittaranjan Avenue, MM Burman Street, Muktaram Babu Street, Picnic Garden Road, Sridhar Roy Road, Sudder Street and Ripon Street.																								The situation was further compounded by the Trinamul Congress bandh, as the civic body lacked the manpower to drain out the water fast. The attendance in the civic drainage department and the pumping stations was below 55 per cent.																								Civic chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) Tushar Ghosh, however, blamed the citys clogged sewer network for the waterlogging. I think it will take two to three hours to drain out the water, Ghosh said in the evening.																								Wednesdays downpour was caused by a low-pressure trough off the Bengal coast. The trough was sucking in moisture from the sea. The morning was sunny, but soon, there was rapid development of cumulonimbus clouds, said a Met official.																								Low pressure and depression are quite frequent in October and November, said another official.

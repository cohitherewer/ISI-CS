				 Query volley at Prasun
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The CBI on Tuesday asked former top cop Prasun Mukherjee to explain the police role in the Rizwanur Rahman case. A Telegraph picture																								The CBI on Tuesday asked former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee why and how his officers tried to separate Rizwanur Rahman and Priyanka Todi.																								Our officers recorded Prasun Mukherjees statements. He was asked to explain the police role in the matter, Arun Kumar, the CBI joint director (special branch), told Metro from Delhi.																								The hour-long interrogation, at Mukherjees Regent Park office, was led by deputy inspector-general Satish Golchha and superintendent Zaki Ahmed.																								We asked him why his officers got involved in the marital life of Rizwanur and Priyanka, even after the two had produced marriage and age certificates, and why the couple were forced to sign a bond, said a CBI official.																								We also wanted to know how Mukherjee reached the conclusion that Rizwanur had killed himself even before the post-mortem report came in and what he meant by saying that the Todis reaction to the marriage was natural, given the gap in the social status between them and the Rahmans, the official added.																								The sleuths asked the former top cop to narrate what had happened after Snehasish Ganguly, elder brother of cricketer Sourav, brought Priyankas uncle Pradip Todi to his Lalbazar office on September 7.																								We asked him what he had discussed with Pradip Todi and who he had contacted to handle the matter, the sleuth said. Mukherjee reportedly said he had referred it to the then deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh and deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar.																								Mukherjee was asked whether he was in touch with the Todis after Rizwanurs death. He had said on September 23, two days after Rizwanur died, that the Todis were in south India, the official said.																								The CBI finally asked him what steps had been taken to ensure the safety of the couple, who had written to senior officers fearing for their safety.																								Mukherjee refused comment when contacted on Tuesday evening.

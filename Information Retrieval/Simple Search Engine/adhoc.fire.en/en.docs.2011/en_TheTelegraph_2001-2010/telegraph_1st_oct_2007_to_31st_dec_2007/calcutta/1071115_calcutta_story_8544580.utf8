				 Anniversary in style
 A STAFF REPORTER			Participants at a seminar at the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy. A Telegraph pictureThe first NGO in eastern India working on cerebral palsy is set to celebrate its 33rd anniversary in style. The Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP), which was earlier known as the Spastics Society of Eastern India, was started in 1974 by the parents of a boy who had the ailment.																								The organisation that began by supporting two children now takes care of 3,000 families. It has a specialist resource centre for cerebral palsy, a training institute with national and international links, a family service, a school for children with disabilities and a vocational training centre for underprivileged people with disabilities. 																								The NGO also runs a socialisation and continuing education programme for adults with multiple impairment, and provides residential care for children and adults.																								The founders week will be observed from November 17 to November 23 with exhibitions and seminars. The events will start with the annual meet of affiliates and partners of the IICP from across the country on November 17.																								An exhibition on environmental conservation will follow on November 18, the founders day, on the Taratala Road premises of the institute.																								Given the opportunity, people with disabilities can contribute to the society. They may take more time but they are equally capable. The exhibition will be a great learning experience for the staff and the students, said Subhra Chatterjee, the head (communications) of the IICP.																								Manabendra Mukherjee, the state tourism minister, will inaugurate the exhibition. Schools, colleges and other NGOs from the city will take part in the exhibition.																								On November 19, the institute will organise a seminar at The Park, which will be inaugurated by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi. The seminar will look for practical and feasible strategies to include the disabled in development initiatives and will see participation of various NGOs and people with disabilities, added Chatterjee.																								Anthony Robertson, an activist for the disabled from the UK, and Santanu Ray, the director of Icfai Business School, Calcutta, will attend the seminar.

				 Ride the plex success crest
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 HIT THAT WAY: Rani Mukherjee and Konkona Sensharma in Laaga Chunari Mein Daag																								The latest Yash-Raj multistarrer, Laaga Chunari Mein Daag, seems all set to repeat the box-office success of its last release, Chak De! India.																								At least thats the impression one gets from the viewing schedule of Fame, the only city multiplex to have screened the last few Yash Raj productions. 																								The Hiland Park cine stop has lined up as many as nine shows a day for the Rani Mukerji-Konkona Sensharma starrer, with the tickets going for as much as Rs 280, one of the highest the price-sensitive Calcutta market has seen.																								Price is no longer a deterrent for the cine-going public, who count comfort and a good movie-watching experience above everything else, said Abhishek Raina, the marketing head of Fame Cinemas.																								Tickets for Chak De, too, were priced at Rs 280 at our plex, but that did not deter the majority from watching it in the first week, he added.																								Rainas statement found an echo in what software professional Arijit Sen said: I like the comfort at Fame and dont mind shelling out a few extra bucks for it. I watched Chak De!... at Fame for Rs 280 and will do the same for Laaga Chunari Mein Daag.																								The latest Yash Raj film is one of the two big Puja releases, the other being Bhool Bhulaiya, starring Akshay Kumar, and Priyadarshan.																								INOX is said to be in last- minute talks to screen Laaga Chunari..., in a bid to end the deadlock going on for months.																								All three earlier Yash Raj films had opted for the Hiland Park address, bypassing the other city multiplexes. In the process, Fame  the far-flung Bypass multiplex, as it was called till a few months ago  has undergone an image makeover, accompanied with a marked rise in footfall.																								Till early this year, Fames location kept a lot of people away. But once we became the only plex in Calcutta to screen some of the biggest blockbusters, the trend was reversed, said Raina, of Fame.

				 Court unites in-laws
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The high court has united a woman and her daughter-in-law fighting over the right to enter the kitchen. After cooking together for a fortnight, Aditi Mukherjee, 28, and her mother-in-law Amita, 53, told the court on Monday they had no grouse against each other.																								My daughter-in-law is nice to me. I am very happy with my family now. Thank you, sir. Because of you, the good days are back in my life, Amita told Justice G.C. Gupta with folded hands.																								Aditi said: I am very happy with my mother-in-law and husband.																								Three weeks ago, Amitas lawyers had told the court that Aditi had locked the kitchen of their house six months back and kept the key with her, refusing to let her mother-in-law enter. Amita had also accused Aditi of mental torture. Aditis lawyers had claimed that her husband Abhijit had taken his mothers side and had not been paying the tuition fees of their daughter. The judge had ordered Aditi to unlock the kitchen and cook together with Amita.																								On Monday, Abhijit told the judge that he had paid the tuition fees and bought clothes for his wife, daughter and mother. Aditi confirmed that he had gifted them clothes.																								Justice Gupta told the family to spend Puja happily and adjourned the matter for six weeks.

				 Meet to salvage Minerva
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Minerva theatre, on Beadon Street: Damage-control measures. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								The stage veterans who had found the renovated Minerva unsuitable for theatre met CMDA officials on Tuesday to discuss corrective steps that can be taken now.																								The century-old Beadon Street address has been refurbished at a cost of over Rs 5 crore with architect Dulal Mukherjee as guide. It was slated for reopening in November. 																								The CMDA, which steered the reconstruction work, has accepted the demands of the theatre experts for an aisle on the ground floor and repositioning of seats from where the stage view is obstructed. 																								Seats scrapped from the ground and first floors will bring down the capacity from 501 to around 350. However, the first-floor ring balcony, which the theatre team wanted to be redesigned, will be left untouched, as it is too old to withstand any major change. 																								The scope for an extra greenroom at stage level  to save performers the trouble of using those on the first and second floors  was also discussed in the meeting at Writers Buildings, convened by Dilip Kumar Chakraborty, the principal secretary of the information and cultural affairs department, at the insistence of urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.																								Apart from CMDA CEO P.R. Baviskar and the director of culture, Anup Motilal, the meeting was attended by theatre personalities Bibhas Chakraborty, Meghnad Bhattacharya and Ashok Mukhopadhyay.																								Whatever possible will be done to make the hall functional. It should satisfy the theatre veterans, Motilal said. 																								The team of veterans had detected several flaws in the auditorium during a visit in end-October on an invitation from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								Their suggestions prompted Bhattacharjee to order that necessary measures be taken before the hall is reopened.																								We feel our suggestions are being considered seriously, though we wish this had happened two or three years ago.																								At this stage, only the minimum can be expected, Ashok Mukhopadhyay said after Tuesdays meeting.

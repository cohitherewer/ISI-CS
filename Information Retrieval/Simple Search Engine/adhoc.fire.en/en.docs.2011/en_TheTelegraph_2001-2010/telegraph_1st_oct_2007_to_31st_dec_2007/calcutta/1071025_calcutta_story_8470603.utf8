				 Ex-friend questioned
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								The CBI on Wednesday interrogated a woman with whom Rizwanur Rahman had a relationship and who last spoke to the computer graphics teacher days before his death.																								The grilling of the woman at her Ultadanga home followed the CBIs interrogation of Pradip Todi, uncle of Rizwanurs widow Priyanka, for the second time.																								The sleuths reportedly asked the woman about her relationship with Rizwanur and also if he sought money from her.																								Priyanka had once called the woman after returning to her parents home in Salt Lake from her in-laws house in Tiljala on September 8.																								The sleuths asked the woman about the conversation and whether she had said anything that might have prompted Priyanka to consider breaking up her marriage.																								It emerged that during their courtship, the woman had asked Rizwanur to move out of Calcutta and settle in New Delhi.																								But Rizwanur shot down the proposal. He told her that he would prefer settling down in Mumbai, where one of his friends lived, said a sleuth.																								The woman had visited Rizwanurs home a number of times, including once during the marriage of one of the family members. 																								The two, however, did not marry because Rizwanur thought she was highly strung and very volatile, the sleuth added. The womans statements will be crucial in cracking the mystery surrounding Rizwanurs death.																								The CBI on Wednesday also interrogated Sujoy Ghosh, one of Rizwanurs colleagues, and Swapnil Sengupta, one of his students.																								Three uncles of Rizwanurs were also called for questioning, along with the guard and motorman of a Duttapukur local that had passed the spot where Rizwanurs body was found on September 21.																								I told the CBI that I didnt spot any body while I was taking the train towards Duttapukur at 10.15am. But while returning at 12.03pm, I saw a body but couldnt take a closer look, said Sanmelan Ghosh, the motorman.																								Earlier in the day, the CID wrote to the CBI, asking the central agency to collect the statements of 83 persons it had earlier interrogated. Insiders, however, said the CID would not hand over the taped conversations.

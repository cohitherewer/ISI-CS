				 	 The Big Bazaar outlet on VIP Road: Learning curve. A Telegraph picture
																								The New Year is set to bring more retail cheer to Calcutta, in the shape of 10 new Big Bazaar outlets in and around the city.
																								Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd, the flagship company of the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group, which introduced its Big Bazaar format with the first outlet on VIP Road in 2001, is again betting big on Calcutta, targeting at least Rs 1,000-crore business in 2008.
																								The phenomenal response to our hypermarket concept, both on VIP Road and in The Metropolis Mall in Hiland Park, has given us the confidence to surge ahead in full steam. We hope to throw open six to seven new Big Bazaar outlets in the New Year, said Sandeep Marwaha, head-operations (east), Pantaloon Retail.
																								The third Big Bazaar, spread over 40,000 sq ft, will open on Lee Road in January, with another 40,000-sq-ft outlet coming up in February, to be housed in the restored Metropolitan Building, a listed heritage structure.
																								April will see Salt Lake flagging off its maiden Big Bazaar outlet, a 50,000-sq-ft store in IB block. The 41A AJC Bose Road premises of the Jugantar and Amrita Bazar Patrika offices, now being converted into a retail-cum-commercial block, will be the address for the largest Big Bazaar outlet in eastern India, spread across 100,000 sq ft, expected to be ready by May 2008.
																								The VIP Road Big Bazaar was an experiment to see if such out-of-town models would work, and we were pleasantly surprised. The initial response was so overwhelming (Rs 1.5-crore business in 10 days) that we had to rush back to the drawing board to plan bigger, and we have used the Calcutta learning curve everywhere, says Rajan Malhotra, CEO, Big Bazaar.
																								Since 2001, the management has been tweaking the format in a subtle manner, adding new categories and achieving a 26 per cent year-on-year growth. The stores coming up in the city will see new elements being rolled out, plus the destination Super Centre format, a bigger bowl of food, fashion and general merchandise, Malhotra promises.
																								Lake Mall, the refurbished, contemporary avatar of Lake Market, will also boast a Big Bazaar, as will The Terminus mall coming up in New Town, Rajarhat. Diamond City North on Jessore Road and the Riverside Mall in Howrah will be other upcoming stops. 
																								Pantaloon Retail will set up more stores in all the malls and consumption centres being set up through Kshitij, its reality asset management arm. Two such malls are coming up on VIP Road and Diamond Harbour Road, and two in Madhyamgram and Kharagpur.

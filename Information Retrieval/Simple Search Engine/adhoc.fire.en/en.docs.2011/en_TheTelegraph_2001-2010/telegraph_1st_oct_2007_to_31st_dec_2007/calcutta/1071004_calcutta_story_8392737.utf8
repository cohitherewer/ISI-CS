				 Gas leak in Big Mac blast
 																											- Forensic report rules out AC duct theory in fatal explosion A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Big Mac after the blast. A Telegraph picture																								The blast at McDonalds on the morning of August 12 was caused by the leak of LPG from a cylinder.																								This is the conclusion of the forensic probe into the explosion at the Park Street fast-food outlet, that claimed the life of a pedestrian.																								The forensic report has confirmed that an LPG leak had caused the explosion. Gas must have leaked after the knob of a cylinder was accidentally left open. It reacted with some chemicals and sparked the blast, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner (detective department).																								In an email statement, McDonalds India said: We have been made aware by The Telegraph of a report pertaining to the causes of the unfortunate blast in our Park Street restaurant.... We cannot comment on the report till we have studied it.																								Asked about the renovation work that appears to be going on behind a tarpaulin veil at McDonalds, the spokesperson was tight-lipped: We have recently got possession of the place and are currently assessing the damage.																								Big Mac opened its doors in Calcutta on March 9. A few employees were preparing for a 10am opening that Sunday when the blast rocked the 55 Park Street address at 9.34am.																								The impact killed Aftab Hussain Ansari, 24, on the spot. The resident of Queens Mansion was waiting to cross Park Street and get home. Four McDonalds employees suffered burns and the outlet was badly damaged.																								Hours after the explosion, the police had blamed it on pressure building up inside the AC ducts. The next day, congestion in the AC ducts caused by dust was the culprit, and on August 14, the police blamed it on leak of LPG.																								The forensic report rules out the AC duct theory and states that LPG leak was the sole cause of the explosion, stressed Kumar.																								The probe was carried out by the state forensic and central forensic laboratories, backed by the fire services department and the police.																								The fire minister, however, refused to confirm the cause on Wednesday. I have not received the report yet and so I cannot comment on the matter. I will check the findings tomorrow, Pratim Chatterjee said late on Wednesday.																								After the AC duct theory fell through, doubts were also raised about LPG leak being the cause of the blast. On August 18, Pratik Kumar Chatterjee, a fire expert and ONGC adviser brought in by McDonalds, examined the site.																								The cause of the explosion cannot be LPG, as no one smelt it. There was no carbon deposition, and the source of the leak and occurrence of the explosion were more than 12 feet apart, he said.

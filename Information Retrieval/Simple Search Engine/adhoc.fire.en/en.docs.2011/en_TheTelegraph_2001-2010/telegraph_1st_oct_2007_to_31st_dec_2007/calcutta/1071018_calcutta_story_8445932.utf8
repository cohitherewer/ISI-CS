				 Legends Puja in sick bed
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Suchitra Sen: Recovering																								The fever has finally left her, but Suchitra Sen will have to spend the Pujas confined in ICCU 2 at Belle Vue Clinic.																								Suchitra Sens condition has improved. But since she is still very weak, we will keep her under observation for a few more days, said K.B. Baksi, one of the doctors attending to the legendary actress, who is suffering from a urinary tract infection.																								Sen regained normal temperature on Tuesday night, a week after being admitted to the clinic with high fever, and insisted on going back to her Ballygunge Circular Road home. She wanted to know if she would have to stay in the hospital during the Puja. She said she wanted to go home, said a source in the clinic. 																								After about a week of fluctuating temperature, Sen is responding to the upgraded antibiotic course that includes Meronem injections, administered thrice a day. She is responding to treatment and her overall progress is being maintained, said Baksi. On Wednesday, Sen had toast, egg and tea for breakfast, and boiled vegetables for lunch.																								The 77-year-old former actress spends most of her time sleeping or listening to religious songs, amid tight security in her seventh-floor cabin. She listens to religious songs on a Walkman and also meditates in the morning, said a source.																								Irritated with the tremendous curiosity among the hospital staff, patients and their relatives to catch a glimpse of her, the reclusive screen star refused to be wheeled down to the ground floor of the clinic for an ultrasonography test on Tuesday. The machine was later sent up for the test.

				 Mop-up of house tax dues
 A STAFF REPORTERThe city civic authorities will soon launch a crackdown on big property tax defaulters.																								The money to be collected from the drive will be used to fund infrastructure upgrade work across the city.																								The civic revenue department has handed over to municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay a list of 150 defaulters, who together owe the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Rs 150 crore as property tax dues.																								The defaulting properties are mostly commercial establishments. Individual outstanding amounts range from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 8 crore.																								Civic revenue manager Bhaskar Ghosh said CMC inspectors will first visit a defaulting property for the dues. If the owner fails to cough up the money, his movable properties and finally, the defaulting property itself, will be attached.																								Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: The CMC will have to shell out its share of over Rs 2,000 crore in the various infrastructure upgrade schemes drawn up under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. We must immediately start a drive against property tax defaulters to raise the money.																								Most defaulting properties are in prime locations  on Bidhan Sarani, Lenin Sarani, SP Mukherjee Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Bishop Lefroy Road and Ashutosh Mukherjee Road.

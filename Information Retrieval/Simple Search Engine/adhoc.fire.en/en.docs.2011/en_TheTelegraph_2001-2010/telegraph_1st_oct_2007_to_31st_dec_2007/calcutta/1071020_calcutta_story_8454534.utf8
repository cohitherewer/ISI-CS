				 Six contenders for Puja crown
														 The final leg of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja saw the panel of celebrity judges travel from far south to deep north. Five of the pujas that were in contention for the Model Puja crown are in Behala, Thakurpukur and Haridevpur. Manicktalla Chaltabagan was the only 				 contender from 			 the north.		Manicktalla Chaltabagan		Senhati		Yuvak Gosthi		Naktala Udayan Sangha		The judges at Behala Club		The 41 Pally pandal																								Behala Club Sarbojanin Durgotsav																								With its clay-and-mud huts decorated with Kalighat pats, the first impression of the pandal is good. But the judges were looking for more. They asked questions on each and every aspect of the puja  from crowd and waste management to drinking water supply.																								The pandal is spread out, with two emergency exits, plus a couple of other gates. There could have been a fan inside for better air circulation.																								We keep watch through closed-circuit television cameras linked to a monitor, said a member of the puja committee. About 10 volunteers are in charge of security.																								Fire-retardant spray was used on combustible materials used in the pandal. Drinking water supply and first-aid arrangements are also in order. The makeshift toilets, made with corrugated aluminium sheets, are behind the pandal.																								The Saptami rain had left the mud walls soft. Extra sand has been brought in to soak up the accumulated water on the compound. Members said the ground would be restored and the extra layers of soil and sand would be removed after Puja. 																								Senhati Durgotsav Samiti																								This puja, also in Behala, has a homely feel. The pandal is roomy. Ours is a completely para affair. Everyone is involved and this is where the residents of the area hang out during the festival. Bickram Ghosh is our neighbour. He comes and jams with the dhakis, said puja committee member Surajit Bhattacharjee, while his 78-year-old father welcomed guests.																								The medical facility at Senhati is of the top order. An ambulance had been kept ready near the first-aid stall. Theres a wheelchair and seats for the elderly. The drinking water dispenser is clearly pointed out.																								A sound limiter was being used. There are many elderly and sick people in the area, so we are careful about using the loudspeaker, said a puja committee member.																								The puja applied for a 12KW connection and has kept a generator ready. 																								Yuvak Gosthi																								Yuvak Gosthis pandal in Thakurpukur is decorated with masks from various parts of India.																								Weve tried to show the faces of man through these masks. Through use of lights on the masks, we have tried to portray the dark and light sides of man, explained puja committee member Samit Majumdar. 																								The pandal, made of earthen tiles and clay, is protected from fire by four fire extinguishers and an arrangement to pump water from a nearby pond.																								The club is carrying out a signature campaign against child labour and child abuse. The members plan to send the signatures to the Prime Minister.																								The judges advised the committee to make its exits wider. If more people can enter than can come out, then some of them will get trapped if there is an accident, pointed out judge Dilip Samajpati. 																								Rupam, another judge, was a big draw and had to give autographs. Rituparna Das, a Class X student, after clicking his photograph on her camera phone, gushed: I am such a fan of yours... I never thought Id meet you. 																								41 Pally																								The ruins of Machu Pichu, recreated at 41 Pally in Haridevpur, was next up. The artists have created with Siporex an artificial waterfall, walls that resemble mossy stone surfaces and motifs inspired by Korean art.																								A group of drummers and flautists from Midnapore, playing tribal music, added to the ambience. Rupam and fellow judge Churni Ganguly joined them.																								The pandal has a dispensary with two beds that is functional round the clock. An exhibition on global warming is mounted in a corner. There are two drinking water dispensers with a board on conserving water near them.																								Fifty volunteers  10 of them trained in crowd management by the local police station  along with NCC cadets and cops are in charge of security.																								Waste management has been taken care of in an artistic way. Big earthen jars painted with Inca motifs, placed strategically inside the pandal, serve the purpose without marring the look. 																								The generator is not only there but is state-of-the-art. It is virtually silent. The puja committee must have saved over several years to buy such a system, said judge Bhaskar Ghosh.																								The club runs an orphanage with 35 children. A pump near a neighbouring pond could be very useful if there is a fire. Judge Manoj Mitra remarked: The puja has taken precaution for every contingency.																								As the judges prepared to leave, a man bent with age, stick in hand, was seen being guided to a chair by a volunteer. Thakur dekhechhen toh? he enquired, in true puja spirit.																								Naktala Udayan Sangha																								The last stop in the south was this pandal, built with bamboo, coloured and cut to size. Pats are painted on the bamboo sticks. The idol, too, looks straight out of a pat.																								It is not exactly a patchitra, as the background of the painting is bamboo and not cloth or paper, explained a puja organiser.																								The abundance of combustible material attracted the attention of the judges, who grilled the organisers about fire-fighting measures.																								The puja committee members claimed that the bamboo sticks used were treated with fire retardant chemicals but were unable to produce documents to that effect. 																								The neat, clean and quiet pandal appealed to many of the judges because of its simplicity. I loved the use of eco-friendly and recyclable material, said judge Myra Rasmussen.																								Manicktalla Chaltabagan																								The lone beacon in the north was the only one that gave close competition to favourites 41 Pally.																								Last years four-star winner outdid itself in terms of attention to detail. The pandal is an immense boat, made out of plywood and embellished with copper plates.																								The pandal is Debi Choudhuranis bajra. We have used copper plates to recreate the feel of gold, said an organiser. 																								The majestic structure, with an anchor and mast, is open. So, people dont have to queue up to view the idol, creating a traffic snarl on the road.																								Security cameras monitor the area round-the-clock. Theres a fire alarm, water tanks and a hose, in addition to fire-fighting equipment. A well-stocked first-aid section and an ambulance impressed the judges.

				 Plays for cancer therapy
 A STAFF REPORTER																								City doctors have started using play therapy to boost the morale of patients suffering from cancer and other chronic illnesses that have no cure.																								As part of the therapy, we organise plays to help patients suffering from chronic illnesses to gain mental strength, said Subir Ganguly, the head of the radiology department at NRS Medical College and Hospital and president of the voluntary organisation, Onkolink.																								On Saturday, Onkolink staged Haripada Samachar at Rabindra Sadan. More than 200 cancer patients and their families watched the play, based on the story of a boy suffering from cancer and the trauma he and his near ones go through.																								The play was enacted by visually-challenged people, most of whom are hawkers.																								Plays acts as a diversion and help the viewer overcome the pains of hard reality. Besides, as patients watch the plays in a group, the therapy is more effective than individual counselling, said surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay.																								Psychiatrists feel the plays come as a shock, prompting patients to react positively to life. A play on the life of a cancer patient will surely lift the morale of several cancer patients, said Ranadip Ghosh Roy, the general secretary of Indian Psychiatric Society. The therapy can also be effective for patients suffering from AIDS and a few incurable neurological disorders.

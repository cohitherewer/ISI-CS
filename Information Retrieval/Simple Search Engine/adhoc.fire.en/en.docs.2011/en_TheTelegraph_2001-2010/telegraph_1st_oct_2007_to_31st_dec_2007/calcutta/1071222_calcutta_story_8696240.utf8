																								The seven suspected militants from Manipur, arrested in a Jadavpur flat, were remanded in police custody on Friday. 
																								The four men and three women  all of whom are graduates, according to police  were brought to the additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM)s court in Alipore in a van guarded by policemen and commandos.
																								Sources claimed Gita Devi, one of the suspected militants, could be an actress. A Manipuri actress has been missing for two years but her photograph did not appear to match with the face of Gita. 
																								Two of the women fell ill on Friday and had to be treated at MR Bangur Hospital, said a police officer. One of the women broke down while getting off the prison van in court.
																								Arijit Mukherjee, the judicial magistrate acting as the ACJM, remanded the men for nine days and women for two weeks in police custody. 
																								We have come to Calcutta as tourists but the police have intentionally implicated us, said Maisnam German Singh, who had rented the flat, in English before leaving the court.
																								We need time to examine them thoroughly. Documents, CDs, cassettes, an expensive camera and bank statements have been found in their flat, said Asish Bhattacharya, the assistant public prosecutor.
																								The seven, suspected to be members of Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kanleipak (Prepak), have been arrested on charges of sedition and assembling with bad intention. According to Bhattacharya, the associates of the group have been arrested in Manipur. 
																								The superintendent of Imphal West police, Clay Khongsai, said two officers have been sent to Calcutta for questioning the seven and ascertaining their identities. 
																								South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar stated: Army intelligence is tracking the group. We are looking into the sevens local links. It seems that they used to receive money from different sources and distribute it to other members of their organisation in countries like Bangkok.
																								Maisnam can understand English and Hindi but it is difficult to communicate with the others, added Kumar. Either they do not know any language except Manipuri or are pretending. 
																								Kumar said the CDs seized from the flat would be sent for forensic investigation. The interrogation will begin from today. The seven may be taken to Manipur on transit remand for questioning.

				 Feel-good back at film fest
 															- SECURITY RELAXED, CINE-GOERS THRONG NANDAN A STAFF REPORTER																								Nandan sprang to life on Day 4 of the 13th Calcutta Film Festival, despite a boycott call from a group of actors, directors, artists and writers to protest the Nandigram killings.																								If Monday was a day of inaction at Nandan because of the bandh, Tuesday saw cine-goers thronging the campus since morning. Film buffs jostled in front of ticket counters, while long queues snaked around Nandan, Sisir Mancha, Rabindra Sadan and crowded food kiosks. There was also a rush to hear Argentine film-maker Fernando Solanas at Jibanananda Sabhaghar.																								The film package is good this year and we want to enjoy the festival. At the same time, we are concerned about the Nandigram happenings. If nothing else has been hampered, why stop the festival, a regular affair? asked Shayantan Bhattacharya, a student. With only four days of the festival left, many were keen on making up for lost time. I have been watching films since 9am. I will see at least three more today, said Pauli Dasgupta, a young homemaker.																								Security was relaxed, with lesser number of cops being deployed at Nandan on Tuesday compared to the earlier two days. The festive spirit has returned. All the auditoriums are full and the crowd will swell by the evening, said Nilanjan Chatterjee, the Nandan CEO and film festival director.																								Though the celebs stayed away  Soumitra Chatterjee being the only exception  a group led by theatre veteran Saoli Mitra gathered in front of Academy of Fine Arts to protest Nandigram. Mitra read out excerpts from Raktakarabi, before joining a candlelight congregation.

				 Teachers body in tank
 																											- Needle of suspicion points to missing taxi driver A STAFF REPORTER																								The decomposed body of Sudipta Ghosh, a 32-year-old schoolteacher, was found in the water tank of a taxi drivers house in Amtala, on the southern fringes of the city, on Monday. His hands and feet were tied.																								Ghosh had been missing for more than a fortnight.																								The taxi driver, Tapan Mukherjee, who stays close to Ghoshs house, is absconding. He is the prime suspect. We are looking for him, said an officer of the local Bishnupur police station.																								Gobinda Mullick, who had recently carried out some repairs in the tank, has been arrested.																								The family members of Ghosh told the police that Mukherjee had taken money from him to buy him a taxi.																								Ghosh, who taught physics at Barisha Shashibhusan Janakalyan Vidyapith, had been missing since Kali puja night on November 9. 																								His nephew Saswata said: Kaka was fixing a lamp when he suddenly left home, around 4pm, on November 9. We became worried when he failed to return even at 10pm. We looked for him at several places and finally lodged a missing diary the next morning. He alleged the police visited the spot more than a week later.																								Saswata said Ghosh had been saving money to buy a taxi. He had the main gate of our house widened so that the taxi could be brought in.																								The family suspects Ghosh had handed over the money he had saved to Mukherjee, who then killed him. 																								There could be no other reason for my brother rushing to meet the taxi driver on Kali puja, said Ghoshs sister Kajari.																								The sleuths suspect the teacher had been strangled. The superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, Praveen Kumar, said: The inquest did not reveal any external injury marks. We will have to wait for the post-mortem report to know how and when Ghosh was killed.																								Asked about the allegation of police inaction by Ghoshs family, Kumar said: An inquiry will be ordered to find out whether Bishnupur police station had actually been negligent in probing the case. If any officer is found guilty, he will be punished.																								But why did the police take 17 days to recover the body? 																								A senior officer said: All police stations in the district and Calcutta police were alerted immediately after we received the complaint. It took some time to recover the body as it was concealed in the water tank.

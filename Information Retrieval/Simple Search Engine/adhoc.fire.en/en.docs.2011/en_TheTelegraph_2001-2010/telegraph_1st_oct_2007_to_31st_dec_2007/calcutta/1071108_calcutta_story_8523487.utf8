				 Roadblocks cripple rush hour
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A Trinamul Congress road blockade on Howrah bridge resulted in a massive traffic jam and harassment of commuters. A Telegraph picture 																								A series of roadblocks by Trinamul Congress brought the city to a standstill on Wednesday. Supporters of the party damaged a government bus in Kidderpore and assaulted policemen during demonstrations to protest the violence at Nandigram. 																								There will be more such disruptions in the near future, warned Madan Mitra, the general secretary of the party.																								Office-goers and students were the worst affected, as Trinamul activists squatted at nearly two dozen places, including key intersections like Hazra, Moulali, MG Road-CR Avenue and Shyambazar, during the morning rush hour. 																								I was stuck at the Hazra crossing for over an hour from 10.15am. The demonstration was for 15 minutes, but it took more than an hour for the traffic movement to become normal, said Brishti Mukherjee, a first-year postgraduate student at Calcutta University.																								The situation was no better in the north. Krishnendu Mahapatra, an employee of a private bank in BBD Bag, had to wait at the Shyambazar intersection for more than 45 minutes from 10.10am. I had an appointment with an important client. By the time I reached office, he had left, said Mahapatra.																								The demonstrations were held between 10am and 11.30am. We arrested 31 people for obstructing traffic, said Vineet Goyel, the deputy commissioner (headquarters). Around 10.40am, a group of 80 Trinamul activists put up a roadblock at Kidderpore, causing a bumper-to-bumper snarl on the flanks leading to Behala and the city centre.																								The demonstrators damaged the windscreen of a government bus and terrorised the commuters. Policemen deployed in the area were attacked when they tired to disperse the activists, said an officer of Watgunge police station. We arrested 20 people on the charge of rioting.																								A case has been slapped on local Trinamul leader Rakesh Singh for allegedly assaulting constable N.C. Mandal.																								More than 200 party workers blocked the Howrah-end of Rabindra Setu for about 45 minutes in the morning. The district unit president of Trinamul led the demonstration. The resultant traffic snarl lasted more than a couple of hours.																								At Rajabazar, 11 people were arrested for not lifting the roadblock they had put up after repeated requests from the police.																								Revolutionary Youth Front (RYF), a Naxalite organisation, also tried to hold a demonstration outside Writers Buildings on the Nandigram issue. Twenty-seven activists of the unit, including two women, were arrested outside the state secretariat around 11.30am.																								Demonstration is not allowed outside Writers Buildings. We arrested RYF workers for violating high-security zone norms, said a police officer.

				 Pandals queue up for power
 A STAFF REPORTER																								CESC is providing temporary powerlines to more than 3,000 Durga puja pandals in and around Calcutta this year.																								We have already processed 3,006 applications for temporary connections, said Dilip Kumar Sen, executive director (commercial-mains). Last year, 2,829 temporary connections were provided to Durga puja pandals.																								All CESC generating stations will be operational during Puja. Arrangements have been made to draw power from Madhya Pradesh and Meghalaya. There is a negligible chance of power cut during Puja, according to Sen.																								More and more organisers are taking authorised power connections for Puja. There is increasing awareness about safety, said Shantanu Chatterjee, executive director (corporate development), CESC.																								River order: A high court bench on Tuesday ordered Calcutta Port Trust to bear half the cost of cleaning the Hooghly bed and banks after the Durga and Jagaddhatri puja immersions. The order was passed on a petition by environmental activist Subhas Dutta. Forty-four municipalities on the Hooghly banks, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, have also been asked to take part in the clean-up.

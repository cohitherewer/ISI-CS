				 Man on MLA bus punches constable
 A STAFF REPORTERA man in a bus that ferries legislators from their hostel to the West Bengal State Assembly assaulted a traffic policeman on Thursday afternoon. 																								Swapan Kumar Mistri, a constable of the south traffic guard, was punched by a man travelling in the bus for MLAs. 																								We are yet to identify the person who hit Mistri. We have decided to start a case of preventing a policeman from performing his duties, said a senior officer of Park Street police station.																								Mistri (picture left by Amit Datta) was busy on duty at the Jawaharlal Nehru Road-Kyd Street crossing around 2.30pm when a bus driver drew his attention from a distance. 																								The bus was moving from Mayo Road towards Kyd Street and I saw it was a bus used by MLAs. We had cleared the congestion at the crossing and the bus started moving forward slowly. The driver was calling me and I approached the bus, thinking he needed some help, recounted Mistri. 																								But what followed was unexpected. As he leaned forward to hear what the driver was saying, a man standing behind the driver suddenly landed a punch on his face. 																								There were three persons on the bus. The man who hit me was somewhere around 50 and in a white kurta-pyjama. An elderly man standing next to him was instigating him to hit me. When he raised his fist again, I backed away, said the 40-year-old traffic constable. 																								Seeing Mistris plight from a distance, another traffic constable, Sanjib Roy, rushed to the spot. But before he could intercept the bus, it sped away towards the MLA Hostel on Kyd Street. 																								Normally, we give priority to the MLA Hostel buses, but it was not possible to let the bus pass immediately, since Kyd Street was choked, Mistri explained.																								After the incident, Mistri went to Park Street police station for a medical examination and to register a complaint. He was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he was administered first aid and released.

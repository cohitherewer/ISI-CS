				 Criminal barter with Bangla

 PRONAB MONDAL
																								The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is using the handover of five Bangladeshi criminals caught in India to pressure its counterpart in the neighbouring country to reciprocate the gesture. 
																								According to sources in the CID, a police team from Dhaka may visit the city in a couple of months to hold talks on the issue.
																								The handover of the five was the first such case between the countries.
																								The criminals were arrested in Calcutta and its adjoining areas. In the absence of an extradition treaty, the state investigating agency handed them over to Bangladesh CID under the Foreigners Act.
																								The CID now wants Bangladesh police to arrest Indian criminals hiding in that country and hand them over. We have given them a list of the gangsters we are looking for, said a state CID officer.
																								Our government is looking into it. We will definitely cooperate with the Indian officers. Handing over of criminals has opened up a new way of curbing crime in both countries, said Mohammad Abdullah Aref, additional special superintendent (Dhaka metro), Bangladesh CID.
																								 Among the five was Sanjibul Islam, alias Iman. He was wanted in Dhaka in more than 50 cases, including 13 murders, said Rajeev Kumar, special inspector-general (operations), CID. He was held in a rented apartment in Kasba.
																								Imans parents are doctors at Dhaka Medical College. He quit studying medicine after a year and took to crime, said a CID officer. We informed Calcutta police after Iman called up a businessman in Dhaka for extorting money, said Aref. 
																								After the arrest, the CID officers at an informal session requested Bangladesh police to track down Indian criminals and send them over.
																								Whether the investigating agencies can work together or not depends on the decision taken by senior government officials, observed a state CID officer.

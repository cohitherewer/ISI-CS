																								An ensemble of five musicians, including a soprano (Ida Fratta) and baritone (Cuneyt Unsal), a pianist (Gianna Fratta), violinist (Dino De Palma) and a cellist (Jacopo Di Tonno), named U. Giordano from the city of Foggia in the Puglia region of Italy, will perform extracts from Donizetti, Bellini, Gastaldon and Rossini at GD Birla Sabhagar on Monday evening. 
																								The ensemble is named after Giordano (1867-1948), a composer born in Foggia. Smyrna-born Unsal was originally from Turkey which, he said, has 40 opera theatres and 20 symphony orchestras.
																								Calcutta will enjoy these operatic lollipops, thanks to the munificence of the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in collaboration with the Commune di Foggia and the Regione Puglia Assessorato al Turismo e Industria Alberghiera. 
																								That the Italians mean serious business became clear when in February 2003, haute couture by the likes of Valentino, Armani, Gucci and Versace and original items of clothing worn by the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy, Audrey Hepburn, Clark Gable and Sophia Loren were exhibited in the Victoria Memorial Hall. 
																								Last year, a huge exhibition of art work by Italian and Indian artists was held at the same venue.
																								Dino De Palma (Hollywood director Brian De Palma is my uncle, he joked) who acted as the spokesperson of the ensemble, which arrived on Saturday, said this is part of a three-year cultural exchange programme organised by Foggia city with countries that fall on Marco Polos silk route along two geographical lines  from sea and by road. 
																								Last year Turkey and Israel had been chosen. This year, it is India and Iran, and next year, it is the turn of China and Japan.
																								Dhoad gypsy musicians of Rajasthan, who are on a year-long tour of the West, have performed in Foggia. The other guest was Bapsi Sidhwa, the Pakistani writer now settled in Dallas. Why Bapsi Sidhwa, who spoke about the condition of women in the Indian sub-continent? Because Deepa Mehtas film Earth was based on Sidhwas novel, Ice Candy Man, and her 2006 Water, A Novel, was based on Mehtas film named after that element.
																								The ensemble has already performed in Pune and Mumbai before enthusiastic audiences. The major of Foggia, Orazio Ciliberti, who has gone back, met the Mumbai municipal commissioner, J.M. Phathak, to discuss tourism and business possibilities.

				 Teachers take on varsity authorities

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Teachers at the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) are up in arms against vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea over his decision to suspend the university sine die on Friday and his subsequent allegations against them.
																								Besu Teachers Association (Besuta) called a special general meeting on Monday to discuss the situation. Besuta secretary Partha Chatterjee said: We hold the vice-chancellor responsible for the current impasse. Students have been sent away and the dates for the semester examinations have not been announced. 
																								Besuta will write to the chancellor, Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, and state higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Choudhury to apprise them of the developments on the campus and the teachers views on the situation. 
																								We will also write to the vice-chancellor asking him to produce facts and figures to prove his allegations against the teachers, added Chatterjee. The teachers are also planning to send a deputation to Banerjea.
																								The vice-chancellor had blamed the teachers for not being committed enough to preserving the academic environment in the university. He had alleged that the teachers had little time for students outside the classroom.
																								No decision has been taken on rescheduling the postponed examinations. The university authorities had declared 144 students discollegiate for the semester examinations that were scheduled to begin on December 11 citing low attendance. The students boycotted the examinations and asked the authorities to review the decision.
																								The university authorities had asked for attendance figures while postponing the tests. The department heads sent in the attendance figures on Monday, but no decision was taken on rescheduling the exams, stated Chatterjee. According to him, there is no proper system in place to record attendance at Besu.

				 Job code delay irks schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Christian missionaries have threatened to launch an indefinite protest against the state governments delay in announcing a policy that will ensure that their schools enjoy the minority rights, as guaranteed in the Constitution.
																								It has become difficult to run state-aided missionary schools because of the states failure to chalk out the policy, said Sailesh Mukhopadhyay, the general secretary of the Association of Christian Schools.
																								A key demand of the missionaries is the freedom to recruit teachers for their 700-odd institutions.
																								The state government had promised us that it would allow us to follow a separate procedure for recruiting teachers. We have submitted a detailed proposal to the government in February, but its still sitting on it, alleged Mukhopadhyay.
																								The missionary schools are now allowed to appoint teachers on their own, but they have to follow a procedure fixed by the government. Also, the schools are required to take the governments consent to fill up any post.
																								The schools have been demanding that they be allowed to follow their own recruitment procedure, in accordance with the minority rights granted to them in the Constitution.
																								Herod Mullick, the general secretary of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, a forum of various bodies of the community, said the teachers being recruited to the missionary schools should adhere to certain philosophy and education policies.
																								We demand the right to test the ability of the teachers before recruiting them, but the procedure we follow does not allow us to conduct such tests, he added.
																								After several meetings with the schools, the government had promised last year that it would frame a recruitment policy soon. The schools, on their part, agreed to freeze recruitment till the policy is announced.
																								More than 1,000 teaching posts are lying vacant in our schools because the appointment has been stalled for over a year. This cannot continue any longer, said Mullick.

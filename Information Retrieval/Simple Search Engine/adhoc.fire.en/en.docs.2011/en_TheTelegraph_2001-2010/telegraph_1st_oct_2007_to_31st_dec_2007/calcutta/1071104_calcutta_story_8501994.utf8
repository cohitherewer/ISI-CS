				 Art of found linen
														 eyewitness			A work by Joy Bhaduri. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Joy Bhaduri is a self-proclaimed writer, poet, painter and musician holding an exhibition of his paintings at GC Laha Gallery on Chittaranjan Avenue, next to Coffee House. Bhaduri has not been formally trained in art. This notwithstanding, Bhaduris output is quite impressive, and he handles paint with equal competence in both the small and large frames.																								Curtains of light, snow-capped peaks, turbulent oceans and what resembles the Aurora Borealis appear in his non-figurative works. In one large work, the colours of the setting sun are spread across the expanse of the canvas, framed with jagged silhouettes. The only colours he uses are black and blue and occasionally red.																								In another set, patches of grey against a white background leap up like plumes of smoke and create pitted and craggy surfaces framed by a grid of black.			Paula Senguptas installation at Akar Prakar. Picture by Pabitra Das 				 				 				 		His pen-and-ink drawings of human figures  Lilliputian and Brobdingnagian  and the scrawls can lay claim to novelty. But his partridges in silhouette look hackneyed. 																								Most Indians hate to face the facts of history. It is a generally accepted fact that the city of Calcutta was a British creation, notwithstanding the small trading stations of local cotton merchants on the banks of the Hooghly. So the fortunes of the Bengalis depended a lot on their ability to curry favour with the British. Supposedly blue-blooded Bengalis often sided with the Brits, letting down their own flesh and blood, and thereafter their coffers swelled. And since imitation is the best form of flattery, many Bengalis chose to become more pucca than the Brits themselves.																								The West still colonises our minds and sensibilities, and although the British left India 60 years ago pucca lifestyles continue to thrive in certain pockets of the city. Paula Senguptas series of prints and art work concocted with found linen being exhibited at Akar Prakar is inspired by such an artificial lifestyle kept alive in a hothouse mothballed by etiquette and other such anachronistic niceties.																								Paula is best when she writes with gentle irony about the dos and donts for the women of such families  laying out a table for tea or dinner, swimming in a bathing suit, wearing high heels  any remunerative work meant strictly for the menfolk.																								Otherwise it is all satin, lace and crochet, pretty ribbons and bows and other feminine frippery, even so in the installations. Paula does not distance herself to regard this world with a wry eye. She is too awestruck to arrive at the truth.			A painting by Sekhar Roy			 		At her boldest when it comes to the nuptial bed, the arena of procreative activity, the installation is hung with paper curtains with perforations making shy references to the male and female genitalia. The installation adds up to little more.																								An exhibition of the paintings of Sekhar Roy and sculpture of Niranjan Pradhan opened at Aakriti Art Gallery on Saturday.																								Sekhar is a skilled painter with the ability to create a dreamlike mood by painstakingly applying thin layers of paint and creating realistic forms that soothe the eye. The colours are mainly grey and chrome yellow, and in this series he has created men on bicycles, a gentle mode of transport, male torsos, musicians, and beauties with haunting faces, one such with a mantilla drawn across her visage, Steichen-fashion. Little wonder his exhibitions are always such a hit.																								Pradhan is a senior sculptor adept at fashioning human forms. This is quite evident from his small bronze work of a windswept man, his scarf rising like a huge pair of wings attached to his arms.																								His skill is also quite evident from the goalkeeper with legs flying in the air, the ball held in the crook of his foot.																								Rahul Tarafder and Arunangshu Roy, who are young painters, and senior sculptor Sankar Ghosh are holding an exhibition at Birla Academy which ends on Sunday. Arunangshu is no doubt influenced by the German Expressionists but he seems to have a mind of his own, and this is clear from his male Chinnamasta, the beheaded man holding his own head. He uses the penis-pistol equation to great effect.																								Rahul is tamer, content with depicting ancient sculptures of deities photo-realistically. Sanker Ghoshs warped head of woman is an arresting piece of sculpture. 						SOUMITRA DAS

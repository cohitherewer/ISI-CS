				 Patient dies in hospital fall
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 65-year-old patient at Salt Lake sub-divisional hospital died on Sunday, allegedly after a fall while trying to escape from the hospital by climbing down a drainpipe. 																								The family members of Kapileswar Mondal, a private bus driver, denied that he was trying to flee the hospital. They alleged that police had refused to register a complaint against the authorities. 																								Mondal was admitted to the hospital on Saturday afternoon with complaints of chest pain and nausea. He responded well to the treatment. When we met him on Sunday morning, he said his health problems had subsided and that he would be released soon, said Bijoy, Kapileswars elder son. 																								An officer of Bidhannagar (north) police station called the Mondals at their Baguiati home around 4pm and told them that Kapileswar had died after falling while trying to climb down the drainpipe from the first floor.																								There was hardly any injury on my fathers body. He could not have fallen down. But the police station did not register our complaint, said Raju, Kapileswars younger son.																								The additional superintendent of Bidhannagar police said a case has been started on the basis of the hospital authorities complaint. 																								The authorities and the district chief medical officer maintained that Mondal had died in the fall.

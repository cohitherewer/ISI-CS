The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

				 Pure magic from stuff mundane
																								It may seem crazy to spend months planning, constructing and decorating for something so ephemeral as Durga puja, yet this isnt a phenomenon isolated to Calcutta. 																								All around the world, there are events in which communities come together and spend the better part of the year creating, with painstaking detail, costumes, floats and giant puppets that will only be viewed for a few days or a few hours.																								On Friday, as a judge for CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Award, I saw the wonderful creations of Durga puja firsthand. There were many aspects reminiscent of festivals in which I have participated, such as the carnival of Rio de Janeiro. The carnival also has religious roots (albeit of a different kind) and like Durga puja, has metamorphosed into a new existence with theme-based sambas. Every year, each group will write a new samba, which may exalt anything from the Amazon forest to Nelson Mandela.																								Similarly, on Friday, I was taken from rural Bengal to a mystical ship to a Mayan/ Incan temple.																								As a sculptor, I was particularly interested in the materials used. I was amazed by the wonders created with simple materials such as clay, straw, paint, bamboo and cloth.																								I was, however, disappointed to see more than one construction that used styrofoam (thermocol), a substance notoriously harmful to the environment. In transit, I noticed one pandal that was decorated with pen tops, which I thought was a fantastic idea, though I hope that these were used pens and not bought for the pandal!																								One thing that is amazing about community art is that the whole community can be involved. Earlier this year, I made several headpieces from plastic bottles. As soon as the community where I was working knew, I was flooded with materials that were free and that were not an extra strain on the environment.																								The most ecologically friendly puja I saw was the Naktala Udayan Sangha. Their use of bamboo, a renewable building resource, was simple but architecturally stunning.																								This, indeed, is the essence of enchantment in Durga puja  the way skilled human hands, along with time and patience, can transform simple (and hopefully eco-friendly) materials into a fantastic experience.

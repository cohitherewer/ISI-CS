Todi was earlier grilled on Thursday, six days after Riwanur was found dead on railway tracks near Bidhannagar.																								Todi was today asked to clarify the contradictions between his statements and those of two officers of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad.

Todi had alleged that Sadique had made threat calls to his family, said a sleuth.

He said he had gone to ARS to lodge a complaint of illegal confinement against Rizwanur and then met deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh and deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar. Today, we asked him to recall the sequence of his meetings with senior officers and what he discussed with them, the sleuth added.																								About the inconsistencies in the statements of the Todi brothers, another officer pointed out: Ashok told us that after Priyanka returned from her in-laws house on September 8, he spent a few days at his Salt Lake home and then went to South India. But his brother said Ashok had left the country on a business trip. Ashok was asked where exactly he was after his daughters return.																								Director-general of police A.B.

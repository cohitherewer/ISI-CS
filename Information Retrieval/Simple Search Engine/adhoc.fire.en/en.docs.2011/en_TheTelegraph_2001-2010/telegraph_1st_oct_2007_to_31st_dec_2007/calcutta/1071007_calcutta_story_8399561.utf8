				 Ready, steady, sail
														 Brinda Sarkar discovers a boat race that would have done Kerala proud mdash; just an hour away from Science City 				 	 The boat race on the Vidhyadhari. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha				 																								When you see the lush greens of Kulti, the clear blue water of the Vidyadhari and thousands of people cheering their favourite team in a boat race, you know that the hour-long drive from Science City was worth it. The event is a baichh race, named after the slender boats that are rowed across the Vidyadhari river, near Basanti highway. 																								To city-dwellers the race may look like a scene out of a Kerala tourism show on TV, but the people of Kulti and the Sunderbans know the competition dates back to the days of the British. The race is held every year around the time of Mansha (the snake goddess) puja, says Pintu Sardar, a waterman aboard one of the racing boats.																								This year the race is on September 19. Dum laga ke haiya, zor se taano bahiya! Pintu bellows to his boys as they row to the starting line. Soon the race has been declared open, the boatmen are rowing furiously and the commentator on the bank is screaming updates into his microphone. The spectators watch spellbound.																								When the race begins, the 12 competing boats are several feet away from one another but towards the end, the fastest few are found to be converging almost to a single point. Thats because the closer you are, the easier it is to gauge whos ahead or behind you, says Ohab Mullah, a member of the team that finished second  Bharater Yuva Federation.																								But if the boats came too close they could collide and topple. Thats why, besides the 20 rowers, theres always an extra team member. He sits on a higher level to get a clear view and uses his oar to maintain direction, explains Ohab. 																								The teams, all from villages in the area, must cross a 1.5 km stretch  from Kulti lock gate to Ghushighata Bazar. The river is crowded not just with competing boats. Also afloat are some 30 supporter-boats that have sailed down from the villages. The people on them sing, dance and chant their teams name, even as the commentator shouts into the microphone for them to steer clear of the race course. There must be over 50,000 people today, says assistant sub-inspector of police Bidyut Biswas, on duty controlling the crowds.																								The supporter-boats are also host to another competition being held alongside the race. Were performing dobai nach, our tribal dance, says Kali Sardar of a Sunderban village. The judges are watching us from the banks and awarding us marks. He is dressed in a womans ghagra choli and dancing to Daler Mehendi beats. Traditionally dobai nach is performed to the dhols music, but now with newer options available, we dance to any song. 																								A major draw for the participants is the prizes. Television sets for winners of the boat race and radio sets for winners of dobai, says Madan Mandal, secretary of the organising body that has been holding this competition for the last 15 years. This is the biggest festival of the region. 																								We will be putting up the TV at our club house for the whole village to watch, says Bapan Chakraborty, a member of the runner-up team in the boat race. He and his mates lift the TV on their shoulders and do a victory lap. And what will they watch on the new TV? Cricket, of course.																								Kamal Saha, who has come from Ballygunge to watch the race, however, says: Its a pity that sports such as rowing are not promoted as much as cricket. If this is being happening so close to the city, why would someone travel across the country to see it in Kerala?

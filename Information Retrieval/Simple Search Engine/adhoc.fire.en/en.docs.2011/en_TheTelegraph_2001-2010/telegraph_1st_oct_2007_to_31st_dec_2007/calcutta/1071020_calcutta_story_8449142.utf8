		 Autumn sonata																																	Nandikar presents Nana Ranger Din, a Bengali adaptation of Anton Chekhovs Swan Song , one of the finest plays in theatre history, where Chekhov draws on the eternal preoccupation with oblivion and mortality that the artist faces. The play opens dramatically with a dark stage in an empty theatre house. The show is long over and the silence is stifling and still. On the stage appears an ageing actor moving about like a ghost. He is attired in his actors clothes and carries a lighted candle in his hand. Though a little sleepy, he playfully and somewhat sentimentally recounts his life and offers the audience glimpses into his colourful, glorious past. This actors voice sometimes cracks and he pants and puffs. He betrays his fears of mortality and a decline in his own talent. Yet, while departing, his voice resonents the pervading atmosphere as he recites Othellos farewell speech, proving how his powerful histrionics have defeated the barriers of time and space. One cannot help recalling the famous pronouncement of Shakespeares Macbeth when he says that an actor is like a brief candle whose oblivion is imminent and inevitable. The play has been scripted in Bengali by Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay. The evening will also have a performance of Chokh Gyalo (direction: Goutam Halder).

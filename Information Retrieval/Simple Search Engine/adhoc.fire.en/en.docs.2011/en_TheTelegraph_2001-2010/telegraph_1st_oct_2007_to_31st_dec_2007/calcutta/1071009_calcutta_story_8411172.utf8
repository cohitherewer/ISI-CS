				 CBI probe opposed
 															- JUDICIAL PROBE DECKS CLEARED OUR BUREAU				 	 The room in Salt Lakes Jal Sampad Bhavan where retired judge Aloke Chakrabarti (inset) will conduct hearings is far from ready. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								Advocate-general Balai Ray on Monday opposed the prayer for a CBI probe into the death of Rizwanur Rahman but did not defend the four police officers accused of involvement in the case.																								In their petition, Rizwanurs mother and brother have blamed a few police officers for his death. The allegations may be true, partly true or false. Unless the court hears the lawyers of the accused, it is difficult to arrive at a decision, said the advocate-general in the high court, adding that he was not trying to defend anyone in particular. 																								He countered the Rahmans lawyer by saying: The apex court judgment on police interfering in the marriage of adults and action against accused officers is fine, but then the plea should be first filed in a magistrates court and not in the high court. 																								Referring to the FIR that Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur had lodged at Karaya police station, Ray said, It states that the death was unnatural. The police are yet to ascertain whether the death was a result of an accident, suicide or murder. Until it is proved that Rizwanur was murdered, how can the court ask the CBI to probe into the case?																								The hearing will continue on Tuesday.																								Judicial probe: As Ray made his point in court, retired judge Aloke Chakrabarti cleared the decks for the judicial probe on the 10th floor of Jal Sampad Bhavan, in Salt Lake. 																								My first task will be to hear what people have to say in connection with the case. They should ideally come with documents. The depositions will continue till October 31 and the hearing will begin the day after, he said. 																								A notice inviting depositions will appear in newspapers on October 10, said an insider. 																								Amnesty plea: Amnesty International India has written to the chief minister, urging him to make the terms of reference of the inquiry and its report public, ensure that it complies with UN principles, assure people of prosecution of guilty public servants and provide compensation to the Rahmans.

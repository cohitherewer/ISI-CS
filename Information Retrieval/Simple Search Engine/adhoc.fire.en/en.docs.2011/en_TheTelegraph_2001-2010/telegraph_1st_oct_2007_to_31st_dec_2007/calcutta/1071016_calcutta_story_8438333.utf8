				 Stable but fever persists
 A STAFF REPORTER			Suchitra Sen: Still too early to go home		The condition of Suchitra Sen, who was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic last Tuesday with prolonged high fever, showed signs of improvement on Monday.																								The screen legend, who has shunned the public eye for three decades, skipped dinner on Sunday as she was running a temperature of 101 degrees, but she felt much better in the morning, with the temperature dropping to below 100 degrees.																								The official medical bulletin for the day read: Suchitra Sens condition remains stable. Fever is continuing with some improvement in food intake. Range of temperature is less than before, since last night.																								Dr K.B. Bakshi, who has been monitoring Sens condition along with Dr Swapan Pal and Dr S.K. Biswas, said it was too early to decide when she would be able to return home.																								She had breakfast and her food intake showed signs of improvement on Monday. People with urinary tract infection often have fever for months and in her case, it has been aggravated by age. Until the fever is controlled, she will remain under observation at the clinic, said Bakshi.																								Sens younger grand-daughter Riya visited her on Monday morning and stayed on till the afternoon. She later left with mother Moon Moon.																								She has made her position about maintaining her privacy quite clear and we must respect her decision, said Pradip Tondon, the CEO of Belle Vue Clinic.																								Sources at the clinic confirmed that her prolonged illness and the antibiotics had left Suchitra Sen weak and confined to the bed.

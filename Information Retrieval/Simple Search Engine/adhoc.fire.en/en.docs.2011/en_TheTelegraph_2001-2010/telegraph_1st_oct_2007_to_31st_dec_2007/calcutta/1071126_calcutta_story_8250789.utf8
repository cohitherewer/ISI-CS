				 Voter cards riddled with mistakes
 																											- Mominpore residents refuse to accept poll panel document A STAFF REPORTER																								Mohammad Ismail got his voters identity card on Thursday. He could hardly recognise it as his own because most of the personal information on the card is wrong.																								He is not the only one facing the problem. More than 6,000 residents of Mominpore  from part Nos. 118, 119, 120, 121 and 122 of Kabitirtha Assembly constituency  have received voters identity cards riddled with errors. 																								The date of birth of the voter is missing from all the cards and in most cards, the road names in the address have been misspelt. The pin code on the cards, too, is wrong  it should be 700027 but is 700023.																								Residents of the area noticed the mistakes while the cards were being distributed from Kidderpore Milani High School on Thursday. They gheraoed the election commission officials.																								The voters identity card is such an important document. One requires it for all government work. How can the election commission be so callous in handling it? If we are saddled with an erroneous voters identity card, we will face problems in getting a passport made or opening a bank account, said Ismail.																								The residents of the area have refused to receive their voters identity cards. The cards are lying with the election commission officials.																								There was a minor mistake in my original voters identity card, so I had applied for a corrected one. But why should I take a document full of errors by giving up one that has more correct information about me? asked Mohammad Tamsil, another resident of the area.																								The election commission officials said they had informed their superiors about the matter. We got in touch with our bosses as soon as the discrepancies were pointed out. The local residents are angry about the mistakes, said an election commission official.																								The poll panel has issued two cards each against the names of some voters. A local Trinamul Congress leader said he was worried that the extra cards might be misused.

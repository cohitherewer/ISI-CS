				 Doctors acquitted of death charge
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The national consumers commission has acquitted two city doctors pronounced guilty by the state panel for causing a patients death by negligence.																								Gynaecologist Biswanath Das and anaesthetist Dhiraj Chakraborty were asked to pay Rs 3 lakh and Rs 2 lakh, respectively, to the family of Bani Sinha Roy, who had died after undergoing a hysterectomy. The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission had given the order on a petition by Banis husband Bijoy Sinha Roy.																								K.S. Gupta, the presiding member of the national commission, ruled that the state panel had erred by not considering the opinion of medical experts before convicting the duo.																								Bani was referred to Das by her family physician after she developed menstrual problems in June 1993. Tests revealed multiple fibroids in the uterus. Bani, who was suffering from a high blood pressure and a low haemoglobin level, was advised a hysterectomy, but she did not go for it immediately.																								Five months later, she suddenly started bleeding ceaselessly. She again went to Das, who admitted her to a nursing home on November 30. The next day, she underwent the surgery.																								But Bani did not regain consciousness and was shifted to the intensive care unit of another nursing home. The woman slipped into a coma and was finally admitted to SSKM Hospital, where she died on January 27, 1994.																								The state commission had said in its ruling that Banis blood pressure was abnormally high when she was taken to the operating theatre and the doctors did nothing to bring it down.																								But medical expert S.M. Basu had opined before the panel that though Banis blood pressure was above the danger level, it was brought below the permissible limit before the surgery.																								Medical literature shows that surgery could be done on a patient with diastolic pressure up to 110 mm Hg, Gupta observed. Banis blood pressure was below that level.

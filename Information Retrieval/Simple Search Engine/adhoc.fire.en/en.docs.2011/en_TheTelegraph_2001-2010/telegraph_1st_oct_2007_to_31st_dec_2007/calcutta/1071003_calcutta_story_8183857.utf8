				 Canine care lacking
 															- Experts call for advanced vet hospital  JULIUS GOMES																								Ginger, a male Golden Retriever, became a show champion when it was 10 months old. When it was 10 years old, it suffered renal failure and due to a lack of proper treatment facilities, died six months later.																								Rex, a male German Shepherd, was also a show champion in its youth. Now, aged nine years, it can barely move because of osteo-arthritis.																								Reputed veterinarians treated both these dogs, but a lack of proper pet care infrastructure came in their way of curing the ailments.																								Calcutta badly needs a well-equipped vet hospital that will be open round-the-clock, said professor Dipak Kumar De, of the surgery department of the West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences.																								State-run hospitals and organisations work from 10am to 5pm. Private organisations dont make house calls in the morning or at night. Moreover, busy vets hardly make house calls, he added.																								In terms of pet care infrastructure, Calcutta is 50 years behind western countries, said Snehasish Banerjee, of Compassionate Crusaders for Animals, which works with People For Animals.																								Renal or kidney failure is common among geriatric dogs and its cure is haemo-dialysis, which requires advanced infrastructure that in India is available only in Chennai. There is very little we can do except cleaning the anal gland, where the toxins accumulate. But because of a lack of awareness, it is often too late to save the dog, he added.																								Veterinarian Goutam Mukherjee said uterine infections, common among bitches that have not mated, can be fatal if not detected early. Mammary tumours, half of which are cancerous, are also common.																								Arthritis is common among dogs and can lead to paralysis. The affected dog is put to sleep 30 per cent of the time or administered drugs that extend its life by a few months.																								The relationship between the pet and its owner plays a vital role, and one should always look out for behavioural changes in the pet, said Gopal Samanta, a veterinary surgeon attached to Alipore zoo. Monthly check-ups are a must.																								Dogs of any age that are anaemic or may have had an accident and require immediate blood transfusion hardly have any chance of survival  there is no animal blood bank in India. 																								It is difficult to find donors, and an even more difficult task convincing owners to help, said a vet.

				 City lags in water supply
 															- Report rap from ADB A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta is the worst performer among the four metros in water supply, a report of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has revealed.																								The city lags behind Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore in service coverage, prevention of leaks from pipes, average salary to the top three civic officials managing the sector, operating ratio (expenditure divided by revenue) and revenue-collection efficiency.																								The objective of the study is to prepare a data book on the status of filtered water supply in 20 cities selected for infrastructure upgrade under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. Our aim is to ensure 24x7 water supply to everyone, especially the urban poor, said mission director M. Rajamani.																								The study  financed by Norway and the Netherlands  was carried out following an agreement between the Manila-based ADB and the Union government.																								The report, published in October, states that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has failed to bring all households and commercial establishments within the supply network. Far from adding to the coffers, filtered water supply actually drains out civic resources (revenue collection has been pegged at 98 per cent).																								The other metros not only ensure 100 per cent collection but are taking steps to realise previous years dues  resulting in revenue collection ranging from 120 to 189 per cent. Besides, unlike Calcutta, where only commercial establishments are taxed for water, the other metros have brought domestic consumers, too, within the ambit.																								ADB experts have pointed out that people in Calcutta are exposed to health hazards in the absence of round-the-clock water supply. The CMC supplies water for 8.3 hours, divided into three slots. Stoppage in the supply leads to contamination of water in the pipes.																								Intermittent supply is also responsible for misuse of water at the cost of the poor, who cannot afford to store water. The report has stressed the need to instal water meters to facilitate realisation of the national goal of introduction of 24x7 water supply in the next five years.																								Reacting to the report, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: We cannot be ruthless in collecting water tax from the poor. A comparative analysis is not enough to rate the CMCs performance. Unlike other metros, Calcutta has to make provisions for a large number of uprooted people.

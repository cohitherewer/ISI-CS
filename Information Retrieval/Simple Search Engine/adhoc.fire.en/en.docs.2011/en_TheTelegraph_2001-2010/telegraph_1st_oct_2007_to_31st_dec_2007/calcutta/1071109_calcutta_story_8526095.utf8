				 Diwali prod for the odds
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 In the betting circuit, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the clear favourite to lead Team India, with former skipper Sourav Ganguly being given an outside chance																								The second ODI between India and Pakistan in Mohali could not have come at a more opportune moment for bookies.																								With Diwali on Friday, its time for fortune-seekers to place a bet on the outcome of the match and check out whether Lady Luck smiles on them.																								The Burrabazar betting circuit was abuzz on Thursday afternoon. An India-Pakistan encounter sees more bets than any other match. And Diwali is an occasion when people involve in various activities invoking Lakshmi. No wonder, the ODI on Diwali-eve has left us working overtime, said a bookie, moments before the Mohali match started.																								Among those placing the bets were several first-timers. Diwali is the time to worship the goddess of wealth. If you make some money during Diwali, you can be sure that the goddess will shower her blessings on you in the coming year, said Yash, 19, after placing his first bet in life.																								Dhonis boys were the clear favourite before the match began. The odds in favour of India were 81 paise and in favour of Pakistan, Rs 1.15  so, a wager of Re 1 on an Indian win would fetch Rs 1.81, while that on a Pakistani victory would fetch Rs 2.15																								India has defeated Pakistan thrice in less than three months. They are the favourite in the books, too, said a bookie. 																								Though the one-dayer was the primary concern of those involved in the trade, there were a few who placed bets on who would be the next captain of the Indian squad.																								Several names have been doing the rounds after Sachin Tendulkar declined the job, but, again, Dhoni is the favourite. The odds in his favour are 30 paise. Another contender is Sourav Ganguly, the odds stacked in his favour being 95 paise.																								Police, however, are not so amused with the spurt in the illegal activity on Diwali eve. We have deployed our men in Burrabazar, Posta and other areas where betting is taking place. We are taking all steps to stop betting, said an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad.

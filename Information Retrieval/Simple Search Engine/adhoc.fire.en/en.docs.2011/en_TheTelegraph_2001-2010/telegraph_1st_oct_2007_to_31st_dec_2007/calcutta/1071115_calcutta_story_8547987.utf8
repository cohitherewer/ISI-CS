				 Civic body goes online to shop
 DEEPANKAR GANGULYThe Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to accept online bids from companies to make the process of procuring goods more transparent. 																								E-tendering will allow companies from across the country to supply goods to the civic body. The civic top brass believes that the process will eliminate middlemen and make it difficult for companies to quote their price in collusion. 																								The CMC spends Rs 110 crore per year to procure brooms, bleaching powder, pens, stamp pads, bulbs, spades, anti-larvae chemical, bitumen, diesel, petrol and other articles.																								Only empanelled companies can supply motor parts now. Bitumen, petrol and diesel are purchased from Indian Oil Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum. Bleaching powder comes from Durgapur Chemicals and Kanoria Chemicals of Gorakhpur.																								For other items, bids are invited from companies through advertisements in newspapers. The companies that quote the lowest prices are generally asked to supply the goods. Some of the firms supply through middlemen in Calcutta. In most cases, the private suppliers quote prices in collusion.																								The so-called lowest prices at which the CMC procures goods are not actually the lowest price. Often, the price in the open market is lower, said a civic accounts official. 																								According to an estimate, the civic bill for procurement, about Rs 110 crore per year, can be cut by Rs 15 crore if the process is made transparent.																								I hope e-tendering will make the procurement procedure more transparent. Because of increased competition, the CMC will be able to procure better material at cheaper rates, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. 																								The recently appointed joint municipal commissioner, Aswini Yadav, convened a meeting with the officers of the central stores and the accounts department on Wednesday to discuss the modalities of e-tendering. 																								The CMC will soon procure 2,400 quintals of broom, about 3,000 quintals of bleaching powder and over 15,000 spades.

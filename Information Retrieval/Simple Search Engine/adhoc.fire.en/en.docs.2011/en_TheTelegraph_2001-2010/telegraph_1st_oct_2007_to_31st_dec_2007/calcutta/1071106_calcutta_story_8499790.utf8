				 Students chase dreams, not jobs
 															- Entrepreneurial bug bites managers and engineers in the making CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE																								Managers and engineers in the making are chucking big bucks to chase their dreams. 																								Jaydeep Mandal is an example. The fourth-year student of JIS Engineering College, in Kalyani, has launched Sarvodaya  AloeWorld to cultivate, process and market aloe vera plants on plots that are otherwise unutilised. 																								Last year, we started aloe vera cultivation in Murshidabad and Purulia. Now is the time to harvest and take the project to the next level, said Mandal, who wants to market processed aloe vera to medical and cosmetics companies. 																								He has applied to register Sarvodaya as a society and plans to convert it into a company. Mandal is busy trying to raise funds  Rs 5 lakh for starters  to set up a processing unit for the project. I want to do something on my own, says the 22-year-old boy, the first in the family of servicemen to plan a business venture. 																								The entrepreneurial bug has bitten students across campuses. Five students of Vinod Gupta School of Management, IIT Kharagpur, are four months into their first entrepreneurial venture, WebVastra. The e-store run by Dharamveer Arora, Ashutosh Chouksey, Amit Joshi, Nishank Agrawal and S. Santhosh Kumar sells customised T-shirts. 																								We worked on a few T-shirts. They were a hit and we started the venture, said Santosh. According to the second-year student, the venture is an excellent opportunity for training in the basics of marketing, finance and strategic management. 																								While the number of campus start-ups is still low, the desire to roll out ones own business is fast catching up among students. I know students who have a clear-cut plan. They are working in companies for a couple of years. But finally, they will go on their own, said Ishita Dutta Roy, a professor at Eastern Institute for Integrated Learning in Management (EIILM) and faculty leader of National Entrepreneurship Network. 																								The non-profit initiative, promoted by Wadhwani Foundation, is aiming to churn out entrepreneurs from college campuses across the country. 																								Sumana Nandan, Pradeep Shaw, Vipin Singh and Vikash Shah of EIILM hit upon the idea of opening a retail outlet during a tea-stall adda session. They are ready with a business plan and have even identified a plot, but are biding time. A booming economy, new opportunities and success stories are helping these students explore beyond the traditional wisdom, summed up Dutta Roy.

				 New-age ship for patrol
 															- HIGH-SPEED CRAFT DEBUT A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The INS Chetlat sets off from Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers dock on Tuesday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								Water jet fast attack craft INS Chetlat was launched in the city on Tuesday at the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Limited (GRSE).																								The high-speed ship will stay close to the coastline and be used mainly for patrolling and rescue operations, said navy officers. The vessel  launched by Beena Suthan, the wife of vice-admiral R.P. Suthan  has been named after the northern-most island of Lakshwadeep.																								This is the second in a series of 10 water jet fast attack craft of the Indian Navy being built at GRSE. The first ship  INS Carnicobar was launched on November 23.																								The ships can attain speed up to 35 knots and are ideal for patrol and rescue. India has a long coastline that needs to be closely monitored, said Rear Admiral T.S. Ganeshan, the chairman and managing director of GRSE.																								The new ships are different from the conventional propeller-based craft, 37 of which are with the navy and the Coast Guard, said a GRSE official. They have a water jet unit coupled with three latest-generation engines, capable of producing 8,160 kw (11,238 hp) of power.																								INS Chetlat has modern weaponry and communications systems and an indigenously developed 30-mm gun on the forepeak, said Rear Admiral Ganeshan. The ships have submarine warfare capability and are not vulnerable themselves.																								The 80-year-old main unit of GRSE, where the launch was held, will soon be dismantled for modernisation under a Rs 400-crore plan.

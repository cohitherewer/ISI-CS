 															- Solution to declining aquifer level DEEPANKAR GANGULYThe civic authorities are planning to popularise the use of sub-soil water, encouraged by a clinical study that found the quality of the water better than what is found in the aquifer.																								The civic planners think the use of sub-soil water  trapped in the upper-most layers of porous alluvial soil  will prove to be an effective solution to the problem of declining levels of water in the aquifer (a body of permeable rock than can hold or transmit water).																								The aquifer is at 700-1,000 ft below the surface, while the sub-soil water can be extracted at 40 ft. Unlike aquifer water that can be drawn through deep tubewells, a shallow well has to be dug to access sub-soil water.																								Sub-soil water will be most helpful for the people of east Calcutta, Behala and Jadavpur, where new settlements are coming up in large numbers despite a lack of piped-water network.																								Civic chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Kumar Maity in a report handed over to municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said over 20 million gallons of sub-soil water can be drawn daily  enough to meet the need of potable water of over 50,000 households.																								The water supply department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), for the first time, carried out tests on sub-soil water and contrary to the popular belief, found it to be better than the water found in the aquifer. The samples were drawn from 12 pockets.																								Till the report came in, we thought sub-soil water was unfit for domestic use because of hardness, salinity and high concentration of suspended solid particles. There was also the risk of contamination. But the test proved us wrong. Even faecal coliform count was zero in sub-soil water, said Maity.																								An official said the level of aquifer water, used mostly by residential estates, is going down alarmingly  nine metres over the past 40 years. In the Park Street area, it has gone down by nine metres; seven-eight metres in the Fort William area; six-seven metres in the Sealdah-Shyambazar area; and two-three metres in the Garden Reach area. Over 100 million gallons of aquifer water are being drawn daily through deep tubewells.

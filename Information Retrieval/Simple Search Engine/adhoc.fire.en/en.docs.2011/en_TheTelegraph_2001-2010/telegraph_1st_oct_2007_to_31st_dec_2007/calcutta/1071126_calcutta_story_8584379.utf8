				 Packs lighter than printed weight
 															- SEVEN BISCUIT BRANDS PENALISED SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE				 	 LIGHTWEIGHT: Footballer Bhaichung Bhutia shoots on a Calcutta street for an ad film for a local biscuit company. Raids show that at least seven biscuit-makers have been selling underweight packs. A Telegraph picture																								Check the weight when you buy your pack of biscuits.																								Raids by the legal metrology section of the state consumer affairs and fair business practices department has revealed that most biscuit brands are selling items that weigh less than the weight printed on the packets.																								Seven brands, excluding Britannia and Bisk Farm, have been found to be selling products weighing 10-20 per cent less than the printed figures. They have been fined for violation of the packaged commodities act, said K.N. Behera, the secretary of the consumer affairs department.																								Priya biscuit, the worst offender, was fined Rs 20,000. The other brands penalised are Anmol, A1, Sona and Raja, he added.																								The raids were conducted repeatedly on the godowns of the biscuit companies over the past two months. 																								The biscuit companies, however, have their own explanation for the underweight packs.																								In packaged products, its technically impossible to provide the weight printed on the packet. The weight often varies because of differences in the baking process. But we have instructed our technicians to ensure that the customers are not cheated, said Sujit Sen, general manager, Raja biscuits.																								P.C. Tibrewal, a spokesperson for Anmol biscuits iterated the technical reason for the reduction in weight. We will ensure that such reduction do not take place. 																								The authorities of Priya biscuits refused to comment.																								An official in the state consumer affairs and fair business practices department said the raids could book so many companies as they were carried out simultaneously.																								The earlier practice was to conduct raids in phases. As a result, the companies that were not covered in the first phase had the opportunity to take back the faulty products.																								But the simultaneous raids on the godowns of the biscuit factories ruled out that possibility, said an official of the department.

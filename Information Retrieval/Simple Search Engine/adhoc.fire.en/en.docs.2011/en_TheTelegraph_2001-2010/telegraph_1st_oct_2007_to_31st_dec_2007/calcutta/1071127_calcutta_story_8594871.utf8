				 Part I performance takes a beating
 															- Percentage drops, university officials blame changes in exam system A STAFF REPORTER																								The pass percentage in Calcutta Universitys BA and B.Sc Part I (honours) examinations has dropped sharply. The results of the examinations, along with those for BA and B.Sc Part II examinations, were declared on Monday. 																								The pass percentage in BA and B.Sc Part I (honours), under the 1+1+1 system, is 75.69 per cent and 69.5 per cent, respectively. The corresponding figures last year were 90 per cent and 92 per cent, respectively. 																								University officials said they were disappointed with the performance. According to them, changes introduced in the examination system last year contributed to the drop in marks. 																								In the new system, students have to study two honours papers and two elective papers for Part I. In 2006, the students had to study four elective papers for the examinations. 																								We have to find out whether students are finding it difficult to study two honours papers of 100 marks each for Part I. If necessary, we have to fine-tune the syllabus and the questions to ensure better performance, said Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of the university.																								The authorities, however, ruled out a return to the old system because universities across the country teach two honours papers in the first year.																								The pass percentage in BA and B.Sc Part II (honours) is 85.24 per cent and 80.52 per cent, respectively. This years batch was the first to appear in the examinations. Das expressed satisfaction with its performance.																								The pass percentage in B.Sc (Part I and Part II) this year is lower than that in BA (Part I and Part II). University officials attributed this trend to the best science students joining engineering and medical courses after Class XII.																								Girls have outshone boys in all the examinations. In BA and B.Sc Part I (honours), the pass percentage among girls is 78.69 and 75 per cent, respectively. The pass percentage of boys is 70.4 and 64.14 per cent, respectively.																								In BA and B.Sc Part II (honours), the pass percentage of girls is 87.04 and 84.07 per cent, respectively. The pass percentage of boys in the examinations is 81.56 and 76.26 per cent, respectively.

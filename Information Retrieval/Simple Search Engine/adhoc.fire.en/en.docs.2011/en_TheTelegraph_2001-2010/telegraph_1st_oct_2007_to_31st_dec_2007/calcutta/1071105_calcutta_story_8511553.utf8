				 Rotting body in house
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The decomposed body of a 31-year-old businessman from Nagaland was found in a house in Regent Park, on the southern fringes, on Sunday afternoon.																								The deceased was identified as Thumpa Singh. We have sent the body for post-mortem to ascertain the cause and time of death. We will contact our counterparts in Nagaland to inform Singhs family members, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar. 																								Residents of Metal Box Housing Complex had alerted the police after a stench started emanating from a house. Residents of the area said the odour was strong even 50 metres from the house.																								Officers of Regent Park police station found out that the smell was coming from inside the house and broke open the door on Sunday afternoon.																								Singhs decomposed body was found inside. According to the police, the businessman had died at least 48 hours ago. Several empty bottles of alcohol were found in the house. There was no suicide note.																								There is no indication of foul play but we are not ruling out anything till the post-mortem report arrives, said Kumar. Singh had been staying in the house since September. He generally kept to himself, the house-owner told police. He paid the rent regularly and there were no complaints against him.																								The police are trying to find out if anyone had visited Singh recently. We will provide the particulars of the businessman to Nagaland police and request for information on people who had gone missing there, said a senior officer.

		 The Mahatmas talisman																																	Power of Non-Violence: Goutam Buddha to Gandhi, a seminar organised by the Calcutta chapter of Gandhi Peace Foundation, is an attempt to chart the contribution of the Mahatma to Indias Freedom Movement and to highlight the unique way in which he set out to acheive his goals. It was Gandhi who gave the concept of non-violence a real, tangible identity. When the nation was reeling under the onslaught of mindless violence, the Mahatma gave to the people the talisman that was morally far superior to any other. Though the younger generation of freedom fighters regarded this as a sign of meek submission unto a cruel regime, Gandhi defended his ideals, saying that such a course of action required utmost moral strength and resolve. He drew inspiration from great men like Buddha, Imam Hussain and Jesus Christ, preaching people to turn the other cheek and tire their interlocutors till they had no more means of dealing out injustice. His acheivement inspired leaders like Martin Luther King Jr, who fought for and won the struggle for the rights of the black people in America. The fact of Indias freedom is proof that it does not require artillery to win a battle; all it takes is belief. Speaker: Professor (Dr) Tapas Basu.

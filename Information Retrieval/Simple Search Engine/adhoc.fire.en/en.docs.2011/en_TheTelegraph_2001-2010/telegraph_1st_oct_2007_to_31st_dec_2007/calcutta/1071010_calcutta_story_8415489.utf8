				 Stay in custody tussle
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A petition was moved in the high court on Tuesday, seeking an order preventing an elderly couple  Kaushal and Surekha Srivastav  from meeting their grandchildren. The plea was moved by the couples daughter and son-in-law, Paramita and Dipankar Sarkar.																								The Sarkars claimed that the Srivastavs are trying to break up their family by interacting with their three children. The elderly couple have also been accused of trying to snatch the children.																								Srivastav is a doctor, while Dipankar runs a business.																								Appearing for the petitioners, advocate Subrata Mukhopadhyaya prayed for a stay on an Alipore court order which allowed the Srivastavs to meet Aditya, the Sarkars eldest son, during the lunch break of his school and the other two children any time at their Naktala home.																								Justice Indira Banerjee of the high court stayed the Alipore court order and fixed October 15 as the next date of hearing. The judge also asked the petitioners to serve a notice on the Srivastavs.																								The lawyer alleged that ever since Dipankar refused his in-laws offer to stay in their Jadavpur home, the Srivastavs have been creating problems in the couples family. Mukhopadhyaya alleged that the Srivastavs are trying to keep the grandchildren with them, in the hope that their daughter and son-in-law will come to their house.																								They are demanding the childrens custody, claiming that they would be able to raise them better than the Sarkars. But my clients are the natural guardians of the children. Why will they allow the Srivastavs to take them away? asked the lawyer.

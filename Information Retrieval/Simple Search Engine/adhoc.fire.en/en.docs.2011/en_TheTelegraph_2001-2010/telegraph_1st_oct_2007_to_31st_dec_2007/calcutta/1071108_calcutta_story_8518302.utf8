				 Nine-day book bonanza for kids
 SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 A book fair awaits children next week. A Telegraph picture																								Children can look forward to a gift of books this Bhai Phota. A nine-day book fair will be camping on Park Circus Maidan from November 10.																								The National Children and Youth Book Fair is being organised by National Book Trust (NBT), in association with Publishers and Booksellers Guild, as part of NBTs golden jubilee celebrations. The duration of the fair includes Childrens Day, the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru.																								More than 200 publishers will take part in the fair, including vernacular language publishers from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Maharashtra, says NBT director Nuzhat Hassan, who has flown down from Delhi.																								The central government-backed publisher had last held fairs in the city in 1983 and 1995. We hope to make this an annual affair. Children need to be supplied with books, Hassan added.																								Entry to the fair will be free. The inauguration will be by author Sunil Gangopadhyay, in the presence of Calcutta University vice-chancellor Asis Banerjee and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. Children will be kept occupied through a bouquet of activities, like sit-and-draw, book quiz, marathon story-telling and poster-writing.																								The Youth Pavilion will host a quiz on the year 1857, a Youth for Peace Convention, a Youth Artist Camp where local artists can participate, a Young Parliamentarian Meet and an exhibition prepared by young artists. Readers can also meet young authors there.																								The fair will serve as a platform for interaction among authors, translators, publishers and booksellers. There will be a Rights Hall, which will display titles of Indian languages meant for sale of translation rights.																								We talk in terms of number of copies sold when we talk of book commerce. In the West, rights are sold from one language to another. We are lagging behind in this regard. How many books are translated from, say, Malayalam to Bengali? Hassan points out. 																								A panel discussion on translation rights will take place on November 14 to bring local publishers up to date with trends and laws. A clutch of childrens books will be released by Mahasveta Devi, in the presence of authors Shirshendu Mukherjee and Sanjeeb Chattopadhyay. 																								Adults will not be left out, either. The Bengali translation of Premchands novel Rangbhumi will be launched. Also to be released is the Bengali edition of the Employment Guarantee Act that the NBT is translating in various Indian languages.

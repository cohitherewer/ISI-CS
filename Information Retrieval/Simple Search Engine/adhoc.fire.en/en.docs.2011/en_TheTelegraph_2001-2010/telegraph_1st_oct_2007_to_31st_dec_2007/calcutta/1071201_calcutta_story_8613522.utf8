				 Sister, husband held for newly-wed death
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rathindranath Mukherjee and Sera Sanyals sister Suparna. Pictures by Gopal Senapati																								The post-mortem on Sera Sanyals body revealed that she had been killed, prompting police to round up her elder sister and brother-in-law. Suparna and Rathindranath Mukherjee have been remanded in police custody for 10 days.																								Sera, 26, was found dead at her parents home in 22/11 Choudhurypara First Bylane, Shibpur, on Wednesday, a week after her marriage.																								The post-mortem revealed that the girl had been strangled, said Neeraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of police (Howrah). There were three other persons in the Shibpur house on the night Sera was killed  Rathindranath, Suparna and Seras mother Krishna. A murder case has been started against Rathindranath and Suparna.																								Seras husband Pratap Bhattacharya and his brother Prabhat were earlier arrested on a complaint from Krishna that torture at the in-laws house had driven her daughter to suicide.																								Rathindranath killed Sera, as he wanted to usurp the property of the Sanyals. And there is every reason to believe that Suparna was aware of her husbands gameplan, said an investigating officer.																								One of the collarbones of the girl was broken. There were acid burns on the face and the chest, though no trace of acid could be found in the stomach. Someone must have tried to force acid down her throat. Seras tattered blouse indicates she had put up a fight against the killer, the officer added.																								Two bottles  one containing acid and another poison  were found beside Seras body. Krishna reportedly told the police that the poison had been bought for killing rats, but had no clue about the acid.																								The police also seized a basin with blood stains from the Sanyal household. It will be sent for a forensic test, the officer said.																								Rathindranath had been staying at the Sanyals home since his marriage in 2003. A relative said he had assumed the role of family head after the death of Krishnas husband Bishnuprasad Sanyal five years ago.																								Anupam Ghosh, a neighbour of the Sanyals, said: Rathindranath had cheated several people in the locality. We did not interact with him.																								According to neighbours, Krishna had handed over Rs 3 lakh to Rathindranath as expenses for Seras wedding. But he allegedly pocketed most of money.

				 Redesign key to rainwater woes
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY			DRAINAGE DEFICIENCY: A waterlogged street of Calcutta. A Telegraph pictureThe only lasting solution to the citys perennial waterlogging problem lies in redesigning the drainage system and augmenting its capacity, feels the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.																								The citys drainage network can handle up to 200 mm of rain a year  the same as in 1859, when the pipes were laid. But the city, on an average, receives around 2,000 mm of rain annually.																								We need to redesign the drainage system and augment its capacity, right from the conduits of individual buildings to the Vidyadhari river, where the water is discharged, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.																								A survey is on for the redesigning work on the basis of actual rainfall in a year and the maximum intensity of downpour in an hour over the past 10 years. A foreign consultancy firm is carrying out the survey, he added.																								Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the citys drainage system  designed by William Clark, an engineer  was laid in 1859. Calcutta was then spread across 18.46 sq km, with a population of five lakh.																								Under Clarks scheme, 48.3 km of brick sewers and 128 km of branch pipe sewers were laid across the city at a cost of Rs 34 lakh. The sewers could drain out up to 200 mm of annual rainfall.																								After 148 years, the city is spread across 185.39 sq km and its population is over five million. The brick sewers now extend up to 80 km and the pipe sewers up to 1,200 km. But the drainage capacity remains the same, resulting in frequent waterlogging.																								During monsoon, the city at times receives 200 mm of rain in a span of two to three days. Then why did the British design a system that could handle only 200 mm of rain in a year?																								Civic chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) Tushar Ghosh pointed out that the city was much smaller in 1839 and was surrounded by several deserted low-lying pockets.																								The bulk of sewage and rainwater would gravitate towards the low-lying areas. To drain out the the rest, equivalent to 200 mm of rainfall a year, they had laid the pipes.																								But the citys expansion has led to a shrinkage of the low-lying pockets, which have been converted into residential areas. Along with it, the sewers and outflow channels have been clogged with silt.																								Both have led to increased accumulation of run-off water in the city. The only hope is in redesigning the drainage system, said commissioner Bandyopadhyay.

				 CU students in the lurch
 MITA MUKHERJEE																								Three months have passed since 15 students took admission in the masters in computer application (MCA) course run by Calcutta University. 																								But the students  unlike their counterparts in other universities in the state  are yet to attend a single lecture in the three-year postgraduate programme.																								Our friends in other universities are nearing completion of the first semester. But we havent had a single class, said an aggrieved student of the 2007-2010 batch, who is shelling out Rs 3,000 as tuition fee every month.																								According to him, the delay would affect his academic career.																								The state joint entrance examination board conducts a common admission test and prepares a merit list on the basis of the students scores.																								The list is then sent to universities which offer MCA courses. Depending on the merit list, students gain admission to universities. 																								Calcutta University, along with Jadavpur University, Bengal Engineering and Science University and West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT), received the merit list from the board in July. 																								It is strange that classes have not started yet. We dont have a clue about when they will begin, said one of the 15 students. 																								The university officials acknowledge the delay, but say they have their own reasons.																								We have 40 seats, but till now, there are only 15 students on the rolls. We are conducting a separate entrance examination to fill up the remaining seats, explained Shyamal Sarkar, the science secretary of Calcutta University.																								According to Sarkar, the authorities have called a group of students for an interview on November 7 to fill up the 25 vacant seats.																								Even if admission formalities for the new set of students are put on the fast track, it will take at least three weeks to start the course. By then, the first semester examination will be over at WBUT, said a student, adding that had the university planned the examination in advance, the delay could have been avoided.																								Not just the delay in starting the course, some teachers are also concerned about the lack of interest in joining the varsitys MCA programme. We must have a re-look at the existing system to attract the best students to our course, said a faculty member.

				 Curfew cloud on Cinderella site
 															- Bright bustle replaced by shadowy silence on fun-and-food Park Street A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Dark, desolate and deserted Park Street on Wednesday night. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Fun street turned into fear street on Wednesday night. By 9.30pm, a shadowy silence replaced the usual bright bustle of Park Street. The food zone bordering the curfew pockets was deserted.																								We know this stretch is not under curfew, but why take a chance? I have never seen curfew in Calcutta; we want to be back home fast, said Malini and Pankaj Gupta, after a rushed dinner.																								The hands of the watch showed 9.45pm. Time for 23-year-old Aditi Chatterjee and her friends to hurry home after attending a function at Park Hotel. We are a little scared and so we want to get out of this area before 10pm, said Aditi.																								The Chowringhee end of Park Street was not under curfew, but restaurants, coffee shops, magazine stalls and paan shops were not taking a chance  all shutters were downed well before 10pm. People are scared. We had just four diners all evening and none after 8.30pm. On any given Wednesday evening, we get at least 70 people. And my staff members requested me to close early just like all other restaurants, said Rajesh Gupta of Gupta Brothers on Free School Street. Gupta was echoed by a paanwallah, seen shutting shop at the stroke of 10. Every night, I stay open till 1.30-2am, as long as there are people on Park Street. But today is different, he said.																								The only sign of life on Park Street was inside Park Hotel. The curfew is restricted to some areas only, so I dont see why we cant go out, shrugged Priyanka, a model, at Roxy. Later at night, Rohan Gavaskar, Ranadeb Bose and Abhishek Jhunjhunwala were spotted at the lounge bar. 																								Police who spent the night on their toes all around Park Street could afford to take it easy on the citys food-and-fun thoroughfare. There are hardly any vehicles or pedestrians, pointed out a cop on duty.																								At 11.15pm, there was not a soul on Park Street, save an Israeli tourist. I didnt know there was a curfew on... But Im not scared. People in India do a lot of screaming but when it comes to action, Ive come from places where its far worse. Indians are a peaceful people.

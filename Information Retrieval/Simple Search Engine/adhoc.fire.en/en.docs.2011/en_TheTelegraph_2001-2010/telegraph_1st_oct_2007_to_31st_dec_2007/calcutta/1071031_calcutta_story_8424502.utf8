				 Photos to monitor pollution
 JAYANTA BASU																								The state pollution control board is using digital cameras to monitor air pollution in Howrah and penalise industrial units violating norms.																								Under the project, named Operation Clear Sky, black smoke coming out of factory chimneys is photographed. The date and the time are noted. The owners of the factories are then called for a hearing, where regulatory orders are passed.																								There are about 350 coal-fired industries in Howrah, a majority of them foundries and galvanising units. By using digital cameras, we have passed regulatory orders on 22 units since May, said Dipak Chakrabarty, the chief scientist and head of the technical cell of the board.																								The units photographed with smoke coming out of their chimneys were initially slapped with closure notices. They were allowed to operate after submitting a bank guarantee and providing an undertaking that they would follow green norms. 																								Before Operation Clear Sky, the board had relied on routine checks and inspections on specific complaints. 																								There are hundreds of small and medium-sized industrial units in Howrah that run on coal-fired boilers and violate emission norms. Given our infrastructure, it is not possible to regularly measure emission from the units. Hence, we decided to track them using digital cameras, said board member-secretary Debal Roy.																								The new method of monitoring pollution has achieved reasonable success in Howrah and is being extended to other parts of the state, added Roy.																								Somenath Narayan, who heads the Howrah unit of the state board, agreed with Roy: None of the units we had pulled up questioned our findings. We will continue with the new method of monitoring.																								Howrah is one of the two critically polluted areas in the state, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. The Durgapur-Asansol belt is the other one.

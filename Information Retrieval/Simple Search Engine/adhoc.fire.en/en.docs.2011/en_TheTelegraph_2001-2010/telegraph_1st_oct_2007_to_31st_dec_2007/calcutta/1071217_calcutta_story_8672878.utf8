																								Move over Memorial, the fairways are here. A growing band of foreign tourists is seeking a slice of Calcuttas history  not with a tour of colonial architecture but by teeing off on the worlds oldest golf course outside the British Isles.
																								Soon after an 11-member Polish delegation descended on the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), all of 179 years old, its the turn of the Singapore President to chip and putt in the New Year.
																								Singapores high commissioner in India Calvin Eu did a reconnoitre of the course last week to set the course for a high-level delegation, led by President Sellapan Ramanathan, in January that wants to test its golf skills at the Royal.
																								Theres no doubt the club is seeing a lot of foreign interest this winter, which is a relatively new phenomenon. We were delighted to host the Polish team last week, besides golfers from Abu Dhabi, Israel, Japan and Korea, says M.M. Singh, the CEO of RCGC.
																								A number of European travel representatives have also contacted the club to tie up golfing tourism trips to Calcutta, especially for visitors from east European countries, where golf is a relatively new sport.
																								Earlier, we only had foreign cricketers coming and playing golf at the Royal. We have had Australian and English players on the course. But this seasons sustained foreign interest is novel and interesting. I think its because of the history, been there, done that kind of agenda, feels ex-captain Ashit Luthra.
																								Theres a new zing in the swing of the foreigners community in Calcutta as well. While the Japanese have teed off their own tourney, some Koreans have taken up temporary membership of RCGC for the winter to indulge their putting passion.
																								Last year, the city had hosted Lucifers, a bunch of goodwill golf ambassadors who, over the past 26 years, have been touring Commonwealth countries like Kenya, Zimbabwe, Bermuda, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and India.
																								This winter, its all about mixing birdie with biz. Our ultimate aim is to create a signature course, and the club management is inviting presentations from the worlds top golf course designers for the right blueprint. We are also looking at a 360-degree upgrade of facilities, including a modern practice range and a golf academy, stresses CEO Singh.

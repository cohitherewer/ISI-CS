		 Return of the natives																																	Calcutta Painters returns with an international exhibition featuring established names that have been part of the Indian art scene for the past 30 years or more. Way back in 1963, the motivation for a handful of young artists from Calcutta was to find an idiom of expression that could do justice to modernism in art; the attempt continues till date. Calcutta Painters has, in these years, proved that the process of evolution is intrinsic to an understanding of art. The group boasts of artists Debarata Chakrabarti, Susanta Chakraborty, Dhiraj Choudhury, Bijan Chowdhury, Anita Roy Chowdhury, Surajit Das, Subrata Ghosh, Tapan Ghosh, Dwijen Gupta, Bipin Goswami, Wasim Kapoor, Sibaprasad Karchaudhuri, Prakash Karmakar, Isha Muhammad, Tapan Mitra, Rabin Mondal, Barun Roy, Amitabh Sengupta, Niren Sengupta and Jogen Chowdhury, whose Couple appears right. The group stands today like a lighthouse along the path of several aspiring artists who fight against sham, cliche and mimicry in art.

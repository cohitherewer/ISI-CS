				 Tiffin-box sparks bomb fear
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A solitary black bag outside gate No. 4A of Eden Gardens caused a greater flutter than all that the Pakistani bowlers hurled at the Indian batsmen throughout Friday.																								Around 8.30am, a few spectators entering the stadium spotted an abandoned black bag and raised an alarm. It proved to be a false alarm, as the black bag contained an empty tiffin-box.																								The bag lay just beyond the barricade, yards from the Club House, said a senior officer. The area was cordoned off and sniffer dogs were pressed into action. 																								Officers from the bomb disposal squad opened the bag and found the tiffin-box.																								Bhaichung barred: A surprise victim of the security ring around Eden Gardens was Mohun Bagan captain Bhaichung Bhutia. The soccer star was not allowed to reach the club grounds for a practice session after cops stopped his car on Kingsway. The car did not have the requisite green sticker, said an officer.

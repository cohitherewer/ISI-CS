				 Fog has fliers tweak travel plans

 															- Demand for evening flights takes off after delayed morning schedules
 A STAFF REPORTER 
																								Manish Sharma, a city-based businessman, was scheduled to fly to London, via Mumbai, on January 20. He had planned to take the 6.55am Jet Airways flight from Calcutta for the 1.30pm Mumbai-London flight the same day.
																								I would have had more than four hours in Mumbai before taking the London flight. But given the fog-related delays in Calcutta, I am not taking any chance and have altered my travel plans, Sharma told Metro a day after fog played havoc with the flight schedule in Calcutta.
																								More than 30 flights were delayed by four to five hours on an average on Thursday.
																								The first thing that Sharma did on Friday was to call up his agent and tweak his travel plan. I am flying out of Calcutta the night before, said Sharma. 
																								With fog-related delays feared to continue throughout winter, a lot of passengers  especially those scheduled to take connecting international flights from Delhi and Mumbai  are altering travel plans. The fog fright has prompted at least 10 per cent of the passengers who had booked tickets on morning flights to opt for day or evening flights, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.
																								An Air India official confirmed that there was a sudden surge in demand for evening flights.
																								Fog delays cannot be averted during winter. Altering travel plans can only reduce the hardship, said a Jet Airways official. The ripple effect of morning delays can be felt till the afternoon or even evening.
																								This, despite the technological intervention to fight fog. The Category II Instrumental Landing System was installed at the airport this year to help planes operate in fog, but it cannot function when the minimum visibility drops below 350 metre.
																								In Calcutta, from December-end till the first week of February, visibility in the morning is often as low as 50 metre. At 5.30am on Thursday, visibility was 100 metre.

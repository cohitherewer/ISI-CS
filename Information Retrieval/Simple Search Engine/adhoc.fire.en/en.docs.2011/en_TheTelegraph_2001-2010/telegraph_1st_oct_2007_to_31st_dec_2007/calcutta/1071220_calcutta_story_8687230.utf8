				 National entrance test for retail course

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The first countrywide entrance examination for postgraduate programmes in retail management will be held on January 27.
																								The Common Admission Retail Test (Cart), organised by the Retail Association of India (Rai), will be used by 15 institutes across India to select students for their retail management courses.
																								Retail in India is undergoing a transformation. The phenomenal growth in the organised retail sector has increased the demand for quality manpower. The test will help us induct the best talents, said Gibson G. Vedamani, CEO, Rai.
																								Application forms for Cart will be available at the 15 B-schools, Career Launcher centres, Axis Bank branches and retail outlets of Rai member organisations like Shoppers Stop, Big Bazaar, Croma, Vishal Mega Mart, Crossword Bookstores and Landmark.
																								The application forms, priced at Rs 1,000, will also be available online. The examination will be conducted at 25 centres across the country.
																								The test will have four sections. Like the Common Admission Test (CAT), Cart will have sections on quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning and verbal ability. In addition, there will be a section on business and consumer awareness.
																								Students will be admitted on the basis of their scores in the test, their performance in the group discussion and the personal interview, said Krishnendu Sarkar, head (learning systems), NSHM.
																								A postgraduate programme in retail management launched by NSHM Knowledge Campus, Calcutta, in the last academic session has been well received by students.

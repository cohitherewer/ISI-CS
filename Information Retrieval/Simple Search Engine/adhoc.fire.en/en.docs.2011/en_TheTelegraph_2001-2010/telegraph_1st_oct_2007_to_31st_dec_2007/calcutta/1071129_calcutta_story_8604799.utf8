				 China office for visas
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The Shanghai surprise for Indian tourists																								China will soon open its city consulate office, from where visas will be issued.																								Once the office is set up, visa processing for tourists from Calcutta will be faster, Wang Xian Yun, the deputy director of China National Tourist Office (CNTO), said on Wednesday.																								Now, Calcuttans wishing to visit China have to approach the embassy in Delhi for a visa.																								Yun was in town to promote Chinas tourism potential among the people of eastern India. India ranks 15th on the list of the countries from where people visit China. South Korea comes first, said Yun. Only 500,000 tourists from India visit China every year. We want to double the figure by 2010.																								Yun stressed the need for better air connectivity between the two countries to boost tourism. Sixteen flights now operate between India and China every week, of which five are from Calcutta. In a year, there will be daily flights from the city, said Yun.																								CNTO is promoting Beijing, Shanghai, Xian, Guilin and Kunming as popular destinations.																								Calcutta sends around 35,000 travellers to China every year. There has been a 20 per cent rise in the number since the introduction of direct flights to Kunming, said Anil Punjabi, of Travel Agents Federation of India.

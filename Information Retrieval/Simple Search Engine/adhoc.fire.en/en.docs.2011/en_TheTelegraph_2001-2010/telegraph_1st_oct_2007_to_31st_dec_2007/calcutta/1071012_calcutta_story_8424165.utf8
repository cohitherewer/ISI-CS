 															- Doctors satisfied with celebrity patients recovery pace OUR BUREAU				 	 Suchitra Sen																								Behind a veil of secrecy at Belle Vue Clinics ICCU bed number 2, Suchitra Sen is regaining her strength and her spirit. I am feeling much better today. When am I likely to go home? the reclusive screen idol, in a sky blue patients gown, asked doctors on Thursday evening.																								She has shown definite signs of improvement. Shes a bit weak from the fever but doctors are satisfied with her progress. She slept well last night. We are suspecting urinary tract infection, but all the test reports have not come in yet. She will be kept under observation for a few more days, said Pradip Tondon, the CEO of Belle Vue. Shes very cooperative and is chatting with the doctors and nurses. She had biscuits and tea for breakfast, pudding and soup for lunch, toast with soup and vegetables for dinner. Shes very fond of sweets, he added.																								Sen was admitted with high fever and stomach ache late on Tuesday. The team of doctors monitoring her condition comprises K.B. Bakshi, S.K. Biswas and Swapan Pal.																								For the sake of the celebrity patient, who has stayed away from the public eye for the past 30 years, a flank of the seventh floor has been cordoned off and two guards posted to stop outsiders from stealing a glance. Two special nurses have been assigned to take care of Sen, keep the curtains around her drawn and not disclose any details. Those visiting other patients on the seventh floor are being specially screened.																								Daughter Moon Moon Sen and son-in-law Bharat Dev Burman spent most of the day at the clinic. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya paid a visit on Thursday evening. When asked how Suchitra Sen looked and what she said, the mayor retorted: She looks like a normal human being. She told me she was feeling fine.

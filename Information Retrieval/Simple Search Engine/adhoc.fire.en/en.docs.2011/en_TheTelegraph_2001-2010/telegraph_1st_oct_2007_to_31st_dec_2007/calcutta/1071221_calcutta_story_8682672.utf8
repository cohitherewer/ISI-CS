																																	Ranans present production was born out of one of its theatre-workshops in Calcutta. After having travelled nationally and internationally, Crossings: Exploring the facets of Lady Macbeth returns in its final version to the city of its birth. It is one of the first experiments by Ranan to bring together the idioms of classical dance and drama. Shakespeares Macbeth has been appreciated immensely both in its digetic and mimetic forms. Interestingly, Ranans production chooses to focus on Lady Macbeth rather than the tragic hero. What is attempted is a recontextualisation of the character of Lady Macbeth, who is one of the most talked about women characters created by the bard. The pieces of dance recital are interspersed with the speeches of Lady Macbeth that reveal her surprisingly strong will and bring to light the fact of her selfless love for her husband. In fact, in the Freudian perspective, Lady Macbeth is only an extension of Macbeths psyche; an objective-correlative of his feminine side. The production explores Lady Macbeths role in her husbands life and her agony of bearing the guilt of murder and losing her sanity and everything else she has. The present production succeeds not only in chronicling the various aspects of her personality, but through dance gives the character that vehemence and verve that cannot be experienced or discerned while reading or watching the play. Direction: Vikram Iyengar.

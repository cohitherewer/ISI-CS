		 Fascinating forms																																	Unified under the banner of sculpture, Uma Roy Chowdhury, Prasun Ghosh, Rathin Dey, Debajit Chakraborty and Soumen Das are of varied age and experience, as are the materials they work with; ranging from terracotta to ceramics, and fibreglass to bronze. From serene to grand, monumental to momentary, sculpture in India has widened its ambit. Experimentation seems to be the keyword in a creative stream abounding in diversity of ideas and material, form and dimension. The new has in no way wiped out the old. The ongoing exhibition testifies to this. Roy Chowdhury (Nature Orphaned; picture right) revels in reinventing the feminine form. Some of her works done in fibreglass finds her raising her head sunwards; elsewhere she squats with her head bent down, the golden orb of apple countering the Mayan motifs she is draped in. Sometimes, a little girl, Gauri, becomes Goddess Durga incarnate, as the child innocently adorns herself with a tinsel crown and weapons of clay idols left behind after immersion. Among the other participants, Das counterpoises the animate with the inanimate, while Dey transfers landscapes into sculpture. Chakraborty tries to capture the alienation he felt while moving along the streets of Calcutta and Ghosh lets loose his creativity, intriguing the viewer into playing strange mind games.

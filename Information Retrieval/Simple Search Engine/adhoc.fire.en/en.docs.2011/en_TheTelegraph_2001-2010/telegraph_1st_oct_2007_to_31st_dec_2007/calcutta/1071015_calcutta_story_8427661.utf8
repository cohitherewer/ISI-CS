 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 MOTIVATION MATTERS: Bhaichung Bhutia at the interface. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Never think you are safe, no matter how well you are doing. Do not dwell on failures. No matter how badly the team performs, keep up the team spirit.																								These words of wisdom are not of a management guru but of mountain scorpion Bhaichung Bhutia. The skipper of the Indian football team held forth in front of 400-odd employees of Acclaris Business Solution, in Sector V, on Friday afternoon. He spoke on a wide range of topics, from the Indian football scene to motivating a team.																								As a leader, whether of a football team or a company, one needs to inspire trust. Gaining trust is not easy. It comes through interaction. Your team members should know that when you say something you mean it, said Bhaichung. 																								For someone who admits to being shy while speaking in public, he handled questions from the audience very well.																								Bhaichung shared his experiences of leading a team, outlining the challenges and the ways to deal with them. Positive attitude, planning, fostering team spirit and not giving up till the final whistle is blown were the prescriptions of the fleet-footed striker.																								The interaction was organised as part of the leadership training programme of Acclaris. Bhaichung, as captain of the Indian football team, has to work with people from diverse backgrounds, just like corporate leaders. Hence he was the perfect choice for a speaker, said Ashish Sen, the executive director of Acclaris.

				 Bye, circus; hi, book fair
 															- ONE MAIDAN TO ANOTHER A STAFF REPORTER				 	 PAPER CHASE: A section of the crowd at Book Fair 2006, the last time it was held on the Maidan. A Telegraph picture																								The Book Fair will replace the circus on the Park Circus Maidan, if the organisers agree to shell out Rs 1.18 crore to the civic body.																								The Publishers and Booksellers Guild has approached the civic authorities for hiring the Park Circus Maidan for the 33rd Calcutta Book Fair.																								The fair will continue from January 29 to February 10, but the guild has sought the ground from January 10 to February 20. The civic parks and gardens wing has fixed Rs 1.18 crore as rent for the fair.																								Since the guild has asked for the ground, we will not let it out to a circus group. If the guild pays the amount, it can hold the fair there, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Friday.																								Guild ground secretary Sudhangshu Dey, however, said: The CMC hasnt told us anything about the rent.																								Mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan ruled out exempting rent for the fair. The question doesnt arise. The fair is a sales promotion venture. If we can collect rent from a sick industry like the circus, why not from the Book Fair?																								The Park Circus Maidan has traditionally been a venue for circus during winter. This year, too, the civic body had invited bids from circus groups. Provat Circus was selected, as it had quoted the highest price of Rs 7 lakh.																								The fair was shifted out of the Maidan this year and held in the Salt Lake stadium compound following an order from Calcutta High Court. The response was poor, with the footfall dropping from 25 lakh (when it used to be held on the Maidan) to 10 lakh.																								Guild officials feel the turnout will be higher if the fair is held at Park Circus.																								The government had claimed that it had identified a plot (Milon Mela) off EM Bypass for fairs, but the facilities there are far from ready.

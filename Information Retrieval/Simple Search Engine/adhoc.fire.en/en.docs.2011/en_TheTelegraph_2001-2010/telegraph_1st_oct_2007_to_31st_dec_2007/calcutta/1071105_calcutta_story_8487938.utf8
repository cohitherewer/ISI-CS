				 Luxury line-up at lifestyle lair
 															- Versace, Tag Heuer among premium brands in talks for shop stop space SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Atria will house top-notch brands																								Calcuttas retail bar is ready to be raised again early next year. Atria, a 20,000-sq-ft shop stop on Gurusaday Dutt Road promises to bring super-luxury retail to the city, after the debut by Marks amp; Spencer on Chowringhee with the Guess-Next-The Body Shop bouquet in tow.																								We are in talks with Versace, Hugo Boss, Tag Heuer, Disney and Lacoste, among other premium brands, and we hope to sign on the dotted line with a few of them by next month, Harsh Patodia of real estate developers Heritage Group tells Metro.																								Yes, we are seriously looking at Atria for the First Line formalwear range of Versace and the deal could happen soon, confirms city-based retail franchisee Varun Kataruka, who is steering some of the luxury brands to Calcutta through a holding franchisee agreement. Versace currently has a presence in Mumbai and Delhi.																								Kataruka says negotiations are in the final stages with brands Ted Lapidus, Daniel Hecter and Bogart for Atria, with DKNY also in the queue.																								The Rs 10-crore retail rendezvous opposite Mainland China, being developed by Heritage Group and PS Group, is expected to open its doors in February next year, and the promoters hope to lure the likes of Versace and Heuer by dint of their location advantage.																								Atrias location is in perfect synergy with the profile of brands like Versace, Prada and Tag Heuer, feels Abhijit Das, the regional director of international property consultants Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj.																								If the deal comes through, it will trigger an exponential jump in high-street prices in the entire region. The ripple effects of this will be felt in the retail space market. At the same time, this will bring in other top-notch brands, adds Das.																								Billed as the most exclusive retail address in the heart of south Calcutta, Atria complements Astral, the luxury sky-condominium project being developed by the same combine. Our effort is to bring in a boutique retail experience for the high-income group in Calcutta, used to similar high-street formats abroad, says Pradip Chopra of the PS Group.																								Some Indian retail players re-launching with high-end products have also evinced interest in the Gurusaday Dutt Road lifestyle lair.

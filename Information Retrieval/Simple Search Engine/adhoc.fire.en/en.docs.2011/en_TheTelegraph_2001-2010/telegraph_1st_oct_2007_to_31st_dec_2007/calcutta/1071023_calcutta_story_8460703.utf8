				 Quest for fun n frolic
				 				 																															From debate to body art and arm wrestling, the students of Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration made Quest, their annual fest, a special occasion for all who were part of the event. 				 				 																															More than 20 city colleges participated in the three-day fest that was organised recently. 				 				 																															It began with the war of words. Titled Crossfire, the topic for the day was Orkut, a social degradation. There were various musical events like antakshari and eastern solo competition. But the crowd-puller was the war of bands where St Xaviers College bagged the first prize. 				 				 																															On Day One, students walked the ramp with their faces painted in varied hues. This is the best part of the whole event. We can have a lot of fun with colours and some of the faces are almost unrecognisable, said Sourav Mitra of Techno India, Salt Lake. Students also showed their expertise in painting T-shirts, one of the fun events at the fest. 				 				 																															Day Two started with brain teasers followed by quiz contest and Ad-Mad, western solo, body art and arm wrestling. 				 				 																															The third day began with dramatics where Lady Brabourne College gave a performance that bagged them the first prize. The girls college was followed by Frankfinn Institute of Airhostess Training and Techno India, Salt Lake. 				 				 																															Of all the events, the treasure hunt caught the imagination of the participants. It was very different from the usual competitive events at fests. It was a tough fight, said Sourav. 				 				 																															A dance event with a retro theme, jazzed up the ambience. The songs from the 60s and 70s was appreciated by the audience, with Bhawanipur Gujarati Educational Society College giving a brilliant performance. Quest wrapped up with a DJ night that saw students light up the dance floor.with foot-tapping numbers.				 				 																															Debangana Saha

				 Book fair in college
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Book-lovers in Calcutta are in for a winter treat, with St Xaviers College (Calcutta) Alumni Association announcing plans to hold a mini book fair.																								The fair, to be held in the St Xaviers hostel or on the school ground, has been tentatively scheduled from December 19 to December 22, with the closing day coinciding with the colleges reunion bash.																								The entry fee to the fair, which will be open from noon to 8pm, has not been decided. 																								Publishers and Booksellers Guild, which holds the Calcutta Book Fair, will provide technical and infrastructure support to the St Xaviers event.																								We have experience in organising book fairs, so we will guide the alumni association on how to contact writers, publishers and decorators, and organise a fair, said Tridib Chatterjee, of Publishers and Booksellers Guild.																								There will be about 40 stalls at the fair. The focus will be on text and reference books. Penguin, Ananda Publishers, Oxford, Rupa, Orient Longman, Seagull and Navneet are some of the publishers expected to take part in the fair.																								There is a lot of uncertainty around the Calcutta Book Fair. We thought it was a good idea to organise a book fair at the college, said Father P.C. Matthew, the principal of St Xaviers.																								Seminars will be held at the book fair at 3pm every day, followed by cultural programmes. The organisers expect at least 10,000 visitors daily.

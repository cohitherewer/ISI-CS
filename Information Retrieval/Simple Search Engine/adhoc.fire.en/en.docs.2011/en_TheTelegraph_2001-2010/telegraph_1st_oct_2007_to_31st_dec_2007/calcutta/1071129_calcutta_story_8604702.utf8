				 Flying colours in football test  															- Soccer star Bhaichung gives Bollywood hero John full marks PRATIM D. GUPTA				 	 John Abraham and Bhaichung Bhutia at the Star theatre screening of Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal on Wednesday afternoon. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								The matinee show at Star theatre on Wednesday was John Abrahams biggest test  not as an actor, but as a footballer. For, watching Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal with the Bollywood star was a man called Bhaichung Bhutia.																								I was so nervous when the show began. I was like a student waiting for the principals verdict, confessed John, looking cool in a casual check shirt and shades. At the end of the screening, the Indian soccer skipper playing principal  sporty and stylish in a light blue sweatshirt and shades  had given the Bolly hunk high marks.																								Bhaichung told me he not only liked the film, he also loved the way I played the game, John told Metro later in the evening. Even Alvito DCunha (of East Bengal) praised my soccer skills after the show.																								When quizzed about the football film, Bhaichung said: The soccer sequences are very original, minor details of the game have been well captured and the technical abilities of the team and the individual players are good.																								John, of course, couldnt stop flashing his dimpled smile throughout his visit to the land of football and Bengali beauties (in a deft reference to girlfriend Bipasha Basu, of course).																								As youngsters thronging the gates of the Hatibagan theatre chanted Johns name, the Dhoom man watched his most testing Goal screening flanked by Bhaichung and Alvito. We made the film for them; we had planned a Bhaichung special appearance that didnt materialise, revealed John.																								 That didnt stop Bhaichung and Co. from watching the John Abrahams and Arshad Warsis dribble and shoot their way to Goal.																								It was easy for us to relate to the film, because we are familiar with all the things that happen to a football team, smiled the Team India captain. Of course, we dont fight that much amongst ourselves, he added with a smile.																								Johns latest release, of course, could do with the blessings of Bhaichung, as compared to the hockey hit Chak De! India, football flick Goal has failed to hit home.																								The first week for Goal has been just about average, despite the soccer skills on display are above average. Chak De! is too fresh in the minds of the people, the handling of Goal leaves a lot to be desired, and John is no Shah Rukh, summed up a trade analyst. But it should do better in the city of Mohun Bagan-East Bengal than in other metros. 																								Thats precisely why John spent Wednesday at Star theatre. I had to come here and see first-hand how people who love football so much are reacting to the film.																								And the citys GenX crowd gave him a rousing reception. The matinee crowd at Star went berserk every time John had the ball at his feet. The applause was thunderous every time he found the back of the net. But no prizes for guessing when the din was most deafening  the John-Bipasha kiss.																								Unlike No Smoking, my previous release, Goal is more of an audience film than a critic film, said John. I was so happy to see the way Calcutta warmed to the film. This is the certificate I was looking for.																								Bhaichung maintained that one film cannot change the football scenario in India, but he was hopeful that Johns huge fan following among kids would help boost interest in the sport. Even if a few of these kids turn out to be good players, that would be great, smiled Bhaichung.

				 Bias cry over madarsa tag
 MITA MUKHERJEE																								The state governments decision to grant minority status to madarsas has upset the Christian missionary and church-run institutions, which need a nod from Delhi to enjoy the same rights. 																								The state government announced grant of minority status to over 500 madarsas last month. Early this year, it had declared that schools run by churches and Christian missionaries could seek minority status from the National Commission for Minority Educational Institution in Delhi. They are considered minority institutions only if they have the institutes certificate. 																								We welcome the governments decision on madarsas. But how can it have different policies for madarsas and schools run by Christian missionaries and churches? Both types of schools are run by minority groups, said Herod Mullick, the general secretary of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, which represents churches in the state. 																								Minority schools can appoint teachers, and their principals and headmasters can be religious heads. The institutions can follow their own education policy, admit students on the basis of their own criteria and follow their own fee structure. 																								The Pariseba has urged the government to withdraw its earlier decision. The government told us that it did not have the resources to grant minority status to educational institutions. Now that the government has given the status to madarsas, it should do the same for us, added Mullick.																								 State minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar said the government had set up a committee last week to draft a comprehensive plan for smooth functioning of all minority institutions.

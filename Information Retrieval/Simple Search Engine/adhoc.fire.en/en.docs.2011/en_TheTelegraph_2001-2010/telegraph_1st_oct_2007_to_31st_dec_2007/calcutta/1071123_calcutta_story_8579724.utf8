				 Soft targets of mob fury
				 	 Burning cars and carcasses on Bridge No. 4 at Park Circus on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture																								On Wednesday, private cars became a soft target for rioters. Metro traced a few who bore the brunt of orchestrated mob fury... 																								I am a researcher in Uppsala University, Sweden. Since I arrived here in September, Calcutta has been in turmoil. My father, Prof Bishnupada Chatterjee, 62, was caught in Wednesdays violence. He is an Emeritus Professor in West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) and was going to Jadavpur in a university car.																								At Bridge No. 4, his car was attacked by a mob. The driver asked my father to flee. My father jumped out of the car and started running, with a gang of rioters behind him. He finally reached a RAF cordon and managed to take a taxi to safety. The driver was badly beaten up and the car thoroughly damaged.																								Is this the Calcutta we are trying to bring some fame to?																								Dr Urmimala Chatterjee.																								Our Tata Sumo was parked outside our home on CIT Road. In the afternoon, a section of a mob, while passing by our house, suddenly turned on the car. By the time they left, the glass panes were smashed and the body damaged.																								Ashoke Chowdhury.																								I was going to my factory in Bantala from BBD Bag. Around 12.30pm, we got stuck at the approach to Bridge No. 4. I started walking, leaving my black Santro behind with the driver. Within minutes, I received a call from my driver, saying the car had been attacked and badly damaged. The garage said the repairs would cost between Rs 40,000 and Rs 50,000. I am stunned. Why should I be made to suffer for no fault of mine? Who do I blame for what happened?																								Nehal Zafar, businessman.																								I was on my way to office on Strand Road when I got stuck on Ananda Palit Road around 11am. A mob of around 30-40 started hurling stones at my car. The front of the Alto was smashed. I want to know why. I was just going to work.																								Sabir Mirza.																								(Was your car damaged in Wednesdays violence? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com)

				 Bengali archives get boost

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The India Foundation for the Arts (IFA), an organisation dedicated to strengthening the arts in India, has recently launched its Bengali Language Initiative to facilitate archiving, research and writing in the vernacular and support individuals and institutions that work on such projects. 
																								What distinguishes IFA from other funding agencies and government institutions is the lack of red-tapism. Even serious researchers of a certain age have access to them, and IFA gives them more latitude. It has already made 41 grants. 
																								Some of the grantees made presentations of the work they are doing on Monday. Kamal Saha, involved in theatre for 25 years, has started compiling a 10-volume encyclopaedia of the 212-year-old Bengali theatre, the likes of which does not exist. Fifty thousand Bengali plays have been published so far. He hopes to make much progress in the work in the next six months, and his work is being vetted by veteran theatre director and actor Bibhas Chakraborty. He will also create an archive of the prodigious amount of material available with him, so that they are available to the public and researchers.
																								Although literature is his primary area of study, Prabhat Kumar Das has been involved in documenting jatra and collecting related material for the past 40 years. He is mainly documenting the history of the jatra companies of Chitpur, the lives of the paalakars or the scriptwriters, the cross-dressing actors and the wealth of songs. He regretted that no list of paalakars exists. In the 20th Century, jatra came very close to theatre yet it retained its identity. He, too, is digitising the material available with him.
																								Scholar Gautam Bhadra spoke on behalf of Subhendu Dasgupta, who is ill and is writing a history of the genre of cartoons in Bengal and Bangladesh. The two forms of cartoons, broadly social and political, began from 1872 with the publication of Basantak and Amrita Bazar Patrika of yore and boasts a rich lode of material. Prafulla Chandra Ray drew cartoons to publicise the ill effects of tea, and Gaganendranath Tagores cartoons approached serious art.
																								Sandip Datta is digitising his collection of 50,000 to 60,000 little magazines. He wants to create an archive of these magazines, for which he needs a house. He made an appeal for more space for his little magazines so that they can be physically preserved.
																								Indira Biswas will continue her research in Bengali music and will create a history of radio and gramophone records.
																								Young Smita Khator is creating a digital archive on how the middle-class Bengali has coped with the turmoil of the period between 1966-67, as reflected in the columns of Anandabazar Patrika.
																								Sandipan Chakrabarty is mapping the changes in language of Bengali poetry from 1990 to 2005.

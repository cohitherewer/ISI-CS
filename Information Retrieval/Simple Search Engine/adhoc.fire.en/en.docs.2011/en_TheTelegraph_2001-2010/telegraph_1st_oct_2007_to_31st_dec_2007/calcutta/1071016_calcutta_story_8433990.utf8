 															- Rise in festive traffic A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Cellphone users may not have cause to cheer when the festive season traffic records a spurt. A Telegraph picture																								Shrishti has taken a picture of sandhi puja at her favourite pandal but cannot MMS it to her friends. 																								Partho is trying to call up his friends so that they can meet and set out for a night of pandal-hopping but cannot get through.																								Nikhilesh from New Jersey has messaged Shubha Bijoya to his relatives in Calcutta but the SMS texts are not being delivered.																								Familiar scenes during the biggest festive season of the year. So familiar that Calcuttans might as well pray to Durga for better cellphone connectivity and network coverage later this week.																								The GSM and CDMA service providers, including BSNL, Airtel, Vodafone, Reliance and Tata Indicom, record up to 50 per cent hike in SMS traffic at this time of the year. 																								According to Airtel officials, if the average SMS traffic is a million per day, on Dashami it is 2.5 million.																								Tata Indicom registered a 25 per cent hike in the SMS count during Puja 2006. Industry officials said the number of SMS texts on the Reliance network doubles during the four festive days. 																								With 800,000 to 900,000 new GSM subscribers and 60,000 new CDMA subscribers in the city in the past two months, are the service providers ready to tackle the additional Puja load? 																								We have set up 400 towers in the state for better coverage, said Ajai Puri, the chief executive officer (mobility) of Bharti Airtel (Calcutta and Bengal).																								Tata Indicoms regional head Sanjeev Khera claimed that a pan-India network upgrade had enabled the company to handle up to 100 per cent more traffic. 																								The cellphone users are not convinced. I will send Puja greetings through e-cards. Sending SMS texts during the festival is impossible, said Sanjeev Chakraborty, a college student. 																								Others plan to send their messages a day early to ensure that they reach their near and dear ones in time.																								Puja ringtones, caller tunes, soirees, roadmaps and competitions that the cellphone companies organise are all fine but at the end of the day, what matters to the consumer is the quality of service, said Ramesh Jha, a corporate executive.

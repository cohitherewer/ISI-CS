				 Lack of examiners holds up results
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								A scarcity of examiners in emerging subjects has delayed the publication of Calcutta Universitys BA and B.Sc (Part I and Part II, under the new 1+1+1 system) results till the second week of November. 																								We are facing a serious problem in finding examiners in subjects like microbiology, molecular biology, electronic science, computer science, computer applications and journalism, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikary, the controller of examinations of the university.																								Few colleges offer the new subjects. Hence, the number of answer scripts in the new subjects is much less than the number of answer scripts in subjects like history, political science, mathematics, physics and chemistry. We still cannot find enough examiners for the new subjects, added the official.																								Nearly 130,000 students took the examinations. Less than 10 per cent of them had written tests in the emerging subjects.																								The results were initially scheduled to be declared before the Puja. The authorities had announced last week that the results would be published in the second week of November. 																								Officials of the universitys examination department are considering the possibility of asking the teachers who have examined their quota of answer scripts to correct more answer scripts.																								We understand the difficulty a teacher has to face while examining several sets of answer scripts within a span of two to three months. We are trying to find a way out of the problem, said Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs). 																								A senior official of the examination department explained how the results have been delayed by a lack of examiners in emerging subjects: The evaluation of 75 per cent of the answer scripts in journalism honours is complete. But the marks of 25 per cent of the examinees are yet to reach the university as we could not find teachers to evaluate the answer scripts of these students till a few days ago.																								According to officials, a teacher is selected for correcting answer scripts after he/she has taught for a certain period. Since subjects like journalism, microbiology and molecular biology were introduced three to five years ago, most teachers do not have the minimum experience required to be examiners.

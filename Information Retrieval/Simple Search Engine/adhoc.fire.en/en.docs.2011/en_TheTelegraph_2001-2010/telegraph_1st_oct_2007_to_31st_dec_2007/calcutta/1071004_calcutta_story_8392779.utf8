				 Airport duo in suburbs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Plans for a second airport in Calcutta are yet to see the light of day, but if chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has his way, two small private airports could come up on the northern fringes soon.																								Airstrips at Kanchrapara and Barrackpore, owned by the defence ministry, may be leased out to private parties for the purpose.																								The defence ministry has already given the nod. The airstrips will be developed by private parties, Bhattacharjee said, while speaking at the 102nd annual general meeting of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI) on Wednesday.																								These two airports will be modelled on the airport at Andal, near Asansol.																								We need smaller airports within the state, apart from the one at Dum Dum, Bhattacharjee said, adding that another new airport at Cooch Behar was ready and would be operational shortly.																								The Airports Authority of India will expand Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at Dum Dum and the work will be completed by 2010. But the chief minister feels that even after expansion, the airport would barely suffice in handling the growing traffic till 2015.																								Both domestic and international air traffic is growing steadily, Bhattacharjee said, adding that the airlines are demanding more operations from the city and are planning to increase connectivity around the globe.																								Listing the upcoming infrastructure development projects in the state to the BNCCI members, Bhattacharjee said the Planning Commission and the ministry of railways had approved the East-West Metro corridor, between Salt Lake and Howrah, last week.																								He also said the Centre had okayed plans for a deep-sea port in the state near the proposed chemical hub at Nayachar.

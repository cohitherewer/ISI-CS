				 MoU for tech town water
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								In a bid to ensure uninterrupted water supply to the states infotech hub in Salt Lakes Sector V, the state government signed a memorandum of understanding with Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company (Jusco) on Thursday. 																								According to the agreement, Jusco  a Tata Steel subsidiary  will create the necessary sewerage and water supply infrastructure in the IT hub. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will supply three million gallons of treated surface water every day and this will be delivered through the Jusco infrastructure. 																								Initially, the project cost is estimated at Rs 58 crore. The CMDA will jointly execute the project, with Jusco bearing 35 per cent of the project cost. Our share will come from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, said municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya. 																								Spread over 300 acres, Sector V is the technology hub of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, but water supply and the sewerage system have caused concern to the sunrise sector companies. 																								With more companies queueing up for space in Sector V, the government is trying to create the infrastructure by joining hands with Jusco and implementing the project in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model. 																								According to Bhattacharya, this is the first such BOT project of its kind in the country. We are using the public-private partnership model for development and subsequent maintenance of water and sewage infrastructure for 30 years, said the minister. 																								This water supply and sewerage infrastructure will cover the entire area, which comes under the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of the fledgling body, after the formal memorandum of understanding was signed at Writers Buildings. Both sides have agreed on an 18-month deadline to execute the project.

				 Woman adept at mobike repairs
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 FIX-IT LADY: Boudi Sonali Mistry is as fast and efficient as any male motorcycle mechanic, her customers will aver. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								If you happen to stop at the motorcycle repair shop on Deshapran Sashmal Road, near the Tollygunge crossing, dont be surprised to see a bubbly boudi come out to take a look at your two-wheeler. 																								Meet Sonali Mistry, the lone woman motorcycle mechanic in Calcutta. The 36-year-old mother of two has carved out a niche for herself in a male bastion. The outlet she runs with her husband Shankar is appropriately called Mr and Mrs Auto Capital.																								Boudi is very friendly and chats with me while working on my Splendor. She is very efficient, too, and as fast as any male mechanic. Boudi knows the tricks of the trade, says IT professional Manowar Hossain, who has been getting his motorcycle serviced by Sonali for eight years.																								Customers often ask Sonali why she chose to become a motorcycle mechanic and whether she feels uncomfortable in a profession that has hardly any women. My customers and co-workers have never made me feel uncomfortable, she says. I became a mechanic out of compulsion but began to enjoy it later. My family, too, is very supportive. 																								Sonali, who was a Christian before marriage, says she started working after her husband Shankar lost his job in early 90s. There was some road development project and the garage he was working in was demolished. He opened his own garage in our house in Behalas Haridevpur. There was an acute labour problem, so I started helping him. I picked up the skills quickly and continued to work when we opened the garage, she says, while working on a motorcycle belonging to police sergeant.																								The couples son Russell helps out in the shop, while daughter Rosina appeared in Madhyamik this year. 																								Shankar says: The religious sentiments of some members of our community were hurt when my wife started working. Some goons also used political connections to threaten us. But we did not budge.																								Sonali wants to continue as long as she can. I have developed a liking for two-wheelers. Given a choice, I would like to ride a motorcycle than ride pillion, she says. Much to her dismay, her doctor has advised her against it, after she suffered an accident.

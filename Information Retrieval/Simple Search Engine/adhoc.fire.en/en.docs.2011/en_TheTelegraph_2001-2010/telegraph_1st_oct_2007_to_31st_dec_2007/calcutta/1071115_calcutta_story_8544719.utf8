				 Compensation eludes passenger
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Krishna Sachdeva recounts her harrowing tale. A Telegraph picture																								Air Deccan is yet to provide compensation to Krishna Sachdeva, 65, who was forced to pay twice for flying from Delhi to Calcutta on October 27.																								We have sent several mails to the airline but havent got any response. We will move court if the compensation does not arrive in a week, said Sanjay Sachdeva, Krishnas younger son.																								Air Deccan, however, claimed that it has finalised the procedure to provide compensation to the woman. As promised, we will issue a complimentary ticket to her and pay the balance. Both the ticket and the balance  a cheque for Rs 7,058  will reach the passenger in four-five days, said an airline official.																								The official blamed procedural delay for the compensation not reaching Krishna yet.																								The woman, who was travelling with her elder son Naval and his family, was asked to get off the flight in Delhi as her ticket had been cancelled because of a technical error.																								After reaching Delhi airport, the family went through the security check and collected boarding passes before getting onto the bus on way to the aircraft.																								The airline staff did not tell us anything while we were collecting the boarding passes, recalled Naval.																								After getting off the bus, Krishna and Navals daughters boarded the flight first. While Naval was climbing the stairs to enter the aircraft, an airline official came running and told him that his mother could not fly as her ticket had been cancelled.																								When Naval protested saying he had not cancelled any ticket, the official blamed the goof-up on a systems error.																								Left with no option, Naval had to pay Rs 8,445 to buy a fresh ticket for his mother.

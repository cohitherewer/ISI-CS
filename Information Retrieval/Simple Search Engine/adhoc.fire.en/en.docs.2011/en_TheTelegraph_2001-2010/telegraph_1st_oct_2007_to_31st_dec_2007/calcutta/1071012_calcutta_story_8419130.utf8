				 Off to school in Raj Bhavan
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A school set up to educate only the offspring of Raj Bhavan employees has opened its doors to underprivileged children.																								Thirty-five homeless children have been admitted to the pre-primary school on the Raj Bhavan premises in an effort to integrate them into mainstream education.																								The children  from areas including Babughat, Strand Road and Sealdah  have been selected by Calcutta Samaritans, a non-government organisation.																								They were studying at a centre run by our organisation. But we wanted to admit them to a school so they could get into mainstream education, said Moumita Adak, the campaign coordinator of Calcutta Samaritans.																								We are through with the paperwork. Classes will start shortly, said Sushil Bhattacharya, the headmaster of the school, which follows both Bengali and Hindi as the medium of instruction.																								Adak is, however, worried over the uniform. The school authorities have provided books to the children. But who will give them the uniforms? None of the children can afford a school uniform, she said.																								The children are from families without a permanent address. Its encouraging that their parents, though uneducated, want their children to study, she said.

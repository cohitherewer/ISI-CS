				 Drunks push man to death from roof
 A STAFF REPORTER			The spot of the death in the Regent Park area. Picture by Aranya			 Sen		A 32-year-old man was killed while trying to calm down five drunk youths in the Regent Park area on Vijaya Dashami. 																								The youths pushed Subhasish Sen, a trader, off the roof of a three-storeyed building under construction. He touched a live wire while falling to the ground and was electrocuted.																								One of the youths, Tapan Das, tried to save Subhasish and fell to the ground from the roof. He is in a serious condition.																								The five, all of whom supply building material in the area, were using abusive language while drinking on the roof of the Sarat Pally building. Around 12.30am, Subhasish, who lived and worked next door, had gone up to the roof with two of his friends to persuade the youths to stop screaming obscenities.																								The five picked a fight with the trio, which resulted in a scuffle. In the melee, Subhasish was pushed off the roof.																								Raja Mahisya, a local resident, said: Subhasish and Tapan were taken to MR Bangur Hospital, where Subhasish was declared dead.																								Police have detained the youths who were drinking on the roof. South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said they are being interrogated to find out who pushed Subhasish.																								Subhasish is survived by his widowed mother, two sisters and a brother. As soon as the news of the death reached the house, Subhasishs younger brother Santu fell ill. He had to be admitted to hospital, said Sudipta Saha, a neighbour of the family.																								We cannot believe that Subhasish died in such a manner. After his father passed away, he worked very hard to run his business and support his family, he added.

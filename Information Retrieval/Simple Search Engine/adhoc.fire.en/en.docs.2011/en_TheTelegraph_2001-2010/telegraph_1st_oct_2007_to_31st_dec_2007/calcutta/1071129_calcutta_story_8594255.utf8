		 Caprice and colour																																	Babita Das, in her early stance as printmaker, dealt with urban complexities expressed in technical simplicity, exuding boldness, solidity and dexterity. Gradually, this urban form disappeared as she took to painting, and colour became far more evident as she got free reign to play with textures. In Cascade, her ongoing solo exhibition, it is the theatre of agile colours that arrests the eye. Whether it is the small works on paper, or the bigger paintings on canvas, all are peopled by dazzling red and yellow with brown, blue, black and white. No less riveting are the monochromatic drawings in ink on narrow horizontal or vertical strips of paper. Faces, foliage and even fish are transformed into sly, capricious patterns as forms are broken into brief and breezy lines. She displays a keen knowledge of details; something which can be attributed to the cunning of the trained feminine gaze. Babitas brush is the magic wand which breathes life into the acrylic, conjuring an exciting sport of tones and textures, shapes and space, scratches and fluent lines.

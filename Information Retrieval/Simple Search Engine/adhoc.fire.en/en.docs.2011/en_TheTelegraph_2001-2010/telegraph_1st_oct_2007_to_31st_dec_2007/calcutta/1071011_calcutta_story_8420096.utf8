				 Police duo thrash man, snatch cash
 A STAFF REPORTERTwo policemen  sergeant Mahan Mukherjee and driver S. Parvat  stand accused of assaulting a man and snatching Rs 20,000 from him on Chittaranjan Avenue on Tuesday night.																								Ajit Baran Hazra, a Digha resident, was carrying the cash for the treatment of his father, admitted in Calcutta Medical Research Institute.																								He lodged a complaint with Girish Park police station, following which the two cops were tracked down and arrested. An officer said the duo are from the wireless wing.																								The loss of face for Calcutta police comes at a time when the force is smarting under the fallout of Rizwanur Rahmans mysterious death.																								Hazra said in his complaint that he had come to the city for his fathers treatment. On Tuesday night, the doctors at CMRI prescribed some urgent tests for his father. Hazra rushed to a friends house on Beadon Street, in north Calcutta, to collect money for the tests, said an officer of Girish Park police station.																								He boarded a taxi at 9.30pm on his way back to the hospital. Near the Girish Park Metro Railway station, on Chittaranjan Avenue, a Calcutta police Gypsy intercepted the taxi. Parvat asked Hazra to get off and meet his boss, who was sitting in the jeep, the officer added.																								Hazra thought it wise to follow the drivers instruction. As I approached Mukherjee, he ordered me to get into the Gypsy, Hazra said in his complaint. On seeing that I was in two minds, the cops threatened to arrest me on the false charge of visiting the adjoining red-light area.																								As soon as a frightened Hazra boarded the car, Parvat pressed on the accelerator. Mukherjee slapped me repeatedly. I pleaded with him to let me go, as I needed to reach hospital fast. But he ignored my plea and kept demanding money, Hazra alleged.																								He refused. Mukherjee then asked Parvat to stop the car and the two forcibly took out the money from Hazras pocket. They then threw him off the vehicle. Before I could raise an alarm, the two sped off, Hazra recalled.																								He was standing on the road, when a group of bystanders walked up to him and suggested that he lodge a police complaint immediately.																								We first checked the duty schedule of the evening shift and identified the vehicle. The two policemen were asked to state their location at the time of the incident. They failed to provide any satisfactory answer. We then arrested the duo and produced them before Hazra, who identified both, said an officer.

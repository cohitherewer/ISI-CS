				 Sleuths gear up for Todi
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Satish Golcha, deputy inspector-general, CBI. Picture by Amit Datta																								The CBI has examined 90 persons and recorded the statements of 65 of them in the first seven days of the probe into the death of Rizwanur Rahman. But his father-in-law, Ashok Todi, is yet to face a full-fledged grilling session.																								Some CBI sleuths had an informal preliminary chat with the businessman on Tuesday, the same morning that his daughter Priyankas statements were recorded. 																								Before sitting face-to-face with Todi, we want to be properly armed with all information so that we can counter him during the interrogation, said a CBI official.																								We will call him as and when required. We cant say anything more than that, CBI joint director Arun Kumar told Metro over phone from Delhi.																								The CBI is said to be examining the medical records of Ashok Todi, who allegedly feigned a heart attack to ensure the return of Priyanka from Rizwanurs house.																								Metro lists what the agency would want to know from the businessman.																								Use of money power 																								During his interrogation, Ashoks brother Pradip Todi told CBI officials that Rizwanurs family members had been paid money to ensure Priyankas return to her parents. The Rahmans have refuted the charge.																								We will cross-check with Ashok Todi to ascertain the veracity of the claim. We are also collecting details of bank accounts of Rizwanurs family members, said a CBI official.																								Use of muscle power																								Both Rizwanur and Priyanka had mentioned threats from antisocials in a letter to Ajoy Kumar, then deputy commissioner of police (detective department). In their statements, Rizwanurs family members have alleged that Syed Hasan Ali, Pappu and Abdul Majid were pressuring Priyanka to go back to her parents.																								Ashok Todis version about the involvement of these people will be critical to the case, said a CBI official. 																								Chronology of events																								Different theories have reached the CBI sleuths about the turn of events that made Priyanka return to her parents, on September 8, from Lalbazar.																								We will try to understand the factors behind her return to Salt Lake. Ashok Todis statement can also prove the role of Calcutta police officials in the case, said a CBI official.

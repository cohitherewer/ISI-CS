				 Puja panels unite to lend helping hand 
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE																								Several puja committees in and around the city, some NGOs and a few police officers have come together for the uplift of underprivileged children and destitute patients. 																								The committee formed for the project, including committees of large pujas like that in Sreebhumi Sporting Club, has collected funds by cutting down on puja expenditure.																								The main problem we face in doing social work is reaching out to the grassroots. The clubs that hold the pujas know their area intimately. We wanted to involve them for grassroots penetration, said Subir Dey, who heads an NGO that works with children and is the coordinator of the project.																								He claimed that nearly 2,000 children will benefit from the project. According to the plan, the clubs will provide night shelter to the children and help in educating them. Some clubs in Tiljala are providing night-shelter to boys who work in a local factory. They were being harassed mentally and sexually. The children now spend their nights in the safety of the club room, said Dey.																								We have formed a committee with representatives from local police stations and clubs. Though nearly 500 clubs had expressed interest in the project we have selected only 200, he added.																								Puja must provide a platform for social activities throughout the year, said Samir Dey of Purba Barisha Sitalatala Club, which has joined the project and is trying to provide shelter to children. Such endeavours hold out a glimmer of hope for people like part-time driver Sibu Patra. His 19-year-old daughter Ratna, a first-year student of Jogmaya Devi College, suffers from an acute kidney problem and needs to be operated upon immediately. Sibu, with a monthly income of about Rs 1,500, cannot foot the Rs 1.8-lakh surgery bill.																								The Patras approached an NGO for help. Its officials wrote to the puja committees in south Calcutta for help. About 50 puja committees have promised to provide funds. Some have already contributed, said Utpal Roy, the secretary of the NGO.																								The club members are happy. There is no greater satisfaction than saving a life. We have handed over our contribution to Patra, said Bhaskar Majumder, the secretary of Samajsebi Club at Deshapriya Park.

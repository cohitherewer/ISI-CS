		 Sacred heresies																																	Based in Israel, the United States and France, internationally reputed Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai has a body of work that has been appreciated by juries and audiences alike. His films probe into layers of cultural history in West Asia. Kadosh (a still from the film appears right), meaning sacred, attempts to underline the hypocrisies practised by the patriarchal society. The film is a part of the trilogy set in Mea Sherim, the ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of Jerusalem. Meir and Rivka have been married for 10 years, but will have to divorce as they have failed to produce a child. Malka, Rivkas sister, is in love with Yaakov, who has chosen to live outside the community. The Rabbi decides that Malka will marry Yossef, his assistant. While Rivka falls prey to solitude, Malka chooses another path: rebellion. The film addresses universal themes; among them are the demands of an orthodox religion and the suffering of those men and women whose faith comes before love, but whose culture lacks a vocabulary for expressing personal pain. The film has won acclaim at the international film festivals of Cannes, Toronto and Teleride, besides being a commercial success. To be preceded by the screening of Music School and a Boy (dir: Bimal Majumder).

				 Hunt on for 25 rioters
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The detective department of Calcutta police has drawn up a list of around 25 people and started conducting raids in various parts of Calcutta and its adjoining districts.																								We have arrested around 70 people in connection with the violence, including All India Minority Forum president Idris Ali, said an officer of the detective department, which is probing the flare-up that brought the city to a halt last Wednesday. 																								The arrested persons, now behind bars, have been slapped with various non-bailable charges, like rioting, attempt to murder and damaging private and government properties. 																								The police, however, did not contest the bail pleas of around 54 persons, arrested before the violence erupted, who were freed on Saturday. 																								We have prepared a list on the basis of intelligence inputs and interrogation of those already behind bars, said the officer, adding that around 200 other perpetrators of last Wednesdays violence remain to be identified. 																								According to the police, most of these people have criminal antecedents and have affiliation to various political parties, including the ruling CPM. 																								A significant number of these people were from the adjacent districts and they fled after the army flag march. Investigations have revealed these people fled by using the EM Bypass-Park Circus connector and Kustia Road, leading towards Tiljala. We are trying to identify them by coordinating with local police stations, said an officer. 																								In the past 24 hours, the police arrested Sheikh Dulara, Mohammad Salauddin and Sheikh Zahirul from the Karaya-Beniapukur area. All of them were produced in court and remanded in police custody till December 3, said deputy commissioner (south division) Jawed Shamim.

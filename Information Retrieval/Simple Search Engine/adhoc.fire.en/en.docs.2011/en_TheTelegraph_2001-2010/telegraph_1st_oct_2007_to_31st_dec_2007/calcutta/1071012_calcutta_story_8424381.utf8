				 Madarsa offices ransacked
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								A group of members of the West Bengal Madarsa Students Union raided the office of the state madarsa board and ransacked the rooms of several officials on Thursday.																								The students were protesting the boards alleged failure to take steps to declare the Kamil course on a par with graduation courses of other universities.																								Board officials said around 10 members of the union, accompanied by some outsiders, barged into the presidents room and ransacked the TV set, computer and furniture.																								The students had not sought an appointment. Led by union general secretary Siamat Ali, they forcibly entered my chamber and started ransacking furniture and other items. They later entered the rooms of other officials and destroyed furniture there, said Sohrab Hussain, the board president. The board has lodged an FIR with Taltala police station.																								Ali said the board had promised the students last year that it would take steps to declare the Kamil course equivalent to a graduation course. That would have enabled a large number of Muslim students passing the Kamil course to seek jobs through the school service commission, he said.																								Ali alleged that board officials refused to meet the delegation on Thursday. This infuriated some of the students, he added.

				 Cheaper land option for tech firms
 															- 160 acres three km away from Rajarhat will help scale down crore-an-acre price tag SOHINI MOOKHERJEA																								The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has finally worked out a way to offer land to information technology (IT) majors at below a-crore-an-acre mark. 																								Wipro, Infosys and ITC Infotech, which have been demanding lower land rates for some time, now have the option of setting up shop on a 330-acre complex in Jagadishpur, on the eastern fringes of the city. 																								Hidco was asking for Rs 2.16 crore per acre in Rajarhat. It brought down the price to Rs 1.5 crore per acre. But even that was too high. So we had to offer cheaper options to the companies, said a senior IT department official. 																								A consortium, led by city-based Forum Projects, will develop the Jagadishpur township, barely three km from the IT park in Rajarhat. The IT department had floated the tender and invited expressions of interest from realtors. 																								We will give 160 acres to the IT department, which they can allot to any company. In the remaining 170 acres, we will develop a township with residential estates, clubs, hotels and retail space, said Rahul Saraf, the managing director of Forum Projects.																								According to him, the company will invest Rs 1,300 crore in the project in the next four to five years. About Rs 200 crore will be spent on creating basic infrastructure, which will be ready in 18 to 24 months. To meet the deadline, the consortium has started land acquisition for the project.																								We think the economics of the project will allow selling of land at below Rs 1 crore an acre, said the IT department source. He also hinted that the government may absorb a part of the cost to sweeten the deal for the companies. 																								IT minister Debesh Das, however, declined to comment on the price at Jagadishpur. We are trying our best to offer land to the firms, Das told Metro. 																								Supply of land for IT companies is lagging behind demand, with Rajarhat out of bounds because of the price factor and Sector V and the IT special economic zone in Bantala sold out. 																								We are keen on expansion and want land close to the airport and our current site in Sector V. But we are yet to hear from the government about the new site, said Sudip Banerjee, the president (enterprise solution and chief strategist) of Wipro Technologies. 																								Banerjee, on an earlier visit to Calcutta, had pointed out that Wipro expected the government to offer a competitive price, in the range of Rs 50 lakh to Rs 60 lakh an acre. Infosys and ITC Infotech had also placed similar demands before the government.

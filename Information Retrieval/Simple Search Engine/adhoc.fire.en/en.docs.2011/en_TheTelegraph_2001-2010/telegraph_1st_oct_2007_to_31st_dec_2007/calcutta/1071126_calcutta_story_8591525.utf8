				 Landfill tag on realty sprawl
				 - Survey accuses project of encroaching on waterbody 				 JAYANTA BASU				 																																																											A survey by a state department has accused South City, a realty project off Prince Anwar Shah Road, of possessing land more than what it had purchased, thereby hinting that it had encroached on Bikramgarh Jheel.				 																																																											The survey was conducted by the state land and land reforms department on a plea from the environment department, which has received several complaints of landfill against the project.				 																																																											We have received the survey report and handed it over to Calcutta High Court, state environment secretary M.L. Meena said on Sunday.				 																																																											The court is hearing two cases on the allegations against South City.				 																																																											The project authorities, however, denied the charge of encroaching on Bikramgarh Jheel. There is a waterbody between our land and the jheel. Hence, the question of filling up the jheel doesnt arise, said Sushil Mohta, a spokesperson for South City. We have conveyed to the court our response to the survey report.				 																																																											The report (a copy of which is with Metro) states that South City is occupying 0.99 acres of excess area (0.40 acres of excess land and 0.59 acres of excess waterbody).				 																																																											It has also recommended that the excess solid land be immediately converted back into waterbody the waterbody area may be properly identified and demarcated by the survey team, thus keeping the total area in the possession of South City Project to 31.14 acres (29.83 acres land+1.31 acres of waterbody), as purchased by the realtors.				 																																																											The survey has found almost no discrepancies in the the boundary on the eastern, western and northern sides of the project land. Hinting at the landfill, the report states: The only scope for increase in solid land is on the southern side, where Bikramgarh Jheel is located, where the survey area was not found to be matching.				 																																																											Several individuals, NGOs, government departments and agencies, and state-appointed panels had stated that the project had encroached on the jheel. 				 																																																											The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the state fisheries department were among those who had raised the allegation.

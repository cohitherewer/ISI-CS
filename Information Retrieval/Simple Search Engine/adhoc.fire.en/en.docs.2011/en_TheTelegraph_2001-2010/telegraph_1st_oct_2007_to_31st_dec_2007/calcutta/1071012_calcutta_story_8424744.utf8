 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 LIC official Mukesh Dasgupta at Bhabani Bhavan on Thursday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								Contract killer Krishna Debnath entered the Sodepur apartment of LIC official Mukesh Dasgupta with an intention of killing him.																								But the moment he stepped in, he found himself pinned down by two policemen, their 9-mm pistols trained on his temple.																								The sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Krishna, in his 20s, in Dasguptas apartment on Wednesday night and also tracked down the person who had reportedly hired him.																								Bikramjit Bhattacharya, the alleged mastermind, was picked up from his Sheoraphuli home. The police said Bikramjit had paid Krishna Rs 50,000 to kill the LIC official. The entire amount has been recovered.																								Rajeev Kumar, the deputy inspector-general (operations) of CID, said the sleuths were tipped off when Krishna started a hunt for two gangsters a few weeks ago. Initially we heard Krishna was trying to recruit criminals for his gang. But while pursuing the tip-off, we came to know that he had targeted Dasgupta, posted in LICs Chandni Chowk headquarters, and was looking for hitmen.																								The sleuths planted two of their sources who approached Krishna in Habra, North 24-Parganas, a couple of weeks ago, posing as sharpshooters.																								Krishna hired them for Rs 1 lakh and revealed to them his plan to kill Dasgupta on Mahalaya night. Our men briefed their superiors about Krishnas conspiracy. Two officers were sent to Dasguptas flat on D-day. Krishna walked into our trap, accompanied by two aides who were our men, said an officer.																								The officers of the CIDs Special Operations Group learnt that Bikramjits realtor brother Nandadulal had been murdered three years ago in the Regent Park area. Bikramjit was the nominee of the realtors LIC policy of Rs 20 lakh. Dasgupta helped him get the money, said an officer.																								On Dasguptas advice, Bikramjit had invested the entire amount in shares and suffered huge losses. He accused Dasgupta of engineering the loss and demanded a payback. When Dasgupta refused, Bikramjit decided to take revenge, the officer added.

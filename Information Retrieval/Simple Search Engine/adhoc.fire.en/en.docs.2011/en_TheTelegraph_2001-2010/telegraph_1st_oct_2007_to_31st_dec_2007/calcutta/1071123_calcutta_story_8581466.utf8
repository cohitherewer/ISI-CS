				 Tech tips for principals
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The principals of several city schools are being initiated into the tech revolution sweeping the field of education.																								The Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM) on Thursday conducted a workshop on new tech tools in education for principals and senior officials of the schools. 																								The tools can be used both in classrooms and outside.																								The principals and officials were given a profile of course-management software like Blackboard, Moodle, Open Source and Second Life, which are used extensively in the West. They help develop the creative ability of the child and also keep him/her engaged in the process of learning, said Sudipa Banerjee, a senior lecturer at IISWBM.																								The participants were also introduced to concepts like Web 2, vortals (vertical portals), podcasting, open source learning management systems and wireless communication as a medium for imparting education.																								The half-day workshop was part of a series of workshops being organised by the institute for teachers and principals. The workshops cover a range of issues, including technology, counselling and vocational guidance.																								The new concepts will enable the schools to play a more effective role in shaping the future of their students, said Banerjee.																								The teachers should learn new technologies to hold the interest of the students, who are becoming tech-savvy, she added.																								The principals and senior officials of Calcutta International School, Delhi Public School, Ashok Hall, Ballygunge Siksha Sadan and La Martiniere for Girls, among other institutes, attended the workshop.

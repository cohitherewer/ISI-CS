				 Pass to ease traffic clog 
 															- Initial work done A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The Jessore Road stretch under Patipukur rail bridge, where an underpass is to be built. The project was okayed six years ago. Picture by Amit Datta																								 Executive Bimal Roy spends an hour every day caught in a traffic snarl under Patipukur railway bridge on the way to office and back.																								 Sayantani Dhar, a student of Medical College and Hospital, passes the Jessore Road stretch at different times but has to remain stuck in a jam for just as long. 																								The traffic nightmare for the two could soon be over if a six-year-old plan to build an underpass at Patipukur takes shape. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has been given 18 months to complete the project.																								The bidding process is over. We have made a thorough survey of the area and hope to start work in December, said Debdas Bhattacharya, the chief engineer (traffic and transportation), CMDA.																								Officials of the agency said precautions are being taken to ensure the underpass does not end up like the one adjacent to Dum Dum Junction, where a short spell of rain causes waterlogging for days.																								Calcutta Improvement Trust was initially given the responsibility of building the Patipukur underpass as a part of the megacity project. PWD minister Kshiti Goswami and sports minister Subhas Chakraborty laid the foundation stone in March 2001. The six-year delay has increased the project cost from Rs 6 crore to Rs 19 crore.																								A CMDA official said about 1,619 sq metres of land would be required for the underpass. Nearly Rs 5 crore has been paid to the plot-owners. 																								Unlike in the case of the Dum Dum underpass, the sewage lines around the proposed underpass have been laid in advance. The basic work is over. We are confident of meeting the deadline, added Bhattacharya.																								Traffic is heavy on the stretch because it connects the north of the city with RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and the Belgachhia Metro Railway station. Despite Jessore Road being widened from two to four lanes, the stretch under Patipukur rail bridge is narrow, creating a bottleneck.

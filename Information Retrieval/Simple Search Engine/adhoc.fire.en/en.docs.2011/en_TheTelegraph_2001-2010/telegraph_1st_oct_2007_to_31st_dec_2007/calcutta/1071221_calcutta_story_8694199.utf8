																								School students and their parents faced harassment on Thursday, as more than 6,000 pool cars stayed off the road as part of the indefinite strike called by the Car Pool Owners Association of West Bengal.
																								The pool cars did not report in the morning to pick up the students from their homes. As a result, parents had to ferry their children to and from school.
																								Pool cars are creating more problems than they are solving. Both of us are working and we completely depend on the service to take our son to school and bring him back. Instead of educating the drivers on safety issues, the car pool authorities are harassing parents, said Sudeshna Sen, a resident of Jodhpur Park, whose son studies in Class VII in Birla High School. 
																								The Car Pool Owners Association of West Bengal, however, is unmoved by the harassment faced by parents and their children. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused but we must protest the highhandedness of the public vehicles department (PVD) and police. We have decided to continue with our strike till the transport minister intervenes, said Santanu Saha, the secretary of the association.
																								It has decided not to follow the guidelines that were laid down by the transport department for pool cars in July. 
																								Following the recent pool car accidents, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray expressed concern over the service used by schoolchildren. We have asked the traffic police to keep an eye on drivers using cellphones while driving, he said at Writers Buildings on Thursday.
																								Parents can, however, heave a sigh of relief, as the schools will be closing down for Christmas.

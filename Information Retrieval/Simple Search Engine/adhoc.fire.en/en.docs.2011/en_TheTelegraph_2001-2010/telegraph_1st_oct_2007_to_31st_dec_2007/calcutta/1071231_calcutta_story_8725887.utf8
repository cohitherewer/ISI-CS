																								For me, this tour meant that I could show my city the exact high one gets out of performing with Pandit Ravi Shankar. Musically, thats really the pinnacle. Its not just the music, but the entire experience of playing with him. Panditji had been wanting to come to our city for a long time. All through our tours of the US, Panditji used to say: Issh, jodi Kolkatae ektu shonate partam! 
																								From the moment he landed in Calcutta, Panditji was very, very happy. It was a kind of homecoming for him. He kept on asking me about the city  detailed questions about old shops and new flyovers.
																								Norah (Jones) and Anoushka (Shankar) might have been a little irritated at the family being hounded by photographers on the first day, but I explained why Calcutta was so interested in them. Its not only because they are famous by themselves but because theyre part of a lineage called Pandit Ravi Shankar, a cultural icon for the city. They realised the love and warmth that Calcutta has for their father and so they were okay with the attention.
																								Anoushka and Norah were raving about mishti doi, nolen gurer sandesh and nolen gurer rosogolla. Norah was probably taken aback by the traffic jams and the sheer population of the city. But after Saturdays concert, she said she felt very happy being in this city and wanted to come back. Both sisters were most impressed with what they saw at Indian Museum, Victoria Memorial and Swabhumi. They wanted to spend more time here to get a real feel of this city.
																								Every concert with Panditji is a learning experience for me: the presentation, the showmanship, the artistry, the attention to detail. He keeps a tab on everything: from the colour of your kurta to the lighting. He says it should be pleasing to the eyes of the audience. Its not just the music; its also the art of showcasing the best of what you are.
																								Till an hour before Saturdays concert, Anoushka and I didnt know what Panditji was going to play. As expected  and this only happens in Mumbai and Calcutta  much of the front row at Calcutta Club comprised the entire classical circuit of the city. That made Anoushka and me very nervous. In a way, Anoushka had to prove a point in Calcutta  you have to perform and get appreciation from the artistes who excel in the arts.
																								The performance was brilliant. Panditjis genuine joy about being in the city was reflected in his music and he performed for almost two hours without a major break. For me, the concert symbolised two generations of unique sitar players and the unique experience of playing with both.

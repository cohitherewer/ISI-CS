				 A club bond of blood
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								Its a club with a difference. By becoming a member, you can not only save lives of others, but also your own. The only entry criteria: a negative blood group.																								On June 14 (International Voluntary Blood Donors Day), Calcutta got a negative blood group club, courtesy Medical Bank, a voluntary organisation based in Rasik Ghosh Lane, north Calcutta.																								We started with 200 members. The response has been good so far. We are trying to spread our network in the districts and the neighbouring states. I dont think there is any other club like this in India, said D. Ashis, the secretary of Medical Bank, which has been collecting blood for nearly three decades. 																								According to Ashis, the idea of the club took shape after the Medical Bank members decided to do something about the insecurity among the people with negative blood groups. Negative blood groups are rare compared to positive blood groups. Hence, people with a negative blood group and their relatives live in fear, explained Ashis. 																								Even we have had to turn away people who approached us for negative blood. The club will help people with negative blood group, added Ashis.																								Members of the club campaign in the districts to collect negative blood. We have got a good response in South and North 24-Parganas, East and West Midnapore and Hooghly. Relatives of patients from Bangladesh and Nepal are also contacting us for negative-group blood. Whenever relatives of patients face problems in procuring negative blood, the hospitals refer them to us, said Ashis.																								The patients and relatives in Bangladesh and Nepal are asked to send names and contact details of people with a negative blood group in their countries. We are also issuing identity cards to people of negative blood groups so that they can easily get help in case of an emergency, said Ashis.																								Call 25540084 and 9831062157 to enlist as a member of the club.

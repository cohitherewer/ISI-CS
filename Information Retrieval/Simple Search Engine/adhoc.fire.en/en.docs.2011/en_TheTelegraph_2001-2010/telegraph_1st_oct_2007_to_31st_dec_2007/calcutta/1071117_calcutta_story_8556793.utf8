				 Stay-cool tips for all CATs
 															- Ahead of entrance test on Sunday, students being advised to de-stress CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE																								The rigour is over, now relax till you get the test paper on Sunday morning. 																								In the countdown to Sundays common admission test (CAT)  the entrance test for the six Indian institutes of management (IIMs) and a host of other B-schools  the training institutes have issued a chill pill advisory to students. 																								We are asking our students to take it easy before the exam, said Kaushik Kapoor of Erudite, a training institute specialising in B-school entrance tests. 																								As de-stressing is a must in the last hours ahead of the two-and-a-half hour examination, Erudite is screening films  primarily comic films  in its classrooms. 																								With complaints of sleepless nights and nervousness pouring in at various training institutes, the faculty members are dishing out de-stress suggestions to students. 																								At the Triumphant Institute of Management Education (Time), students have been specifically asked not to spend excessive time with books. 																								A movie or a game of cricket are great de-stressing tools at this time, Jaydeep Singh Chowdhury of Time. 																								Vijay Mishra, a B. Com graduate  set to take his first CAT on Saturday  is following the instructions of his faculty members. 																								I did my revisions today. Tomorrow, I intend going out and watching movies, said Mishra, all set for the toughest test of his life. 																								Richa Malhotra is aware of the degree of difficulty in the test, where she will have to compete with over 230,000 students from across country. Around 11,000 students will write the test in Calcutta. 																								I have spent a year preparing for CAT. So much has gone into the preparation. Obviously, I am a bit tense, admitted Richa. 																								Unnecessary tension may affect performance, warned Kapoor. Every year, there is some surprise element in the question paper. It is impossible to predict the pattern change. So, the best strategy is to keep your cool and deliver your best, he summed up.

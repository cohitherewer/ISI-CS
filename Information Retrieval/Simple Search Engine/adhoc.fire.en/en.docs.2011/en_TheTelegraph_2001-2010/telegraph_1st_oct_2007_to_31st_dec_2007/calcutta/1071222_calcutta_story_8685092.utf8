				 Depressed, disowned but saved by cops

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI
																								A call centre worker from the city, pushed to the edge by stress and her mothers death, has found medical care and a shelter, thanks to the efforts of police.
																								Mousumi Dutta, 35, had taken up a job in a Hyderabad call centre in December 2005. A graduate, she had been working in Calcutta but needed to increase her income to pay for the treatment of her cancer-stricken mother.
																								Mousumi struggled to cope with work pressure in Hyderabad and became stressed and depressed. But she had no option but to stay on.
																								About four months back, Mousumi could not take it any more and returned to the city, only to find that her mother had died. Shocked, she left her house in Chetla to stay in a hotel on Park Street. She had no source of income and her relatives abandoned her.
																								Last month, a sub-inspector of New Market police station found Mousumi sitting with her bag outside Indian Museum at night. She told him that the hotel she had been staying in had thrown her out after she had run out of money.
																								The woman was speaking English fluently. I took her to New Market police station in the police van. Woman constables were called to make her comfortable. She spent the night at the police station. Next morning, she narrated her story. All of us were touched, said Siddhartha Chatterjee, the sub-inspector who found Mousumi outside the museum.
																								She told us that her father had died when she was a child and how much she loved her mother. She would often become incoherent while talking about her past and start crying. She would sometimes say that her mother is alive and will find her one day. It was apparent that she was depressed and could commit suicide, added Chatterjee. 
																								According to him, Mousumis mother died of lung cancer in June this year but the relatives did not inform her in Hyderabad. The police contacted the womans relatives in Chetla, but they refused to take her back.
																								With no option left, police officers produced her in Bankshal court and pleaded with the judge to send her to a mental hospital for treatment.
																								After listening to Mousumis story, the judge ordered the superintendent of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital to take custody of the woman and treat her.
																								A doctor at the hospital diagnosed that Mousumi was suffering from acute depression and schizophrenia, stated another officer of the police station.
																								We will request the judge to send Mousumi to an asylum and ensure her rehabilitation, added another officer.

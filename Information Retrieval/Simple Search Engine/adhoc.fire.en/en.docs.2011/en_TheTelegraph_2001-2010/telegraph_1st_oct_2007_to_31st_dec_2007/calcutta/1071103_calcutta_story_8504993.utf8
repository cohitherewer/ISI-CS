				 Early-bird rush at plexes
 															- Advance bookings a week ahead for Diwali blockbusters A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bookings open five days in advance for Om Shanti Om																								The Diwali fireworks will go off a week in advance this year, as Sunday becomes the new Wednesday at the multiplexes. If the INOX counters in town are opening advance bookings for Om Shanti Om five days before the November 9 release, Fame (Hiland Park) is doing the same for Saawariya.																								INOX, whose distribution wing is handling the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer in Calcutta, will allow bookings for next Friday and Saturday this Sunday, instead of the usual Wednesday.																								We have had huge queries about Om Shanti Om, says INOX (Forum) general manager Vikas Syal. And given the multiple activities for Diwali, we wanted to help cine-goers plan their festive weekend with time to spare.																								The last time the INOX advance counters opened on a Sunday was for Aamir Khans Rang De Basanti, but then the film had released on a Wednesday.																								Fame, on the other hand, had tried this trick last Diwali for Shah Rukhs Don. This time, the Shringar plex is opening early for Saawariya, the Sanjay Leela Bhansali film introducing Ranbir (Rishi) Kapoor and Sonam (Anil) Kapoor, also releasing on November 9.																								We are expecting big numbers during the Diwali weekend and it makes sense to offer tickets for a few shows next weekend this Sunday, explains a Fame spokesperson. Since the total number of shows is yet to be decided, we wont open full advances.																								The early advance blitz hasnt touched single screens, though. We will open advance bookings as usual on Tuesday, says Arijit Dutta, whose Priya hall will screen Saawariya and whose Star theatre will juggle both the Diwali releases. We used to open advances the preceding Sunday for big movies like Indrajit and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai but we dont see any benefit these days.																								The plexes, of course, think differently. If the hordes of block booking requests  demanding entire shows  are anything to go by, they might just have got it right. And the bottomline for the Bollywood buff this Diwali weekend is: heads I win, tails you lose.

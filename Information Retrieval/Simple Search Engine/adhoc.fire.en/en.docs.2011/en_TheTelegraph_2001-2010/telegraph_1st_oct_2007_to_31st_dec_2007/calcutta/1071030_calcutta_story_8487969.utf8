				 Global tech, local help
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A knowledge processing and outsourcing (KPO) unit in Calcutta is teaching people in the US how to set up and use the latest electronic gadgets.																								The support  in the form of easy-to-understand graphics uploaded on websites  is not restricted by brand. Some malls in the West are using city expertise to teach their customers how to use gadgets of different makes together.																								For example, by logging on to the websites of these malls, a customer can find out what models of DVD players and speakers work best with his TV. Once he buys the components, he can learn with the help of the web graphics which wire goes into which slot and set up a home theatre system.																								The concept, known as consumer electronics parts management, has taken off in the West. City-based Globsyn Technologies provides the background support to some gadget manufacturers and malls that offer the service to customers.																								We have a specialised KPO team handling consumer electronics parts management, said Bikram Dasgupta, the chairman and CEO of Globsyn. The team of 100, which started functioning five years back, has provided the service for 7.8 billion consumer electronic devices.																								Globsyns clients are based in the US. Equipment manufacturers it has handled data for include Sony, Pioneer, Samsung, Whirlpool, Sharp and Panasonic. Best Buy is one of the large conglomerates that has employed Globsyn, which is planning to expand its KPO operations to Europe, the Far East, West Asia and Australia.																								There is not much demand for electronics parts management in India. The market will take time to develop, said Dasgupta.

				 Spare strokes of beauty
														 eyewitness				 	 A work by Ganesh Haloi on display at Sanskriti Gallery				 																								Blessed is the artist who matures with age and develops a language as spare and as expressive as a haiku. There are few Indian artists who can be described thus, Ganesh Haloi being an exception. The countryside of Bengal and the severe geometry of Rajasthans architecture have in the most part acted as his creative stimulus but this seemingly limited repertoire has not cramped Halois style. Instead this artist in his 70s seems to device countless ways of turning this apparent limitation to his advantage. His exhibition at Sanskriti Gallery proves this.																								Haloi has developed a visual code whereby a few strokes of a brush and even the merest dot on a sheet of vertical white paper become suggestive of a paddy field, shrubs and the entire geography of region. Halois art has always been sophisticated and contemplative but now he has taken this refinement to such rarefied heights that a dab of grey and a few craggy lines conjures up a vision of the monsoon clouds moving ponderously over parched plains, and a gust of unruly wind announcing the arrival of the rains. The gallery should be congratulated on bringing out a catalogue of rare beauty designed by the artist himself.			A work by Amritah SenWhen Pradip Maitra had joined Government Art College in the late 1970s, he had seen the painting of a steam engine in a friends house. This painting was a life-long influence. In those days the huge car shed was close to what was Ultadanga rail station (now Bidhannagar station) and this area extending to Tallah bridge became Maitras studio. He had spent years there amidst the huge engines, bogeys, piles of ash, smoke and dust. Maitra developed a bondage with these gigantic machines. Over the years he has painted these mechanical monsters obsessively.																								Maitras recent exhibition at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture is the fruit of his closeness to these harbingers of industrialisation in England and subsequently in India. They have become museum pieces but Maitra chose to exhibit only steam engines painted in water colour in the early years of his career.																								The artist had few shades to chose from, grey and black being the dominant colours. The works are all in a very large format but skilled watercolourist that he is, Maitra has been able to retain transparency throughout.																								In most of these works, the engine is depicted upclose, when the details of its mechanism are clearly delineated. Maitra captures the heat and dust and tumult that these engines leave in their wake. In some exhibits, however, the train is seen from afar, racing through a gray void. But Maitras skill notwithstanding, steam engines and only steam engines can be a drag.																								Amritah Sen loves to break readymade formats, and this is once again evident from her exhibition at Gandhara Art Gallery. After a long time she has combined both watercolour and collage in her recent works. Animals with human attributes appear in them. She talks about her personal preferences in books and TV channels and a lot of humour seeps in, an element that is non-existent in most artists.																								Serpents, crocs, zebras and tigers people her work in a manner that projects her love of cartoons and at the same time parodies this medium. She exploits a whole range of media and comes up with something new that she can claim as her own. Amritah has the intelligence to use whatever is trendy and cocking a snook at them at the same time. 						SOUMITRA DAS

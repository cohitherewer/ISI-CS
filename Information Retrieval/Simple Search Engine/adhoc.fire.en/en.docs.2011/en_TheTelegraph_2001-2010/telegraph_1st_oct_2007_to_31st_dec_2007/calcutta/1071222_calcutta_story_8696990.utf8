nAn eight-year-old boy, identified as Danish, was kidnapped by his uncle from the Karaya area on Friday evening. Minutes after the crime, the kidnapper called up the boys house but did not demand any ransom. He said his wife was at Danishs home and he could not meet her. He also said he would send the boy home only if his wife returned to him. A preliminary probe revealed that Sheikh Raju, a resident of Ahiripukur Lane, married two sisters (names withheld) a couple of years ago. Last month, his father-in-law came to his house after one of Rajus wives complained of him torturing her. He took the woman back to his Chamru Khansama Lane residence. Raju picked up Danish from his in-laws doorstep.

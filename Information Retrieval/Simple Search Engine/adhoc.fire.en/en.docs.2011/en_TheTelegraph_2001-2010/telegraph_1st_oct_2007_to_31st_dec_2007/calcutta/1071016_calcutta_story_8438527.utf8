				 Neighbours erupt on womens team
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 A neighbour of the Rahmans protests the visit by the womens commission. Picture by Amit Datta																								After the chief minister, it was the turn of the state womens commission members to face the wrath of the neighbours of Rizwanur Rahman.																								Waving black flags and posters  one of which read Mahila Commission purchased by Ashok Todi  women of Tiljala Lane tried to block the six panel members on their way to Rizwanurs home on Monday afternoon.																								The residents had raised slogans against Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and banged their fists on his car when he came calling on Saturday.																								The Rahmans neighbours protested the commissions decision to meet Rizwanurs widow Priyanka Todi first before calling on his mother and brother.																								The Rahmans, too, expressed their disappointment over the decision. They also refused to accept what Priyanka reportedly told panel members at her Salt Lake home on October 9.																								We have heard Priyanka told the commission that she went back to her parents on her own. Yeh jhoot hai. Had that been the case, why did she have to go to Lalbazar first and then to her parents house? asked Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan. I told the panel members to help me get justice. Why have the accused police officers not been removed from their posts? she added.																								With Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur away at the high court, the family members told the panel they would like to hear from Priyanka at a press conference, where they, too, would be present.																								The panel members, led by chairperson Jasodhara Bagchi, later said the Rahmans statements were at variance with what Priyanka had said. There are contradictions, said Bagchi.																								Months ago, when bombs were hurled in front of the chief ministers residence, the Karaya officer-in-charge was immediately transferred. But in this case, no action has been taken against the guilty officers, rued Rizwanurs uncle Mohitur Rahman.

				 Bouquet of tribute to Tagore
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								A tribute to Tagore, with a difference.																								Ten singers, 24 songs, a 64-member philharmonic-level orchestra, translations rolling on huge screens  Tagore Symphony will come to town at the Science City auditorium on Saturday evening, courtesy KC Das Private Ltd and Anandabazar Patrika.																								The bouquet of songs, which packs in lyrics from Geetabitan, has been conceptualised by Ranjon Ghosal, of Mohiner Ghoraguli fame.																								The germs of the concept lay in an English play (Tagore on Tagore: Crisis in Civilisation) that Ghosal was commissioned to write by the Bangalore-based Artistes Repertory Theatre after the Gujarat riots.																								Songs in the tribute will include Bidhir badhon katbe tumi, Ekla cholo re, Amaar mukti aloi aloi, Aguner parashmoni, Je raate mor duarguli, Aaj jyotsna raate and Aakash bhora surya tara. Mohan Singh, Manoj and Manisha Murali Nair and Sraboni Sen will be among the singers.																								Abraham Mazumder will conduct the orchestra.																								The concert spawned by the Gujarat riots will hit the city close on the heels of the Nandigram killings. All we can do is sing. Were not trying to teach anyone any lesson... Bengal is not far away from Gujarat any more, said Ghosal.

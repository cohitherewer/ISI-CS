				 A masseuse among Tigers
 															- INDIAN CRICKET LEAGUE TEAM HAS A WINNER DALIA MUKHERJEE				 	 RUB IT RIGHT: Heidi Hill and the Calcutta Tigers on the CC amp;FC lawns. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								A svelte blonde in a track suit massaging the backs and necks of men sprawled on the lush lawns of Calcutta Cricket and Football Club (CC amp;FC).																								Stretch forward and back, she calls out to Subhamoy Das, a cub among Calcutta Tigers.																								Meet Heidi Hill, sports masseuse of the team from the east for the Indian Cricket League.																								Heidi was in town for a week-long, pre-league camp that started on November 16. 																								The British citizen, settled in Sydney, has trained in sport and remedial massage from the London School of Sports Massage and has worked with sportsmen from various fields, including tennis, football, hockey, athletics, rugby and baseball.																								It was through Australian fitness guru Jock Campbell that Heidi got her assignment as a fitness assistant with Calcutta Tigers, said the fitness freak, sitting upright through the interview on a sofa in a hotel lobby. 																								Heidi, who has worked with the likes of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Nathan Bracken and Brad Haddin, was excited to be with Indian cricketers. My experience in cricket has mostly been with regional teams in Australia, like New South Wales and Easts Cricket Club, said Heidi.																								Was it awkward for the boys in black and red to have a masseuse among them? Oh, we are all professionals here and Heidi did her job well. The bowlers in our team have reaped the benefits from her work, said Deep Dasgupta.																								Heidi said: They made me feel very welcome in the team. She found Rohan Gavaskar the most cordial.																								According to her, cricketers have a lot of stiff muscles. Cricket is a one-sided game. Bowlers and batsmen use their stronger side repeatedly and there is also a lot of running around. This results in wear and tear of the arm and leg muscles. I have had to administer deep tissue massage to heal the scarred tissues, she said.																								Amongst all the hard work, there was never a dull moment with the boys. She has earned the sobriquet Tigress, because of a 15-year-old tattoo on her right shoulder. It seems like I was destined to work with Calcutta Tigers, she laughed.

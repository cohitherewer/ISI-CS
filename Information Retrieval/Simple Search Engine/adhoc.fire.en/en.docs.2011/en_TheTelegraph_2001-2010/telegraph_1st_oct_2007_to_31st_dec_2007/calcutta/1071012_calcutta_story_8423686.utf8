				 Pre-results script scan 
 															- JU REVIEW POLICY SHIFT OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Engineering students at Jadavpur University (JU) will be shown their answer scripts before the declaration of results.																								Once the preview system is introduced in the 2008-09 academic session, the review system  examinees appealing for re-evaluation of scripts after the publication of results  will be abolished.																								The decision, taken by the universitys faculty council on Thursday, awaits formal approval of the executive council.																								We expect the preview system will make the evaluation process more transparent, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the council of the engineering faculty.																								As part of the preview system, the university will set up a cell where students can register complaints if they are not satisfied with the marks.																								Officials manning the cell will examine each complaint and work out at a solution after talking to the student. Results will be declared only after all grievances are redressed.																								Officials said the new system will also help expedite the publication of results of engineering courses.																								The date of preview of scripts will be mentioned in the universitys annual academic calendar. Which means every examiner will have to complete evaluation by that date. This will streamline the evaluation process, said Biswas.																								Last week, students of the universitys engineering faculty had threatened to launch a movement to protest the inordinate delay  often stretching up to three months  in the publication of results. The university in 2003 had set themselves a 45-day deadline for the declaration of results.																								The students had demanded that they be shown their answer scripts before the results are declared.																								A section of students had attributed the delay to the failure of some examiners to complete evaluation of the scripts within the deadline.																								In the new system, the examiners will be under pressure to speed up the evaluation process and submit answer scripts within the preview date. Those who will fail to meet the deadline will have to explain the delay, said an official.

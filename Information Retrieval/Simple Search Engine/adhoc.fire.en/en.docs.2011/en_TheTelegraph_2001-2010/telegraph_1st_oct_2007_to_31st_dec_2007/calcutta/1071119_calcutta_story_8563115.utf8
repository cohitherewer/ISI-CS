				 Write it, shut it, forget it
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Sonam Jain came out of St Xaviers College with a sigh of relief on Sunday afternoon.																								Finally, CAT is over I am so relieved, said the final-year economics honours student of St Xaviers College before joining a gang of friends.																								How did it go? someone from the group hurled the most obvious question. The questions were tough Am not sure, replied Sonam, after the two-and-a-half hour Common Admission Test for the six Indian institutes of management (IIMs) and the other premier B-schools.																								Most of Sonams friends echoed her views while discussing their chances of cracking CAT, the first hurdle to get into IIMs and the best of the rest.																								The scenes and the conversations were the same across all other centres in the city, from Bhawanipur Education Society, on Elgin Road, to Delhi Public School, off EM Bypass. 																								Thats the beauty of this examination In most cases, people do not know how the test went till the final verdict is out, said Rahul Reddy, director, TIME, a training institute.																								As the uncertainty of their performance sunk in, the students agreed it was too early to relax.																								It is not possible to bank on CAT alone I will have to start preparing for the other tests, said Sonam, who will take a day off before getting back to books.																								So, instead of waiting to find out if they have secured the cut-off to make it to the IIMs, the students are pulling up their socks preparing for the next set of tests, lined up till January (see box).																								The war is far from over, said Amit Dhawan, a working engineer, keen on an MBA degree from a leading B-school. 																								Not just mine, the performance of others, too, is important in CAT So, I am not thinking too much about what happened in the morning. Instead, I am looking forward to the next round of tests, said Saurav Chowdhury, who is trying to crack the CAT for the second time.																								The training institutes are also advising the students to write it, shut it, forget it when it comes to CAT. 																								We have seen that some students get demoralised and others become overconfident after CAT. We advise them to learn from the mistakes and perform better in other tests, said V. Viswanath, of Erudite, a training institute.

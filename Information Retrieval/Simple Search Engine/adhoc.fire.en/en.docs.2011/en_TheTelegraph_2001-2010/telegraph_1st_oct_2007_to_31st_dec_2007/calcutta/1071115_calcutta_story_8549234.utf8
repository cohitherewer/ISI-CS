 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 COMRADES IN ALMS: Students collect foodgrains for Nandigram victims on Childrens Day. Picture by Amit Datta																								The atrocities in a village 160km away have marked the awakening of Calcuttas GenY.																								When trouble breaks out, whether in a home or in a place like Nandigram, the children are the worst affected, said Neha Dubey, a Class XII student of Apeejay School.																								Neha and several other school students had gathered on the Park Street pavement, off St Xaviers College, on Childrens Day to voice a silent protest against the lawlessness in Nandigram and also to lend a helping hand to the victims of violence.																								Seven-year-old Pankaj Chandiramani, a student of La Martiniere for Boys, came armed with two packets of dal. Most carried rice or wheat, they all carried compassion and commitment.																								Childrens Day was just the beginning. The students on Park Street vowed to collect 250 gm of foodgrains from each student in every school of Calcutta and send it all as relief material to a ravaged Nandigram. All the relief material gathered by these schools would be sent to Bharat Sevashram Sangha.																								Students from Apeejay, Saifee Hall, Birla High, La Martiniere for Girls, St James and MSB Educational Institute signed the flexes demanding peace in Nandigram and pledged their support																								For the students of Saifee Hall, this was a Childrens Day with a difference  it was about politics and protests, not fun and games. When will political parties spare a thought for us? demanded young Huzaifa.																								Sometimes children understand things much better than us adults. And they also have real determination. We hope the powers-that-be take some lessons from these kids, said Sooni Dhakani, a teacher from La Martiniere for Girls who accompanied students to Park Street on Wednesday.																								That the Nandigram issue has invaded classrooms in school was evident. We have been asking our teachers questions about Nandigram and wanting to do something for the people there, said Disha Mulji of La Martiniere for Girls.																								And on Childrens Day they took a little big step in that direction.

				 Hospital wings join hands to save farmer
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two departments of a government hospital joined hands to conduct an experimental surgery that saved the life and livelihood of a poor patient.																								Ganesh Malik, a 41-year-old farmer from Hooghly district, had suddenly lost vision in his left eye. The doctors of the ENT department at Medical College and Hospital found that a giant tumour in his pituitary gland was causing the vision loss.																								The tumour needed immediate removal, according to a senior official of the hospital, but it could not be operated upon without the help of a neurosurgeon.																								We do not have essential equipment, like an operating microscope, to conduct such surgeries. The neurosurgery department gets many cases like Maliks, but has to turn them away, said a hospital official. But if we had turned away Malik, it could have been fatal. He did not have the means to approach a private hospital for treatment, he added.																								The ENT and neurosurgery departments decided to work together. In the last week of October, specialists from the two wings removed the tumour in the ENT operating theatre through a minimally invasive endoscopic surgery that lasted more than three hours.																								A health department official said such a surgery is unheard of in a government-run hospital in the state.																								This is the first time we conducted such a surgery in our operating theatre. We accessed the tumour through a nostril using our ENT endoscope. The patient is recovering fast, said Indranath Kundu, an ENT surgeon who treated Malik.																								Sudip Chatterjee, the head of the neurosurgery department, helped in the surgery. He said: We are happy that our combined effort was successful. We are planning to conduct more such surgeries. 																								I cannot thank the doctors enough. I owe my life to them, said Malik.																								The medical fraternity is hailing this surgery. Sumit Basu, the head of the ENT department at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, described the operation as path-breaking.																								After the successful collaboration between the two departments, we will try to treat as many patients like Malik as possible, said a senior official of Medical College and Hospital.

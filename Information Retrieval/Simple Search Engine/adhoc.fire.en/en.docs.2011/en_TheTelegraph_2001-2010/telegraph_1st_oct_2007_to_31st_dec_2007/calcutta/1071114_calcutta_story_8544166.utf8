 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 The smashed windscreen of a car belonging to a Dover Terrace resident. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								A group of about 40 youths hurled stones, injuring five people in their homes, and damaged several cars at Dover Terrace on Monday night after the residents rebuked some of them for smoking and using abusive language.																								Four youths from Garcha First Lane were arrested. Police are on the lookout for eight others.																								Around 10.30pm on Monday, four to five drunk teenagers from Garcha First Lane were walking about at Dover Terrace, smoking and shouting abuses. When the residents of the area reprimanded the boys, they left, only to return with more youths, said an officer of Gariahat police station.																								According to witnesses, the boys returned around 11.15pm. They were carrying iron rods, knives and swords. They went about smashing the windscreens and windows of the parked vehicles. They barged into my house and hurled a stone that hit my wife Rita on her eye. She started bleeding profusely. We had to take her to RN Tagore hospital, said Gopal Das, a resident of Dover Terrace.																								At least 13 vehicles, including taxis, scooters and autorickshaws, were damaged.																								The youths allegedly entered some houses in the area and threw away plates from the dining tables and damaged furniture, before ransacking Garcha Youth Club. 																								They even broke down the doors of some of the houses and stepped inside. We were trembling in fear. It was evident that they were out to settle a score, said Mona Gupta, another local resident.																								 The smoking and swearing appear to be a pretext for creating trouble and settling old scores, said the officer.																								With the situation remaining tense on Tuesday, a police picket was posted in the area. Personnel from the Heavy Radio Flying Squad were also deployed.

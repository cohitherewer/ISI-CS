				 Hours away from home
 A STAFF REPORTERSuchitra Sen has recovered from her prolonged illness and should be able to return home by the end of the week.																								She is doing fine now. The fever has subsided completely and she has regained some strength, said a doctor treating the screen legend at Belle Vue Clinic since October 9, when she was admitted with high fever and weakness. It was later diagnosed as urinary tract infection.																								We cannot specify the exact time when she will be able to leave the hospital, but it should be in a couple of days, he added.																								For the first time since she was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic, Sen walked around in her ICCU cabin on Thursday.																								She was initially finding it difficult, but did manage to walk without support, said K.B. Baksi, the doctor leading the treatment team.																								She is in a cheerful mood and is recovering fast. The weakness is almost gone and she is eager to return home, added Baksi.																								Although the antibiotic injection has run its course, Sen is still on oral medicines.																								She will be allowed to go home once the weakness is completely gone, which should be in the next few days, a doctor said.																								Sens appetite has improved steadily over the past few days and she is now on a normal diet. We have asked her to eat anything she likes, said Baksi.																								On Thursday, she had toast, egg and fruit juice for breakfast. At lunchtime, she had home-cooked fried rice brought by daughter Moon Moon.																								Sens stay in Belle Vue has been marked by an unprecedented security blanket, as the star who has shunned the public eye for three decades is paranoid about her private space being violated.

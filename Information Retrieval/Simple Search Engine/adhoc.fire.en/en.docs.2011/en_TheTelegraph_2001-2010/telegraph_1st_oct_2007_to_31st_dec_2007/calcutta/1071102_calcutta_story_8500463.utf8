Picture by Amit Datta																								Civic workers demolishing illegal buildings or evicting encroachers will soon have a dedicated police force to guard them.																								Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay announced on Thursday that a police force would be kept ready in Lalbazar to help the civic body perform its duty better.																								Initially, the force will function under the joint commissioner (armed police), said Chakrabarti, who came to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters to receive two inflatable light towers from the mayor. The towers will help the police during disaster management.																								The dedicated force will ensure safety of civic employees while they conduct raids on violators of civic laws, pull down unauthorised or unsafe structures, or clear encroachments, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.																								On several occasions, the civic body could not take action against offenders because of delayed action by the police, he added.																								The mayor agreed to the top cops plea for financial and other help for better traffic management and redressal of citizens grievances. 																								The civic body will foot the bill for advertisements on changes in traffic plans or bear the expenses of installing traffic signals. It can also relax building rules to allow police stations to construct rooms for setting up grievance cells, said a senior civic official.																								Since the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Calcutta police are the principal authorities of the city, its natural that they come together for better management of traffic and to address peoples grievances, the mayor said.

				 Teachers barb at Besu VC 

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The teachers at Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) have demanded that vice-chancellor (VC) N.R. Banerjea withdraw his allegations against them and admit responsibility for the campus closure.
																								Banerjea had accused the teachers of not being committed enough while defending his decision to close the university sine die on December 14. 
																								Besu teachers union secretary Partha Chatterjee said on Tuesday: The VC must accept the onus for the damage to our academic ambience. He must protect the interest of the university. Banerjea refused to react to the charges. If anybody has any problem, he can approach the chancellor or the state government.
																								The teachers union alleged that Banerjea, ever since he took charge of the university in September 2004, has been undermining the tradition of the 150-year-old institution. He has been enforcing his own views and opinions, which are incompatible with our ambience, unilaterally.

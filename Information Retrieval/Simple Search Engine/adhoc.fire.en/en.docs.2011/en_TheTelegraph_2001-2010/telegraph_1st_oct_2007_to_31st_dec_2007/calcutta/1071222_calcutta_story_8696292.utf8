				 Custody denied of abandoned baby

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								A man visited Dum Dum police station on Friday morning and demanded custody of his newborn son, whom he had abandoned near Durganagar railway station on Wednesday night.
																								Biswajit Chakrabarty, a private security guard, said poverty had forced him and his wife to abandon the baby  their third child.
																								I have to support a family of four on a meagre income of Rs 1,200, half of which goes towards paying the house rent. But now, we are suffering from pangs of guilt and want to get the child back, said Biswajit.
																								The police sent him off, saying the couple would have to first prove that they are the biological parents of the child.
																								The residents of the Durganagar railway colony heard the cry of an infant around 11pm on Wednesday. 
																								We searched the place and spotted the baby on the the footboard of a rickshaw beside the railway tracks of Durganagar station, said Narayan Das, a resident of the colony.
																								As news spread, Mili Sarkar, a mother of two, took charge of the baby, who was immediately taken to a doctor. The police later sent the baby to the state-run home Sukanya.
																								We realised our mistake after reading news reports about the child. We are desperate to get him back, said mother Manju Chakrabarty.
																								Experts said the couple could face legal action. The couples offence is punishable under Section 206 of the Juvenile Justice and Child Protection Act, 2006. The child is now an orphan, said Kunal Dey, a member of the Juvenile Justice Board.

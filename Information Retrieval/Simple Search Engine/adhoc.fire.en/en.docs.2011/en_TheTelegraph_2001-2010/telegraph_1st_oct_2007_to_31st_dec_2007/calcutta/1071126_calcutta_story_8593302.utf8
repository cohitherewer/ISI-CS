				 Charge next fiscal
 															- WATER METERS TO BE OUTSOURCED DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will start collecting water charge from domestic users from the next fiscal.																								However, households that collect water from roadside or community taps or those who live in tiled houses will not have to pay the charge, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said.																								The CMC, departing from its usual policy, has decided to outsource installation of water meters and their upkeep, meter reading and bill generation to private parties.																								The Asian Development Bank-funded Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) had floated pre-qualification tenders early this month for the installation of the meters. The last date for submission of applications is January 7.																								The installation charge for meters is likely to be within Rs 2,500. The monthly charge has been fixed at Rs 10 per kilolitre for commercial users and Rs 5 per kilolitre for domestic users, a senior civic official said.																								The rate for domestic customers will come down once all the households start paying the charge, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.																								CEIP project director Shantanu Bose said meter reading and bill generation will start immediately after the installation of the meters.																								The 7,000-odd commercial users and the 2.5 lakh-odd households will be brought within the tax network in phases. Domestic users who will approach the CMC on their own for installation of water meters will brought under the tax purview first.																								The CMC, which spends Rs 30 crore a year on electricity to produce and distribute filtered surface water, plans to introduce 24-hour supply. 																								To make that possible, we need to drastically cut down on wastage of water. Metering system is an effective deterrent against wastage. We can save 40 million gallons of filtered water a day if wastage can be eliminated, the commissioner pointed out.

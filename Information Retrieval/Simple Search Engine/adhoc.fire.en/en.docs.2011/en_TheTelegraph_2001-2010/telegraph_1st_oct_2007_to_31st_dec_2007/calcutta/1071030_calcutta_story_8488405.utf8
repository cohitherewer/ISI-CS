				 Shutdown roster in twin threats
 A STAFF REPORTERBack-to-back calls for shutdown threaten to stall Calcutta on Tuesday and Wednesday, though the government has announced measures across the state to keep life normal.																								Tuesdays 12-hour bandh has been called by the SUCI, while the 12-hour shutdown on Wednesday has been sounded by the Trinamul Congress.																								Since SUCIs bandh also coincides with a strike called by the CPM-backed coordination committee, government offices are likely to be deserted on Tuesday, said an official.																								SUCI has announced plans to bring out processions from the Shyambazar five-point crossing, and Sealdah and Howrah stations. Party activists will also be deployed at various crossings.																								Bandhs do not serve any purpose. This is definitely not the way forward, said Rajeev Singh, the secretary-general of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, summing up the mood of most Calcuttans.																								The Inspector-general of police (law amp; order), Raj Kanojia, said security is being beefed up throughout the state to foil any attempt at a shutdown. A special control room is being set up at Writers Buildings to monitor the situation.																								All our senior officers will be on the road to ensure normalcy. Steps are being taken to keep public transport running, said Kanojia.																								We are making all arrangements to ensure that commuters are not inconvenienced, said home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray.																								According to the chief ministers secretariat, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees scheduled meeting with Dick Parsons, the chairman and CEO of Time Warner, at Writers Buildings on Wednesday, has not been cancelled.																								Airport officials said all flights will operate as scheduled on both days. 																								The railways, too, plan to run all suburban and long-distance trains.																								Corporate bosses have already started feeling the pinch. We will run up extra expenses by keeping our employees in office overnight to ensure that our work flow is not disrupted, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Salt Lake-based Acclaris.																								Several companies like Usha Martin and Jai Balaji have cancelled their scheduled press conferences on Wednesday to declare their second quarter results.																								Meetings of the various chambers of commerce are on, but insiders are keeping their fingers crossed about the turnout.																								I can reach office tomorrow but am not quite certain about Wednesday, said a woman in BBD Bag.

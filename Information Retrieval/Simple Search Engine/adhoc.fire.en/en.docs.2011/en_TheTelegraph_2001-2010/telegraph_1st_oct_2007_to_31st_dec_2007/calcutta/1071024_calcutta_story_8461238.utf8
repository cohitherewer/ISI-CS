		 The throbbing life within																																	Three Wheel Drive is a group show by three artists  Sukanta Hazra, Subhadeep Dawn and Souryeya Chakraborty. The attempt is to showcase the talent and uniqueness of the individual artists. They draw inspiration from both within their vast pool of imagination and from the perceptive world around them. For Sukanta, the transient world is a source of never-ending wonder which fuels his creative journey of self-discovery and each painting is an objective-correlative of his own intellectual existence. With Subhadeep, the world forms a symbolic construct of language via which he scripts his own images. While he observes the external world, Souryeya connects it with the inner emotive universe. The artists have used various means to express themselves, ranging from canvas to digital print. One of the works by Souryeya Charaborty, titled The Nights Neighbourhood, appears right.

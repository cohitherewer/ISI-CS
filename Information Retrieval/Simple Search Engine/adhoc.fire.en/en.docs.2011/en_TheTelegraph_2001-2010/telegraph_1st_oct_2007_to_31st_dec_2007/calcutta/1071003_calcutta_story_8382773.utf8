				 Lax curbs lead to plastic bag return
 JAYANTA BASU				 	 A visitor to Victoria Memorial, where all plastic items are banned. A Telegraph picture																								Banned plastic bags are back in the city after a gap of two months, making the most of the laxity in the governments enforcement measures.																								The ban on the manufacture, sale and use of plastic bags less than 40 microns in thickness was announced in June. Such bags are a major cause for rampant waterlogging in the city.																								But the state-level plastic management committee, at a recent meeting in Writers Buildings, admitted that the initial success of the ban has fizzled out, leading to a comeback of thin plastic bags in Calcutta and its suburbs. 																								The panel responsible for monitoring the production and use of plastic items in the state has decided on a series of measures to reinforce the ban.																								Its a fact that we are getting complaints about thin plastic bags being used in the city flouting the ban, said state environment secretary M.L. Meena, who is also chairman of the plastic management committee.																								I have asked the state pollution control board to act against the violators and lodge police complaints, if required, he added. Meena admitted that monitoring the ban has slackened, allowing resurfacing of thin plastic bags.																								Biswajit Mukherjee, the member-secretary of the committee and senior law officer in the environment department, said complaints of violation of the ban are pouring in from Salt Lake, Baranagar and some other fringe areas.																								But the situation in the city proper is no different. Many shop-owners in Lake market, especially in the fish and vegetable corners, have reverted to plastic bags, said Biswa Ranjan Bose, a local resident.																								A shop-owner in Lansdowne market admitted that plastic bags are back.																								The plastic management committee has asked the state pollution control board to step up vigil on the manufacturers of plastic bags.																								An official said the board will soon ask the district industrial centres  which provide clearances to plastic bag units  to send a list of manufacturers.																								As part of the renewed enforcement measures, the environment department will ask the municipalities and zilla parishads not to renew the licences of plastic bag units without ensuring that they have the consent of the pollution control board.																								The environment secretary will also request senior officials of the administration to ask the police to be pro-active in enforcing the ban.

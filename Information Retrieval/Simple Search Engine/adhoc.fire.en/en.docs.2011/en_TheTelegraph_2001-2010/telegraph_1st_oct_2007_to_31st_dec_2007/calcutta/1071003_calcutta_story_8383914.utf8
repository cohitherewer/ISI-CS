				 B-school tips for CBSE principals
 A STAFF REPORTEREx-servicemen of the armed forces, engineers and officials of private organisations have done it. It is now school principals who will pick up management tips from the premier business school in the city.																								The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has requested the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta to conduct a leadership-training programme for principals of its affiliated schools.																								The move follows the success of the Excellence in Education programme conducted by the IIM in May. Students, teachers and principals of various schools across the country had attended the course.																								The first two slots of the leadership training programme have been fixed but other details of the course are yet to be worked out, said C. Paduranga Bhatta, coordinator of the Management Centre for Human Values of the institute.																								A group of 40 principals will attend the five-day training from May 26, 2008. Another group will join the course in the first week of June.																								The principals will be trained in proper management of the schools and making learning an enjoyable experience for students.																								The course will touch upon issues like the role of the teacher, pedagogical approaches, educational content, modes of delivering lessons and work culture in schools, said Bhatta. We have been requested by the board to add modules on finance management, resource mobilisation and conflict management, he added.																								IIM Ahmedabad had organised similar programmes for the CBSE board, which is now considering tying up with the IIMs in Bangalore and Lucknow for the training.																								The course will help principals run their schools better, Ashok Ganguly, the chairman of the board, said last month.																								Meena Kak, the principal of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, said: It is an induction programme for principals. This is the first time I am going to attend such a course. I am looking forward to it.

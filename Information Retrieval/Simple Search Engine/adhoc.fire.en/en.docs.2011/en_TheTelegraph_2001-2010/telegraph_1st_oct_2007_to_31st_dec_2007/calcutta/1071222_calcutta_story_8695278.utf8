																								Entrepreneurship is the flavour of the season at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC).
																								Every December, the teachers and students at the institute sift through business plans for i2I (ideas to Implementation), the annual entrepreneurship competition.
																								This year, the B-school boys and girls have gone a step further and invited industrialists to share their experiences with entrepreneurs.
																								Three IIMC alumni, along with other big names from the industry, will speak to the students on December 23 at the first-ever entrepreneurship summit being organised by IIM Calcutta and National Entrepreneurship Network (NEN), a not-for-profit initiative of the Wadhwani Foundation.
																								The aim of the summit is to create awareness among students about entrepreneurship, develop synergy between the academia and businessmen and align entrepreneurship with management education, said Abhijan Ganguly, consultant, NEN.
																								The summit coincides with Reminiscence, the annual alumni meet where ex-students will share their experiences with the current lot. This will encourage alumni interaction with current students, with focus on entrepreneurship motivation and mentoring, said N.S. Mahadevan, the student coordinator for the summit.
																								Ajit Balakrishnan, the CEO of Rediff and the present chairman of the board of governors of the institute, will be one of the speakers at the summit. He will speak on how to build an entrepreneurial mindset.
																								Pradeep Gupta, the chairman and managing director of Cybermedia, and K. Ganesh, the CEO of TutorVista.com, are the other alumni who will speak at the summit.

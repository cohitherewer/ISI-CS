		 In defence of art																																	Icons, Idioms and Inamoratas is an attempt by five artists to challenge the allegation that contemporary art is born out of a restricted, myopic world view. For Ganesh C. Basu, art is primal exploration of the two-dimensional surface where the act of producing art is brought down to the relationship between colours and form, allowing us to respond physically to the canvas in a sensuous participation. Sukumar Bhattacharjee speaks through his paintings that serve as a record of absorption and incorporation, with imagery at once rich and complex: a veritable tribute to the contemporary modes of life. Dilip Guchaits art is earthy and owes much to traditional and primitive forms. It is a quest for stability amidst the turmoil of modern existence. Dipak Mukherjee involves us in endless arguments and conjectures as his works make us look for standardised contexts, which, he claims, are after all absent. Incorporating images from varied sources, Satyajit Roy puts across with works like Gopala I (right) that hierarchy in art is not inherent; it is more a product of social conditioning.

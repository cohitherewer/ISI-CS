				 Zone of crumbling homes
 A STAFF REPORTER																								There are over two dozen buildings in the Ripon Street-Bedford Lane-Elliot Road belt that can cave in any moment and claim lives, in a rerun of Sunday mornings incident.																								According to Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) officials, the building that collapsed had been declared unsafe years ago and its property tax had not been paid for decades.																								The director-general (buildings) of the CMC, Gorachand Mondal, said like in north Calcutta, Burrabazar and the Sealdah-College Street area, Sudder Street, Ripon Street, Elliot Road and Bedford Lane have many ramshackle buildings occupied by tenants.																								They are among the 1,500-plus buildings in the city that have been declared unsafe for human habitation. We put up a notice on an unsafe building asking the occupant to either repair the structure or move out, explained Mondal. The civic authorities cannot pull down the buildings, he added. 																								The house-owners are not interested in repairing buildings that have been occupied by tenants for 40-50 years and the tenants are not interested in repairing buildings owned by others. The CMC can only declare the buildings unsafe, said Mondol.																								Councillors Nasreen Iqbal of Elliot Road and Mohammad Iqbal of Bedford Lane and Ripon Street said most of the old buildings in the area are in bad shape. The owners of some of the buildings have died without bequeathing the properties to an heir or moved out of the area. The caretakers have rented out parts of the buildings.																								Promoters, too, are not interested in these buildings since there are several tenants in each. The tenants belong to the low-income bracket and demand rehabilitation on the same premises, said Iqbal.																								Civic engineers feel that the tenancy act and rent control system have made investment in landed property in Calcutta, unlike in other metro cities in India, a liability.

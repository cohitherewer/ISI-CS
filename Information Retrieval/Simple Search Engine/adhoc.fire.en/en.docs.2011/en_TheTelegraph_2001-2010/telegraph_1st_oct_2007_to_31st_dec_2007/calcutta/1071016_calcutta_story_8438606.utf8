				 Four held for death
 							 - Homemaker found with burns in toilet A STAFF REPORTER																								Four members of a family were arrested in Kalighat on Monday for allegedly burning a homemaker to death.																								Suhita Haldar, 24, was found in the toilet of her home at 13 Kali Lane, said her in-laws. She was taken to SSKM Hospital, where she died around 11am.																								She had almost 98 per cent burns when she was brought here. We did our best, but she succumbed to her injuries within a few minutes, said a senior official of the hospital.																								Suhitas elder brother Nirendu Saha, a resident of Bansdroni, told the police that his sister was mentally and physically tortured for dowry by her husband Mriganka Haldar, father-in-law Sashanka, mother-in-law Lali and brother-in-law Manash since her marriage in March.																								We have arrested the four on the basis of the allegation. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said deputy commissioner (south) Jawed Shamim.																								According to the police, Nirendu received a telephone call from his brother-in-law Mriganka, who works in an agency of a private bank, around 9am. Mriganka told Nirendu that his sister was found in the toilet of their house with serious burns and was being taken to hospital.																								Nirendu, along with some relatives and neighbours, rushed to the hospital. They found Manash and Mriganka outside the emergency department. An argument broke out between the two groups that sparked mob fury against the in-laws. 																								Manash was beaten up before being taken to the police station. Mriganka fled while his brother was being beaten up. He was arrested later.																								A senior police officer said the couple used to have altercations and Mrigankas parents and brother often ganged up with him against Suhita.																								Nirendu said: Suhita refused to yield to the pressure from her husband and in-laws. She used to complain to me about the inhuman treatment meted out to her.

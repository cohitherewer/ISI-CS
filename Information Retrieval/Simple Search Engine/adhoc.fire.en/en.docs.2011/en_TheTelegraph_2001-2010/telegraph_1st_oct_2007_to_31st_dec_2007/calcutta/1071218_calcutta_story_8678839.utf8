		 The bookworms tale
																																	Adapted from Alice Wosters Hubab on the Bookshelf, Abdul Latif Khatanas Kitabon Mein Hulchul tells the interesting story of an old book shelf which is peopled by various books and an old, wizened, melancholy bookworm, which has been living there for many years. Suddenly, one day, eight bookworms appear. They are very hungry and therefore decide to binge on these books. In spite of the old worms warnings, these worms attack the books. In this chaos, a little worm gets left out. When the older worms have had their fill, they begin praising and advocating the subjects whose books they have consumed, leading to arguments and complications. The old worm steps in to handle the situation and proposes to build a community of worms. When it comes to making a home each feels that its subject is superior and there is a deadlock of opinion. Right in the middle of all this, the little worm also gets very hungry and agitated, and chews a whole book! Its its turn to speak the oracle and it declares itself the leader of them all. Now, others realise the inappropriateness of their actions and they, in turn, make the little worm realise the bookish fill alone is not sufficient. The play is a resounding strike on the idea that some subjects are superior than the rest. It should be kept in mind that all are equally required for an all-round development of a person. The play, in its novel manner, also ridicules those sophists who have read a lot but learnt very little. The play is being performed as part of Nandikars 24th National Theatre Festival.

				 Learning to like the turkey
										 Americans go to great lengths to be with their families on Thanksgiving 			 			 			 			 Made in Manhattan																								This is a big weekend in the US with a holiday everyone looks forward to  Thanksgiving. An intrinsically North American holiday, its a time when families and friends get together to share a meal  which includes a turkey  and give thanks for the good things in their lives.																								It started with the pilgrims who first came to the country and after the first harvest designated a day to celebrate and take stock of all the things one needs to be thankful for. The holiday is always on the fourth Thursday of November and is part of a four-day weekend, which provides a break in school and college calendars. This weekend sees some of the heaviest travel days and the Friday after Thanksgiving is the start of the traditional Christmas shopping season, with some retailers throwing in free breakfast to get the crowds!																								Before I came to this country the shopping part is the only thing I associated with this holiday. Yes, I had seen many times on some TV channel or another, footage of crazed Americans running into shopping centres at 4am to avail of the items going at half-price or some similar incredible sale. American consumerism at work again, I would say. But looks can be deceiving. 																								If you look at American lives a little closer through the prism of Thanksgiving, you will discover other less publicised details. For instance how family-oriented Americans really are. My neighbours with three young children always have a celebration that brings together their relatives, from the grandparents to month-old toddlers. Like them most Americans go to great lengths to be with their families on this weekend. This often means flying from one part of the country to another, clocking five or six hours flying time. Check-in takes forever, tarmacs are overcrowded and long flight delays are part of the deal. 																								From the elderly aunt to the nervous young bride hosting the meal, the Day entails cooking a large meal of turkey, yams, mashed potatoes, veggies and pie for 20 or 30 people and making sure everyone goes home happy. Along with family members, neighbours, office colleagues and even foreign students are invited by their professors to join in. And mind you the meal is usually home-cooked, guests often stay overnight, and hardly any commercial activity such as buying and exchanging gifts are part of the tradition. 																								Community service is an integral part of American life and there is also a lot of giving during Thanksgiving. Many sponsor entire meals for the less fortunate. Hundreds of people volunteer at homeless shelters and soup kitchens all over the country, registering their names months in advance. Since spots fill up quickly for this activity, volunteers are then called upon to deliver meals to people who are  shut-ins  the elderly and the poor. In neighbourhoods and offices and football games there are food donation drives conducted in the weeks prior to Thanksgiving. Frozen turkeys, canned food, fruits, and other non-perishables are collected to make sure that the poor get their meal as well. 																								Many middle-class Americans take advantage of the four-day Thanksgiving break and combining it with a few days from their two weeks annual break, spend it with communities that need their help. From working in one of Mother Teresas home in Calcutta to helping rebuild homes in Hurricane Katrina devastated communities, an incredibly large number of people volunteer their time and money during Thanksgiving. 																								For Indians, Thanksgiving is also a rite of passage and a step towards assimilation. It starts off initially with pure emulation in the new land. Impromptu gatherings take place  with pot-luck dinners, roast chicken substituting for turkey, and maybe a biryani thrown in. But with time, tastes change, people become more adventurous and friends become family. Even the turkey, which is the butt of many jokes, described as tasteless cardboard and resisted for many years, takes on a different hue and finds its way to the best spot on the table. And yes, thats what I am having this year. 						Oisika Chakrabarti (The writer, a Calcuttan, works at the UN in Manhattan)

				 Gang of three held for serial robbery
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Syed Zakir Hussains house. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								The home of a retired IAS officer and three other houses were robbed and a shop was ransacked by a three-member gang in Salt Lakes HB block early on Tuesday. The trio were arrested and the loot recovered.																								The robbers reached the house of Syed Zakir Hussain at HB 272 around 2.45am. They managed to open the glass front door and smash the lock of another grille door within.																								They picked up the watches of my parents, who were sleeping downstairs. On the first floor, my sister-in-law was sleeping with her two little children. When she woke up, they held a chopper to her throat, said Syed Tanvir Hussain, the younger son of the former member-secretary of the West Bengal Commission for Backward Classes. 																								According to Tanvir, the man holding the chopper wore a mask, while his two accomplices were carrying guns. They picked up cellphones, watches and some ornaments. The trio also opened the almirah and took her husbands passport and some foreign currency.																								The former bureaucrat had woken up by then and he saw the three men leaving the house. They escaped before he could raise an alarm. 																								The robbers had taken three watches, three mobile phones, two digital diaries, a handycam, some ornaments and $3,000 from the house.																								The gangs next targets were three houses at HB 254, 160 and 292 and a makeshift shop at HB 273.																								The police reached within 10-15 minutes by Tanvirs estimate, but by then, the other premises had been robbed of two car stereos and cigarettes worth Rs 600.																								The robbers were picked up in the afternoon from an undisclosed location outside Salt Lake.																								All three men have criminal records, is all sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Prasun Banerjee would say. The three will be produced in the additional chief judicial magistrates court on Wednesday.																								Despite the arrests, residents of the locality are jittery after the looting spree. Never has such a dacoity taken place in our block, said Jyotsna Das, who lives opposite the Hussains. They were in the house for 45 minutes yet we did not hear a thing, she added. 																								We will beef up security, promised SDPO Banerjee.

 I am no Prince Hamlet...
 Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow / Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.... Shakespeare rsquo;s inference stands in good stead for us even today. The two plays, being staged this evening as part of Nandikar 24th National Theatre Festival, show human beings caught in the straits of constricted emotions. Suffering from an emotional myopia, these characters fail to express their longings or articulate the nature of their dilemma. In Aarakt Kshan (director: Anup Joshi), Babuji, Padma, Laali and Raju, in their normal circumstances, find themselves facing a crisis. Their otherwise ordinary existence is perturbed by a major problem: they are to decide for themselves. Governed by the given standards they are lsquo;correct rsquo; or lsquo;incorrect rsquo;, yet none can accept or reject this judgement. The playwright chooses to keep the play open-ended and turns the question onto the audience. A scene from Aarakt Kshan appears here. The other play,? (Question Mark) (director: S. M. Azhar Alam) has been adapted into Hindi from Ismail Choonara rsquo;s They Burn People, They Do. It tells the story of four young men who are survivors of the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat. They have lost their sanity, but to the playwright they are more human and more sane than we are.

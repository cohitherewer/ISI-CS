				 Hunger strike shifts CU exam rule
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A section of Calcutta University (CU) students went on hunger strike on Monday, forcing the authorities to change the examination rules. 																								The rules are arbitrary and absurd. A student failing in a pass paper in Part I can clear the same paper through a supplementary examination while taking Part II. But there is no scope for supplementary examination if someone fails to clear the pass papers in Part II or fails to clear the pass papers of Part I in the supplementary examinations, pointed out a student. 																								More than 100 students, who failed to clear the Part II pass papers or failed in the Part I supplementary papers gathered on the university premises on Monday morning and spent the day pressing their demand for a rule revision.																								We have decided to allow the students to take the supplementary examinations in the pass papers as well as Part III. The modalities will be worked out later, declared Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of the university, late on Monday. The students withdrew their agitation after the announcement.																								We had made a written submission to the pro vice-chancellor on Friday, requesting the university to allow us and appear for the Part III examination. Otherwise, we would have had to lose a crucial academic year, said an agitating student. 																								Das had initially said: Part III is a terminal examination. The rule is that the students have to clear all the papers in Part II before they are allowed to sit for Part III.																								Some students had said that their colleges were not aware of the rule.

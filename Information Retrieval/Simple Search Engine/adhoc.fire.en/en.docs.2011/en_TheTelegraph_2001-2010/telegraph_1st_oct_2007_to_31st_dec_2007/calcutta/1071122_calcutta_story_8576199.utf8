				 Metro citys lifeline
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Metro Railway turned out to be the sole saviour of commuters on a day most roads in the heart of the city were clogged, following the mob fury in the Park Circus area.																								But the underground ride was far from smooth, as passengers jostled with each other, standing in serpentine queues for tickets. The counters initially were too few for the crowd that was swelling by the minute.																								The Metro authorities sounded a high alert to tackle the situation that at times seemed to be spiralling out of control.																								The first wave of commuter surge hit the stations around 1.30pm. The maximum load was on the stretch between Rabindra Sadan and Chandni Chowk, though almost all stations recorded around 35 per cent more turnout than on any working day, said Pranab Dutta, the senior public relations officer of Metro Railway.																								An official admitted that the number of ticket counters was initially far less compared with the huge footfall.																								At several stations, queues for tickets snaked up onto the roads, with passengers jostling with each other and screaming at the Metro authorities.																								Why dont you open more counters? yelled out Jayasree Das, a resident of Lake Town, who had been standing in the queue for more than 30 minutes at Rabindra Sadan.																								The situation turned for the worse after a rumour spread that the Metro services would be stopped. Commuters made a rush for the first available train, creating problems for the drivers to close the gates. The authorities scotched the rumour through announcements on the public address system.																								A Metro official said in the evening: Later, we opened more counters to cope up with the rush. Trains will run at eight-minute intervals till 9pm, or even later. Three standby trains were also pressed into service.																								Security was also beefed up on the station premises. The Metro Railway police, Calcutta police, special branch and the RPF were alerted. The officials who were on leave were asked to join duty. There was no major incidents of violence, Dutta said.

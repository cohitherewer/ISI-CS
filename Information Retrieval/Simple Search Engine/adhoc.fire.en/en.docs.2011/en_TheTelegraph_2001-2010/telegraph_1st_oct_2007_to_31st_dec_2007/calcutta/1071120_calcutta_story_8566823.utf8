				 Realty plans for facility
 															- Pact with state agencies OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 An artists impression of Acropolis																								A home-grown real estate company has announced an investment of Rs 10,000 crore in housing and infrastructure over the next five years at a time when outstation majors are dropping anchors in Calcutta.																								We expect commercial property rates to appreciate at least 50 per cent by 2010 and by that time, we hope to invest around Rs 2,000 crore in housing and infrastructure projects with our joint-venture partners. This should go up to Rs 10,000 crore over five years, Merlin Group managing director Sushil Mohta told Metro on Monday.																								The city-based realty firm, which is developing the 750,000-sq ft mixed-use project Acropolis on the Kasba connector as a public-private partnership in conjunction with the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), plans to put this money into creation of industrial estates, factory outlets, hospitality stops, retail infrastructure and housing.																								The housing and infrastructure projects will be rolled out through Bengal Merlin Housing Ltd, formed in partnership with CMDA, and Bengal Merlin Infrastructure Ltd, with West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation, respectively.																								South Calcutta is fast becoming an alternative CBD (central business district) and the need to create quality commercial infrastructure in the area is greater than ever before. Through our joint-sector partners, we want to participate actively in creating such facilities, Mohta stressed.																								Merlin Group has formed a consortium with South City Projects and CMDA to develop premium housing, commercial and high-end retail space over another 600,000 sq ft of space near the Ruby crossing.																								To be developed across 6.5 acres at the Kasba Rajdanga ground, near Siemens, the Rs 400-crore Acropolis will comprise a 4,000-seater sports stadium, a 17-level IT-enabled business tower and a shopping mall with a four-screen multiplex, besides two mini-anchors. The property will have a three-level car park for 750 vehicles.

 A STAFF REPORTER			The bank branch that was broken into. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha		Robbers broke into the Batanagar branch of the United Bank of India after it closed for the weekend on Saturday. They fled with cash, jewellery and a double-barrelled gun kept outside the vault.																								According to Praveen Kumar, the district superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), the robbers entered the bank through the window in the toilet between Saturday evening and Sunday night. 																								The robbery was discovered on Monday when the bank opened. The vault lock was broken, though we are not yet sure how much cash has been taken, said Gourisankar Deb, a senior official of the bank. 																								The CID has also been informed about the robbery and sleuths have started a probe. 																								A bank official said that it was the second time that the bank was burgled, the first time being in 2006.																								According to him, the bank has had to do without a security guard for nearly two years and the gun that has been stolen, was kept near the vault by the last guard who worked there. 																								An investigating officer said that the burglars have left behind several gadgets normally used by electricians and they hope to get a lead from them. Preliminary investigation suggests that the robbers were well-acquainted with the ground plan of the bank.

				 Parent meets mandatory
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has made it compulsory for its 11,000-odd affiliated schools to organise meetings between parents and teachers on a regular basis.																								The move, officials said, will pave the way for active participation of parents in the academic performance of their wards.																								The board issued a circular last week, directing the schools to introduce the system before the Puja vacation.																								Every school will have to hold at least one meeting between the parents and teachers of students studying between classes V and VIII before October 16. The parents of students in Classes IX and X may be called after the Puja, said Swapan Sarkar, the board secretary.																								The Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had made such interactions compulsory long ago.																								According to Sarkar, the board will award grades along with marks to Madhyamik students from 2009. Continuous assessment of students, unit tests (introduced this year) and regular parent-teacher meetings will make the grading system more effective.																								Board sources said that after interacting with some parents, it was found that most of them were unaware of the academic progress of their children.																								Parents participation is a must if we are to make learning more enjoyable. Parents should know about their childrens progress and also the performance of the teachers, said a board official.																								The board has also requested the state education department to step up its vigil to ensure that such meetings are held regularly. 																								The board will conduct more inspections and, if necessary, meet guardians to verify whether the schools are holding the meetings regularly, the official added.

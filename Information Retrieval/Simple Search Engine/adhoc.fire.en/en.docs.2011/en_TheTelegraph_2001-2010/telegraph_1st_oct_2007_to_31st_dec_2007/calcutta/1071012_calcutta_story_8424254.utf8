 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sub-inspectors Jayanta Mukherjee and Pulak Dutta arrive at Bhabani Bhavan. (Bottom): Trinamul Congress MLA Javed Khan before his questioning by CID sleuths on Thursday. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								Five days after questioning two deputy commissioners of police, the CID officials recorded the statements of two sub-inspectors  Pulak Dutta and Jayanta Mukherjee of Karaya police station  on Thursday. 																								Like their superiors  Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner (headquarters), and Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner (detective department)  the two sub-inspectors had met Priyanka Todi and Rizwanur Rahman. But unlike them, the sub-inspectors had not meddled in the couples personal lives.																								Dutta and Mukherjee went to 7B Tiljala Lane on August 31, after Rizwanur and Priyanka informed Karaya police station about their marriage and the threats from Ashok Todi.																								The two officers told us they visited the house and examined the documents like the marriage registry certificate and the age proof. They left the place after they were convinced that the two adults were married under law, said a CID official.																								The cops also left instructions at the nearby police kiosk  located a few metres from Rizwanurs home  to ensure the safety of the couple. Following their visit, they submitted an inquiry report to the officer-in-charge of the police station, said the official, explaining how the duo stuck to the rulebook while performing their duty. 																								Trinamul Congress MLA Javed Khan, who was also summoned to the CID headquarters on Thursday, told the sleuths that he had met the couple in his capacity as their local MLA. Rizwanurs family has complained that Khan visited their home on October 7 and pressured Priyanka to return to her parents house.																								The MLA denied the charge and told the CBI officials that Priyanka had gone on her own to visit her ailing father. 																								Khan spent around one-and-a-half hours at Bhabani Bhavan explaining his position. Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday that the law must take its course. If Javed Khan is found guilty, he should be punished according to the law, Mamata told a rally.																								At the high court on Thursday, lawyers representing Ashok Todi and Anil Saraogi, Priyankas uncle, toed the state government line and contested the plea for a CBI probe. They, however, did not contest the Rahman familys charges against them.																								Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and the four other Calcutta police officers accused of harassing Rizwanur and Priyanka, were also represented by their counsel.																								The allegations are baseless. But if the court asks my clients to submit their views in affidavits, they will obey the order, said the counsel. 																								State advocate-general Balai Ray concluded his arguments with an assurance that the government was ready to submit a full report of the CID investigation.

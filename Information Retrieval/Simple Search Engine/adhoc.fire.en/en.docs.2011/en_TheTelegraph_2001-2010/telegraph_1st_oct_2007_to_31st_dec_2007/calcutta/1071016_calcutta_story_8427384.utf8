				 Uniforms for litter army
 															- 16,000 to get ID Cards A STAFF REPORTER																								Civic conservancy workers will wear a uniform and display identity cards after almost five years so that people can recognise their contribution in keeping the city clean.																								Judging by the state of the city, few Calcuttans hold a high opinion of the 16,000-strong conservancy army of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. But the civic fathers blame the misconception on the fact that people tend to mistake conservancy workers on duty for local club members.																								The primary objective of providing a uniform to conservancy workers is to segregate them from the rest, said deputy mayor Kalyan Mukherjee.																								When the city was flooded a few weeks ago, conservancy workers tried hard to drain out the water. But their effort was not appreciated as people mistook them for local youths, explained Mukherjee.																								The deputy mayor also pointed out another reason for reintroducing uniforms for the employees. There have been incidents of outsiders entering houses posing as civic employees and stealing money, jewellery, cellphones and other valuables. The uniform and identity cards will help prevent such thefts.																								An official said the workers will be given the material for their uniforms. Around 1,000 have already been distributed the material. Women will wear navy blue saris and men will have grey or black trousers paired with white or light blue shirts, depending on their nature of work. The CMC will also bear the cost of stitching the clothes.																								The civic authorities withdrew the uniform for conservancy workers around five years ago following complaints from the councillors and local residents. Most workers did not wear the uniform. They used to sell their clothes to outsiders, pointed out Mukherjee.																								This time, the civic authorities have declared that they will take action against those who do not wear the uniform when on duty. The field workers will also be given raincoats, umbrellas, shoes, aprons and gloves.

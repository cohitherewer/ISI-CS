				 Peace rally minus party agenda
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The walk for peace in Nandigram, from College Square to Esplanade on Wednesday afternoon, will remain a non-political platform of protest.																								Though I morally back tomorrows peace rally, neither the Trinamul Congress nor I shall join it so that there is no controversy. This is a peoples rally to protest against bloodshed in Nandigram and I wish it all success, said Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday.																								The Trinamul chief had earlier planned to join the rally with her supporters but without party flags. She shifted her stance following an appeal from the rally organisers. 																								I think its a mature decision by Mamata Banerjee not to join the procession. Whoever joins it should do so without any political agenda, said singer-director Anjan Dutt.																								Poet Sankha Ghosh termed Mamatas decision correct and stressed that he would join the procession only if there was no participation from political parties.																								The Congress took the cue, with senior leader Somen Mitra saying: Aparna Sen has said the organisers of the rally are opposed to the participation of political parties and so we have decided not to join it.																								The Wednesday peace procession is being organised by the citys intellectuals and students. The silent march will start from College Square at 1pm and make its way to Esplanade. Lalbazar said the rally route would be College Square-Nirmal Chunder Street-SN Banerjee Road-Rani Rashmoni Avenue and there would be proper police deployment to ensure that nothing untoward happens.																								I have joined the protests because I am a democratic citizen, said Aparna Sen, who has also sent out SMS appeals to mobilise relief material for the people of Nandigram.																								Mobilisation of support for the peace march has flooded mobile phones and the Net. Orkut and Facebook, the two popular social networking sites, had this posting: ... a historic rally is going to be organised on November 14.... The rally will start from College Square, sharp at 1pm. No organisational banner will be there.... Come on friends... let us overflow the city streets.

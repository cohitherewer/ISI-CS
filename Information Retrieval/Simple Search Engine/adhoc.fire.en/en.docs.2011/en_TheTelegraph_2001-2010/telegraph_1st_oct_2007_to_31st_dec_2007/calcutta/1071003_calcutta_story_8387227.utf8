 																											- True Spirit Puja organisers pledge to keep spirits high  SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 DEITY WITH A PURPOSE: The idol at Dum Dum Park Tarun Sangha which was adjudged the Model Puja in True Spirit Puja 2006. A Telegraph picture 																								With just about a fortnight left for Durga puja, the forces gathered at St Xaviers College auditorium on Monday evening to join hands once again to make the citys biggest festival a meaningful one. 																								CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja has stepped into its fifth year and with it, the pledge of puja organisers from across Calcutta and Howrah to give citizens a viewer-friendly, socially conscious community event.																								There was no flexing of budget muscles nor tall claims about innovative themes from the people who gift Calcutta the grand affair that Durga puja has become. 																								Instead, the evening was dedicated to them getting reminded about commitments to the True Spirit cause  facilities to pandal-hoppers, integration of the differently abled, eco-friendliness and social activities.																								We provide blood to five thalassaemic kids and donate blood on the death anniversary of our para boy, footballer Krishanu Dey, said Anjan Das, the secretary of Naktala Udayan Sangha. It was only in passing that he mentioned how the pandal this time would be a creation in bamboo, with little lamps concealed inside poles creating a semi-lit ambience.																								No wonder, they came into the 2007 edition with a Three Star recognition for last years efforts. We will do better this time, Das stated.																								Doing better is also the vow of the Lake Pally puja of Santoshpur. We have never got a True Spirit star but we have earmarked a part of our small budget to fulfil the awards requirements. There will be fire extinguishers at every 25 ft of our 6,500-sq-ft pandal, said an organiser.																								The young organisers of Students Club, Bhowanipore, would offer legal aid to the poor on Panchami. That is how we plan to do the inauguration, said Debraj Mallik, an Ll.B final-year student.																								Dharamdas Jaiswal, of Rammohan Smriti Sangha, agreed that space constraint was a big problem in north Calcutta. But we will deploy about 50 volunteers to control the crowd, he promised. Maintaining order would be a priority here. After all, the puja is based on the theme of unity for peace.																								After the presentation on the True Spirit Award criteria in the packed auditorium, the organisers fielded a volley of questions at the representatives of the public utility services that are vital to life round the year and during the Pujas  the fire services, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the power utility CESC, all stake-holders in the True Spirit movement.																								Please come for the fire drill on October 11 and 12, requested Gopal Bhattacharya of the fire services. 																								The drill, which teaches puja organisers how to tackle fire-related hazards, will be conducted simultaneously in the Howrah, Gariahat, Mohammad Ali Park and Behala fire stations.																								Last year, not a single fire was reported in pujas in the urban belt. I hope we can keep it that way this year as well, Bhattacharya said.																								After all, the True Spirit movement has raised hopes for the best by always living up to its motto, Lets make Puja truly enjoyable.

				 Diwali duo grab full house
 															- Early advance bookings see record sell-out of tickets for blockbusters A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The Om Shanti Om pair																								If you havent yet booked a weekend seat for Om Shanti Om or Saawariya, you may as well look elsewhere. By the time you read this, chances of grabbing a multiplex ticket for the Diwali biggies would be as thin as Ranbir Kapoors towel.																								The advance bookings for the twin releases have bettered all festive records of pre-release ticket sales. By Wednesday evening, more than 80 per cent of Om Shanti Oms (the advances had opened on Sunday) and more than 60 per cent of Saawariyas first weekend tickets were gone at the INOX plexes. Compare this to the advance figures last Diwali, when Shah Rukh Khans Don and Salman Khans Jaan-e-Mann had advance bookings of around 50 per cent at the same properties.																								By the time the first day first show opens on Friday morning, all 18 shows (nine of Om Shanti Om and nine of Saawariya) for all three days of the weekend will be full, feels Vikas Syal, the general manager of INOX (Forum). 																								Thats not all. As many as 22 shows of the two films  with Om Shanti Om enjoying the bigger share  have been blocked in advance at the INOX plexes. Compare this to just nine advance block bookings for Don last year and you know which Diwali will burn brighter at the box office. The Saawariya duo 																								Fame (Hiland Park), which opened advance counters on Wednesday morning for Om Shanti Om, sold out all tickets for Sunday by the evening. Saawariya, despite opening advances on Sunday, was trailing at the Bypass plex. After Chak De! India, which played only at Fame, another Shah Rukh film is the first choice, reveals a Fame spokesperson.																								Both the films are assured of a bumper opening in Mumbai and a great start is guaranteed even in cities like Delhi and Bangalore, says trade analyst Indu Mirani. Monday onwards, when there is a dip, we will know which of the two will become the superhit of 2007.																								In the countdown to the festive big fight, Shah Rukh-Deepika in the red corner start favourites because of the all-out entertainment promised by Om Shanti Om, while Ranbir-Sonam in the blue corner hope romance delivers the knockout punch.

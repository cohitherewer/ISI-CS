				 Godowns gutted in mid-day blaze
 															- Late arrival of fire tenders sparks skirmishes A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A resident of Kidderpores Babubazar joins fire-fighting operations at the blazing godown. The local residents allege the firemen took an hour to reach the spot. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Three warehouses stocked with combustible material were razed in a fire in the Martin Burn Company compound, of Kidderpore, on Tuesday afternoon.																								There was no report of injury. The workers in the compound, at 1 Satya Doctor Road in Babubazar, had gone out for lunch when the fire started around 12.15pm. The cause of the fire has not yet been ascertained.																								Late arrival of fire engines resulted in skirmishes between local residents and police.																								The company uses the compound to store containers. The remaining area houses warehouses of various companies. Many of them store chemicals, fuel and spirit in the compound.																								According to fire services officials, the blaze started in a warehouse where adhesives were kept for export. It spread to adjoining facilities  a Great Eastern Company fridge-repairing unit and a Multimore Marine Container Services warehouse, where sponge iron and mica were stored. There were also stacks of paper in the warehouses.																								D.P. Biswas, the director of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services, said: The godowns were filled with combustible material, which resulted in rapid spread of the fire.																								Fourteen fire engines took about three hours to bring the blaze under control. At one point, the flames had spread over 25,000 sq ft.																								Witnesses said if the local residents had not joined the firefight, there would have been greater damage.																								We called up the fire station several times. Each time, the officers told us that 10 tenders had been sent. But they took more than an hour to reach. So we evacuated the residents of a neighbouring building and started pouring water on the fire from the terrace. The main aim was to stop the flames from reaching the adjoining slum and petrol pump, said Mohammad Siraj, a local resident. 																								There was a delay in the arrival of fire engines but the blaze was controlled before it spread to the adjoining areas, said Shabbir Ahmed, the assistant commissioner of port division. 																								Local legislator Ram Pyare Ram confirmed that the fire tenders reached late. I called the fire station several times but the officers did not respond, the MLA said. 																								About 500 people work in the compound but the warehouses have no fire-fighting arrangement, alleged Ram.																								Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee, who is now in Mumbai, said: We are looking for the owner of the warehouse where the fire started. The local residents did not help in dousing the flames.

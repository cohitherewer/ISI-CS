				 Tiljalas Id is two days late
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Rukbanur Rahman outside the high court after the ruling was announced. Picture by Amit Datta																								Maidan ke charo taraf light jala dena; aaj khushi ki din hai, bhai																								The voice of victory drifted into the small room at 7B Tiljala Lane where Kishwar Jahan, in a black-bordered white sari, struggled to voice her feelings about the high court ruling.																								I have always believed that my son cannot commit suicide. At least now there is a ray of hope. Shayad insaaf mil jaye, said the bereaved mother, waiting for elder son Rukbanur to return from the high court.																								Kishwar Jahan barely slept on Monday night and spent all of Tuesday morning in prayers.																								The police commissioner said it was suicide and the CID seemed to believe the same. We just hope truth prevails and all those who have taken my sons life are punished. It was not our family alone. The people of Bengal have been seeking this (CBI probe) and were thankful to everyone for their support... But valuable time has been lost, she said softly, her voice drowning in the sounds of neighbourhood celebrations.																								Outside, Id had arrived two days late in Tiljala Lane. Neighbours of the Rahmans, in mourning since September 21, were celebrating the first glimmer of hope.																								We did not celebrate Id this year. But the high court has sparked a festive mood. We can afford to smile again after three weeks, said neighbour Mohammad Tauqeer Alam.																								As dusk descended on the the tiny Tiljala lane, the crowd swelled and hope burnt bright.																								In the adjoining field, youths abandoned their game of cricket and rushed to the small office of Mohammad Ishtiaq, next to where Rizwanur lived.																								The youths dropped the bat and picked up the pen to sketch huge posters and banners  thanking the high court and proclaiming that the CBI inquiry order was the first step to success.																								Just after Rizwanurs death, we were afraid to take any steps. But then, we felt his soul wouldnt rest in peace if we didnt fight for justice and gradually, we found support from everywhere, including little children of the locality who didnt know much about the case, said Akilur Rahman, one of Rizwanurs uncles. It is two days later, but now we can celebrate Id.																								The now-familiar photograph of a smiling Rizwanur started flooding the area, as members of the local Tiljala Noble Mind Union Club got into the act.																								There was such a sense of loss, of pain, on Id that none of us could celebrate on Sunday. But today, as the news reached us, everyone hit the streets and started embracing and congratulating each other. The court order has given us hope, said Mohammed Eklakh, a member of the club.																								Hope was the hero on Tuesday afternoon, as friends and family took a deep breath and resolved to carry on the crusade. This is the first step towards justice. We are sure that an impartial CBI probe will expose all those who were involved in Rizwans death, said Rehan Waris, a friend who was in touch with the 30-year-old graphics designer till a day before he was found dead on the railway tracks near Dum Dum.																								When Rukbanur returned home on Tuesday evening, his first thoughts were for Kishwar Jahan. My mothers prayers have been answered, he said fervently.

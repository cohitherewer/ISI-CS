				 Kshiti fires funds salvo
 A STAFF REPORTERAshok Todi may have funded Prasun Mukherjees campaign in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) election, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, of the RSP, said on Wednesday.																								The minister (The Telegraph picture left) demanded a judicial inquiry into the matter. Ive heard that Todi helped him (Mukherjee) win the CAB poll. These allegations are doing the rounds in the citys sports circuit, he said.																								The police commissioner said he didnt know the Todis personally. Pradip Todi came to meet me with Snehasish (Ganguly). I was in a hurry and told him to meet Gyanwant. But he said he had already met him, said Mukherjee.																								The CAB reacted strongly to Goswamis statement. We are protesting against the comments made by a responsible citizen. Its unfortunate, said the CAB joint secretary, Samar Paul. He pointed out that Mukherjee was elected unopposed this year.																								Asked whether Todi had provided financial help to Mukherjee, the minister, known to have opposed the top cops bid to be CAB boss, worth over Rs 200 crore, said: Well, lets just say Todi offered Mukherjee whatever help was possible for him.																								Goswami called for the removal of the Calcutta police officers under the scanner. A probe with the officers in the chair was like asking a cat to guard the fish. He also demanded interrogation of Ganguly. 																								Asked about the public pressure for action against the officers, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: Im looking into everything.																								Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said: Removal of the accused officers is under consideration. And if the agency conducting the probe recommends their removal, it will have to be done.

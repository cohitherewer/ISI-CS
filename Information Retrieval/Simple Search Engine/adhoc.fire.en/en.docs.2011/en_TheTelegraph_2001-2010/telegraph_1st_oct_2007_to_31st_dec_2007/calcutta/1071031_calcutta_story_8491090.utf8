				 Light towers to fight crisis
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								The city civic authorities will gift two inflatable light towers to Calcutta police to help the cops manage disasters better.																								The light towers are portable lamp posts. When inflated, they rise to a height of 15 ft and can be set up in three minutes.																								The 400-watt metal halide lamp in each tower can illuminate 10,000 sq metres for eight hours at a stretch. A fuel tank attached to the towers can power the lamps if electricity is not available.																								Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti will visit the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters on Thursday to accept the light towers, which together cost Rs 3.6 lakh, from mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.																								A Delhi-based company has supplied the light towers to the CMC, said chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar.																								Since the police are at the forefront of disaster management and coordinate between various agencies, we are gifting the inflatable light towers to them, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.																								While fighting big fires in Burrabazar, Bowbazar and Star theatre, the city police had to request the CMC to make arrangements for emergency lights.																								But when there is a big fire, electricity supply in the area is generally cut off. This forces the fire brigade to work in darkness.																								The civic conservancy department also faces problems in removing the debris in the absence of light. The inflatable towers will be of help in such a situation, added Sarkar.

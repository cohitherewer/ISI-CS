				 Undertrial on the run caught
 A STAFF REPORTER																								One of the three undertrials who had escaped from Bhowanipore police stations lock-up on Monday night was arrested in Kankinara early on Wednesday. 																								We got a tip-off that Munna Mullick had taken shelter in a relatives house. Our officers raided the house at dawn and arrested him. We are on the trail of the other two undertrials who had escaped, said deputy commissioner (south) Jawed Shamim.																								Apart from the 20-year-old Mullick, Tomato Sardar, 19, and Lalit Kumar Yadav, 23, had fled the lock-up. They were arrested in Kalighat on Saturday in connection with thefts. The three slipped through an opening created in the lock-up window wire mesh.																								Mullick took a bus to Rajabazar and then went to Kankinara on Monday. He has given leads about the whereabouts of his two associates, added Shamim.

 															- THERE WAS NO FIGHTING. WE HAD CLASSES AS USUAL A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Schoolgirls make their way happily to their institutions on AJC Bose Road on Thursday. In the background is a jeepful of armymen, keeping watch as the city comes out of its curfew curse. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Most schools caught in Wednesdays violence in the Park Circus area did not open the day after.																								St Augustines Day School and St Marys decided to remain closed on Thursday, soon after the government announced the imposition of an eight-hour curfew on the area on Wednesday evening.																								St James chose to remain open, but gave over as attendance was too low.																								Pratt Memorial School and Our Lady of Providence, too, were closed. Don Bosco, Park Circus, did not have to take a call as Thursday is its mid-week day off.																								Frank Anthony Public School, however, decided to go ahead with classes. Everything was normal today. There was no fighting. We had classes as usual, said Christopher Antec, a Class IV student of the school.																								Many students and their parents were in the dark on Wednesday about whether the schools would remain closed the next day. 																								Rows of cars  most parents decided to drop their children themselves, instead of relying on pool cars  were parked in front St James and Pratt Memorial in the morning.																								I came to know that there would be no classes today from a friend, whom I called yesterday evening. Some of my friends did not get the information in time, said Toonika Guha, a Class VIII student of Pratt Memorial School.																								Her brother, Treenok, who studies in Class II at St James, did not mind Thursdays break. I would have been afraid to go to school today. Now that everything is normal, I wont be scared tomorrow, Treenok said.																								My son normally comes in a pool car. But today, I decided to drop him myself. I and my wife will take turns to drop him to school and bring him back home for the next few days, said Himangshu Sen, whose son, a student of St James, reached home two hours behind schedule on Wednesday.																								St James principal Terence Ireland said the school gave over after assembly as only 150 students had turned up.																								Richard Gasper, who teaches at St Augustines Day School, said the authorities had to declare a holiday to clear the stones and bricks that had landed in the compound during the violence.																								Besides, there was also the possibility of trouble erupting again. We decided not to take any chance, he said.

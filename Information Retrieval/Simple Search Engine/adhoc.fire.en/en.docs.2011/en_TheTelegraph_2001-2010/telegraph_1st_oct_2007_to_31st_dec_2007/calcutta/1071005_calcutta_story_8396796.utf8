				 Software engineer suicide in Metro
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Niwas Kumar Pathak, a 30-year-old software engineer, committed suicide by jumping onto the Metro Railway tracks at Belgachhia station on Thursday.																								Pathak, a resident of Kumardubi, Dhanbad, worked in a software firm in the city. He had boarded the Tollygunge-bound train from Dum Dum at 11.40am but got off at Belgachhia station instead of Tollygunge, his usual stop, said a Metro Railway official.																								At 12.10pm, he jumped in front of a Dum Dum-bound train and died almost instantly. 																								One coach of the train had already entered the platform and he jumped right in front of it, giving the driver no chance to save him, the official said.																								Railway staff later recovered Pathaks mutilated body, which was sent for post-mortem. His name was found on the voters identity card that he was carrying.																								Train services were disrupted by the accident. Trains on the Dum Dum-bound track could not be operated till 12.40pm. Two Dum Dum-bound trains were cancelled and five others delayed.																								According to police, Pathak had been working in a private firm on Prince Anwar Shah Road for the past five months and stayed at Lalgarh, in Dum Dum. 																								His father, Ashutosh Pathak, who lives in Kumardubi, has been informed about his death. However, the news was not broken immediately to his mother.																								The police said they were unsure of the circumstances that drove Pathak to commit suicide. They are trying to contact his employer to get a lead in the case.

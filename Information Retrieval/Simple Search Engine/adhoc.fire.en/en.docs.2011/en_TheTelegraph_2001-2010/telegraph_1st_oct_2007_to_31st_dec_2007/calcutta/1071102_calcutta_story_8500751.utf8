				 Copper pipes stolen from hospital ACs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Copper pipes attached to the air-conditioners (ACs) in an operating theatre of SSKM Hospitals cardio-thoracic department have been stolen for the second time in a year.																								The theft was detected on Thursday morning and a police complaint has been lodged. Sources said it would take a few days to relay the pipes  around 80 ft  which connect the ACs with the cooling plant.																								The theft has rendered the ACs inoperative, but no surgery scheduled in the operating theatre (OT) was cancelled, as the department has two other OTs.																								The ACs, with 100 per cent air-freshening and circulation capacity, are very expensive. They are installed only in a handful of corporate hospitals, said a health department official.																								A preliminary probe suggests that the theft was an insiders job. There is no sign of anyone having broken into the OT, located on the fourth floor of the cardio-thoracic building, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.																								We are worried over repeated thefts in our department, said a senior cardio-thoracic surgeon.																								The copper pipes were earlier stolen in March. An inquiry was ordered but there was no breakthrough. 																								Hospital officials alleged that security on the premises is inadequate.

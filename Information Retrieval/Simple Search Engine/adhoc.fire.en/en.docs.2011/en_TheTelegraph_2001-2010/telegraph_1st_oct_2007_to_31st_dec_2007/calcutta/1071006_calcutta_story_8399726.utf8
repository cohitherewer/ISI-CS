				 Sunlight in pandal
 															- Alternative energy to generate awareness SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 RAY OF LIGHT: Solar panels being fitted to the pandal of 66 Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsav Committee, in Kalighat. Picture by Aranya Sen																								The sun god will play a part this Durga puja. A puja in Kalighat, off the Rashbehari Avenue crossing, is harnessing solar energy to light up its pandal.																								Last year, we had taken 35 KW electricity. We hope to cut down on the consumption by at least 10 KW, says Partha Pathak of 66 Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsav Committee. While this will result in a cut in the power bill of about Rs 10,000, the organisers stress on the environmental impact.																								The earths reserve of fossil fuel will end one day. So, Durga puja is a great platform to make people aware of the need to shift to non-conventional sources of energy, states chief organiser Rajat Sengupta. 																								According to the plan, 16 streetlights will be lit with compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), while 15 blinkers with light-emitting diode (LED) lamps will lead visitors along Dharmadas Street. Closer to the pandal on Nepal Bhattacharjee Street, there will be 11 solar lanterns with seven-watt CFL lamps hung from posts. Each streetlight will come equipped with a 74W photovoltaic panel. The 11W bulb in it will produce luminosity equal to that of a 100W incandescent bulb, says Anupam Baral of Geetanjali Solar Enterprise, which is providing the lights free.																								Inside the pandal, there will be six CFLs near the idol, while small LEDs will illuminate decorative conch shells bearing sketches in lac from three schools of painting  Midnapore, Bishnupur and Kalighat. All these lamps switch on and off on their own by sensing the intensity of sunlight.																								Conventional electricity will be used on the side, for lighting the streets and the stalls.																								In 2006, another big puja in the neighbourhood  Mudiali Club  had used solar energy but that was kept as a standby in case of emergencies. We had used two 11W CFL bulbs last year, though thankfully there was no need to use them. This year, we are in talks to use four, said Nitai Mukherjee of Mudiali Club.																								CESC is happy with the trend. Ninety-nine per cent power in Bengal comes from thermal energy, which involves burning of fuel emitting carbon dioxide. This adds to global warming. So, curtailing the consumption of conventional energy is a necessity, says Dilip Samajpati, the senior manager, CESC.																								The Puja lighting pioneers now have their eyes set on the sky. The only boon they seek from the goddess is four days of bright sunlight to power their solar panels.

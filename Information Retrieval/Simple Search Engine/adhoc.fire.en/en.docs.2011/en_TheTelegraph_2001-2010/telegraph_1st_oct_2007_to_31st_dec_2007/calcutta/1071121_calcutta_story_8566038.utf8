		 The rhythm divine																																	Sufism has its roots in the life and practices of the Prophet of Islam and Quran, the holy word. It espouses a well-founded and thorough interpretation of Islam, focussing on love, tolerance, worship of God and disciplining ones self. The order of the Whirling Dervishes, the Sufi mystics, was founded in the 13th century by Maulana Jalal-ud-Din Rumi. The ritual of the Whirling Dervishes features the revolving dance of the dervishes cloaked in long white robes accompanied by spiritual Sufi music performed live on instruments dating back to the time of Rumi. The ritual, called Sema, is based on the fact that the fundamental condition of our existence is to revolve. All beings are composed of revolving electrons, protons and neutrons in atoms. Everything revolves; the human being, too, lives by means of the revolution of these particles. This cyclical movement is followed by life too as each man returns to the dust he had come from. The goal of the semazen or the dervish, therefore, is not to lose consciousness or to be in some ecstasy, rather to harmonise these natural revolutions by consciously turning round and round, in tandem, as if with the smallest cell on earth and the largest star in the firmament. It is a way of expressing an overwhelming acknowledgement of the Creators greatness. Through the performance, Indialogue Foundation hopes to depict the way of Rumi, the great Muslim poet and mystic, and its relevance to our violent and battered world.

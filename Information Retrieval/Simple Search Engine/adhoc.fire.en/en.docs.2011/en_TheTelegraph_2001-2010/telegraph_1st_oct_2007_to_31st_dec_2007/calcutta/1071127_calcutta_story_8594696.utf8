				 Boost for city brand 
 															- Offer from UK to share expertise OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 BBD Bag, or Dalhousie Square, which a team of urban regeneration experts from the UK wants to help rejuvenate. A Telegraph picture																								How to bring fun and public activity back to the heart of the city? How to keep iconic and loved structures intact, link places to monuments and engage the community? How to create a Brand Calcutta?																								A team of urban regeneration experts from the UK has promised all help in branding the city better by sharing experiences and best practices that can lead to the rejuvenation of Calcuttas derelict districts.																								We hope to play matchmakers to our urban renewal experts and the various key agencies here to catalyse meaningful collaborative projects in areas like Dalhousie Square (BBD Bag), the riverfront and even in new growth areas such as Rajarhat and Dankuni, delegation head Douglas Barrett said at a seminar on Monday.																								Barrett, the director for construction and Asia Pacific, British Expertise, an independent, not-for-profit trade organisation based in London, feels Calcutta, with its inclusive administration, has a great chance to arrest its urban decay and revitalise the city core areas.																								British Expertise has an objective to help member-companies grow their business abroad and hopes to promote UK expertise in the field of intelligent and green building and design. The UK mission was presented by the British deputy high commission in Calcutta and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).																								Its important to re-use historical areas to articulate a vision and create a brand. And Calcutta is steeped in history, like London. So, we feel it should strive to preserve its core identity, so essential to build a brand, said Liz Wrigley, the director, Core Connections, a planning and communications consultancy in London.																								Regeneration was not in the lexicon of the UK even 20 years back, observed Stuart Smith of Wood Holmes Group, a niche strategy practice based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, stressing on the need for community engagement and stakeholder management in any urban regeneration project.																								The British deputy high commissioner in Calcutta, Simon Wilson, pointed out: No other nation has the depth of experience or holistic range of skills in delivering large-scale programmes of integrated regeneration. Calcutta can draw from that vast pool.																								The UK team later held a round-table with the Centre for Built Environment, a city-based think tank.

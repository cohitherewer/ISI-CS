				 Shot over hooch dispute
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bapi Das, 22, was shot dead in Kalighat early on Wednesday while trying to mediate in a dispute between illegal country liquor dealers in the area. 																								The death prompted local residents to go on the rampage in the illegal country liquor shops on Wednesday afternoon. A police picket was posted in the area.																								There are two illegal country liquor shops on Kalighat Road. One is run by Swapan Mondal, the other by Rabi Das. Quarrels and brawls are common between the two and their customers, said Gopal Saha, a local resident.																								On Tuesday evening, trouble broke out between Swapan and Rabi. At night, Bapi spoke to Rabi on behalf of Swapan, said an officer of Kalighat police station.																								Around 1.30am, Ravi and three of his companions, named Bubai, Bhutto and Gutkha, visited Bapis house and asked him to come out for a discussion. Soon, an argument broke out. One of Rabis men shot Bapi. He died on the way to SSKM Hospital, added the officer.																								Rabi and his accomplices are absconding. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Jawed Shamim said raids were on to nab the men.

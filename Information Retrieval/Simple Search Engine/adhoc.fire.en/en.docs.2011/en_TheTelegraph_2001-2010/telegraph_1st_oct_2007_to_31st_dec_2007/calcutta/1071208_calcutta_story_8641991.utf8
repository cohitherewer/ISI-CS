				 Six held for fuel theft

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Six members of a gang were arrested in Barasat on Thursday night for robbing fuel from vehicles on New Town Road.
																								The men siphoned off diesel from parked cars, some of which are used to ferry BPO employees in Sector V. They also drew out fuel from vehicles by holding the driver at gunpoint. 
																								For two months, we have been receiving complaints from vehicle-owners about fuel theft in the area. We laid a trap and arrested the six at Champadali, when they had assembled there. Some sharp weapons and an improvised revolver were found on them, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.
																								According to the police, 22-year-old Feroz Ali led the gang, with the help of Sheikh Laltu. The six would target vehicles parked on the road. They travelled in Ferozs mini-truck and used a hand-operated pump to draw fuel from the vehicles, said Ajay Mukherjee, the officer-in-charge of Rajarhat police station.
																								A typical operation lasted five to seven minutes. If the driver turned up before that, the men would hold him at gunpoint, Mukherjee added. 
																								The gang has stolen 5,000 litres of diesel in the past two months, according to a police estimate. They used to sell the stolen diesel to bus and autorickshaw operators in Rajarhat and Madhyamgram at Rs 25 a litre, said an investigating officer.

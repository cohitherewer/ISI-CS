				 Now, civic tie-up with district police
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After tying up with Calcutta police, the city civic authorities have decided to link up with the district police authorities of South 24-Parganas as well. About 85 sq km of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area is outside the purview of Calcutta police.																								Of the 55 police stations in the CMC area, 10 are under the district police authorities of South 24-Parganas. These are Behala, Jadavpur, Kasba, Metiabruz, Parama Island, Patuli, Purba Jadavpur, Regent Park, Tiljala and Thakurpukur. 																								Besides, there are three outposts in Bantala, Raipur and Sarsuna.																								Since almost all the present urban growth centres of the city, like east Calcutta, Behala, Jadavpur and Metiabruz, are in the state police area, a closer involvement of the district police is essential for better management of the city, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.																								According to municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, traffic management, erection of traffic lights at busy road intersections, prevention of encroachment on pavements, prevention of indiscriminate road-side parking of cars and vehicles, interception of illegal constructions and providing security to the civic officers to carry out assessment of buildings, and pulling down of billboards are some of the spheres where closer links between the district police and the CMC will help.																								Lacking their own force, the civic authorities cannot properly enforce civic rules and laws without police help, Bandyopadhyay added. The CMC tied up with the city police last week, following a meeting between Bandyopadhyay and the commissioner of city police Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.																								The civic authorities will pay the police in return.

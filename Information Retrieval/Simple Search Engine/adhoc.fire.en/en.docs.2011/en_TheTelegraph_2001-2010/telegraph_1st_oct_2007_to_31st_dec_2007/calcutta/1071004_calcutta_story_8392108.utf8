				 Cricketer a party to case 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Snehasish Ganguly, former Bengal cricketer and elder brother of Sourav, has been made a party to the case seeking a CBI inquiry into the death of Rizwanur Rahman.																								Justice Soumitra Pal allowed the inclusion of Snehasishs name in the case following a plea by Rizwanurs family members, who had moved the petition.																								Ganguly, assistant secretary of the Cricket Association of Bengal, had admitted that he had introduced the Todis to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. The court should allow me to add him as a party to the case, submitted Kalyan Banerjee, representing the Rahmans.																								The judge told him to send a notice asking Ganguly to be represented in court by a lawyer.																								On the plea for a CBI probe, Banerjee said the case should be handed over to the central agency, as the CID, a unit of the state police, cannot conduct an impartial probe into the death of Rizwanur.																								The judge also allowed Banerjee to file a supplementary affidavit. Some events have occurred after the petition was filed. The chief minister had announced a judicial probe without finalising the terms of reference of the commission. The matter should be included in the supplementary affidavit, Banerjee prayed.																								The case will be heard again on October 5.

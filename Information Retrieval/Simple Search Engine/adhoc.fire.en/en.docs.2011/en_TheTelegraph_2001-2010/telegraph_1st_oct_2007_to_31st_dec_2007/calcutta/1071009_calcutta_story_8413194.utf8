				 English made easy

But one might be willing to do a rethink upon looking in at Monika Poddars class of four on October 6. The class of four was eagerly answering queries in English on fables like The Ant and The Crow and The Hen and The Fox. The stories were being used to teach 60 students between five and six years of age, as part of the training given by Rotary Club of Calcutta Mahanagar to 30 teachers working with underprivileged children in 18 NGOs in and around Calcutta. Loreto Day School, Sealdah, hosted the training programme. 				 				 																															The teachers were part of a five-day-training programme in Concentrated Language Encounter (CLE), a method of teaching considered more rapid than traditional methods. It is especially useful for students from underprivileged backgrounds who are often forced to drop out from school abruptly, explained Sarla Totla of Rotary. 				 				 																															On the first three days, the teachers received training from Shiv Kumar Singh, a technical coordinator of CLE from Nepal and a Rotarian. The idea is to educate the students functionally, so that they can use the language to read, write and communicate. Under this method, they will not forget what they have learnt even if they stop studying, explained Singh, who took his training in CLE from Thailand. 				 				 																															Under the method, students progress from stories to paragraphs, sentences, words and letters. The teacher narrates the story to capture the interest of students, and then teaches them to recognise words aurally, simultaneously explaining their meaning in the sentence.

But once they get to know a story through repeated narration, they can have fun finding out where a particular word is, explained Poddar. 				 				 																															Sabita Saha of Welfare Uttara Sangha, an NGO, informed: All our students in the fourth standard have learnt to read and write in English in 15 days using CLE. The other classes are also progressing well.				 				 																															The next step, informed Singh, is to introduce CLE, accepted as the official method of teaching in Thailand and Bangladesh, in vernacular languages. The programme itself has six phases, implemented at two-year intervals. In Calcutta, the first phase is still being implemented. 				 				 																															Romila Saha				 				 																															Shout out loud				 				 																															Whats on your mind this week				 				 																															Beauty redefined				 				 																															The word fashion originally meant a trend. But in todays world, the word symbolises an industry. People are spending millions to get an artificial look. 				 				 																															Beauty has changed face with time. Todays is an age of artificial beauty. A person can do anything to look beautiful. Seeing this I cant help but share a story about Chanakya with readers. Chanakya was believed to have been very ugly. The Maurya king, on his first encounter with Chanakya burst into laughter. But the wise mans reply silenced the king and his council of ministers. Chanakya said: Are you laughing at me or my maker, who is your maker too?				 				 																															Beauty at first sight is all very well. But did Shakespeare refer merely to Cleopatras physical beauty when he said: Age cannot wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety? All that glitters is not gold, goes another immortal line from Shakespeare. 				 				 																															When we talk about beauty, it is not just the outer appearance of a person we refer to. Nothing is as commonplace as wanting to look pretty. It is the heart that matters and the soul behind it. Aishwarya Rais arched eyebrows and tinkling laughter are not what beauty is about. It is the mind that makes the body rich, said the bard in The Taming of the Shrew, following it with, kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, shall win my love. 				 				 																															Physical beauty is not like an eternal summer that never fades. So its not worth wasting resources on. 				 				 																															The purest treasure mortals can have is a spotless reputation. The mirror bears witness to fading looks. Hence to all those who fail to see beyond the physical beauty of a person I would say, open your eyes; there are more beautiful things on heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy!

Through the years, we have experienced a cultural unification with the aim of developing a globalised culture. But in this process, individual cultural values and the uniqueness of every ethnic group is gradually lost. In trying to copy the west, the city is gradually losing herself.				 				 																															It is really sad that many of the heritage buildings are in a dilapidated state and the authorities hardly care to renovate them. This negligence directly affects the tourism industry and a major source of income is lost. 				 				 																															Culturally, too, the city is losing its aura. The young generation is moving away from our traditions. Pursued by the desire to be global citizens, many youngsters turn out to be sheer iconoclasts while remaining ignorant about their culture. 				 				 																															Parents have a major role to play in exposing children to a cultural environment. Waning art-forms like Indian classical dance, mime and classical singing should also be encouraged. Although we say, old order yields place to the new, we must maintain our cultural backgrounds as they define who we are. 				 				 																															Tanmoy Das Lala,

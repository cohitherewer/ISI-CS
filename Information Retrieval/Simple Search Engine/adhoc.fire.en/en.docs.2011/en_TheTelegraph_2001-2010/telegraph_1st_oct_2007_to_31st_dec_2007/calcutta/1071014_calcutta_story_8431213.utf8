				 Puja bonus off the street
														 caleidoscope				 	 Police on the prowl? A Telegraph picture eyecatcher: 				 				 The E-Mall screen on Chittaranjan Avenue. Picture by Amit Datta 																								The Pujas are only a few days away and the police are in an overdrive. This is an annual ritual and bus passengers are not surprised. But they are not amused either.																								Suddenly overzealous cops on duty at the intersections of important roads are hauling up bus drivers on the slightest pretext, such as picking up passengers anywhere and everywhere. The same policemen for the rest of the year turn a blind eye to racing buses that more often than not kill pedestrians and break all road law.																								As usual, the passengers bear the brunt of police earnestness. They have to wait for about a quarter of an hour as money changes hands and the bus conductor returns totally unfazed, fine and reprimand notwithstanding. It is not they but the bus-owners who pay the fine. So why should they bother so long as they get their commission?																								But it often leads to bus passengers  many of them students and office-goers anxious to reach their destinations in time  to wonder if this is how those who are supposed to uphold the law enhance their Puja bonus. 																								She has left home																								How do the artisans of Kumartuli feel after the last of the Durga idols leave the hub where they have been given form, shape and beauty in the days leading to the festival?																								Sad, very sad, says Nemai Chandra Pal, the president of the Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskritik Samity.																								For him, the months leading to the festival result in a great bonding with the goddess. I dont get the same feeling during the Pujas. Its a pain of separation then, he says  a pain that Nemai and his colleagues say is like the feeling of separation from the daughter after her marriage.																								It feels like sending your daughter off after her marriage, a daughter that you have brought up with such loving care. The rooms feel so empty without her, says Babu Pal, the union secretary.																								There is a Puja at Kumartuli, but not many idol-makers, who were too busy with their work to be part of the organisation, play an active part in it. Durga puja is followed soon by Lakshmi puja, which makes them busy again, but everything is tinged with sadness for Ma who has left their studios to adorn the various pandals across the city.																								Display n distract																								Picadilly Circus  the famous London hotspot  has them by the dozen. So why cant Chittaranjan Avenue? And that too a single measly one.																								We are talking about the stolid old GEC building at the Madan Street intersection, recently turned into E-Mall, which sports a colourful electronic display in front that every now and then explodes into a splash of brilliant light and colour depicting clips from ads.																								To say it is merely eye-catching would be a gross underestimation of the power of this screen to grab the eyeballs of pedestrians and drivers of vehicles passing by. Calcuttans are famous for their habit of gawping at just about anything  and this screen shows ads and video clippings on electronic gadgets, films, lifestyle elements and attractive models, one of them an almost nude young man.																								Picadilly Circus dazzles and shines with backlit screens and electronic displays that light up to attract tourists. Those displays are not so great a hazard for drivers and pedestrians as they are not in continuous motion like the one on unruly Chittaranjan Avenue, and the discipline of drivers in London is in no way comparable with the impatience and indiscipline of Calcutta drivers.																								The E-Mall electronic display looks just too distracting for the good of goggle-eyed Calcuttans.																								(Contributed by Soumitra Das and Poulomi Banerjee)

				 Vehicles damaged in protest
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A group of youths taking part in a protest rally went on the rampage near the Park Circus crossing and damaged cars on Friday afternoon.																								About 200 people were taking part in the procession from Baker Hostel, in Taltala, to protest an article that appeared in a Bengali magazine named Patha Sankhep, whose office is at Entallys Padmapukur. The protestors tried to block Sundari Mohan Avenue around 3.15pm, said a senior police officer.																								The mob had cleared by the time we reached the spot. About 100 youths broke the windshields of cars parked at Padmapukur, he added.																								There were traffic snarls for half an hour between Padmapukur and Park Circus after the incident. Several shops on the stretch downed shutters.																								According to the residents of Padmapukur, the group of youths was looking for the magazines office. They vented their ire on the cars when they could not find the office. The youths are not local residents, said a man from Taltala, who took part in the rally.

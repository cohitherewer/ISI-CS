				 Aide of Burrabazar gangster in cop net
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Kamta Singh, an alleged extortionist and aide of gangster Gopal Tiwari, fell into the police net late on Friday, after being on the run for the past two years.																								Singh and Tiwari were reportedly hired by Haldirams owner Prabhu Shankar Agarwal in 2005 to kill the owner of a tea stall in Burrabazar.																								We arrested Singh from a hideout in the Burrabazar-Posta area. After hiding in Hyderabad, Varanasi, Gujarat and Mumbai for the past couple of years, Singh returned a few days ago to extort a businessman in Burrabazar, said Ajoy Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).																								The police said the tea-stall owner, Satyanarayan Thakur, had turned down Agarwals demand to vacate his house in Jagmohan Mullick Lane, which the businessman wanted to convert into a highrise.																								On March 30, 2005, Tiwari, Singh and three others came to the tea-stall and by mistake, fired at Satyanarayans 21-year-old nephew Pramod. The bullet pierced Pramods right thigh.																								Agarwal was arrested at Palam airport in Delhi on June 6, 2005. The others involved in the crime were subsequently tracked down.																								An officer on the case said: Singh was Tiwaris most trusted aide. His main business was to extort money from businessmen of the Burrabazar-Posta belt. He also helped Tiwari run his extortion racket.																								Speaking on Singhs role in the plot to kill Thakur, an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad said: He, Tiwari and two others spent the night before attacking Pramod in a red-light area. Singh was present on the spot along with Kulwant Singh, Manoj Sharma and Raju Sonkar, when the youth was shot.

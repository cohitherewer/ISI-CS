 We Ask You Answer				 Custom vs clean waters
 Todays question: Should immersion in the river be stopped to save the Hooghly? More responses will be published next week				 With the flow: Idols with their finery float in the Hooghly after immersion					Gouri Chatterjee, 
													 Dum Dum				 					There is no necessity to stop immersion. I would rather that the height of the image be shortened as that would make it easier to immerse. Pollution will also be less. But the government should take proper steps for immersion at particular ghats. 									

Biman Saha. 
																		Lake Town																																																														Yes, it must be stopped to save the large waterbodies that are Natures gifts to us. I think each locality should have some earmarked areas, say, a corner of a park, or a space near a market, where the idols should be kept after the Pujas, whereby they will be washed away naturally by rain. Even the local ponds or other large waterbodies should not be used for immersion. Puja organisers should also use eco-friendly colours and drapes, and idols should be as small as feasible. Religion should never overshadow practical necessity. 									

Bhupen Bose,
																		Dum Dum Park																																																														Certainly. With the number of pujas increasing every year, immersion in the Hooghly is polluting the river. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the idols of Lord Ganesha are painted with organic colours in order to avoid pollution of water. In West Bengal, idol-makers may be encouraged to use non-chemical colours. Moreover, there should be a proper guideline to not dump all unwanted elements like flowers, earthen pots and leaves in the river. With nearly 4,000 idols of different goddesses being immersed in it, the water of the Hooghly is definitely getting polluted. 									Prahlad Agarwala, 
																		Majdia, Nadia																																																														The Hooghly river is being constantly polluted due to many reasons and the sincere efforts of the government to keep the river clean have proved futile. Immersion in the river, especially during Durga puja, causes large-scale pollution as well as deposits a phenomenal amount of silt on the bed. Given this backdrop, immersion should be stopped to save the river. 									

Bratini, 
																		Behala																																																														It is a difficult question to answer. If immersion in the Hooghly be stopped then where will the idols be immersed? On the other hand, the river is indeed getting dirty after immersion. There are also religious strictures about immersing idols in the river. So, let the idols to be immersed in the Hooghly but after the immersion, the authority must swing into action. Not a single accessory or flower must be left behind in the river. If this is possible, then immersion in the Hooghly need not to be stopped. 									

Sovan Mridha,
																		Sonarpur																																																														I consider Hooghly to be the mother of Calcutta. We should not forget that the city has flourished by it. After five days of revelry, into the Hooghly goes Durga, finery, flowers and whatever else, creating pollution in the river and on its bank. If this is continued, the Hooghly will lose its predominance. So, the government and every puja committee should explore a suitable alternative to save the river.									

Sukumar Ghosh, 
																		Mukundapur																																																														As immersion of idols is an age-old custom, it cannot be stopped by any means. Thanks to dishonest promoters, the number of local waterbodies is dwindling fast. Therefore, puja organisers have no other alternative but to immerse the idols in the Hooghly. To save the river, they have to be follow the Chandernagore model of eco-friendly immersion. As soon as the idols are immersed, the wooden structures are to be cut off from the idol and dragged back to the ghats along with the hay, ropes and other materials by civic workers and Puja volunteers before they drift away. This way, the immersion may be continued without polluting the Hooghly. 									Rathin Chatterjee,
																		Dum Dum 																																																														Definitely. The idols are painted with chemical colours. Both the idol-makers and organisers must be alerted about this aspect. They may use natural colours on the idols. The spots where idols are immersed should be far from residential places on the banks.									

P. Pramanik, 
																		Santoshpur Avenue																																																														Fanaticism in the name of religion whereby 1,000 images are immersed in the river in Calcutta alone should immediately be stopped either by legislation or by coercion to save the Hooghly from further pollution and siltation. 									

Biswajyoti Bagchi, 
																		Alipore 																																																														The stopping of immersion alone can neither save the river Hooghly nor be a solution to immersion-related problems. Though several crores of rupees have been spent by the authority on the Ganga Action Plan, little has practically been done to save the river. The filth and sewage discharge into Tollys Nullah and Beleghata Canal also pollute the Hooghly river. For immersion of idols in the river, both Calcutta Port Trust and Calcutta Municipal Corporation should act jointly to curb the menace by forcing people not to dump anything other than the clay idols in the river. The clubs should pay at least two per cent of their puja budget to the municipality as a fee and should inform the civic body in advance about their choice of immersion site. The wooden structures should be removed by cranes positioned on the bank and on a barge nearby. When Chandernagore has shown the way, why should Calcutta lag behind? 									Indranil Sanyal,
																		Address not given 																																																														No, immersion in the river need not be stopped as it is not the only cause for pollution. Proper dredging from time to time can keep the river in good shape. Poor maintenance is the only cause for the decay of Hooghly. So, why blame immersion? Besides, where will the idols be immersed if not in the Hooghly? But, the new idea of using sling cranes for picking up the idols just after the immersion is a welcome move. The puja organisers can afford the crane-handling charges which are nominal in comparison to their colossal expenditure. 									

Pankaj Bhatia,
																		Loudon Street 																																																														No. But the immersion must be restricted to designated places.									Anil Kumar Sen,
																		Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane 																																																														Yes. Immersion of idols in the river is destroying the lifeline that is the Hooghly. So many hazardous chemicals go into the making of the idol. 									Manashi Chakraborty,
																		Golf Green 																																																														Every religion has its set of traditional rituals. Immersion is part of that in Hinduism. It should not be stopped on any pretext.									

Ranjan Kr Joardar,
																		Dhakuria 																																																														Immersion in the river should immediately be stopped for the safety of the people. The pollution control board should keep strict vigil.									

Supratim Nandan,
																		Ashoknagar 																																																														When it is a matter of religious tradition, the ritual should not be stopped. If immersion in the Hooghly has to be stopped, one has to consider alternate sites like Rabindra Sarovar, Laldighi, Adi Ganga etc. The height and the number of idols should also be reduced.									

Satyen Biswas, 
																		Pathakpara, Behala																																																														Immersion of images has been going on for decades. Let it go as the river melts the idols naturally and only the bamboo structures remain. These can be removed, if needed.									

Diptimoy Ghosh, 
																		Salt Lake																																																														It is not desirable that immersion will be stopped just to keep the river free of litter. A simultaneous cleaning procedure should be devised. The mayors intention to move high court to ban immersion in the Hooghly is ridiculous. People will object to the move. Why doesnt he clean the Adi Ganga instead?

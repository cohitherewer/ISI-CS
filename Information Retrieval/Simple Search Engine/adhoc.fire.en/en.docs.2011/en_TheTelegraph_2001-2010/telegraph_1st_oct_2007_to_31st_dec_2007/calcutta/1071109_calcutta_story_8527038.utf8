				 Kareena the cracker-box cover girl
 															- Actor Shahid Kapoor, sporting hero Dhoni the male fireworks-pushers POULOMI BANERJEE				 	 A child carries home both Kareena Kapoor and M.S. Dhoni. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Kareena Kapoor has more sizzle than Aishwarya Rai; Mahendra Singh Dhoni has more spark than Sourav Ganguly  on the covers of fireworks boxes this Diwali.																								The stars keep changing, depending on popularity. Aishwarya was really hot till a few years ago. Now, she has gone thanda. Kareena and Priyanka Chopra are the most common faces on the boxes, says Shahid of Suraj Stores, at Baji Bazaar, off Shahid Minar. 																								In the three decades that Shahid has been selling a variety of fireworks for Diwali, Sridevi has the best record as cracker cover girl  she was there on every box for years, he recounts admiringly.																								The obsession with Bollywood stares you in the face at the stalls selling sparklers on Diwali eve. If Bebo is the big draw at Baji Bazaar (though till late on Thursday, sources confirmed that Saif Ali Khan had not dropped in), Priyanka is a distant second and Ash a consolation-prize third. The only Bollywood male hotbod on show is, ironically, Kareenas ex-boyfriend and Jab We Met hero Shahid Kapoor.																								Breaching the Bollywood bastion is the sporting hero, who is also Mr Fireworks  M.S. Dhoni. The Indian captain is a huge hit after Twenty20, explains Anwar, handing out a box of rockets. The only other sporting star lighting up homes on Souravs home turf will be Sania Mirza.																								Bollywood and cricket have combined to kill the craze for the scantily-clad circus women who would crowd the covers of cracker boxes. The trend of putting pictures of gods and goddesses on the cover is also over as once the boxes are discarded, people trample on them, explains Hemanta Paul of fireworks store K.L. Paul.																								The use of stars to sell fireworks is all about packaging and push. Presentation is very important today. Kids, especially, are drawn to boxes with pictures of stars, says Shahid. But Sanjay of Kamala Prasad Gupta and Sons, another prominent fireworks store, is quick to clarify that these are tactics employed by smaller manufacturers. Big, branded fireworks dont use such pictures of celebrities to grab eyeballs, he says.

				 Trade bar on unsafe sites
 															- CIVIC LEASH ON LICENCES A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will not renew the trade licences of shops or companies operating from unsafe buildings. The move, civic officials hope, will prompt the owners of unsafe buildings and their tenants to undertake repairs.																								A meeting called by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya last week discussed a proposal that once the CMC declares a building unsafe, no commercial establishment will be allowed to operate from there.																								Civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and mayoral council member (building) Dipankar De, among others, attended the meeting.																								There are more than 5,000 unsafe buildings in the city and around 1,400 have already received notices from the CMC. Engineers in the civic building department, however, said structurally weak buildings in the city total more than 20,000 and the number is on the rise.																								Most of these buildings are in the Burrabazar, Posta, NS Road, Ezra Street, Canning Street, Chinabazar, Sealdah, Anthony Bagan, Chandni Chowk, Hatibagan and the Shyambazar areas. While five per cent of the buildings are fully commercial, around 60 per cent are used for both commercial and residential purposes.																								For public safety, the CMC should not renew the trade licence of shops or companies operating from these buildings, said commissioner Bandyopadhyay. Once the CMCs e-connectivity programme is ready by March 2008, the licence department will be up to date about the buildings being declared unsafe.

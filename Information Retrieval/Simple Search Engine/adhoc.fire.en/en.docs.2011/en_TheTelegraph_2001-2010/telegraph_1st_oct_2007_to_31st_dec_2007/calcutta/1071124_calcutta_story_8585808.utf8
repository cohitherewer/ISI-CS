				 Dec. 5 deadline set for Besu upgrade
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN NEW DELHI 																								The Centre is likely to take a final call on the proposed upgrade of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) by December 5.																								Sources said Union human resources development minister Arjun Singh has set the deadline to his officials, following his meetings with two Bengal members of Parliament (MPs).																								Singh is learnt to have accepted most of the states proposals on the upgrade, but did not disclose to the MPs the new status of the 150-year-old Shibpur campus.																								On Thursday, Bankura MP Basudeb Acharya told Singh that half the seats in the university should be reserved for students from Bengal, post-upgrade. The minister seemed to understand our point, Acharya told Metro. 																								He also iterated the state stand that it be allowed to nominate a director on the board of governors of the university.																								Howrah MP Swadesh Chakraborty  Besu falls in his constituency  met Singh on Friday and raised the same demands.																								Ministry sources said both proposals may be accepted, though that may cost Besu its desired status of Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology (IIEST).																								According to the ministrys policy, institutes upgraded to the IIEST level must be fully under the Centres control. Admission to these institutes are conducted through the central Common Entrance Tests.																								Officials hinted that the Centre may finally bring Besu within the ambit of an amended National Institute of Technology (NIT) Act.																								But Besu, with its emphasis on postgraduate education and research, does not want to be clubbed with NITs, which are primarily undergraduate institutes.																								A Centre-appointed panel had suggested in 2005 that Besu and six other institutes across the country be upgraded to Indian institutes of technology or that they be declared institutes of national importance.																								For Besu to be declared an IIEST, the Centre must enact a separate piece of legislation.

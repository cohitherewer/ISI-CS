		 Three amigos from Goa																																	Three Amigos is the name given to three painters Deviprasad C. Rao, Suhas Shilker and Swatee Nair from Goa. Their association all along has been extremely productive. No matter how disparate their approaches may be, they share a sense of what art is or could be. Shilker has been painting for the past 27 years, while both Rao and Nair took to painting after their stint in journalism. Standing on the common ground of abstractness, Raos Minutiae Series is acrylic on canvas whereas Shilkers collection consists of works in oil and acrylic on canvas. Nair showcases her works in mixed media on canvas; one of them appears right.

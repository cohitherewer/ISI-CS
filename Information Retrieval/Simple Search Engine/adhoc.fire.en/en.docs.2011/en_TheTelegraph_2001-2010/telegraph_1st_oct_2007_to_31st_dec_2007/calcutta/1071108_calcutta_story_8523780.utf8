				 Queries for pyari bahu
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Some of Priyanka Todis articles which she has asked Rizwanur Rahmans family to return. Picture by Amit Datta																								Kishwar Jahan has a few questions for Priyanka Todi  Itne din tum kahan thi, beti? Humara saath kyun nahin diya? Rizwanur agar mera beta hai, to woh tumhara pati bhi hai																								A day after the Rahmans received a letter from Priyanka through a law firm, Rizwanurs mother wrote to her daughter-in-law, asking her to take away her belongings personally, instead of communicating through solicitors.																								If Priyanka turns up at the 7B Tiljala Lane home, Kishwar Jahan told Metro, she will have a heart-to-heart talk with her, holding her hands, and ask her why she had not sided with Rizwanurs family during the crisis.																								I will welcome her with all my heart and ask her why she had to send a letter through her lawyer. This is her house, too, and she can walk in whenever she feels like and say whatever she has to say. Rizwanurs death is as much her loss as it is mine. If she comes, we could share our sorrows, said Kishwar Jahan.																								The letter from Priyankas lawyer said that she would not return to her husbands home and asked Kishwar Jahan to return all that she had left behind at the Tiljala Lane house.																								In her three-page reply to Priyanka, Kishwar said she was hurt that she would ask for her belongings through a letter, asking them to hand everything over to a peon of Victor Moses and Co.																								Kishwar Jahans letter, which addresses her bahu as Pyari Priyanka, was sent through speed post to the Todis Salt Lake home. A copy was forwarded to Victor Moses.																								Since September 21, the day I lost my son, I have been hoping that you will turn up, the letter stated. The way my younger son and your husband was killed following a despicable conspiracy of some senior police officers and your father Ashok Todi, you should have come to us... I had hoped that you would side with us in... the probe into the mysterious death of your husband. But you didnt turn up even for a minute. 																								And then a final plea to Priyanka: Please dont send me any letter through your lawyers. If you have anything to tell me, I will be happy if you write to me directly.

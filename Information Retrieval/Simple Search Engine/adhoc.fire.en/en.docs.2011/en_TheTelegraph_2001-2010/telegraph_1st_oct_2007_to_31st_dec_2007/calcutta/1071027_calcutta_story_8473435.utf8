				 Celluloid festival at film school
 															- BYPASS ADDRESS TO SUSPEND CLASSES AND HOLD SCREENINGS KUSHALI NAG				 	 Koel Mullick and Jeet shoot for a film on the SRFTI campus. The film school is slated to be a venue of the upcoming Calcutta Film Festival 																								The Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) will be one of the venues of the 13th Calcutta Film Festival, starting November 10. This is the first time the EM Bypass address will hold screenings of festival films, for which a number of foreign delegates are expected to turn up. 																								The screenings will be held in the 400-seat auditorium, equipped with Dolby digital sound system.																								We have the infrastructure needed to screen films and when the film festival organisers approached us, we agreed readily. Its good news for our students. We have the latest projection facilities, Cinemascope and various lenses to screen all kinds of films. We will also host discussions between the students and delegates after every show in the open-air theatre, said SRFTI director Swapan Mullick.																								Renowned Argentine film-maker Fernando Solanas is scheduled to visit the institute and interact with the students during the festival.																								The package for the SRFTI includes contemporary, classic and documentary films. There will be three shows a day  noon, 2.30pm and 5pm. Classes will be suspended for the seven days of the festival. The institute will distribute delegate cards among its students, film schools and universities. 																								The SRFTI plans to organise additional screenings of documentaries in the preview theatre, which can hold about 100 people. 																								Three diploma films from the film school will be part of the festival  Raka Duttas Chinese Whispers, which was screened at Cannes this year, Sweta Merchants Lal Juto and Bishnu Dev Halders Bagher Bachcha will be shown in the festivals documentary section. 																								The SRFTI is gearing up for a few more firsts. The institutes community radio channel is scheduled to be launched in November. There will be discussions on films with scholars and film-makers. Our students will also take part in them. The channel will air cultural programmes. We are waiting for the licence, said Mullick. The radio jockeys for the channel have been auditioned and appointed.																								Next in line are two new departments and recording studios. We plan to set up two sophisticated recording studios, and animation and production design departments. Three-year diploma courses will be offered in the subjects, with 10 seats each. Since these will be residential courses, we will need at least two more buildings, added Mullick.

				 Thieves switch off solar lamps
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE																								Solar streetlights have become a soft target for thieves, forcing a rethink of the plan to use them in place of conventional streetlights.																								Theft of vital components has made four solar streetlights on Jessore Road unfit for use. The lights were installed as part of a pilot project.																								We have come to know about the thefts. Unless the local residents and the police become more vigilant, it is not possible to use these lights, said S.P. Gon Chowdhury, the director of the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA).																								The four solar power-operated red blinkers on Jessore Road  at Lake Town, Bangur Avenue, Tentultala and near Patipukur rail overbridge  were set up by South Dum Dum Municipality about six months ago.																								The blinkers were powered by 20-watt solar panels and indicated bus stops, said Anup Mitra, a councillor of the municipality.																								In the first week of July, we found that solar panels, costing over Rs 7,000 each, were missing. Within a few days, the specially-designed light boxes, too, were found broken, said a municipality official. 																								According to him, the panels are in great demand in the market.																								A WBREDA official said: There was an attempt to take away the battery boxes but they were under lock and key. The solar panels in the streetlights are fitted at a height of over 15 to 20 feet. So, they are not easy to steal. We are planning to introduce more safety measures to prevent theft of the panels.

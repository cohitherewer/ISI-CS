				 Delay in neglect cases

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The state medical council has acted only on a small percentage of negligence complaints against doctors, alleged People for Better Treatment (PBT), on its sixth foundation day on Sunday.
																								The organisation had helped the kin of about 100 victims of negligence to file complaints with the council but less than five cases have been decided, said Moloy Ganguly, the secretary of PBT.
																								In the current situation, only the council can bring an errant doctor to book. If justice is not meted out, violence against doctors and hospitals will continue, he said.
																								According to the members of PBT, it is not possible for the common man to fight a long legal battle against doctors and so, they are forced to approach the medical council.
																								Ashok Chowdhury, the president of the medical council, pointed out that following proper procedures were resulting in delays.
																								We have to go through a set of processes before deciding on a case. Doctors take time to reply. Complainants, too, seek time for submitting supporting documents, added Chowdhury.

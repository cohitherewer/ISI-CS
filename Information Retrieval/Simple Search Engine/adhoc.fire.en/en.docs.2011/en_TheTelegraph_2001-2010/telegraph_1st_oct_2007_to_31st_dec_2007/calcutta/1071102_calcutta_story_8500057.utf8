				 Steps to salvage hall
 															- STAGE VETERANS ADVICE HEEDED A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Refurbishment of Minerva theatre. A Telegraph picture																								More than 100 seats will be removed to try and salvage the refurbished Minerva theatre. The decision comes days after a group of stage veterans had inspected the 6/1 Beadon Street address and found it unsuitable for theatre.																								Their suggestions have been forwarded to the chief minister. He has directed that the necessary measures be taken and the hall be opened only when they have been put in place, Anup Motilal, the state director of culture, said on Thursday.																								The renovation of the century-old theatre had started in 2001 at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees instance. Spearheaded by the CMDA and guided by architect Dulal Mukherjee, it has cost the state exchequer Rs 5 crore and was slated for a November unveiling  till Sundays inspection.																								Rudraprasad Sengupta, Manoj Mitra, Ashok Mukhopadhyay and Meghnad Bhattacharya were critical of the impeded view from the first-floor balcony, the faulty seating arrangements on the ground floor and reduced stage space at Minerva.																								We are trying to create a central aisle for better circulation and to facilitate better viewing. It is not possible to do away with the ring-shaped balcony for its heritage value, but seats will be taken off from the problem areas. Around 100 seats will be removed, said Gopinath Chatterjee, the executive engineer for the real estate sector, CMDA.																								As advised by the theatre team, some seats from the first-floor balcony will be shifted to the second floor, with the proposed Utpal Dutt archive being moved to the annexe.																								Architect Mukherjee had told Metro he was under pressure from government officials to increase the number of seats to 500, leading to a design disaster. We will visit the hall along with stage experts to identify the problem points. We plan to bring down the number of seats to around 350 and try for a central and a cross aisle. The work should finish by December, he added.																								Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya has urged Dilip Kumar Chakraborty, the principal secretary of information and cultural affairs, to convene a meeting on Minerva involving theatre veterans on November 5.

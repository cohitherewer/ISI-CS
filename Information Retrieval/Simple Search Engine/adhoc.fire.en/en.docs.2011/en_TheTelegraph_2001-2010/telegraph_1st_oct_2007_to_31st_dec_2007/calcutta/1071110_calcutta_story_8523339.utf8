 															- REHAB EFFORT CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE				 	 One of the station mothers and her infant given shelter by NGO Tracks																								Shankari Naskar (name changed) gave birth to her son at Howrah station. She begged at the station for 15 years till Tracks (Training Resources and Care for Kids on the Station) gave her shelter. 																								Michael Anthony, a bank official in Calcutta, is the brain behind the 17-year-old NGO that started by holding classes on Platform 8 for children living on the station premises. It is now ready to take in mothers and babies living in the station.																								Shankari is the guiding force of the effort. I am grateful to Tracks for helping me and have put my life and soul into bettering the lives of others like me, she says.																								While working with platform children, the NGO workers realised that those who earn by picking rags and stealing are difficult to rehabilitate. They decided to work with destitute mothers and their infants or pregnant women to stop the children from becoming addicts, thieves or criminals.																								The unit for mothers and infants is coming up at the NGOs home in Amtala, where platform children are being given shelter for 15 years. An exhibition of photographs of railway mothers and children, paintings by the children, and embroidery and craft by the mothers at Junior Oxford Bookstore on November 18 and 19 will mark the units launch.																								Ten needy mothers and their infants will be put up at the home. They will be given vocational training, apart from tips on parenting, health and hygiene.																								Many child inmates would run away from the home, not wanting to lose out on easy money. The mothers sometimes abandon the children on the platform and go into prostitution. It is difficult to convince them to leave the platform, says Margaret Waterworth, a UK citizen who has been involved with Tracks from the time it was conceived.																								The children who stay at the Amtala home study in local schools. Some of them are taking their board exams. We hope that the success stories will encourage others, adds Waterworth.

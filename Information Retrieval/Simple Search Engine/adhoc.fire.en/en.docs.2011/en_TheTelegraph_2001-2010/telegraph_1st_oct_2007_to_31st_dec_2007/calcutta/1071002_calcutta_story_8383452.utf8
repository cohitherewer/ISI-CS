				 Query on Lalbazars authority
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Rizwanur Rahmans family questioned in court on Monday the authority of senior officers at Lalbazar to summon him and his wife Priyanka.																								If there had been any complaint against the couple, it should have been filed with Karaya police station, as Rizwanurs Tiljala Lane house is under its jurisdiction. Action, if any, should have been taken by the police station, Kalyan Banerjee, counsel for the Rahmans, said in the high court during the hearing of a plea for a CBI probe into the death.																								The court should decide the authority and jurisdiction of Lalbazar, he added. Banerjee also asked whether the police are empowered to summon a couple against whom there is no written complaint.																								He drew the courts attention to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjees comment that it was the duty of the police to stand by Ashok Todi, who had lost his 23-year-old daughter Priyanka.																								Was there any FIR against Rizwanur, charging him with kidnapping Priyanka? If not, the police chief should be prosecuted, Banerjee argued. 																								He said that among the accused officers, deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar had refused to accept a copy of the petition.																								The hearing will continue on October 3. 																								Former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray was present in court to lend moral support to Rizwanurs family.

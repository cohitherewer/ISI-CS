				 Highrise shade on health

 SUBHRO SAHA
																								A national conclave of architects and planners has sought to shift the focus from seducing architecture to healthy homes built through sustainable development.
																								The conclave, which ended on Monday, called for an urban health commission to formulate guidelines to curb the uncontrolled real estate boom in Calcutta and on its fringes, that is affecting public health.
																								The cage in the city, a three-day seminar on housing, health and hygiene, organised by the Centre for Built Environment (CBE), discussed issues in planning, design and management and the impact of highrises on public health.
																								A state-level urban health commission for housing, including experts from healthcare, is imperative. It is also necessary to decentralise sanitation, making each housing project self-sufficient in waste management and recycling, stressed Sonia Gupta, a research fellow at CBE and the convener of the seminar.
																								The construction rush has led to a qualitative decline in health and hygiene conditions, particularly in the lower-income segment, felt S. Shiva Kumar, a professor of architecture at MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore. This has put a burden on urban infrastructure services like water supply and sanitation.
																								The market-dictated kind of housing machines being built in our cities are far removed from the desired housing solutions, agreed Sibabrata Halder, the head of the department of architecture at Bengal Engineering and Science University.
																								The architects concurred on the need to integrate the economically weak into the master plan and urban design of the city. Anupam Banerji, from the school of architecture of Canadas University of Waterloo, defined housing as the built response to accommodate varying lifestyles.
																								Inadequate and contaminated water, coupled with poor sanitation, result in diseases and reduced economic opportunity. Simple methods of obtaining water and disposing of waste can ensure good health, observed CBEs Gupta.

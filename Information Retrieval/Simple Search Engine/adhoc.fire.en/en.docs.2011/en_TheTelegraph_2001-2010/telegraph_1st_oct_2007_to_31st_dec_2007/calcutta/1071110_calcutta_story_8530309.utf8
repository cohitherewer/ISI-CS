				 Diplomat bullish on Bengal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Germany hopes to double its trade ticket with India to 20 billion Euros in the next five years and Calcutta will make a significant contribution, feels Hans Henning Blomeyer-Bartenstein (picture left).																								The German ambassador and director-general for Asian and Pacific affairs, Federal Foreign Office in Berlin, who was in Calcutta recently, noticed a lot of readiness in the city for foreign investment.																								Like all metros, Calcutta is a huge city with its attendant problems. However, its amply clear theres lots happening here and the positive vibrations are most evident in the warmth of the people. We are confident this buzz isnt just superficial and the recent flow of German trade delegations to the city is acknowledgement of that confidence, said Blomeyer-Bartenstein.																								He and his colleague in the Federal Foreign Office, Gudrun Sraga, the head of the South Asia division, were happy with the tenor of their talks with chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb. We have identified infrastructure and food processing as the key areas for possible collaboration, Sraga told Metro.																								Science and technology, power and small and medium enterprises could be the other fields of meaningful cooperation with Bengal, added the German Asian and Pacific affairs head. Germany is a world leader in alternative energy modules and we can offer technology to assess climate changes and achieve energy efficiency, stressed Blomeyer-Bartenstein.

				 Debut flight empty
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The much-hyped Calcutta-Singapore operations of Air India Express made a disastrous debut on Sunday.																								The inaugural flight of Air Indias low-cost carrier took off from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport with 28 passengers and returned with just two passengers. The aircraft has 180 seats.																								Sources said Mondays flight from Calcutta had even fewer bookings.																								Calcutta airport sources said the flight took off at 7am after the service was inaugurated by V. Thulasidas, the chairman and managing director of Air India. It returned at 5.15pm.																								Airline officials blamed the poor turnout on the delayed start in bookings, which opened on September 28.																								The directorate-general of civil aviation had told Air India that there was a delay in getting permission from the Singapore government for operating the flights. As soon as the clearance came, we launched the service, said an Air India official.																								Airline officials hoped the situation would improve in the next few weeks. The trend indicates that the flights during the Puja will go full, an official said.																								Thulasidas said the flight was not launched for short-term gains. We have come here to stay and want the market to grow slowly but steadily, he pointed out. 																								Air India Express will also fly to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur from Calcutta shortly.

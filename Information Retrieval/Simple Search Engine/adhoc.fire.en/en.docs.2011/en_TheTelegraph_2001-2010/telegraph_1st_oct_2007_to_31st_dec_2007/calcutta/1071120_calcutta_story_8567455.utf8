				 Blaze at heritage park
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Firemen survey the damage at Rang Manch in Swabhumi. A Telegraph picture																								A fire broke out in Rang Manch, an auditorium inside Swabhumi, on Monday afternoon, causing major damage. 																								According to fire department officials, employees of the heritage park off EM Bypass noticed smoke coming out of the auditorium, which spans 5,000 sq ft and seats about 800 people, around 3.30pm. 																								We received calls from the park authorities and Phoolbagan police station informing us of the fire around 3.45pm. Six tenders were rushed there. The flames were put out in an hour, said Bibhas Guha, the divisional fire officer.																								P. Sandeep, representing the Swabhumi management, however, said: It was a small fire, resulting from a spark around 3.30pm. Our in-house team was able to control it within 20 minutes. 																								The fire department has started a case  under section 285 of the Indian Penal Code, relating to negligent conduct resulting in a fire  against the heritage park authorities. The firemen are also probing the cause of the fire. 																								The park authorities had the infrastructure to tackle the situation, but they hardly used it. We have started a case as the incident could have led to loss of lives, added Guha. 																								There was inflammable material in the hall. The flames spread rapidly, said a fire department official.																								The auditorium was to host a programme by a television channel on Tuesday. The set erected for the purpose was gutted. 																								Sandeep asserted that the park had the required permissions from the fire department and fire drills were regularly carried out.																								We have summoned the officials of the park. We will take action after reviewing the probe report and the parks fire-fighting preparedness, said fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee.

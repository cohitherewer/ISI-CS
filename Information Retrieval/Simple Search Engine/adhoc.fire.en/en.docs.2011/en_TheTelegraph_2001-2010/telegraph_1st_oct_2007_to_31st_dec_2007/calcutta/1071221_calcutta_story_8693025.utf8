				 Circus jumbo yet to cool down

 A STAFF REPORTER

(Bottom): Rupkali, a 60-year-old female tusker, went on the rampage in a village near Belmuri, in Dhaniakhali, Hooghly, about 40 km from Calcutta, after being separated from her mate Chanchal early on Thursday. When she realised Chanchal was not with her while bathing in a pond, Rupkali damaged crops in farmlands, along with some huts, and uprooted a few trees, creating panic among local residents. The mayhem continued for nearly six hours, until Chanchal returned. Picture by Krishna Chandra Mishra
																								Bhola, the 42-year-old male elephant of Nataraj Circus, shook off the effects of the tranquilliser that was administered to him on Wednesday evening and tore down a part of the big top on Thursday.
																								He remained restless all day, prompting police to ask the circus management to cancel all shows until he was shifted off the premises.
																								According to Bholas doctor, Gobinda Ghosh, of the State Veterinary Hospital, the elephant may remain in heat, or mast, for a few more days.
																								Forest department doctors said the elephant will be kept under observation for 72 hours. Initially, we had planned to keep him here for that period. But we have now decided to let forest department officers take him away, said Sailen Ghosh, the general manager of Nataraj Circus. 
																								Bhola was straining at the ropes and chains that bound his legs on Thursday. He trampled the leaves he was given to munch, he wound his trunk around his tusks and raised his head irritatedly. But he didnt trumpet all day. His meal was 10 kg of paddy and wheat khichdi, sugarcane and coconut leaves.
																								Circus staff said Bhola didnt have a mate after Nutus (his 10-year-old son) mother died two years ago. There are two female elephants, but Suman, 15, is not fully grown and Basanti, 20, is not in heat.
																								Bhola now performs a single act of Shiva puja. Earlier, he would play cricket, too. But we dont allow him to do that trick any more since he hits the ball too hard and breaks the lights, Ghosh said.

				 Once bitten, twice shy
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Last-minute purchases at Baji Bazaar, on the Maidan, on Thursday. Picture by Amit Datta																								Shankhadeep Chatterjee is wiser this Diwali.																								Rounded up last year in front of his Jodhpur Park apartment for bursting crackers on the road, the youth in his mid-20s has vowed to observe a quiet Diwali this year.																								I had to spend a night at Lake police station and learnt my lesson. Even my friends will not touch crackers this year, he said.																								Like Shankhadeep, Deepnarayan Sengupta was picked up by the police last year for bursting crackers on the roof of his apartment building in Ballygunge. And like Shankhadeep, Deepnarayan and his friends, too, have resolved to observe a cracker-less Diwali.																								Police are banking on offenders-turned-responsible citizens like Shankhadeep and Deepnarayan to ensure a noise-free Diwali. We hope the areas that saw arrests last year will be spared the noise nuisance on Friday, said a senior Lalbazar officer.																								The state environment department, however, is not convinced. On earlier occasions, there was rampant violation of noise norms despite raids and a cracker haul before Kali puja, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the senior law officer in the environment department.																								The government has banned crackers that produce sound more than 90 decibels at five metres from the source.																								Raids by the police and the state pollution control board were routinely carried out this year, too. Over the past two days, more than 4,700 kg of banned crackers were seized and 63 people arrested in the city and its outskirts. Those booked were traders trying to smuggle in banned crackers.																								Mukherjee, also convener of the state noise pollution monitoring committee, said most complaints of cracker bursts last year were received from Kankurgachhi, Ballygunge Circular Road, Kankulia Road, Salt Lake, Lake Town and Bangur Avenue.																								This year, officers from all 48 police stations in the city and teams from the detective department conducted raids to prevent the entry of banned crackers in Calcutta. On Friday, 5,000 cops will patrol the city streets, said Vineet Goyel, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).																								Senior officers at Lalbazar have decided to keep a close watch on highrises. Last year, banned crackers were exploded on the roofs of highrises. We have warned the apartment-owners that they will be held responsible if there is any violation of noise norms on their premises, said an officer.																								Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) said five police jeeps patrolled Salt Lake on Thursday and warned residents not to break the noise law. We will try to ensure that not one banned cracker is exploded in the township, said Sarkar.

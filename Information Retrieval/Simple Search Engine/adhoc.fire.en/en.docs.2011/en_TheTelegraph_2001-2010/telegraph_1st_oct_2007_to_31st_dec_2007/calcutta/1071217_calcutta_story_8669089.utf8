		 Colour of consciousness
																																	The central theme of Finnish painter Soile Yli-Myry is the human being which is neither the motif of an art figure nor the pretence to an aesthetic description. Yli-Myry studied at the Liberal Art School at Helsinki and the Stuttgart Academy in Germany. Her paintings, to her, are a means of the expression of an elemental substance that manifests itself in the personal harmony between the artist and her surroundings. Her colours are, as Professor Rudolf Hoegale of Academy of Fine Arts, Stuttgart, comments, not merely an objective phenomenon, but a lyrical fate. The use of colours is striking, but all her works have that feminine softness which is integral to the way she looks at the world. Her paintings and drawings have a connection with real life, its figures, conditions and objects. One cannot miss out on the theme of her ongoing exhibition which depicts the alienation of the human being from nature, defining in every way her personal expression of the tension.

				 72 hours on, FIR lodged
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rajib Nath: Suicide in humiliation																								The people-friendly police of the state took more than 72 hours to register an FIR in an unnatural death case, and that, too, after Metro got in touch with a senior officer.																								Rajib Nath, 20, killed himself on Saturday morning, unable to bear the insult of his father at the hands of a few moneylenders. Till Monday night, the Thakurpukur family had approached the police four times to lodge an FIR, in vain.																								But to the Naths surprise, a cop van arrived at their doorstep on Tuesday evening to escort Rajibs father, Panchu, to Thakurpukur police station to register an FIR.																								What caused the shift in attitude of the police? A phone call to Dev Prasad Singh, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas, from Metro. Singh promised to intervene.																								The police had registered an unnatural death case on Saturday, after being informed by the nursing home where my son was taken. But they did not tell us about it during our repeated visits to the police station, said Panchu, a contractor.																								The Naths first went to the police station on Saturday to lodge an FIR. But the officers told them to come back after the post-mortem and cremation. We went again on Sunday but were turned away. On Monday, we visited the police station twice, but the FIR was still not registered, Panchu added.																								Rajib, a BA first-year student, was found hanging in his room at 12.30pm on Saturday, after local moneylender Nanigopal and his men publicly humiliated his parents for not repaying their debt.																								Panchu had taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh from a few local men. The interest in 15 months added up to Rs 7 lakh, beyond the means of the Naths to pay.

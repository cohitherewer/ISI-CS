 Small town shows the way

A Telegraph picture 															The fourth assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) a few months ago predicted that Calcutta, along with Mumbai, will be the worst sufferers among Indian cities of climate change in the near future. According to the report, which many believe is a watered-down version of the real dangers ahead, warns of flash rains, floods, fall in water tables and water conservation potential.																					The Sunderbans have already started showing the stress of global warming and in the next few years, Calcutta will perhaps witness an unprecedented heat wave, says IPCC chairman R.K. Pachauri. 																					In fact, most of the future impacts, in varying degrees, can already be felt. But the city, like the rest of the country, is yet to wake up and think of reversing the process of climate change. For a start, Calcutta could follow the example of Chandernagore, the small town on the western bank of the Hooghly, about 50 km away. 																					The town is famous for its decorative lights during Jagaddhtari puja. The highlight of the festival is the immersion day, which is spectacular for the lights that accompany the processions that wind their way to the river throughout the night. But the practice always proved to be a major source of pollution because of constant use of generators that let off both sound and toxic gases, affecting both the thousands of watchers and the environment. 																					But a change set in from 2005. A local club, Charmandirtala, showed the way by replacing the fume-emanating generator with a 12-volt car battery, alongside a computer-programmed microchip-based lighting system. The result was a more spectacular display of lights  without the pollution and the impact on climate change. It was more cost-effective, too.																					According to Sabujer Avijan, a local NGO supporting the green initiative, the number of pujas using the eco-friendly lights rose to 14 this year  seven were totally green and the rest partial. 																					 The power consumption at peak hours during Jagaddhatri puja last year was 1,400 KW per hour. This year, 10 more pujas were organised but the corresponding figure dropped to 1,200 KW per hour because of use of power-saving LED lights, says Sanjay Bhuniya, the divisional engineer of the West Bengal State Electricty Board. The net effect is 10 tonne less carbon dioxide emission, which is the leading cause of global warming. 																					Perhaps Calcutta can adopt such real measures rather than hosting numerous workshops on climate change.

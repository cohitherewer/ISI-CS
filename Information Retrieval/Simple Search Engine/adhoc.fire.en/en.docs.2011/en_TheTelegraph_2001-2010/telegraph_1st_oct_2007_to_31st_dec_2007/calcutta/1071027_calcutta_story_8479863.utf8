				 One out of hospital, another in  A STAFF REPORTER																								Archana and Sukhendu of Saat Pake Bandha were bound together by a twist of medical fate on Friday.																								Less than 12 hours after Suchitra Sen left her hospital bed and headed back home, Soumitra Chatterjee, her co-star in the hit film of 1963, was admitted to hospital with a cardiac complication.																								Complaining of chest pain, Chatterjee, 73, first underwent an angiogram at Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), which revealed a critical blockage in one of the cardiac arteries. A coronary angioplasty was conducted soon afterwards.																								According to a spokesperson, the veteran actors condition was stable but he would be kept under strict observation for the next 24 hours.																								Chatterjees medical scare came hours after Suchitra Sen left Belle Vue Clinic, late on Thursday, following 18 days of treatment. Sen requested doctors to let her go home on the auspicious night of Lakshmi puja, hospital sources said.																								That was just after 10pm on Thursday. And by 10am on Friday, Chatterjee was being wheeled into the operating theatre at RTIICS.																								Moon Moon, Suchitra Sens daughter, when informed by Metro about Chatterjees illness late on Friday, said: He is a very dear friend of ours. He has, of course, done many films with my mother and me. I hope and pray he gets well soon... As for Ma, she is doing fine and happy to be home.																								Poulomi, Chatterjees daughter said: He used to be a heavy smoker till a month ago when he suddenly suffered a pain in the chest and breathlessness. He then stopped smoking and cut down on his screen and stage assignments.																								According to Poulomi, Fridays angiogram at RTIICS had been scheduled earlier, but when it revealed the critical blockage, doctors decided to conduct the coronary angioplasty at once. He was conscious and feeling much better at night, said Poulomi.																								The previous night, Suchitra Sen convinced her doctors that she was feeling fine enough to leave Belle Vue.																								I want to go home tonight. Please release me, doctor, she called one of the doctors treating her and requested him on Thursday night. The doctor received the call around 10pm.																								Sen had had a light dinner and some Lakshmi puja prasad by then. Swapan Paul, one of the doctors monitoring Sens progress, then went to ICCU 2 to set the discharge procedure in motion and all formalities were taken care of in a flash.																								Sen, who had been admitted with high fever caused by a urinary tract infection on October 9, could leave for home a little before 10.30pm, accompanied by daughter Moon Moon and son-in-law Habi.																								Before leaving, the reclusive screen idol bid goodbye to the nurses on duty and took the elevator down to the car park.																								She remains such a beautiful and charming lady. Her smile is as radiant as it used to be. It has been a dream come true to be able to see her and interact with her, gushed one of the hospital staff members on condition of anonymity. She insisted on going home because it was Lakshmi puja.																								Doctors said Sen would continue with oral antibiotics for a few more days.

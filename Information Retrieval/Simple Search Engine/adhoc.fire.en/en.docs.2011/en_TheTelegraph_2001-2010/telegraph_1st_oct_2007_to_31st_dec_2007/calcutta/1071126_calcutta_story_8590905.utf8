				 Torture on the homefront
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 A woman checks out the posters to spread awareness on stopping domestic violence. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								Malati Ghosh (name changed), 38, has been suffering emotional, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, but doesnt know whom to turn to for help.																								Jhuma Sarkar (name changed), 40, has been running from pillar to post, seeking protection from torture inflicted by her husband, in vain.																								There are thousands of women, like Malati and Jhuma, who are victims of some form of domestic violence and their number is growing by the year.																								In 2005, around 9,000 women in India were murdered for dowry and more than 58,000 suffered torture at the hands of husbands and in-laws, of whom around 2,000 committed suicide.																								Bengal had registered the highest number of cases of sexual violence faced by married and unmarried women between 15 and 49 years of age in the country.																								To spread awareness on stopping domestic violence against women, Aman: Global Voices for Peace in the Home, an international network of NGOs, is organising a fortnight-long drive as part of the International Campaign to Stop Violence against Women and Girls.																								The drive started on November 25 with an exhibition of posters on violence against women. The theatre group of Swayam, an NGO, staged plays highlighting the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005.																								We want to dispel the myths about the act, which is not about punishment but stopping violence being meted out to women, said Anuradha Kapoor, the director of Swayam.																								The campaign will also focus on effective implementation of the act, which came into force in October 2006.																								The authorities are yet to take adequate measures for effective implementation of the law. There are not enough protection officers, who are to be appointed by the government  one for each district, she added.																								The campaign period is significant, as it coincides with International Day Against Violence Against Women, World AIDS Day and World Disability Day, said Anuradha Kapoor, the director of Swayam.																								The campaign will also feature a rally on wheels on November 26, workshops with police and protection officers and information fairs. It ends on December 10, marking International Human Rights Day.

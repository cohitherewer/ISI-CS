		 Nature to the rescue																																	From the earliest days, when the cosmos had received its shape, Mother Nature has reared humans, and ensured their growth, recovery, and survival and finally allowed them to degenerate. Ancient medical science derived all its sanction from nature alone, keeping faith on its immense power to cure and repair. With the progress of civilisation, the ecological balance was disturbed, and man and nature, that lived in harmony, were now pitted against each other. Modern medical science, with its tall claims, depends much less on natural remedies. If nature chooses to react, whether or not human life can be controlled by means of modern science, is an issue which this play problematises. In his quest to resolve this debate, a commoner and chronic dyspeptic, Golokpati, visits a renowned gastroenterologist, Dr Palodhi. He discovers another chronic patient in his doctor and now Golokpati starts advising his doctor as to what he should do. The doctor admits his limitations, and the play unfolds a role-reversal through pun, humour and pure comedy, perhaps driving home that laughter is the alternative medicine for everything. Based on Bhagirath Misras story and scripted by Jayanta Mitra, the play is directed by Sima Mukhopadhyay.

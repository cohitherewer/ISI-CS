				 Garage norms get stronger  															- Police proposal adds clout to civic bodys parking rules DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Each new flat in the city will come with at least one garage. And if the flat is larger than 2,000 sq ft in area, it must have two garages or more.																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has made it mandatory for residential buildings above 10,000-sq-ft area to have garages in a city facing a parking space crisis. The norms, in effect from mid-September, have also been made more stringent for commercial buildings.																								The garage rules also prohibit rehabilitation of tenants on the ground floors of reconstructed buildings to keep the space free for parking. Building plans drawn up adhering to the parking rules will not be sent to the police for clearance.																								The restrictions were put in place after a series of meetings among the mayor, municipal commissioner and the police commissioner. The civic authorities had felt that the police must have a say in guidelines for building plans and had approached Lalbazar for suggestions. 																								Under the new rules, a realtor constructing flats between 2,000 sq ft and 3,000 sq ft will have to make provision for two garages for each.																								For flats between 3,000 sq ft and 4,000 sq ft, there must be three garages. For flats larger than 4,000 sq ft in area, there should be at least four garages.																								In addition, houses above 10,000 sq ft must have 10 per cent of the area for parking of visitors cars, in addition to four garages and the mandatory open space.																								The norms focus on estates and houses above 10,000 sq ft without adequate parking space because they are the primary cause of parking problems in the city, said a civic official. 																								Commercial buildings have been divided into two categories  non-retail and retail. Office and other businesses with low footfall have been bracketed into the non-retail category.																								For every 250 sq ft of non-retail built-up area, the developer will have to provide a garage.																								 Malls, multiplexes, cinemas and restaurants have been kept in the retail category. Since the footfall is expected to be higher in buildings of this type, one garage will have to be set up for every 150 sq ft of built-up area. 																								Nursing homes, private hospitals and shops measuring upto 15,000 sq ft have been kept outside the purview of the new garage norms. The number of garages these establishments must have will be decided on a case-to-case basis.

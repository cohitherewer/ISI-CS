				 More than a story
				 				 Kanishka Kanakiya of Heritage School receives the first prize from Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi at Frank Anthony Memorial Inter-School Storytelling Contest, organised in association with The Telegraph, at Raj Bhavan. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta				 				 																															Evil cackling witches, a super Diwali sans superheroes and magnificent magnetic hilsa took over Raj Bhavan on Saturday, as 26 fearless youngsters narrated their tales for the Frank Anthony Memorial Inter-School Storytelling Contest. Organised by the All-India Anglo-Indian Association (Santragachhi branch) in association with The Telegraph, Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi attended the event, distributing the prizes to the students, who were all in Class IV or V.				 				 																															Arshad Qureshi and Soumik Chatterjee were declared joint winners in third place, with Samudra Basu of Don Bosco Park Circus coming in second. Kanishka Kanakiya, a Class V student of Heritage School, won first prize with the thoroughly entertaining Spellbound. Not only was his story  about a joker who accidentally ends up in the home a very evil witch  well crafted, it was delivered with sparkling style. He was also the only participant who used props, and to great effect.				 				 																															The participating schools included Our Lady Queen of the Missions, St Xaviers, Future Foundation, Pailan World and Apeejay School. In under three minutes, the students had to narrate their stories and were marked on three parameters: content and originality, enunciation and tone and delivery and confidence. The judges panel included Sujata Sen, director, British Council (east) and Bernard Brooks, veteran educator. 				 				 																															The kids had a surprise visitor in the form of Barry OBrien, MLA representing the Anglo-Indian community. The Governor came in as the show was coming to a close. After Kanishka repeated his performance for the chief guest (he even improvised to add more action during his second act of the morning), the young members of the Anglo-Indian Association put up a dance show to a versatile medley of music, including the Beatles, Shakira and Elvis! That was followed by a dance to Vande Mataram by three girls from National Gems school.				 				 																															We thought the Raj Bhavan would be the best venue for the competition to mark the 60th year of independence, said Michael DCruize, president, All-India Anglo-India Association (Santragachhi branch). The event is held specifically for young children as there are no inter-school fests at the primary level, he added.

This year, our three-day fair goes international, said Sanjeev Bolia, Bangkok and Kathmandu will be the twin international stops for the fair, where Indian Schools will call on foreign students. 				 				 																															Twenty-five schools across the country  right from Montessori schools to Day schools  set up shop in 42 stalls. The fair was abuzz with parents and children over November 16-18, the buzzwords being brochure collection and research. The fair also saw hearty participation from schools for special children.				 				 																															Education psychologist Raj Sethia, guided parents on awaken the genius in their children, while parenting expert Saloni Priyas session on choosing the ideal school for a child was well-received.				 				 																															As part of the fair, an education conference was organised on November 17 at the Taj Bengal. The speakers at the conference were Das, former governor of Mizoram Amolak Rattan Kohli, Lina Esher and Ranjan Mitter, faculty member of the Management Centre for Human Values at IIM-Calcutta. Topics at the conference varied from Human Aspects Of Education to How A Principal Can Build Great Institutions. 				 				 																															Mitter urged schools to shed the timeworn modes of teaching. Each child is different. The need of the hour is to teach children to learn to be individualistic, that will give them an edge in the job market in future. Ashish Rajpal of iDiscover i Education spoke on creating innovative classrooms and training of teachers. 				 				 																															C. Panduranga Bhatta, faculty member at the Management Centre for Human Values at IIM-Calcutta, said that education should also address the issue of character building. He called on schools to develop values in children, to make them more socially concerned and humane. 				 				 																															Anindya Shankar Ray 				 				 																
	 Carnival time				 				 																															St Thomas School turned 219 this year and the schools birthday was celebrated with its annual carnival  one of the oldest in the city  on November 16-17 at the St Thomas Girls School. Bishop Samuel Raju, chairman of the board of governors, St Thomas School, Kidderpore, inaugurated the two-day event. 				 				 																															The ground was decked up for the carnival, sporting 11 stalls that offered games like Basket the Ball to Bounce the Lucky Score. Students from the middle section were busy playing the bowling game. 				 				 																															But the stall that saw the maximum rush was the one holding Treasure Hunt. Beautiful handicrafts created by the school students were on display at these stalls, with just the right prices for student pockets. A technical stall offering information on a Welder training course, computer hardware and networking, conducted in collaboration with Jadavpur University, saw enough interest.				 				 																															But whats a carnival without some mouth-watering food? From kati rolls to biryani, the St Thomas School carnival served it all up hot, with the sales proceeds going to the school welfare fund. The funds resources are used for under-privileged children of the school, said Usha Andrews, acting principal of St. Thomas Boys school.

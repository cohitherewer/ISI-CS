				 Fake parts in phone blasts 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The apex body of cellphone manufacturers in the country has blamed fake accessories for handset explosions. 																								After reports of about 10 mobile phone explosions in India, most of them in and around Calcutta, the Indian Cellular Association (ICA) has rolled out a nation-wide campaign to assuage the concerns of cellphone-users. 																								Eighty-five per cent of cellphone accessories, like batteries and chargers, sold in West Bengal are fake. The national figure is about 70 per cent, said Pankaj Mahindroo, the president of ICA. 																								He was, however, on the defensive when asked about original phones exploding. 																								Nokia had issued an advisory on August 14 stating that some batteries of a series could overheat and dislodge. Several cellphone explosions were reported in Calcutta after that, including two that injured a pregnant homemaker and two children.																								Gauhar Raza, a scientist at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, said: Batteries can swell because of overheating but not burst. If a battery explodes, then it is because a charge of a greater voltage than what is specified is entering it through the charger.																								Fake batteries have a Rs 4.5-crore national market, seven per cent of it in West Bengal, said Mahindroo.																								ICA believes that the way to counter the menace is bringing down the price of the original parts. The government needs to lower import duty on batteries. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India must be more vigilant, while the customers, too, should take a stance, said an ICA official.																								Mukesh Karnawat, a cellphone dealer in Chandni Chowk, however, said the blasts will automatically make buyers go for original accessories.

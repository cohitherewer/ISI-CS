				 Horror tales in trouble spots
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Commuters and schoolchildren suffered the most in the riots on Wednesday. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Abhijit Nandi was travelling in a private bus that got stuck 																								in the mob fury in Park Circus around 10.30am.																								To our horror, we saw stones raining on the bus from all directions. A little girl returning home from school was bleeding after being hit by a stone on the head. All the passengers immediately got off the bus and started running, recalled Nandi, a Salt Lake resident on the way to Entally for work.																								Many commuters met with Nandis fate and that of the little girl on Wednesday, as vast stretches in the city turned into a war zone. Mullickbazar, Park Circus and a large stretch of AJC Bose Road were out of bounds for people for the entire day from 9am.																								Patients in ambulances had a harrowing time reaching hospitals  the trouble spots fall on the routes to National Medical College, SSKM, NRS Medical College and Belle Vue from several parts of the city.																								Some of the arsonists claimed that they had not blocked any ambulance, but kept mum when asked about the plight of the patients stranded in traffic snarls.																								A couple of wedding cars were stranded in the snarls. One of them took more than three hours to reach AJC Bose Road from Salt Lake. 																								We took the road along the Beleghata canal and had to stop for hours in a snarl near Munshi Bazaar, said an elderly man sitting in the car.																								The brides family had booked a marriage hall adjacent to St James School, the epicentre of the trouble. Very few people have turned up. And a curfew will be imposed in an hour, said a family member.																								Deboprem Chatterjee, who had arrived in Calcutta on a flight from Delhi, was stuck in a jam for two hours near the Kasba crossing on the way home.																								Most shops in the Mullickbazar-Park Circus area were closed. Kanak Dutta had kept his hardware store open till a few stones aimed at cars landed on his shop. I promptly downed the shutters, keeping only the PCO counter in the shop open, he said.																								Antoine and Julien, Delhi-based French students who came to Calcutta on Tuesday, said: Protests happen in Paris, too. But could anyone have imagined that one would assume such proportions?

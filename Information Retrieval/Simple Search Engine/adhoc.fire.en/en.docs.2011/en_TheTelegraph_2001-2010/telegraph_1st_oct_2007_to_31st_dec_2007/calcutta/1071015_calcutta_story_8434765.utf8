				 Driver killed on his bus
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Lalbabu Shau, 38, was murdered early on Sunday on a private bus on the Howrah Maidan-Sealdah route that he used to drive.																								The two conductors of the bus, which was parked on Bankim Setu, in Howrah, told police that they found a bleeding Shau lying unconscious on the floor of the bus.																								They took the driver to Howrah State General Hospital, where doctors declared him dead. The conductors  Munna Shau and Gopal Das  have been detained for questioning.																								It doesnt seem that Shau was murdered for money. Personal enmity seems to be the motive. We are examining the conductors, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of police, Howrah.																								Munna and Gopal told the police that they went to sleep on the bus along with Shau after dinner.																								Around 2 am, we woke up on hearing Lalbabus screams and saw a man jumping off the bus through the front door. We chased the man, but failed to catch up with him, one of the conductors reportedly told the police.																								Munna and Gopal returned to the bus and found Shau lying unconscious, blood gushing from a deep wound in the abdomen. They immediately took him to hospital.																								We are trying to find out whether Shau had any enmity with local criminals, said police superintendent Singh.

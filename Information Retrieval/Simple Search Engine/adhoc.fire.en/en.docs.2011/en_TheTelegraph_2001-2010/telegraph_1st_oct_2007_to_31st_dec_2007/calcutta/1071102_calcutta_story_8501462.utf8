				 Aunts face sleuths at Todi home
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The CBI sleuths probing how Rizwanur Rahman died on September 21 questioned two of Priyankas aunts on Thursday. They had reportedly tried to convince the 23-year-old girl to leave her husband and return home.																								Shobha Todi and Bela Murarka were asked to explain their role in the matter at the Todi residence  CG 235  in Salt Lake, where sleuths spent nearly four hours from 9.50am. A team, led by a woman official, first visited the houses of Shobha and Bela to pick them up and bring them to Ashok Todis house.																								They were in touch with Priyanka since September 31, after they came to know about her marriage, said a CBI official. During the week that Priyanka spent at Rizwanurs Tiljala Lane residence, both her aunts would call on her cellphone and repeatedly urge her to leave her husband and come back to her parents.																								Among others questioned by the CBI on Thursday was Sadhan Sinha, the officer-in-charge of the anti-rowdy squad. We wanted to know how assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das had got involved in the incident, said an official.																								Assistant secretary of APDR Sudipta Sen and some students at Arena Multimedia were quizzed, while the statement of gangman Pramod Halder, who had spotted Rizwanurs body by the railway tracks, was recorded.

				 Quote hunt in quest for truth
 OUR BUREAU																								A CBI team has questioned over 20 people in three days in its quest for truth in the Rizwanur Rahman case. Metro gets behind some closed doors.																								Who: Sujato Bhadra of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR).																								When: Around noon, on Sunday, at Nizam Palace.																								What: I was asked to provide a blow-by-blow account from the day I met Rizwanur to my last interaction with him. They asked me whether I had noticed anything wrong in Rizwanurs voice when he spoke to me over the phone a few minutes before his death, whether I felt he was depressed... Bhadra said.																								Who: Supriya Mandal, the owner of a telephone booth on APC Road, from where Rizwanur made three calls minutes before his death.																								When: 11.40 am on Monday.																								What: A team of CBI officials went to Mandals booth and spoke to him for an hour. I told them Rizwanur had dialled three numbers from here, but got through to two of them, said Mandal. 																								Who: Sujoy Ghosh of Arena Multimedia, Chowringhee branch.																								When: 10.30am-11.30am at Rizwanurs workplace.																								What: The CBI officers asked how we function, about our networking, what Rizwanur did and when he last attended office. They checked his computer and spoke to three colleagues, said Ghosh.																								Who: Sadique Hussain, witness to the Rizwanur-Priyanka marriage.																								When: Between 10.30am and 6pm, in two phases, at Nizam Palace.																								What: They asked me everything related to Sirs (Rizwanur) marriage and what I had gone through after that. I told the interrogators  including a lady officer  how officers from Lalbazar used to threaten me. I named the officers and narrated the incident when an officer called me on my mobile while I was with inspector-general of police Nazrul Islam. They asked specific questions and listened intently, said Sadique.																								Who: Rizwanurs former girlfriend.																								When: Monday afternoon at her Ultadanga residence.																								What: The girl told sleuths how she and Rizwanur were in a relationship during their college days. She made it clear that the relationship had ended quite some time back. She had no complaint against the youth. She told us that the relationship had come under strain for financial reasons. They had both agreed to part ways, said a CBI official.																								The girl got married on August 15, three days before Rizwanur married Priyanka.																								Who: Rehan Waris, Rizwanurs friend.																								When: 12.30pm on Monday at Nizam Palace.																								What: One of the officers first told me to record my statement. I wrote down everything  whatever I had earlier penned for The Telegraph. Then some CBI officials called me into a room. They asked me how I knew Rizwanur, how many times I had interacted with him after he got married, and when I spoke to him last.																								Who: Jalisur Rahman, uncle of Rizwanur.																								When: Between 3.30pm and 5.15pm at Nizam Palace.																								What: They asked me why I felt this was a case of murder and not suicide. I told the officers that Rizwanur left home around 8.30 that morning saying he would be back in an hour for breakfast, after which he would go to meet a lawyer.																								Rizwanur had told us he would make a last-ditch effort to get Priyanka back but if she was unwilling, he would not press for it.																								I told them how Ashok Todi had warned us that he had the power to blow away our entire locality, sitting from Salt Lake.																								I also told them how I had seen senior officers in Lalbazar threatening Rizwan, said Jalisur.

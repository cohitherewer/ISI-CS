				 This Diwali, budgets take rocket route
 															- Splurge curve in fashion, food and fun exceeds Durga puja spend quotient ANUMITA GHOSH AND DIYA KOHLI				 	 Actress Koel Mullick lights Diwali diyas while arati is performed on the Kali idol at her ancestral home on Friday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								The Diwali weekend is running the Durga puja days close when it comes to fashion, food and fun. With the festival of lights growing bigger and brighter by the year, the Calcuttan is celebrating Diwali like never before.																								Sanjay Kumar Dutta, the general secretary of Burrabazar Fireworks Dealers Association, has seen people splurging for a few years. Fancy fireworks, ranging from Rs 200 to Rs 1,250 a box, flew off the racks this time. Till two years ago, 15 per cent of the high-spend customers were Bengalis; now there are 40 per cent, says Dutta.																								For Tumpa Palit, 25, Diwali is as much fun as the Pujas. My Diwali budget for new clothes and food was the same as Durga puja, but add the fireworks and Ive ended up spending more, smiles the software professional.																								Nowhere is the budget rise more evident than at the cards table. A traditional part of Diwali fun, a game of cards this year (Drop  a variation of teen patti  being the top draw) means five-star rooms and stakes touching lakhs.																								D-Day parties are the next big thing. Pre- and post- bashes are hot, while Diwali theme parties are ethnic and extravagant, says DJ Akash. On this count, the Diwali fun-spend quotient zooms past the good ol Durga puja adda.																								On the fashion front, both Diwali and Durga puja signal splurge time. The mood is such that you feel like dressing up. And this is one time when budget takes a backseat  you buy what you like, says Pooja Goenka of 85 Lansdowne, which held a 10-day Diwali extravaganza (in association with t2) featuring designer clothes and jewellery.																								When it comes to sweets, the overall sales volumes figures are undoubtedly higher during the Puja days, but when it comes to variety and price, Diwali scores. From the Make Your Own Hampers at the Mithai Shop of ITC Sonar Calcutta, priced between Rs 3,000 and Rs 12,000, to the Special Diwali Truffle cakes at Kookie Jar for Rs 400.																								Eating in is more in for Diwali, but that does not mean spending less. The food budget for a Diwali bash at home ranges from Rs 5,000 for a small gathering to lakhs for a big get-together,says Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpies.

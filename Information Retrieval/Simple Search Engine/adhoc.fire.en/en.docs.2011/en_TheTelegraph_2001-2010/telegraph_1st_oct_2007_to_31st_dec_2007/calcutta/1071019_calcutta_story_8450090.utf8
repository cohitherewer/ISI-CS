				 Screen legend better
 A STAFF REPORTERSuchitra Sens health has been showing signs of improvement since Wednesday night, doctors treating her said. 																								She has not had a fever in the past 24 hours and is feeling reasonably well. Her overall condition is improving and her health is stable, K.B. Baksi, who is monitoring the screen legends condition, said on Thursday. 																								Sen was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic on the night of October 9 with a high fever, along with nausea and other complications. Investigations later revealed that she was suffering from a urinary tract infection, and the prescribed antibiotic had to be changed three times.																								Doctors said the infection was gone and she was recovering fast. Sen told doctors on Thursday that her appetite was returning. We have asked her to eat whatever she feels like, a doctor said.																								However, the hospital authorities refused to divulge when she will be released. We know everyone is anxious to know when she will be discharged. The doctors will decide that, said a hospital source. Doctors said they would keep her under observation for a few more days.																								It is unlikely she would be released during the Puja. However, she is not demanding that she be released and has left it to us, said Baksi. Sen had toast, egg and fruit juice for breakfast, and rice and home-cooked fish curry for lunch. Daughter Moon Moon brought the food from home.

		 Exalted																																	The Deities, an exhibition of paintings hosted by Artists Circle, features well-known names in contemporary art: Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Subrata Gangopadhyay (whose rendering of the image of Kali appears right), Geeta Maity, Sajal Kanti Mitra, Biswajit Mondol, Bratin Khan, Saroj Sarkar, Subrata Pal, Snehangshu Shekhar Das, Sukti Subhra Pradhan, Prabal Roy, Sanjiv Narayan Dutta and Arun Mondol. The artists interpret their beliefs through these paintings of various Hindu deities. Worshipping some supernatural, supra-sensory power comes naturally to man. Irrespective of the era the place, man has always been known to have derived satisfaction from the faith he invested in some incomprehensible power which controls everything. To this awed admiration, man added his imagination and made tangible forms and idols which were beautiful and attributed them with supreme powers. Even in this age, these artists claim, the validity and currency of these concepts have not died out. This is because mans soul has remained the same in its essence: it is still stirred by the same things. Besides, the worship of deities have become inseparable from our culture and therefore, our identities. To this great relationship between human and superhuman, these artists offer their talent and worldview.

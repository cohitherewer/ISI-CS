		 Ode to the Mother Goddess																																	Artline, in association with Sreechanraneshu, presents Tribute to Durga, showcasing the works of well-known artists. Once a year in the autumnal month of Ashwin , the goddess comes home along with her four children Ganesh, Laxmi, Kartik and Saraswati. Durga is the reincarnation of Devi or the Mother Goddess, a unified symbol of all divine forces and her name in Sanskrit means invincible. She symbolises the triumph of good over evil. When evil forces threatened the very existence of the gods, each offered his radiance to her creation and each formed some part of her body. She was endowed powerful weapons by Shiva and Vishnu. Durga finally overcame the powerful demon Mahishasura. With Durga Puja only a few weeks away, the exhibition hopes to complement the mood of the season of which Maa is the flavour. While some artists have portrayed her as a supreme symbol of strength, others have tried to capture her as an image of feminine grace and exquisite beauty, offering a contemporarised interpretation of the concept of Durga whose hold over the imagination of the artist and the common man is equally strong. One of the works (by Nirmalendu Mondal) from the ongoing exhibition appears right.

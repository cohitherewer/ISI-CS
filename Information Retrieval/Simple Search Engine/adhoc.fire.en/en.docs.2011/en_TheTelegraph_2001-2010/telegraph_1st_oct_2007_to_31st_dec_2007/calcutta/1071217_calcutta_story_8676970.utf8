				 Tiger skin in bus stop bag

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								A tiger skin was found in an unclaimed gunny bag at a bus stand near Ruby General Hospital, in Kasba, on Sunday afternoon. 
																								People waiting for a bus at the stand alerted police about the bag. Officers from Kasba police station went to the spot. They asked people in the vicinity if the bag belonged to them, but nobody claimed it. They then opened the bag to find the skin, which is worth nearly Rs 7 lakh, wrapped in tarpaulin, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar.
																								The owner must have left the spot briefly. When he came back and found cops inquiring about the bag, he fled, said an officer of the police station.

				 Revamp plan for schools
 							 - Assessment drive follows rap from the Centre MITA MUKHERJEEAn overhaul of the infrastructure and administrative set-up of state-aided schools is in the offing. The government has undertaken a drive to assess the facilities and administrative practices in schools, following criticism by the Centre.																								From the condition of the school buildings, seating arrangement in classrooms, toilet facilities for students, playgrounds and drinking water supply to implementation of the mid-day meal scheme, meting out corporal punishment and introduction of life-style education will be assessed. The findings will be used to draw up the plan for overhaul.																								The Centre had recently observed that West Bengal lagged behind many states in educating boys and girls below 14. The government does not feel that the Centre is entirely justified in saying that Bengals performance in educating students below Class VIII does not match those of other states. But we need to get the real picture. The current drive is an attempt to take stock of the situation, said Santosh Mahapatra, the joint secretary of the state school education department. 																								The inspections started last month and will continue till December.																								We will start chalking out the revamp plan once the inspection of 90 per cent of the schools is over. We should be able to start the revamp from April 2008, added Mahapatra. 																								This is the first time in decades that an intensive assessment of infrastructure and administrative practices in schools is being carried out, claimed the official. More than 59,000 primary institutions and over 10,000 secondary schools will be covered by the drive.																								Only academic inspections are regularly held in state-aided schools. They are meant to monitor students enrolment, students and teachers attendance, their performance and the examination system. 																								Officials of the joint director rank in the education department are conducting the special inspections. They are being accompanied by district-level school inspectors.																								In the second phase, a similar exercise will be held for the students of classes IX and X. The inspections will be conducted by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.

				 Singapore route, but on a faster track
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Lou Armstrong: Eyeing the top of the retail pyramid																								Lou Armstrong, the first expatriate at the helm of a contemporary retail mall in Calcutta, is excited to be in the city while its on the cusp of something big.																								It could be like Singapore of the Sixties at the moment, but itll get there a lot quicker than Singapore did, says the CEO of Mani Square, readying its Bypass racks for a February opening.																								Armstrong, 60, brings with him 20 years experience in retail consultancy, with stints in the UK, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, preceded by a 14-year Royal Navy Aircrew career.																								He had started off with managing the Wigan Galleries in Wigan and then, moved on to White Rose Shopping Mall in Leeds, before taking up a managerial position in Saudi Arabia, to later become a vice-president in the King Faisal Foundation.																								I heard of Mani Square from its overseas design team in the US and when I first flew down, I liked what I saw. Its an integrated mixed-use project where all the elements  the retail, foodcourt, cinema and offices  interface with and feed off each other, he says.																								Armstrong feels, like in the UK, West Asia and Southeast Asia, Calcutta is making the natural progression from marketplace to high street to retail malls to out-of-town shopping centres. I want to stimulate that course to the top of the pyramid.																								A recent study released at the India Retail Forum says that from 179 operational malls with 47.4 million sq ft of quality retail space in 2007, India will have 412 malls, offering 205 million sq ft of retail space in 2010.																								These numbers excite Armstrong and he feels Calcutta will account for a sizeable share of the pan-India pie. So what makes a mall stand out even if it offers the same brand-mix? You can tell they care the moment you walk in and you can achieve this by a completely different approach to services, he points out.																								Cleanliness, high safety standards, quick and effective response in times of difficulty or emergency, a listening network for business associates, clear lines of contact, professional marketing, promotions and advertisements are among the best practices the citys first foreigner mall chief preaches.																								We are contemplating setting up a retail academy and offering retail tips to the tenants to give them a trouble-free trading experience to the extent possible, he adds.

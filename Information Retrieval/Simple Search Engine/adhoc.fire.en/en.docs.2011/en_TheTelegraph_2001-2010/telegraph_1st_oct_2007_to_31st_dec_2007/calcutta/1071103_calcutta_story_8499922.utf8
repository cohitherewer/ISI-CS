		 I wandered lonely as a cloud																																	Aakriti Art Gallery presents a solo show of paintings by Sekhar Roy. Into figurative paintings for the last 20 years, Roys works show leanings towards the likes of David Hockney, Kitaj and David Hopper. He feels he shares something with these artists  loneliness. Every person weaves an impenetrable cocoon around himself, guarding his private world jealously since it affords him the much needed escape. Roy admits that he, too, always felt the need to escape and abandon the present and the available. Like a cloud, his mind would hover over everything and then desert it when it failed to inspire or tease his intellect, moving on to seek some newer horizon. His paintings all along have been an expression of that effortless transition from the given to the imagined. Roy claims that the canvas itself leads him on and the images created are spontaneous. The paintings are in acrylic on canvas.

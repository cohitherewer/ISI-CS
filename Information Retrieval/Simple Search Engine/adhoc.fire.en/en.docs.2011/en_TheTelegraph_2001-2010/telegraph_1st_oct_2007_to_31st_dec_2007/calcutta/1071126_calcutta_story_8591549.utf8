				 Crore prize for biz plan
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Seed money to the tune of Rs 1 crore is on offer at the annual entrepreneurship festival of Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC), whose preliminary rounds started on Saturday.																								One of the most important events on the B-schools calendar, i2I (ideas to Implementation) was conceived in 2001 with the objective of providing students a platform to showcase their entrepreneurial skills. The sixth edition of i2I will attempt to raise the bar.																								We want to move away from the traditional business plan competitions that end up as essay contests for cash prizes, with the participants not looking to actually start businesses, said Ankur Gattani, a member of the IIMC entrepreneurship cell.																								The best ideas and teams will be selected by an elaborate procedure, starting with submission of a business summary with a team profile and statement of purpose, followed by a pitch to a panel of investors or judges in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Bangalore. 																								The top 10 teams from across India will be mentored by experts. The process will culminate in the final in Calcutta on February 1, 2008. There will be no cash prize, only seed money to tune of Rs 1 crore for start-ups.																								The competition is being held in partnership with the Indus Entrepreneurs and National Entrepreneurship Network (NEN). Seedfund is the investing partner for the event.																								Students of B-schools and engineering institutes and working professionals can take part in i2I.																								The e-cell of the B-school is working with a portal to run an online contest. We plan to host an online reality show, where participants can make presentations through videos and if selected, pitch directly to the investors, said Gattani.

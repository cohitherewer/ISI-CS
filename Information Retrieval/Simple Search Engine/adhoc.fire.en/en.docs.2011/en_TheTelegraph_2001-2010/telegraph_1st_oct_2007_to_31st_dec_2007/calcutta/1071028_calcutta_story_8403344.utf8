				 Next weekend you can be at ... Jharadi
																								Dense forests and blue hills lend a majestic beauty to south-east Chhattisgarh. Raigash, Sarguja and Bastar, near the border of Jharkhand and Orissa, are some of the most beautiful parts of India. The natural splendour of the region is exhilarating and attracts nature-lovers and adventure tourists. 																								Jharadi is one of the lesser known tourist attractions in the state but can stimulate the mind and rejuvenate the body and soul. The cluster of hillocks that surround the area are an extension of the Vindhya range.																								Half of the population consists of tribals. Maria, Muria, Abhuj Maria, Bhatra and Halba are some of the prominent tribes. Each tribe has its own deities, customs and food habits.																								The forests are made up of sal, segun, kendu, mohua, akashmoni and palash. Kendu and mohua are the cash crops. The tribals earn their livelihood in the bidi industry and in the iron mines of Biladila.																								Wild animals, including sambars, cheetals, wild boars, wolves, elephants, bears and leopards, are common. They frequent human habitats during the harvesting period.			 		There are beautiful waterfalls about 10 km from Jharadi, in the heart of the Vindhya range. You can trek to the waterfalls with the help of local tribals.																								The tribal villages around Jharadi come alive during festivals, such as Dussera, Tusu and Buddha Purnima, and even on full moon nights. The beats of the madal can be heard from afar.																								Jharadi is most attractive in spring when millions of green leaves appear on trees. Palash and simul in bloom add more colour to the surroundings. 																								Going 																								There is no direct railway connection between Calcutta and Jharadi. One has to reach Raigarh, which is 40 km from Jharadi, by Ahmedabad Express, Geetanjali Express or Mumbai Mail via Nagpur and take a passenger train towards Nagpur																								Staying 																								Stay in Raigarh, where there are several hotels with tariff between Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 per day.

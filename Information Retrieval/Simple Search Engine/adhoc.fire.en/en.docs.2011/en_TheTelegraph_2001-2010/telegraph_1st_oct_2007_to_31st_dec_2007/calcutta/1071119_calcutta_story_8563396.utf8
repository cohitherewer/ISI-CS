				 Dengue scare in Rajarhat
 																											- Three cases reported from a housing estate since Puja A STAFF REPORTER																								New Town has emerged as a dengue-prone zone, with three cases being reported since Durga puja. The Rajarhat township is plagued by waterlogging.																								Moutrisha Bagchi, 10, was admitted to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals on November 10 with dengue haemorrhagic fever, a severe form of the disease. Her doctor parents, who returned from Nigeria in September, said Moutrishas blood platelet count dropped drastically and she had rashes all over her body.																								She had fever, headache, and muscle and joint aches. She also lost appetite and was vomiting, said father Tirthankar Bagchi. Moutrisha returned home from hospital after a week.																								Software engineer Prasenjit Adhikary was treated for the same disease at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals and homemaker Kalpana Mahaldar at Calcutta Heart Clinic.																								All three are residents of Animikha Housing Complex in Rajarhat.																								Anjan Bhattacharya, the doctor who treated Bagchi, said the civic authorities of New Town should take immediate steps to improve public health, including fumigation and prevention of waterlogging.																								Sumantra Chowdhury, the managing director of Hidco, the executing agency of New Town, said: We will consult experts of the health department on Monday and act according to their advice. The area was waterlogged for a few days in September, but now the situation is normal.																								Reacting to reports of dengue in New Town, K.K. Adhikary, the chief medical officer of health, North 24-Parganas, said: Steps are being taken to prevent the spread of the disease.																								The dengue virus is transmitted to humans through female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. According to medical experts, the infected mosquitoes breed in accumulated rainwater and also in water stored in containers like jars and drums.																								Haemorrhagic dengue  more severe than classical dengue  is characterised by high fever, joint ache, facial flush and bleeding from nose and gum. In extreme cases, patients suffer from a circulatory failure.																								In moderate dengue haemorrhagic fever, the symptoms abate after the fever subsides. But in some cases the patients condition deteriorates after a few days, followed by a circulatory failure. In the absence of proper treatment, the patient could even die within 24 hours, warned a doctor.

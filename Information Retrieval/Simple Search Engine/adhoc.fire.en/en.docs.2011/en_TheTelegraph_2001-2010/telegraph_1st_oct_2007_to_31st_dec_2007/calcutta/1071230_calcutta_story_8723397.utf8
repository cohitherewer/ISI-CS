																								Malls, food courts and City Centre notwithstanding, the zoo, the Indian Museum and the Victoria Memorial Hall are still the Calcutta hotspots for the masses, particularly for the innocents from the suburbs and districts. As on rally days, they come in droves, irrespective of age, in their Sunday best, to invade the grounds of these three perennial favourites constructed a century and more ago by the Brits.
																								Jadughar, as the Indian Museum is popularly known, is still a Victorian behemoth, but the collection of Indian archaeological specimens is really beautiful and impressive, although the stuffed birds and beasts look like they have emerged from a dust bath. But the inefficiency of the staff makes even something as simple as depositing a bag into an impossible task that leaves everybody with frayed nerves. The situation becomes even more chaotic when one of the staff goes for a lunch break that lasts forever.
																								On a winter morning, no place is better for an outing than the zoo. But how shoddy it has become! The relatively new reptile house is falling to pieces, and although the old Victorian structures, some of which remind us of the old Jewish residents of Calcutta such as the Ezras and Gubbays, are still intact, the grounds are strewn with dirt and the air laden with dust.
																								As to the exhibits, the monkeys and big cats, particularly the lions, always look lean and hungry although the crowds never seem to get enough of them. 
																								Mind the S
																								James Prinsep was a great Indologist. Later in life he became the assay master of the old silver mint on Strand Road, was secretary of the Asiatic Society and had deciphered the Ashoka script.
																								He was born in 1799 in the UK and died in Varanasi in 1839. After his death, the people of Calcutta erected Prinsep Ghat close to Chandpal Ghat in 1843. It was from here that the bigwigs of the Raj set sail for home. Lord Curzon was the first one to take a train back home from Howrah Station in 1905.
																								The pair of couchant lions on either side of the ghat was relocated to Fort William. It was restored in the not so distant past. The Hooghly riverfront has been in the news for some time as efforts are being made to refurbish the district but with little definite happening till now.
																								It is commendable that the administration held a riverfront festival on December 26. Notices had appeared to draw people to the river walk from Prinsep Ghat to Millennium Park. But quite expectedly, the name of the great scholar was spelt with a c, when it is quite clearly emblazoned on the ghat itself. Prinsep deserves a little more attention. 
																								Messenger of God
																								Revellers out for breakfast at Flurys on Christmas morning were subjected to a test. While they waited in queues (and some wandered around Middleton Row), an attractive woman in blue stopped people to ask: Have you prayed today? The church is now open. Come pray. Three young women who were stopped by the woman had more in store. When I was your age, I did bad things. I was into drugs and had a lot of boyfriends. I was also suicidal. I came and confessed in this church. They told me that the Lord would save me. He did, said the woman, in a hurry to pass on her story, and moved on.

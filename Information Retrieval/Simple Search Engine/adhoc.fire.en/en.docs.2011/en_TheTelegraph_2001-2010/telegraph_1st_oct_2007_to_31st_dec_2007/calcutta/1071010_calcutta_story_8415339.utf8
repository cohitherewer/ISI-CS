				 Three flee as cops sleep
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 ESCAPE ROUTE: The broken wire mesh on the police station lock-up window. Picture by Amit Datta																								Three undertrials escaped from Bhowanipore police station on Monday night by breaking the lock-up window grille while the cops slept. 																								Tomato Sardar, 19, Lalit Kumar Yadav, 23, and Munna Mullick, 20, were arrested in Kalighat on Saturday in connection with thefts. They failed to drag out another undertrial, who was in the lock-up with them, while escaping.																								The window grille was more than a decade old and had rusted. The trio broke the grille and uprooted the wire mesh to flee, said the officer-in-charge of the police station, Dulal Chakraborty. 																								The three were involved in several thefts in south Calcutta. They were produced in court and remanded in police custody. One of them is a drug addict, added Chakraborty. 																								According to preliminary investigation, Sardar was the first to jump out of the window. He pulled out his two associates. The fourth man is too fat and could not escape. One of the constables discovered that the three were missing around 6am, said an investigating officer. 																								Seven policemen, including a sub-inspector, were in the police station at the time the undertrials escaped. There were four constables on duty last night. One of them was supposed to keep an eye on the lock-up. It is a case of utter negligence, added the officer. 																								The undertrial who could not escape told the police that the three had been trying to escape since Saturday night. 																								Deputy commissioner (south) Jawed Shamim said an inquiry had been ordered to find out whether there was dereliction of duty. It is strange that the policemen did not realise that the grille was being broken. Action will be taken against the negligent, he said.

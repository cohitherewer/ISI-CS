				 Turnout thin in sunrise sector
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The states information technology (IT) hub in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec) bowed to the might of the bandh on Monday, as attendance dipped to below 15 to 20 per cent in some of the firms. 																								While the IT department claimed that average attendance in Sector V was around 40 to 50 per cent, most parts of the showpiece tech town wore a deserted look, with techies failing to make it to their workstations. 																								Though IBM declined to share attendance numbers, sources at the companys Global Delivery Centre at Millennium City disclosed that only 121 people, out of around 1,500, could get to work. 																								The sprawling Wipro campus had very few people as Wipro Technologies had shut shop for a day for the first time since 2003, while the BPO unit registered only 12 to 15 per cent attendance. 																								It was far from business as usual at TCS, which employs over 8,000 people in Calcutta. We had about 35 per cent attendance in our office today, said vice-president Ajoyendra Mukherjee. 																								But some companies, learning the art of defying the bandh diktat, had made provisions  like accommodation for employees at community halls and pick-up facilities early in the morning  to stick to their 24x7 roster. 																								The impact of the bandh was minimum. Five companies  IBM Daksh, HSBC, BNKe Solutions, Acclaris and Explotech Solutions  had 100 per cent attendance, said state IT minister Debesh Das. 																								He also dispelled fears that frequent bandhs and an uncertain environment will have a negative impact on brand Bengal. 																								Even on a bandh day, I got calls from two investors from Bangalore, who want to come into Bengal. So, it is clear that it will not have any impact, said Das.

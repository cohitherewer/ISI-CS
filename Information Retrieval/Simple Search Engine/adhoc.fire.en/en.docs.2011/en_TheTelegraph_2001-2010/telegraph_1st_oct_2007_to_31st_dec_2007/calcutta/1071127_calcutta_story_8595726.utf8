				 Panel team at Tiljala 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two representatives of the National Commission for Minorities met Kishwar Jahan and Rukbanur Rahman on Monday evening and assured them of justice in the Rizwanur case.																								Harcharan Singh Josh and Lama Chosphel Zatpa visited the Rahmans Tiljala Lane home around 6.30pm and spent five minutes with the family.																								We asked them to get in touch with us if they face any problem with the CBI, said Josh, while leaving the house.																								The two asked the family members whether they were happy with the way the probe was being conducted. Josh and Zatpa told Kishwar Jahan that the investigation is taking time because it is being conducted thoroughly.																								However, the minorities commission representatives later said that they were apprehensive about the possibility of the central investigating agency being influenced by powerful people. 																								We told the commission members that we dont have any idea about the progress of the investigation in Delhi, said Rukbanur. They asked us to get in touch with them if we were not satisfied with the CBI investigation. But so far, we have had no complaints.																								Rukbanurs cousin Mohammad Reazuddin was questioned by the CBI investigators in New Delhi on Monday.

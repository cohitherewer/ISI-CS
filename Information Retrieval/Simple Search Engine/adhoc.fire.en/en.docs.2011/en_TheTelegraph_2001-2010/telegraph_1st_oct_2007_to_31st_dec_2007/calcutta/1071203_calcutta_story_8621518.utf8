				 Civic panel set up to ease traffic flow
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The civic authorities have formed a six-member committee to identify points in the city core area where traffic flow can be eased through small or medium-scale infrastructural changes.																								The members of the Transport Infrastructure Development Committee are director-general (town planning) Dipankar Sinha, former chief engineer (transportation planning and traffic engineering) D.K. Sadhu, principal consultant (Hidco) S.K. Roy, former CMDA chief engineer Tushar Mitra, additional police commissioner K. Harirajan and deputy commissioner (traffic) Manoj Verma.																								The first meeting of the committee was held on Tuesday. The panel will meet again in the first week of January. 																								Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay presided over Tuesdays meeting. He told the panel members that the civic body has decided to delve into traffic infrastructure development so that the city can cope with the growth in traffic over the next 20 years. 																								The committee will study the survey reports of the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Organisation, CMDA, JBIC and the state transport department, and set aside big-budget projects for government-level intervention. 																								The proposals involving small and medium-level expenditure will be taken up after drawing up a priority list, considering the availability of funds and viability of the projects.																								The CMC has set aside Rs 100 crore for small and medium-level projects, said the municipal commissioner. 																								Deputy commissioner (traffic) Verma placed a list of areas in the city where immediate intervention is needed. It was decided at the meeting that additional police commissioner Harirajan will review the list before action is taken on the basis of it.																								The panel members agreed that long snarls at busy crossings are a major problem in the city. Most of the experts felt that building crossovers at intersections would help in better traffic circulation.																								The civic engineers pointed out that flyovers recently constructed on Jawaharlal Nehru Road, AJC Bose Road and Gariahat Road are incomplete without flanks or extensions on the sides.

				 Question hour for Bappida
														 caleidoscope				 STUMPED: Bappi Lahiri. A Telegraph picture
																								It wasnt only Shyam Benegal who had faced Nandigram questions from the media about a week back. However, the filmmaker, who has produced masterpieces on rural reality, had his feet firmly on the ground and knew how to tackle the questions. Journalists looking for a bit of controversy received a long lecture on development economics. But he had other unsuspecting colleagues from the film industry who had flown down from Mumbai around the same time.																								Bappi Lahiri, addressing a news conference on the reality show Bathroom Singer, was happily describing how he, along with elite members of Bollywood, had played a guest role in Shah Rukh Khans Om Shanti Om, when a journalist of a vernacular daily caught on to the magic word shanti. Dada, Nandigram niye kichhu bolun. Apni ki okhane shanti-r jonno abaedan korben? (Sir, tell us something on Nandigram. Will you issue an appeal for peace there?)																								The smile vanished from above the double chin and the bejewelled composer immediately folded his hands and pleaded: Dada, ami kichhu janina (Dada, I dont know anything).																								Another, much younger composer, Pritam, was in an even tighter spot. Caught here on the day of the bandh, he was offered a lift to the airport by a TV channel provided he gave them an interview before that. Pritam reached the studio prepared to speak on his latest spate of Bollywood hits in Bhool Bhulaiya and Jab We Met.																								But they put me on a live debate on Nandigram with an author and a theatre personality. And I had not even seen the newspaper for the two days I was in Calcutta! he lamented to a friend. The only word that he clung on to through the show? Shanti. 																								Television channels should remember that not everyone is responsible for Nandigram. 																								Original masala mix																								Pre-mixed spices are flooding the market. Recipes that were secrets of families or communities over generations now appear in the made-easy formats of sachets: Garam Masala, Chana Masala, Meat Masala, Chicken Masala, Biryani Masala, Panir Masala, Chat Masala. 																								Its both good and bad. Good because the mixes enable even a newcomer in the kitchen to try Biryani or a Chicken Korma on the very first day. Bad because they make every feast prepared by the local caterer taste the same. 																								But they also provide the occasion to remember the original masala mix in the market: Gotar Masala, available in the early-70s, and Curry Powder, available from the mid-70s till the 80s. In terms of aroma and taste, they were much superior to the present day masalas. 																								Gotar Masala was versatile: it could be used in every vegetarian dish, from the home-made Masala Muri (puffed rice), Alu Bhate (mashed potatoes), to Chhanchra (mixed vegetables), Chutney (sweet gravy) and Danla (curry). Curry Powder was for non-vegetarian dishes. It could be added to any preparation of meat, chicken, beef, pork and fish . 																								Is there any present day masala that can accomplish even half of it?An anti-war graffiti in Istanbul. (AFP)				 				 				 		Art of the matter																								The AJC Bose flyover has a new art on display  spray-painted graffiti, an advancement from the hand-drawn and mostly crude examples that mark the streets of the city. Or is it? Because the designs may be spray-painted, but theres nothing different about them. They are the kind of graffiti seen on trains  male and female names written inside a huge heart. They are a far cry from the graffiti found in Brazil  colourful, brilliant, subversive. The artists risk life and limb to leave their imprints on the city, from the tallest buildings to the undersides of motorway flyovers. We are not asking for all that. But instead of so much paint, could not the city use some more imagination?																								(Contributed by Deepankar Ganguly and Sudeshna Banerjee)

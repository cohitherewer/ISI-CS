				 Neglect cry at hospital
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Trouble broke out at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Sunday morning following the death of a newborn.																								Relatives blamed the negligence of hospital staff for the death. The authorities denied the charge, saying the woman had given birth to a stillborn child. A probe has been ordered.																								Rekha Sonkar, 24, a resident of Ghosh Bagan Lane, in Cossipore, was admitted to the hospital early on Sunday with labour pain. She underwent a Caesarean section at 5am and gave birth to a boy child, said Rekhas husband Babla, who works in a private firm.																								A few minutes later, the doctors who performed the Caesarean section told my wife that the child was dead. When the body was handed over to us, we saw there were scratches behind the ears and the face and also marks of bleeding on the body, alleged Babla.																								We could not speak to the doctors but the other employees told us that the injuries were caused during delivery. But arent they supposed to wear gloves during the procedure? he asked.																								Bablas neighbours soon came to the hospital and started a demonstration, alleging that the child died due to negligence. A complaint was lodged with Tallah police station.																								The hospital claimed Rekha had given birth to a stillborn child. The child was given a cardiac massage, which caused the scratch marks, said an official.																								But if the condition was so serious, why was Rekha not admitted earlier? asked a family member. She went to the hospital for admission two days back, but the doctors said there was no need for immediate admission as her condition was not serious. Besides, there were no beds.

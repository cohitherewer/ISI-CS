				 Blast shock waves rattle high court
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 Theres a safety scurry at the high court. A Telegraph picture																								The blasts in Uttar Pradesh courts have prompted a security beef-up at Calcutta High Court and other courts in the city.																								An extra contingent of 100 policemen will be deployed at the high court from Monday. The court is now guarded by 150 policemen, who work in three shifts round the clock.																								Besides deploying additional policemen, we will set up metal detector gates at all five entry points and also at the doors of all 37 courtrooms. The cops manning the entry points will also carry hand-held metal detectors. Plus, there will be the usual combing by sniffer dogs, Debkumar Chakraborty, the assistant police commissioner in charge of high court security, said on Friday.																								Metal detectors are now installed only at two entry points.																								Earlier, advocate L.C. Behani, a former president of the high court bar association, moved the court of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar, requesting him to ensure that the government steps up security in the court.																								More than 5,000 litigants and 7,000 lawyers throng the high court daily. Besides, there are around 2,000 court employees. Many lawyers and litigants were seen leaving the court soon after news of the blasts reached the premises.																								The bar association has called an extraordinary general meeting to review the situation on Monday.																								Sources in the high court administration said security would also be strengthened at Alipore court, Sealdah court, metropolitan magistrates court and the city civil and sessions court.

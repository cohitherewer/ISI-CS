				 Idris fiasco draws flak
 A STAFF REPORTER			Idris Ali: Discharge amid disorder. A Telegraph picture		Idris Ali was discharged from SSKM Hospital on Tuesday after tests revealed that he was not suffering from any complications.																								Hospital superintendent Ashok Ghosh was reportedly rapped by the government for admitting the accused in the Park Circus violence without investigating whether he was actually suffering from any serious problem.																								Ali, the president of the All India Minority Forum, was arrested last Saturday on charges of attempt to murder, rioting, causing injury to police and public and damaging property. He was remanded in police custody till November 29.																								On Monday afternoon, he complained of severe abdominal pain and was admitted in SSKMs Woodburn ward under gastroenterologist Abhimanyu Bose. Some patients from Nandigram are admitted in the ward.																								He was released at 11.50am on Tuesday and taken back to the Lalbazar lockup. Nothing was found in the tests conducted on him, said medical superintendent Ashok Ghosh.																								Sources said Ghosh was summoned to Swasthya Bhavan, the state health department headquarters, on Monday evening and asked why he admitted Ali without finding out whether he was feigning illness or not. He was also questioned about his decision to admit Ali in Woodburn ward, where VIP and critical patients are usually kept, said a health department official.																								Since Tuesday morning, the sources added, CPM-affiliated doctors in the hospital started pressuring the authorities to discharge Ali. If he is not ill, why should he occupy a bed? a doctor asked.																								Ghosh said: Ali was brought to the emergency ward. He seemed to be suffering from a severe pain, so we admitted him for some tests.

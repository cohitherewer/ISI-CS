				 Bigger, better, longer Puja 
				 	 The crowd at College Square on Panchami. A Telegraph picture 																								Gone are the days when the Pujas started on Saptami and ended on Dashami. Now the Puja is bigger, better and longer  formal inaugurations are held on Panchami, sometimes even on Chaturthi and the idol is kept a day or two after Dashami to allow visitors more time to check out the themes, and of course the idol. 																								Ballygunge Cultural had a formal inauguration for the first time in 2000, their golden jubilee year. This year the Puja will be inaugurated on Monday, Chaturthi.																								The inauguration of the Babubagan puja, to be held on Panchami, Tuesday, will be dramatic. Initially we were planning to have it on Chaturthi, but work was postponed owing to the rain. We have invited many dignitaries. The pandal will be in complete darkness. As soon as the dignitaries step in, the lights will be switched on, the dhaaks will start playing and members of our womens committee, all dressed alike, will give flowers to the dignitaries to be offered to the goddess, inaugurating the Puja, says Suman Chatterjee, the president of the Babubagan puja committee. 																								Organisers say that pandal-visits start from Panchami now, which has forced them to start the festivities early. The elite city crowd prefers to make a round of the pandals on Panchami and Sashthi to avoid the crowd that throngs pandals on Saptami, Ashtami and Navami. On the later days, the crowd is mostly of people from the outskirts, says Neelanjan Deb, the joint secretary of the Deshapriya Park puja, which is also being inaugurated on Panchami.																								Then there are those who want to do a quick round of the pandals before taking off for a vacation on Saptami and Ashtami, or out-of-towners who will leave the city once the vacation starts. So many people leave the city from Saptami. For them, too, we inaugurate the Puja on Panchami, says Badal Bhattacharjee of the College Square puja committee.																								On Panchami and Sashthi offices are still open. In the evening many people like to make a round of the pandals before going home. Every organiser is going for an early inauguration for a greater footfall and longer-lasting festive feel, says Anirban Bose, the general secretary of Jodhpur Park puja, which will be inaugurated on Chaturthi. 																								There is also the lure of the awards. Now judges start coming in from Tritiya to avoid the crowd later. We have to be ready for them, says Anjan Ukil, the secretary of the Ballygunge Cultural puja committee. 																								But the desire to avoid a crowd often results in a crowd. Our footfall on Panchami is approximately 20-25 per cent of our footfall on Navami evening and on Sashthi is 30-40 per cent of the Navami crowd, says Chatterjee.						POULOMI BANERJEE

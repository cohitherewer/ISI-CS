				 Public out, marriage in
 																											- Councillor brother ties knot on no-entry Howrah Maidan A STAFF REPORTER																								Morning-walkers are not allowed but marriage parties are welcome on Howrah Maidan, a precious patch of green in the congested town.																								A portion of Howrah Maidan, near the Howrah stadium, has been rented out for the wedding of BJP councillor Sanjay Singhs brother. A giant pandal was erected on the grounds for the ceremony on Wednesday evening.																								I have complained to the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) and spoken to the district magistrate about this. The district magistrate shared my concern, said environment activist Subhas Dutta.																								He pointed out that the grounds are out of bounds for the common people, even for a morning walk.																								The highly congested, polluted and unplanned Howrah town has practically no open space. The British had earmarked Howrah Maidan as the lungs of the town. It is shocking to find that the already-clogged lungs are being damaged further by hosting a wedding, added Dutta. 																								The population density of Howrah  about 20,000 people per sq km  is one of the highest in the country. According to the central pollution control board, it is one of the two critically polluted cities in the state (the other being Durgapur-Asansol).																								The HMC does not believe that holding a wedding ceremony on a green patch would damage the grounds. 																								There is no question of the environment being degraded or the Maidan being damaged in any way. Moreover, there was no match at the stadium today, said mayor Gopal Mukherjee.																								The rent will be used for maintenance of the football ground, claimed Mukherjee.																								According to civic officials, this is the first time the Maidan has been rented out for a private function.																								I have been plying a rickshaw in the area for decades but I have never seen a marriage ceremony being held on the Maidan, said Samir Malik.																								Howrah is a highly congested area and encroachment on the existing open space, including Howrah Maidan, should be avoided as much as possible, said Somnath Narayan, who is in charge of the Howrah office of the state pollution control board.

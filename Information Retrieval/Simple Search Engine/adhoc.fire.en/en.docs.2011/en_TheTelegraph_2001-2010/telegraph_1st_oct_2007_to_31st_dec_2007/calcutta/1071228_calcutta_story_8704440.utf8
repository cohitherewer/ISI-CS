		 Art of enlightenment
																																	Thangka is a painted or embroidered Buddhist banner which decorates monastery walls or family altars or is carried by monks during processions. In Tibetan, the word than means flat and the word ka stands for painting. It is also sometimes called a scroll-painting. Originally, Thangka paintings became popular among travelling monks as they could be easily transported from place to place. The Thangkas served as important teaching tools, depicting the life of Buddha, influential lamas and other deities. One popular subject for these paintings was the Wheel of Life, a visual representation of the Art of Enlightenment. These images serve as the centrepiece during religious rituals and ceremonies and principally for meditation as the visual stimulation offered help the worshipper to internalise the qualities of the Buddha thus portrayed. Chitrakoot Art Gallery brings to us the Thangka paintings collected and preserved over centuries, unfolding stories of a past which shaped the thinking of the East to a great extent.

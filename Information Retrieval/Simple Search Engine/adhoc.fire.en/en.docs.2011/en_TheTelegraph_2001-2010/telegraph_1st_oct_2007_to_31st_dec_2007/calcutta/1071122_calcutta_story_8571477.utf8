				 Norms for ICSE tag made tough 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTIts tougher now to set up an ICSE school.																								The Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations has made the criteria for granting affiliation to new ICSE schools more rigorous.																								The new rules say the final inspection of an upcoming school before the affiliation is granted will have to be conducted by two principals from other states.																								Till last year, the inspection used to be conducted by principals from the same state or the city where the school is proposed to come up.																								Following the new rule, two principals from Orissa and Jharkhand recently inspected an upcoming school in Burdwan.																								The principals will conduct inspections separately. Both the reports will be studied by the council before it decides on granting affiliation to a school, said a senior official from Delhi.																								Separate inspections will bring in more transparency in the affiliation-granting process, the official added.																								Sources said the council has tightened the rules following complaints against several schools, that they lack adequate infrastructure and staff strength. A section of guardians and teachers blames the lapse on the liberal attitude of the inspectors, who in most cases were close to the school authorities.																								However, the officiating chief executive of the council, Gerry Arathoon, said: As of now, we have not received any major complaint about improper inspections. The council wants to ensure high academic standards in each institution that runs the ICSE and ISC courses. The changes we have introduced in the affiliation system will give us an opportunity to cross-check the documents provided by the schools.

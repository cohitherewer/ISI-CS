				 No Shisha for Shoaib
 ZEESHAN JAWED				 	 Little Danial makes a face while dad Mohammed Yousuf gets his haircut. Picture by Pabitra Das																								The security ring around cricketers in Calcutta is playing party-pooper for Team Pakistan.																								Usually the most mobile cricket tourists in town, popping up at restaurants and hopping into nightclubs, they are not being allowed to deviate from their hotel-to-ground routine.																								Pakistani players usually eat and party in town till late at night. But this time, they have rarely moved out of Taj Bengal, said a cop outside the Alipore hotel.																								Much to the disappointment of food-and-fun addresses eager to host the Shoaib Akhtars. Pakistani cricketers are very fond of the north Indian cuisine at Ivory. But this time, we have not had anybody visiting us, observed Sovan Mukherjee, food and beverage manager of the Camac Street restaurant that hosted Shahid Afridi and Mohammed Sami on the last tour.																								Shisha, next door, is also missing the men in green, with only ex-player-turned-commentator Aamir Sohail dropping in at the lounge bar on Wednesday night.																								If not for the excessive security, Shoaib and Co. would surely have come to Shisha or Venom or Roxy before the Test, rued Pinky, a party regular. As it turned out, the only place Shoaib went to was Apollo Gleneagles, to recover from a chest infection.																								If theres one Pakistani player the citys party circuit is missing this week, its Shahid Afridi. We are confident that had Afridi been in the team, he would have been out partying and got the boys along, said the manager of a disc in south Calcutta.																								What fans in Calcutta are missing out on was evident from the crowd that gathered within minutes of five Pakistani players arriving at the Reid amp; Taylor outlet at the Park Street-Russell Street crossing around 3.45pm on Thursday.																								Mohammed Yousuf, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Gul, Imran Farhat and Yasir Hameed spent 50 minutes shopping. The players blamed their restricted movements on health problems. Arre yaar, most of us have been under the weather. We have not even got a chance to taste some local cuisine. Ive heard you get good sweets here, said Misbah.																								So which brand ambassador of Reid amp; Taylor would the Pakistani players bat for  Bond or Big B? I have not seen any Pierce Brosnan movie, but Amitabh Bachchan is as big a superstar in Pakistan as he is in India, smiled Farhat.																								The only other public place frequented by Pakistani players has been Eyecatchers, a salon on Wood Street. If on Wednesday evening Umar, Misbah, Yasir and Faisal Iqbal had gone there, Thursday afternoon saw Mohammed Yousuf dropping in with his son. While dad had a haircut and beard trim, little Danial was busy munching chips and chocolate.

				 Jobless hangs himself

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								A 44-year-old jobless man committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling of his Aurobindo Sarani house on Sunday morning. 
																								Kamal Roys elder brother started knocking on his door around 6.30am after finding it locked. Neighbours broke open the door after some time, to find Kamal hanging from the ceiling.
																								He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Doctors declared him brought dead. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said an officer of Shyampukur police station.
																								According to the family members, Kamal, a bachelor, had confined himself to his room for three days and came out only to have dinner with his family.
																								Roy had been without a job for six months and had been frantically looking for one. Acute depression drove him to suicide. He left a suicide note, so we do not suspect foul play, said Niren Chandra Chattopadhyay, the additional officer-in-charge of Shyampukur police station.
																								Roy was a graduate and had worked in several private firms. He was sacked in June by a firm in Howrah after he had worked there for two years, added the officer.
																								According to the police, Roy wrote in his suicide note that he had been very depressed for the past fortnight. He did not hold anyone responsible for his death.

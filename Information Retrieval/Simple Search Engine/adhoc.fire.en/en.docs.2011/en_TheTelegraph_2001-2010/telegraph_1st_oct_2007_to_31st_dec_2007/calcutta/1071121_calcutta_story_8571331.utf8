				 Back-to-back blaze sears city
 Tension over tardy firemen A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Firemen hurry to put out the blaze at the Martin Burn compound in Kidderpore. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								How long does it take a fire engine to reach the site of a blaze three minutes away by car? More than an hour, if you go by the fire services efforts on Tuesday afternoon, when the Martin Burn compound in Kidderpore was ablaze.																								The Garden Reach fire station was alerted around 12.15pm. The first tender reached the Babubazar address after 1.15pm, said local residents. All the while, the flames were threatening to spread to a neighbouring slum and petrol pump. 																								This caused tension in the area. Angry residents gheraoed the police officers and firemen, and pelted stones at them. The Rapid Action Force was deployed to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. 																								The fire department officers blamed the delay on bad traffic. We would not have taken an hour to reach the spot under normal circumstances. Had it not been for the traffic snarls, we would have got there much earlier, said a fire department official. 																								Metro drove from the fire station at 48 Hide Road to the Martin Burn compound on Tuesday evening. Even without the fire engine siren, the journey took less than three minutes.																								D.P. Biswas, the director of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services, claimed there was no delay. The fire engines reached on time but the people did not cooperate with us. Otherwise, we would have doused the flames earlier. 																								More than 1,000 people live in the slum near the compound. They were afraid that the fire would raze their homes. The flames would not have spread so far had the fire tenders arrived in time. I shudder to think what would have happened if the blaze reached the slum. Many lives would have been lost, said Mohammad Sharik, a local resident who was among the first few to reach the compound and help in putting out the flames. 																								 The RAF personnel and policemen had to use force on the residents to help the firemen to work. The firemen and the police officers took ages to reach the site of the fire but were prompt to summon RAF personnel. They should have shown the same alertness in fighting the fire, said Iqbal Ali, another local resident.

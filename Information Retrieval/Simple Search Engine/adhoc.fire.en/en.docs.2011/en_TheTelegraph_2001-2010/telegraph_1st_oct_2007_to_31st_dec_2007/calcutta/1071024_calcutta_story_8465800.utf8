Picture by Amit Datta																								CBI officials probing Rizwanur Rahmans death are trying to find out where the computer graphics teacher spent seven nights after his wife Priyanka Todi left for her parents home.																								Rizwanur was found dead on the railway tracks in Patipukur on September 21.																								Not even his family knows where he was on those seven nights between September 9 and 21, a CBI official said on Tuesday. Unravelling the mystery can provide us with a crucial lead in the case.																								Another official said: We are trying to find out what was his mental state after Priyanka left and what forced him to leave home at night. It is also important to know who he spent the nights with.																								Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan said her son did not dare sleep at home at night, fearing arrest on trumped-up charges slapped by father-in-law Ashok Todi.																								He used to be at home during the day, preparing documents on the police harassment he had to suffer, but would leave home at night. He did not tell me his whereabouts.																								Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur, too, was in the dark. He shared all his secrets with me, but refused to divulge where he was spending the nights, recalled Rukbanur.																								Rizwanur agreed to send Priyanka back to her parents house in Salt Lake after signing a bond in front of senior officers of Calcutta police at Lalbazar on September 8. Priyanka, too, signed the bond, stating she would be back in the Rahman home within a week.																								Investigations revealed that Rizwanur spent the nights of September 8 and 10 at his 7B Tiljala Lane home.																								On September 17 and 18, he slept at Rukbanurs CIT Road flat. He spent the last two nights of his life, on September 19 and 20, at his aunts house on Shamsul Huda Road.																								But no one seems to know where he was on the night of September 9 and from September 11 to 16.

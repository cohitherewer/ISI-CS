				 Brother cries off politics
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rukbanur Rahman, Rizwanurs elder brother, will not associate himself with any political party.																								I am not into politics. This is a baseless rumour, Rukbanur said at a press meet near his Tiljala Lane house, reacting to reports that he will join either the Congress or Trinamul Congress.																								The rumours are being spread to divert attention from the real issue. We want justice for my brother. We want those responsible for his death to be punished. This has become the sole mission of our life. We are not bothered about anything else, Rukbanur added.																								Leaders from several political parties have visited the 7B Tiljala Lane address since Rizwanur was found dead on the railway tracks near Dum Dum on September 21.																								They have come and met us, but that does not mean I will join politics. I am not here to gain publicity out of my brothers death, stated Rukbanur.																								He expressed concern over the state of their mother Kishwar Jahans health. My mothers blood pressure has shot up. She has been crying constantly and praying for justice, said Rukbanur.

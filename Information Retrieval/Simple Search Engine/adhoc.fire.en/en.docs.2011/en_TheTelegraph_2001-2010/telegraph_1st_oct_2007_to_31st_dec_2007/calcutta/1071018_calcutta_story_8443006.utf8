				 Star line-up an annual affair at puja
 															- BEYOND SILVER SCREEN MADHUPARNA DAS				 	 BOLLYWOOD BOUQUET: Preity Zinta and Ajay Devgan at the 2007 inauguration of Pratapaditya Road Trikon Parks Durga puja. A Telegraph picture																								Bollywood biggies have been on their menu for the past three years now. And for the residents of Pratapaditya Road Trikon Park, its something beyond the silver-screen lure.																								This has become part of our tradition now. We demand a grand opening from our puja committee and this is what we get, smiles Sagnik Mukherjee, happy to volunteer as spokesperson for his para. We have always had a bash.																								Having stars from Bollywood visiting them has become customary, thanks to Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. This year, the Bollywood bouquet at the inauguration on Monday included Preity Zinta, Ajay Devgan, Dharmendra and Rakesh Roshan.																								Devgan and Preity came down leaving their shoots midway just to be part of the grand Bengal festival. 																								Starting with Dharmendra, as the stars greeted the huge gathering one by one in the small cordoned lane beside the little triangular stretch they call the park, a reverberating surge of voices greets them back.																								Trikon Park doesnt have space big enough to accommodate the galaxy of stars, but the local residents were calm and well-behaved. A lot of planning went behind it, too, said Sagnik.																								The stars could easily walk through the human barricades from the stage to the pandal, a good few yards, and there was no untoward incident. For the people, even a giant screen was put up so that no one was deprived of star-gazing.																								Last year saw John Abraham and Sharmila Tagore, Nana Patekar and Anupam Kher taking the centre stage. And the year before, the residents had Jaya Prada and Sunil Dutt. No doubt, things are getting bigger by the year.																								But did they have a wish list for this year? Well, Hrithik Roshan was our first choice and Vivek Oberoi second. And of course, there was Rani Mukerji, said Santanu Roy, a committee member.																								Tollywood stars are also a fixture of our Puja every year. Be it Mithunda or Tapas Pal, they all claim they belong here, laughs Sagnik, while attending to his job of keeping order around the temple. 																								Rituparna Sengupta and Debasree Roy were present at this years inauguration.																								Pushpa Mukherjee, aged 60, was there with her daughter-in-law and two grandsons, like every year. Whom did she come to see among the stars? 																								Everyone, especially Preity Zinta and Rakesh Roshan, she said. And I would love to see Rani Mukerji, our gharer meye, smiled daughter-in-law Mallika.																								Sagnik goes on to explain how the pandal has been fashioned on the Kutaikundi temple of Orissas Mayurbhanj district, an excellent piece of art that has vanished even from the states tourism brochure. The nagor shilpa of Keeching village, in Orissa, has been recreated in pith and plaster of Paris by award-winning artisan Deepak Ghosh.																								If you think para puja cannot get bigger or better than this, heres Priya Ranjan Das Munshis promise for the year to come. Rakeshji (Roshan) has just promised me that if he keeps well next year, hell definitely bring Hrithik with him.

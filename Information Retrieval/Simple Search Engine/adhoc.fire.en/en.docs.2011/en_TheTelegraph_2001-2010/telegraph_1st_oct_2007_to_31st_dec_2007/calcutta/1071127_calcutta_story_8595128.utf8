				 Revamp plan for Howrah
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 A monument in Howrah. Calcuttas twin town is set for revitalisation. A Telegraph picture																								Parts of Howrah are set to benefit from a first-of-its-kind integrated inner-city regeneration programme, with the aid of a UK-based multi-disciplinary consultancy firm.																								A 260-sq-km zone on the west bank, spanning the Howrah Municipal Corporation area, Bally, Uluberia and Bagnan, among other places, with a population of over three million, has been earmarked for a revitalisation plan under the UKs Department for International Development umbrella. The project is set to unfold over the next 15-20 years.																								We are now organising stakeholders workshops in Howrah and collecting inputs on demographics, skill sets, migrant population level, land-use plan and other critical issues, Amit Mukherjee, the divisional director, Mott MacDonald, a multi-disciplinary consultancy firm headquartered in the UK, said on Monday.																								The company with a turnover of 700 million, engaged in planning and development from water, energy, industry, environment and transport to building, healthcare, tourism and social development, is the consultant in the Howrah regeneration project.																								At a macro level, the preliminary data should be in by December-end, and a strategy document prepared in January. We can then identify budgets and draw up a priority of revitalisation projects in the area, which people want and which can leverage the regions core strengths, said Mukherjee.																								The UK company wants to dovetail micro-level projects of all stakeholders in the region into the master plan. Once three to four projects are picked for immediate implementation, the private partners will be identified.																								The revitalisation projects could be driven by education, small and medium-scale enterprise, healthcare or whatever is the USP of the area. We will work towards making the projects attractive for bankers and financial institutions and look for strategic linkages, the official of Mott MacDonald India added.

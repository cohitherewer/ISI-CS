				 Hard lessons from bandh
														 Schools start extra 				 classes to make up for lost time, report 	 Priyanka Roy and Saionee Chakraborty																								If till recently a strike meant a surprise holiday, it is now proving to be a bane for many city school students. With educational institutions pulling out all stops to make up for lost school hours, students find themselves not only trudging to school during the weekend to attend special classes, but also sitting through extra study sessions after scheduled school hours on other days.																								Lessons piling up because of the sudden spurt of bandhs and violence in the city is a major concern in many schools. Says Seema Sapru, principal, Heritage School, EM Bypass branch: Our schedules have been re-adjusted due to the bandh. The location of our school is such that it becomes difficult for students to commute if school buses cannot ply.																								With the spate of bandhs, the school could not send buses. We have had to schedule classes on Saturday, which is basically reserved for extra-curricular activities. We realise that students and teachers alike have things of their own planned out during weekends. But we dont have a choice since we cant cut down on the syllabus. 																								Like Heritage, St James and La Martiniere for Girls have also had to resort to extra school hours. We are attending 15 minutes of extra classes in the morning and in the afternoon. The normal school hours are 7.45am to 1.30pm. Now, classes start at 7.30am and end at 1.45pm, says Sharequl Haque, a student of St James school. 																								It is the same for students of La Martiniere for Girls. We now attend school on Saturdays, something that has never happened. Our regular closing time of 1.20pm every day has now been changed to 2pm to push in one extra period of study, says Teesta Nayak, a Class XI student of La Martiniere for Girls.																								Students of schools that have so far not started extra classes are afraid that they will start soon. We havent had extra classes so far. But since the school was closed on Thursday because of the riots on the previous day, we are anticipating that we will soon have extra classes as well as study sessions on Saturdays, says Indrani Chatterjee (name changed on request), a student of GD Birla Centre for Education.																								And more classes in school mean readjusting private lessons. Says Pranati Kundu, mother of 16-year-old Ashmita who studies at St Stephens school: Owing to extra classes on Saturday, tuition timings have to be adjusted. As a result, my daughter has to go for tuitions on Sundays as well. Since she is in Class X, she cant afford to miss out on extra classes. Neither can she miss out on tuition.																								The student is drained out at the end of the week. I dont mind attending extra classes since the syllabus needs to be completed on time. But after a whole week of school, it does get tiring to attend classes over the weekend, says Ujjoiny Das, a Class IX student of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.

				 Baby boon against odds
 															- Paralysed woman becomes mother A STAFF REPORTER																								Two women have become mothers against medical odds, thanks to the efforts of city doctors.																								Sudipta Sarkar, 35, a resident of the airport area, had five unsuccessful deliveries, while Gargee Roy, a 31-year-old resident of Dakshineswar, is paralysed from the chest downwards. Sudipta gave birth to a boy and Gargee a girl at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, on EM Bypass, on November 4 and 22, respectively.																								I had lost all interest in life after five miscarriages, said Sudipta. Gargee did not have it any easier. A motorcycle hit her in 1996, causing multiple spinal cord fractures. She survived, but was partially paralysed.																								The accident did not leave Gargee psychologically scarred. She fell in love and married businessman Arindam Roy in 2003. The couple decided to have a child, braving the challenges. Gargee conceived in April this year.																								Both cases were complex. Besides suffering five miscarriages, Sudipta was a patient of high blood pressure and diabetes and had thyroid problems, said Jayanta Gupta, a senior consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the hospital. He was in charge of both deliveries.																								According to him, Gargees was the more complex case, as she has to undergo physiotherapy daily after spinal cord treatment at Vellore. I had to stop the physiotherapy during my pregnancy. I took the risk for my baby, said Gargee.																								Both women had Caesarean deliveries. We had to be very careful. Constant monitoring, treatment and psychological support were needed. Thankfully, the patients showed lots of courage, said the doctor.																								The mothers and the babies are doing fine now.

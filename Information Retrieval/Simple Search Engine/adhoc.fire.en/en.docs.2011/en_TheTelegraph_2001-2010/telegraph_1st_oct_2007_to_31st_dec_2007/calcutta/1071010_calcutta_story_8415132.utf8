				 CBI probe hearing 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Advocate-general Balai Ray argued in the high court on Tuesday that Rizwanur Rahmans mother and brother could not technically call for a CBI probe on the basis of allegations.																								Until it is proved that Rizwanur was murdered and had not committed suicide or got killed in an accident, the petitioners cannot demand a CBI probe, said Ray.																								The advocate-general claimed that since the petitioners did not make the CID a party to the case and didnt challenge its competence, the CBI could not be given charge of the probe. Ray will conclude his arguments before Justice S. Pal on Thursday.																								At Jal Sampad Bhavan in Salt Lake, Amit Das, the secretary of the judicial commission probing Rizwanurs death, said the panel has the power to ask an IPS officer to depose before it.																								Das urged individuals, associations and organisations to depose before the commission with relevant documents between 11am and 4pm from Monday to Saturday (except government holidays).

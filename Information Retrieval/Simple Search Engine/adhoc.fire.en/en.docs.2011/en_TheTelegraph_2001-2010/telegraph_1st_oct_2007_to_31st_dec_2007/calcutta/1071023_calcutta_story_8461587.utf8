				 Baby left in pandal
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The three-month-old baby that was abandoned in a puja pandal on Sunday night. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Members of the Vidyasagar Central Club Netaji Pathagar, in Jadavpur, heard a baby crying in their deserted puja pandal on Sunday night after the musical soiree to mark Vijaya Dashami had ended and the crowd had dispersed.																								They soon discovered a baby girl lying alone on a chair, wrapped in a towel. There was a bag by her side, with a feeding bottle inside.																								The child, barely three months old, was brought into the club and some female members of the club took care of her, said Sanjib Mazumdar, a member of the club.																								We made announcements over the loudspeaker for nearly three hours but no one came to claim the baby, he added.																								Another member of the Vidyasagar Central Club said someone might have quietly abandoned the infant, taking advantage of the fact that everyone was busy on Sunday evening celebrating the last few hours of Durga puja amidst music blaring from the loudspeaker.																								We feel that the person who abandoned the baby was waiting for an opportune moment. We dont think she belongs to this neighbourhood, he added.																								Soon after discovering the abandoned child, the club members alerted Jadavpur police station. The baby was first taken to Bagha Jatin State General Hospital and later transferred to MR Bangur Hospital. 																								Doctors and nurses took care of her there. She is quite lively. We are feeding her and taking care of her, said one of the nurses.																								It is quite shocking that her parents have left behind such a lovely baby, said Shanti Sen, who had come to the hospital to take her newborn granddaughter home.																								The district superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), Praveen Kumar, said till late on Monday no one had come to claim the baby. 																								After waiting for some more time, we will contact the social welfare department to hand over the baby to them. Till then, the baby will remain in the custody of the hospital, added Kumar.

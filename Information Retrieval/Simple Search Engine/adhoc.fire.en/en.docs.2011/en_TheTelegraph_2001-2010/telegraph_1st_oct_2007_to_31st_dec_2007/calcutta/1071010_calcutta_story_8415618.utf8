				 Man saves drowning girl
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 SAVIOUR: Imam Mazher, who rescued a girl from the Hooghly on Tuesday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Imam Mazher jumps in to help people. On Tuesday morning, he had to do that literally, to save a drowning girl.																								The martial arts teacher was on the way to his Watgunge home from a class when he saw three boys running helter-skelter on Baskel Bridge, in Kidderpore.																								The boys told him that a girl had just jumped into the Hooghly from the bridge. The 31-year-old parked his motorcycle and rushed to the side for a look.																								As soon as he saw the girl flailing her arms in the water, he dived in. I was not thinking about myself. I was just hoping that I would be able to save her, recounted Mazher in the afternoon, sitting in the clinic he runs near his home.																								All she kept saying was, Let me go, I want to die, said the braveheart. He pulled her to the bank, where the police had arrived. They took the girl to South Port police station.																								The girl is a Class X student of a local school. She had allegedly tried to commit suicide after being scolded for cheating in an English examination. Her parents took her home from the police station.																								Mazher is the first person to chip in if there is trouble in the locality, said one of his neighbours. He rushed to the site of a traffic mishap on Hastings bridge earlier this year. He was the one who took the injured to SSKM Hospital, he added.																								For Mazher, though, its all in a days work. Jaan bachana hamara kaam hai. Baki hum kuch nahin jantey (Saving lives is my job. The rest is not important), he said.

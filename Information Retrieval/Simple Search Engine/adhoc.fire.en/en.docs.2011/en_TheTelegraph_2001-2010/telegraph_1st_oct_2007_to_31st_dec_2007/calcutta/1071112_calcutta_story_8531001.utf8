				 Tax hurdle leads to civic funds crunch
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Civic services in Salt Lake will be hit unless the property tax rules are amended soon.																								Property tax is the biggest component of Bidhannagar Municipalitys income. The civic body has not been able to collect the tax since May after the Supreme Court ruled that the existing laws were arbitrary and illegal. Bidhannagar Welfare Association, a residents body, had filed the case against the municipality. 																								The civic body has funds to last barely five more months. According to officials, municipal services will have to be stopped if the situation is not tackled on a war footing.																								The monthly expense of the municipality is nearly Rs 70 lakh, which means that Rs 8.4 crore has to be spent annually to provide amenities to the township residents, without undertaking any development work. The civic body had about Rs 11 crore in the reserve fund in May and over Rs 5 crore has been spent from it, said Debashish Jana, an Opposition leader in the municipality.																								To modify the property tax rules, an amendment bill must be passed in the Assembly. The taxpayers also have to be informed about the new rules before they are implemented.																								There is a lot of work to be done even if the amended bill is passed at the earliest. The assessment will take time and appeals will also have to be heard against the valuation. Earlier, the process took nearly two years, said a municipality official.																								The chairman of the municipality is confident that services will not be affected. Apart from the reserve fund, we have a small income from billboard licences and rents. I feel that the situation will change and we will be able to collect taxes well before the reserve fund runs out, said chairman Biswajiban Majumder.																								The municipality has not undertaken projects since May mainly because of the funds crisis. There are several projects in the pipeline, like upgrade of the Karunamoyee market and construction of a bus terminus, but have not been taken forward. We had also decided to build a swimming pool and improve the solid waste management system, but these projects, too, have been stalled, added the municipality official.

				 Objection to minority panel
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Church bodies that run educational institutions have protested the constitution of a government panel to look into the problems of minority institutions without representation from them.																								Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, an organisation of church bodies running educational institutions, and the West Bengal Association of Christian Schools have written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar and Left Front chairman Biman Bose on Monday in this regard.																								The church bodies had last week expressed displeasure at the government for granting minority status to madarsas when church-run and Christian missionary institutions need a nod from Delhi to enjoy the same rights.																								We are shocked that the government did not consult the two bodies before setting up the panel. The organisations have been fighting for betterment of minority institutions for 13 years, said Herod Mullick, the general secretary of Pariseba.																								There are more than 700 church and Christian missionary schools, 13 colleges, five teachers training institutes and six vocational training institutes in West Bengal.																								The government should have taken our organisations into confidence. We had been taking up major issues related to minority rights and smooth running of minority institutions for several years, said Faustine Brank, a member of the association.																								Sattar said he had received a letter but ruled out the possibility of the two bodies being included in the committee, headed by Subimal Sen, the vice-chairman of the higher education council. 																								The panel will examine the rules related to minority schools, starting from the issuance of no-objection certificates to setting up a body to grant them recognition. The Pariseba and the association are free to provide inputs to the panel on the draft rules. We will certainly take their views into consideration, said the minority affairs minister.

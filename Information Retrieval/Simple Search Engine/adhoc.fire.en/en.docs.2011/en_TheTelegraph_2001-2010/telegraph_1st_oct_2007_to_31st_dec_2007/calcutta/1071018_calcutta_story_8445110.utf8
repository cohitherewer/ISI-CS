				 Platforms of protest
 SREYASHI DASTIDAR				 	 Members of band Cactus at the candlelight vigil for justice for Rizwanur Rahman. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								 Is the death of																								 Rizwanur Rahman a cautionary tale about a hard-working																								 boy who had to sacrifice his life for marrying out																								 of his station? 																								 Is it an eye-opener to the mala fide intervention of the state, police and family in the private domain of two adults? 																								 Is Rizwanur a																								 symbol of the dreams and aspirations of those Calcuttans																								 who want to lead peaceful, law-abiding, apolitical																								 lives in the city? 																								lIs the death an indication of how far the machinery of the state has sold itself to the money-power of industry? 																								lIs it correct to bring in stereotypes such as progressive Bengali, orthodox Marwari, or urban marginalised Muslims into the discussion on Rizwanurs death? 																								Students  and teachers, too  from several colleges in Calcutta asked these questions and exchanged impassioned views at the students colloquium at Jadavpur University on Tuesday, organised by Ebong Alap, a voluntary organisation dedicated to publishing and initiating dialogues on social issues.																								For many institutions, it was the last working day before they shut down for the Puja.																								Teachers Supriya Chaudhuri and Rimi B. Chatterjee suspected that the whole truth may never be known, simply because there has already been too much tampering with the scientific and forensic evidence and because of the primitive nature of such investigations in the state. 																								Singer Mousumi Bhowmik was sad that the police should feel free to stride into the most private of an individuals spaces even when no law is being infringed on.																								Madhurima, a classmate and close friend of Rizwanur, promised to take the movement to Mumbai, when some rued the fact that the protests are still largely confined to Calcutta.																								A candlelight congregation has also been planned at India Gate, in New Delhi.																								Boycotting Lux Hosiery products was among the many suggestions that came up, for, as a JU student put it, Ashok Todi may make high-quality baniyans, but he is a vile man. 																								Students of JU  they hope to be joined by one and all  plan to take out a march from the university to Writers Buildings as soon as the Puja vacation is over. 																								From opening protest kiosks at Sealdah station to distributing leaflets and pictures of Rizwanur at the big pujas like Maddox Square, the students were full of ideas to stop the movement from losing steam during the festive week. Thats what the authorities want, dont they? asked one. 																								It seemed only fitting that halfway into the discussions  where, strangely, no one spoke of love  news reached that Calcutta High Court had ordered a CBI probe into the death that has brought Calcuttans closer to one another than anything has in a long time.

				 Italian trade wing for joint ventures
 															- Opera show and conclave next month SUBHRO SAHA																								It is important to encourage entrepreneurial contacts between the business communities of Italy and Bengal, and the Italian trade mission office, set to come up next month, will boost that effort, says Bruno Campria, the new consul-general of Italy in Calcutta.																								If we can create a conducive environment for good contacts and entrepreneurial joint ventures, bilateral trade will automatically follow. However, the first task is to increase reciprocal contacts and knowledge, Campria tells Metro.																								He identifies leather, food-processing, multimedia and hi-fashion as the core areas for possible joint ventures. We can later grow that sphere to include infrastructure and transportation, and next month, after the Calcutta office of the Italian Trade Commission starts functioning, this process will gather steam, he adds.																								The diplomat stresses the need to build on the momentum generated by Italian prime minister Romano Prodis visit to Calcutta in February. Prodi visited the city with a 400-strong delegation of Italian business captains, the largest ever trade team to have touched down here.																								Following the Prodi visit, an MoU was signed between the Italian Trade Commission, the Council for Leather Exports and Assomac of Italy, to set up a training and service centre in town. This project is co-financed by the Italian Trade Commission and the Union government.																								Another MoU was signed between the Confederation of Indian Food Trade amp; Industry and the Parma Association of Italian Industrialists. The aim of the MoU is to promote, improve and develop economic ties between the business communities trading in food in India and Italy.																								While an Italian opera is set to perform in the city on December 17, an Indo-Italian workshop in technological cooperation and investment will be the high point of the winter calendar, Campria points out.																								To be organised by the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce, the objective of the December 10 conclave is to enhance technological cooperation and investment between Italy and Bengal, with focus on information and communication technology, multimedia and design, both at the academic and industrial level.

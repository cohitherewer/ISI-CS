				 Special treat for shunned children
			Clowns entertain youngsters at the Oxford Mission event. Picture by Sanjoy ChattopadhyayaStanding on a makeshift stage under an overcast sky three-year-old Priti Mondal was reciting Akash jure megh koreche surji gelo patte. A while later little Simran Khatun and Priyanka Das swung to Hindi numbers and Supriya Mondal, Piyali Bag, Pinki Das, Munmun Haldar joined in a song for peacea magic show, antakshari, game stalls, food packets 																								So what was so special about this Childrens Day celebration at Oxford Mission in Behala? The programme organised by World Vision and the Church of North India on November 16 was for children infected with HIV or affected by the virus 																								True, Childrens Day was gone and the ground was soggy after the rains and there was no hip emcee for the show and there was little to eat till the end of the 10am-4pm event. But for the 350 children from units in New Alipur, Topsia, Tangra and Mehendi Bagan, this was a dream come true.																								They are more used to being shunned, thrown out of houses, hospitals and schools the moment their health status is known. Many of these children cannot get the medical treatment and cant study in schools.																								The Calcutta World Vision is a small team of six registered staff members. But they hope to provide assistance to as many children as possible. With the help of volunteers, many of whom are infected, the organisation also reaches out to drug addicts who are often exposed to HIV. 																								Night shelters for addicts and HIV infected, affected children are in the pipeline. In 2008 we are going to concentrate on child right advocacy which may really change things for these children, says Steve Lloyd Lee, the project co-ordinator of World Vision. 						SEBANTI SARKAR

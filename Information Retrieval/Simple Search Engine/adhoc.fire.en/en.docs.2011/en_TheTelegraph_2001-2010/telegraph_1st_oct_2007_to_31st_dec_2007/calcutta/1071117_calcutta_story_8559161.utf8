				 Cal connection 		Mad about science - A child admires a model displayed at the workshop organised by Mad Science, a Canada-based organisation, at Calcutta International School on November 10. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray				 				 																															Remember the sharp-tongued, rebellious schoolgoer in Bow Barracks Forever, who had a crush on neighbourhood boy Bradley? It was Sohini Pal (picture below), daughter of Tollywood actor, Tapas Pal. She was a school student herself when she did the film. She has studied in Pratt Memorial School and did her plus two from Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. At 16, she got an offer to act in Anjan Dutts film about the predominantly Anglo-Indian community of Bow Barracks in central Calcutta.				 				 																															She never thought that she would be doing films at such an early age. But her father appreciated her performance, as did the audience. We caught up with her in Bangalore where she is roughing it out at a PG accommodation as she does her MBA.				 				 																															Who inspired you as a child?				 				 																															My parents were my strength and inspiration. My mother was always very supportive while my father would pamper me whenever he could make time from his busy schedule. Was your mother a strict disciplinarian, then?				 				 																															(Laughs) Let me share something that was a regular affair at home. Whenever studies bored me, I would tell my mother that I wanted to go to the toilet. I would take a book with me to refresh my mind from the monotony of studies. Although she knew what I was doing, she never spoke about it. It was her way of pampering me.				 				 																															Was it your childhood dream to be an actress? 				 				 																															I wanted to be a doctor, specifically, a vet. I am a vegetarian and I am against the killing of animals. But when my dog passed away, my inclination to be a doctor declined. 				 				 																															Bow Barracks Forever happened when I was returning home from school one day. My father called me and asked me to meet Anjan uncle who wanted to see me about the film.				 				 																															How was your experience while working in the film?				 				 																															It was fun. I also learnt a lot. Bow Barracks has given me the confidence to take on more projects. But I will always depend on my father to select the right film for me if I take up acting in future.				 				 																															Have you faced any major hurdles in your career?				 				 																															Hurdles are nothing but stepping stones to a better life. Life has been very good and I am enjoying every moment of it.				 				 																															What does it take to be successful in life?				 				 																															Hard work, dedication, confidence and a good nights sleep are the primary ingredients for success. But then, success is not a destination but a journey towards a better life.				 				 																															What is more important for you: destiny or destination?				 				 																															You choose your own destination, on which depends your destiny. Certain things remain constant in life, and cannot be manoeuvred around.				 				 																															Do you think there is a price to be paid for success?				 				 																															For me, the price was the balancing act I had to do constantly between my studies and shooting for the film. But both have helped me. 				 				 																															Your advice for the generation ahead.				 				 																															Be grounded and focussed. Make up your mind about what you want to do in life.				 				 																															Where do you want to see yourself ten years down the line ?				 				 																															I would like to be financially independent. I think that is very important for girls.				 				 																															Dont you miss Calcutta while staying in Bangalore?				 				 																															Of course. Calcutta is like oxygen for me. It sustains me when I go back to Bangalore.				 				 																															Anindya S. Ray				 				 																															The Diary				 				 																The Sunset				 				 																The local priest is dead tired. 				 				 																															His countenance will change very soon. 				 				 																															Bits of metal fly past him, 				 				 																															And lodge in the farmers heart. 				 				 																															The land is wet, the air pungent. 				 				 																															You say the acrid smoke fills your chambers. 				 				 																															Why do you say it hurts you, 				 				 																															When it hurts them the most? 				 				 																															The cattle stand dazed in the fiery fields. 				 				 																															Someday they will return, 				 				 																															To their valleys and their farms. 				 				 																															When hopes and metal shields melt. 				 				 																															Is the sun then truly rising, my friend? 				 				 																															It is, but on a tainted sky. 				 				 																															It is a sky that carries the thoughts released 				 				 																															By destroyed brains in the fields. 				 				 																															Has the Stoneman then come back? 				 				 																															I am waiting patiently for the sun to rise, 				 				 																															When the last of these insects will go to their deaths, 				 				 																															Before the law in the middle of the night.

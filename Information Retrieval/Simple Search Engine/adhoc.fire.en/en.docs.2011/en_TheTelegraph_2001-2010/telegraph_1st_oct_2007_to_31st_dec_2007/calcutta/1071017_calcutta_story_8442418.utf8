				 Kudos in courtroom
 															- Tradition of silence broken by spontaneous slogans hailing verdict A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rukbanur Rahmans wife leaves the high court, happy with the order of a CBI probe. Picture by Amit Datta																								A century-old tradition of Calcutta High Court was broken by a rare show of popular support for a ruling on Tuesday afternoon. Close to 500 people thronging the courtroom of Justice Soumitra Pal shouted Darun, darun and clapped loudly after a CBI probe was ordered into the Rizwanur Rahman case.																								High Court judges and lawyers were amazed at the spontaneous outpouring of emotion that drowned the strict code of conduct in a courtroom, where only the judges and lawyers have a right to break the silence. Justice Pal seemed taken aback by the cheers as he waited for silence to return in the courtroom before signing the order.																								There was no curbing the decibel levels outside the courtroom, with hundreds waiting for the verdict on the stairs leading to the courtrooms. As soon as word was out, slogans of Thank you, high court and CBI inquiry zindabad filled the court premises, where such an act is prohibited.																								On Tuesday, however, police turned a deaf ear to the slogans of support. When a group of lawyers urged a constable to take action, he retorted: Amar ki matha kharap hoyechhey, oder thamate jabo?																								At the high court gates, the man of the moment was Kalyan Banerjee, the lawyer representing the Rahman family. Thousands of people will bless you, Banerjee. Everyone was wanting a CBI probe, said many men in black.																								Standing next to Banerjee, Rukbanur Rahman, Rizwanurs elder brother, allowed himself a smile. I was very nervous and was constantly praying for a CBI probe. My heart was beating so fast. Now, there is hope.

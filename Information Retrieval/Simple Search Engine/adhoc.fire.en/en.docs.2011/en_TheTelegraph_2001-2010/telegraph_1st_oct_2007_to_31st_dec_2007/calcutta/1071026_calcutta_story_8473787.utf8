 We Ask You Answer				 Wanted: facilities amp; faith
 Todays question: Will the Nehru Cup victory revive football in the city?									Sukumar ghosh,
																		Mukundapur																																																																			The revival of football in the city depends on the upgrade of infrastructure of the clubs and on competent coaches. We should also remember that some of the players come from needy families. In such cases they should be given full financial support by the clubs governing body. The clubs should also take precautionary measures to stop pilferage of funds by dishonest members of the managing committee. 					Suparna Sengupta,
					Dum Dum
									 With the Nehru Cup victory, Indian football has definitely taken a step forward. Just as every failure opens a new road to success, every hard-earned win strengthens the will to win. Thus the Nehru Cup victory will definitely strengthen the games fan following. 																		Kunal Karmakar,
									 Dum Dum Park									 It is difficult to believe that a country of one billion people cannot produce a football team that can represent it at the international stage. The sight of Bhaichung Bhutia lifting the Nehru Cup would definitely revive the spirit of football in the city that has produced some of the best legs on the football field. Even today there is an aspiring Pele or an aspiring Maradona in every lane in Calcutta. 																																																														Indranil Sanyal,
																																																													 Dhakuria																																																														Yes. Indias success in the international arena has come after a span of 37 years. Our last hurrah was the bronze medal in the Asian Games in 1970 and a third position in the Mardeka soccer tournament the same year. Stars like Bhaichung, Mehraj and Deepak Mondal will now soak in the million adulatory glances that are being showered on them. This victory will help increase the popularity of the game and enthuse the youth to concentrate on football and not cricket alone.									

Manash Kumar Das,
																		Behala																																																														One victory does not necessarily mean that the winning streak will continue. This win may help in boosting the citys fervour for the game but a lot more is needed to restore its dying charm.									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
																		Behala																																																														Its difficult to say if the spirit of the game will be revived in the city after this victory. Massive financial assistance from the government, extensive training, and optimum utilisation of players are required.																																																														Nidhi Poddar,
																																																														 Salt Lake 																																																														 Indian football is indeed reviving after the glorious victory at the ONGC Nehru Cup. But it will still take time to revive the game. 																		ATIF AYAZ,
																		Serampore
																																																																																																																											 Football is definitely the most watched game in the city and the Nehru Cup victory along with the success of Chak De India! will definitely work as a morale booster for games other than cricket. The time has come for Indian football to shine. Its only a matter of time before we see the new face of football in the city. 									

B.N.Bose, 
																		Dum Dum																																																														It will create an interest and craze amongst our football fans to gather in much more numbers to witness our top teams in the league matches this year. Considering this aspect, it can be hoped that the Nehru Cup victory will revive football in the city. However, football players should be provided better monetary benefits like cricketers. Football grounds, galleries and other kinds of infrastructure must also be improved to revive football in the city. Even Salt Lake stadium needs betterment in all aspects. After all, we are talking of a game that is intrinsic to the citys culture for decades. 									

Satyen Biswas,
																		Behala																																																														It is difficult to predict if the Nehru Cup victory will revive the spirit of football in the city. It was decades ago that we won the last tournament and the gap is not merely in time alone. In my opinion the revival will be tough to achieve.									

Ratan Kumar Halder, 
																		Behala																																																														I do not think so. Boys who are bent on playing cricket will not change the game they play for this victory in football. Cricket is being played even in the alleys. The impact of Sourav Ganguly is stronger than Bhaichung in the youths mind. To grow the interest of football in the city our government should create proper infrastructure and spend more to attract boys to soccer. 									

Sourish Misra, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														It is a great news for every football lover. The authority should also improve the infrastructure of national football by creating new football grounds and maintaining the old ones with greater care. They should also take initiative to spot young talent from rural India and train them. 									

Biman Saha, 
																		Lake Town																																																														Though the Indian football team under the coaching of Bob Houghton deserves kudos for its victory in the Nehru Cup, I think this single win will not revive football in the city because there are only three-four players from the local clubs who have represented the national team. It is quite unfortunate that only club football dominates in our country. But hopefully we will see the national team scripting more and more such wins. 									

Prasenjit Das, 
																		Jadavpur																																																														Yes, definitely. Pradeep and his mates have proved that we will win bigger tournaments if we get proper guidance. Under the supervision of the foreign coach, more young players should be spotted. 									

P. Pramanik, 
																		Santoshpur 																																																														Curbing politics in the football arena is the only answer to make India qualify in international competitions. Low remuneration to the team members is another cause for under-par performance. The match fee should be awarded on the basis of performance. 									

Sovan Mridha, 
																		Sonarpur																																																														I hope this memorable victory will revive football in our city. The football clubs in our city should play an important role by creating appropriate infrastructure to encourage players. Eventually, our city will show the way to Indian football. 									

Rathin Chatterjee, 
																		Dum Dum																																																														Lack of confidence of the Indian football team was a cause for defeat against foreign teams. But this win under foreign coach Bob Houghton has inspired the whole team and given it self-confidence. So positive attitude and optimism are what the Nehru Cup victory means for us. 									

Nishith Mitra, 
																		Mahinagore																																																														The Nehru Cup victory, no doubt, will inspire football players but there is little immediate hope to resurrect the plummeting standards suffered during past 14 years. Indias place in the FIFA ranking has slipped from 100 in 1993 to 151 position in 2007 which means losing on an average more than three ranks per year. The Nehru Cup victory provided some consolation which, of course, is required for revival. But more important factors are sustained motivation, efforts and training under competent coaches conversant with latest international techniques. This virtually seemed to be absent in Indian context. Revival of a game requires not any wishful and wayward endeavour, but concerted effort.									

Gitanshu Naskar,
																		Domjur, Howrah																																																														Just as one swallow does not make summer, one big victory will not revive football overnight.But we must not be pessimistic. The victory will surely inspire footballers and football-lovers. 									

Prahlad Agarwala,
																		Majdia, Nadia																																																														Calcutta is hailed as the Mecca of Indian soccer. The scintillating triumph of the national football team, the spirits will definitely be upbeat all round.									

Pankaj Bhatia, 
																		Loudon Street																																																														The Nehru Cup win will bring back crowds at the Salt Lake Stadium where football is being watched in challenging conditions.

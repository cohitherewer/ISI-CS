				 JNU rout delinked from Nandigram
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The CPM-backed Students Federation of India (SFI) is busy delinking its reverses in the Jawaharlal Nehru University students union polls from the Nandigram issue, in the run-up to elections in a host of Calcutta colleges.																								Our organisational weakness on the Delhi campus had led to the defeat, not Nandigram, said a senior SFI leader.																								Political observers had attributed SFIs rout at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) to the March 14 police firing in Nandigram, in which 14 villagers were killed.																								SFIs rivals in the state  the students wings of the Congress and Trinamul Congress  are gearing up to capitalise the Delhi rout in the upcoming polls at Calcutta University and its affiliated colleges.																								But Koustav Chatterjee, the secretary of SFIs Calcutta district committee, is confident that the SFI setback will not have any impact on Calcutta polls.																								Students union elections in Bengal are not fought on any single issue. As for the Delhi loss, we will explain the real reasons to the students, added Chatterjee.																								The organisation  which controls the unions in 86 of the 115-odd institutions in the city  has decided to focus on academic issues in the campaign.																								Better educational facilities and job guarantee for students are among the key issues the SFI will highlight.																								Whatever be its campaign plank, SFI will face the same consequence here as at JNU if they dare justify Nandigram, said Sourav Chakraborty, the state president of the Congress-backed Chhatra Parishad.																								We have started painting posters and coining slogans highlighting the SFIs declining popularity at premier institutions like Jadavpur University, Presidency College and JNU, Chakraborty added.																								The SFI might claim that the JNU rout was due to organisational loopholes, but politically aware students here will not buy it, said a student of Calcutta Universitys Ballygunge Science College.																								The defeat in the JNU elections is a fresh blow for the SFI, which is already smarting under the reverses at Jadavpur University and Presidency College, said a student of a central Calcutta college.

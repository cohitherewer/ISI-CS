				 Public-private pact in scheme for poor
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A fund for the poor and the marginalised, under a public-private initiative, has been going strong for more than a year.																								Innovative Challenge Fund, a part of the Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor (Cusp), has 51 NGOs working with the government to carry forward the mandate of urban management and catering to the poor.																								The programme covers 38 municipalities and two municipal corporations, excluding the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.																								Areas like Mahestala, Uttarpara, Budge Budge and Kalyani dont have the basic health and education facilities, said Udita Ghosh Sarkar, the fund manager.																								The fund has two windows  one for capacity building of various agencies involved in the project and the other for implementation of the project, she added.																								Innovative Challenge Fund is aimed at the urban poor and marginalised groups, including women, socially excluded groups, socially disadvantaged groups, pavement-dwellers and challenged children.																								The fund  which operates on the theory that arrangements between private groups and the common people yield better results than the institutional delivery system  facilitates projects for livelihood development, income generation, health and education. It tries to improve water supply infrastructure and promote low-cost solutions for sewage disposal and sanitation.																								A year into its operation, the programme has helped women to form self-help groups, enrolled children in non-formal education programmes, streamlined sewage disposal, generated livelihood opportunities and undertaken environment protection projects.																								Cusp, a multi-sector urban reforms programme, was started in 2003 by the state governments municipal affairs department with funds from the UK-based Department for International Development.																								The budget for the initiative is Rs 740 crore for eight years (2003-2011). The programme aims at improving urban planning and governance, enhancing access to basic urban services for the poor and promoting pro-poor economic growth.

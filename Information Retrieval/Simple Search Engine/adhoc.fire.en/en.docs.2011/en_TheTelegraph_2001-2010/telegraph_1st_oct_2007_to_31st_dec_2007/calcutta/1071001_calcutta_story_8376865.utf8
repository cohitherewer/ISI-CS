				 Prayers but no Priyanka
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rizwanurs sister (centre) reads from the Quran on the 10th-day rituals of his death on Sunday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								The Rahmans of Tiljala Lane on Sunday observed the 10th-day rituals of Rizwanurs mysterious death. Everyone close to the family turned up, recited from the Quran and prayed for his soul. Only his widow Priyanka Todi was missing.																								Hoping against hope, the Rahmans waited for her from early morning, when the relatives started turning up. Priyanka was the person closest to my son. I hoped she would come to pray for his soul. But she didnt. I think she was not allowed to come, said Kishwar Jahan, Rizwanurs mother. 																								She held her sons photograph to her chest and broke down several times during the rituals. Nothing can compensate for the loss. Those behind my sons death should be punished. I want justice from the authorities, said Kishwar, before lying down on the bed.																								In the adjacent room, the women and children were reciting from the Quran and offering namaz. The male relatives went to the graveyard where Rizwanur was buried and prayed there.																								We prayed that his soul may rest in peace in heaven. We are hopeful that Priyanka will at least contact us on the last day of mourning, said Rukbanur, Rizwanurs elder brother.																								As part of the ritual, the poor were fed and they, too, offered prayers for Rizwanur. Almost everyone present felt that had Priyanka been allowed to leave her fathers Salt Lake house, she would have definitely dropped by at Tiljala Lane. The familys faith in her has not been shaken by the trials of the past 10 days. 																								Priyanka belongs to this family and she can come back with full dignity anytime she wants to. Well welcome her and give her the necessary support. She will not have any problems, said Kishwar.																								Priyanka had stayed with us for eight days and knows how our family treated her, said Zahida Rahman, Rizwanurs sister-in-law.																								Many relatives, including, Rizwanurs uncles, are not sure that Priyanka will come back to stay with the family. From the little that we saw of her, it seemed that she is very strong-willed, but I doubt whether she will be able to come back, said Akilur Rahman, an uncle of Rizwanur.

				 Power play, realty role 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The money-and-muscle trail the CBI is tracing from Tiljala Lane to Salt Lake passes through murky land deals and power play.																								We have found the names of a few real-estate promoters and have even identified some of them. We are digging deep, said Arun Kumar, the joint director of the CBI who is leading the probe into the Rizwanur Rahman death case. 																								At the centre of it all is Hassan Ali, the man from Palm Avenue with his roots in Shamsul Huda Road, who is believed to have played a part in trying to separate Rizwanur and Priyanka Todi.																								Hassan was a small-time promoter till a few years ago. His fortunes changed dramatically after he aligned with a businessman with strong CPM contacts. He shifted from Shamsul Huda Road to Palm Avenue and became a powerful figure in the locality, said a resident of the area.																								Hassan would flaunt his proximity with the powers-that-be and control a lot of the illegal land deals in the area, he added.																								It was through his patron than Hassan came to share a close relationship with Ashok Todi. The Salt Lake-based businessman allegedly activated Hassan to get Priyanka out of Tiljala Lane at any cost.																								It appears that Ashok Todi went to Rizwanurs house only after Hassan told him that his men had failed to separate the two and that the matter was becoming increasingly complicated, said a sleuth.																								Hassan apart, the CBI has spoken to his younger brother Imtiyaaz  at 21 Shamsul Huda Road  and his construction superviser Abdul Majid. It was Majid who led the sleuths to Imtiyaaz and Hassan.																								The hunt, meanwhile, is on for Imran, one of Hassans key associates. Imran, who is absconding, had left Bright Street to live in Kasba but is now back somewhere in the area, said a sleuth.

				 Rising importance of iftar and after
 ZEESHAN JAWED 				 	 Politicians Kanti Ganguly and Mohammad Selim at an iftar in Calcutta. A Telegraph picture																								Mohammad Ahmed had iftar invitations from a Muslim politician, a Hindu businessman and a celebrity on Saturday evening. He could not decide which party to attend and ended up stopping over at all three. 																								Iftar diplomacy is catching on in Calcutta. According to an estimate, by the time Ramazan ends next weekend, over 65 high-profile parties will be held in the city, more than in any other year.																								Calcutta is following in the footsteps of New Delhi. Iftar is significant in the political circles in the Capital, says an iftar regular in Calcutta. In both places, the most-talked-about parties are the ones with bureaucrats and politicians on the guest list and lip-smacking Mughlai fare on the menu.																								Apolitical organisations also take the opportunity. Iftar offers a good opportunity of bringing communities together, said Rajendra Singh, a businessman who organised an all-faith iftar in Kidderpore on Saturday. 																								Sandeep Bhutoria, the secretary of Rajasthan Foundation, said: We held an iftar party for the first time this year to promote amity between Muslims and Marwaris.																								Business is the buzzword at some parties. Imran Zaki Siddiqui, a member of the Indo-Turkish Business Association, which organised a party in a five-star hotel on Sunday, said: It was an excellent opportunity to announce the organisations presence.																								Politicians use the iftar platform to the fullest. The leaders issue statements to the press and get photographed on the occasion. They also send out messages to specific sections of the population, said a central Calcutta MLA.																								This year, some politicians called up iftar organisers to ask them to schedule a speech. The politicians who do not speak, gather feedback at the parties. I always make it a point to attend iftars. It is a great place to gather information on the political situation, added the MLA.

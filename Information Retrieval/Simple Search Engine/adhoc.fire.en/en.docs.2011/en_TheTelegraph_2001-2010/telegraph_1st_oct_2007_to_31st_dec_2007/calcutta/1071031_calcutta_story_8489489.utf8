 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE				 	 A garbage dump on VIP Road. Picture by Soumen Bhattacharjee																								Stretches along Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue (VIP Road) have become a happy dumping ground for residents on both sides of the thoroughfare, and the local Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality as well. 																								Apart from causing visual pollution and stench, the garbage heaps are destroying greenery along the road.																								The 400-ft stretch near Kestopur on the airport-bound flank has become a huge garbage vat. The stench is unbearable and the dump is an eyesore, said Anirudhha Chowdhury, a resident of Prafulla Kanan, who has been running a campaign against the menace.																								A few yards from the stretch lies another vat of similar length, near Narayantala, on the flank leading to the city. A third stretch, overrun by solid waste on both sides of the road, is at Joramandir, near the Baguiati market.																								The municipality has ignored our pleas to clear up the stretches and prevent dumping of waste along the road, alleged Chowdhury.																								The civic authorities, however, claim that a space crunch in the Mathpara dump, in Baranagar, is forcing them to dispose of solid waste along VIP Road. The Mathpara dump, shared by four other municipalities, does not have enough space for the five tonnes of solid waste generated in our municipal area. Hence, some waste is disposed of along the road, said civic chairman Tapas Chatterjee.																								Officials in the municipalitys sewerage department blamed a nexus between a section of civic workers and residents.																								The municipality collects household garbage early in the morning. But several residents miss the service as they wake up late. They pay a few bucks to some civic workers, who collect the garbage after duty hours and dump it on stretches along the road, said the official.																								The illegal vats are also taking a toll on the roadside greenery. Several big trees on either side of VIP Road have withered away as the soil has turned toxic, said Sanjay Banerjee, a resident of Nazrul Park.

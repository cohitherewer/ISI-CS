				 Embers smoulder a week on
 															- PARK CIRCUS KEEPS TRACK OF TASLIMA SCHEDULE A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ripon Street erupts last Wednesday over Taslima Nasreens ouster. A Telegraph picture																								Tension is still palpable in the Park Circus area a week after it was rocked by violence, though voices condemning last Wednesdays arson are also being heard.																								We will never accept Taslima Nasreens stay in India in general and Bengal in particular, asserted Mohammed Shakir, 22, who has vowed to hit the streets again the moment the Bangladeshi writer is back in town. How could the Left Front government provide refuge to her? She has hurt the sentiments of our community.																								Shakirs friend Mohammad Naseem added: Every individual in the locality is opposed to Taslima.																								People in the Ripon Street-Beniapukur-Park Circus-Entally belt are quick to respond to any rumour about the writer. Shops on Ripon Street suddenly downed their shutters on Friday morning, following rumours that Taslima was coming back to Calcutta. Things, however, soon returned to normal. We are keeping track of every development about her, said a Ripon Street resident.																								If one section of local residents is still talking in terms of protest, there is another equally vocal against what had happened in the name of protest.																								True, there is discontent in the community over the Taslima issue, but one should not express it through violence. The entire community is earning a bad because of a handful of unruly elements, said Mohammad Anjum, a Ripon Street resident, who exports leather accessories.																								Last Wednesday, the All India Minority Forum had called for a road blockade at the seven-point crossing in Park Circus to press for Taslimas ouster from India and other demands. Soon, there was widespread violence, targetted mostly at the police, prompting the government to call in the army. An eight-hour curfew was imposed on the locality from 10pm on Wednesday.

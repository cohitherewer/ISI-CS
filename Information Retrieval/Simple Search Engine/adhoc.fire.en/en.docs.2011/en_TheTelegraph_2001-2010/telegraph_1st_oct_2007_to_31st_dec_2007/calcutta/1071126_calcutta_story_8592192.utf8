				 Constable in drunken swoon on VIP Road
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								A constable with the Calcutta Armed Police stepped out for an evening stroll after downing more liquor than he could handle and brought traffic to a standstill on VIP Road on Sunday evening.																								Around 6.30pm, I saw a man in khaki lurching along VIP Road. Suddenly, he tripped and fell on the Ultadanga-bound flank, said a witness, who was standing at the Baguiati-Hatiara crossing.																								The sudden fall of the man in uniform in the middle of the road threw Sunday traffic out of gear. The vehicles tried to pass in single file through the narrow corridor he had left free and it led to traffic chaos.																								As the situation worsened, some local men intervened, stopped the traffic and took away the unconscious man.																								He was not in his senses and couldnt say anything. He was reeking of alcohol, said Subhendu Bagui, a local businessman. 																								From the mans pocket, Subhendu and his friends fished out an identity card and got his details  Biswadev Majumdar, 28, constable (No. 15838) of Calcutta Armed Police. 																								We sprinkled water on his face and after some time, he opened his eyes. He tried to stand on his feet, but couldnt, said Bagui, who informed Baguiati Traffic Guard about the incident. A team from the traffic guard arrived and took away Majumdar. 																								We are trying to contact his seniors and his family. We do not know whether he was on duty. We will check what took him to that area, said an official of the traffic guard. 																								It took 45 minutes for traffic on the city-bound flank of VIP Road to return to normal.

				 Marriage over, fear moved in
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rizwanur Rahman and Priyanka Todi had planned to leave for Delhi or Mumbai on August 31, the day she left her parents house in Salt Lake to stay with her husband in Tiljala Lane.																								Priyanka knew that her father Ashok Todi would create problems after he found out about the marriage. They were scared and decided to leave the city the same night, Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur told Metro.																								His family convinced the couple to stay and asked Priyanka to speak to her father over the phone, he added. We thought the police would register a kidnapping case against all of us. We told her that she had not done anything illegal and should not run away. 																								Todi was shocked when Priyanka told him over the phone that she had married Rizwanur and asked her not to tell that to anyone. After he visited the Rahman house and failed to persuade his daughter to return to Salt Lake, the harassment and torture of the couple began.																								Rizwanur was afraid that his phone was being tapped by Lalbazar and used to make calls from public phones, said his brother.																								On the night before Rizwanur died, he had gone to sleep in his aunts house on Shamsul Huda Road. He was very scared after Priyanka was taken away by her parents with the help of the police and didnt even want to sleep in his house, said Rukbanur.

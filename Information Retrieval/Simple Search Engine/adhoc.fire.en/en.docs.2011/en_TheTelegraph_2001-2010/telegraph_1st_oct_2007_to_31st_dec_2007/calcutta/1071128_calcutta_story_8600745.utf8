				 Traffic in chaos for rally duo
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Two rallies threw traffic out of gear across central Calcutta on Tuesday afternoon.																								One, organised by the Anti-Imperialist Forum, started from College Square around 1.30pm and ended in front of American Center, on Jawaharlal Nehru Road. A protest meeting was held there, with participants blocking the road, said a police officer.																								Around 10,000 people joined the rally, marching down Nirmal Chunder Street and SN Banerjee Road, before hitting JL Nehru Road.																								While it was passing through SN Banerjee Road, a rally of Congress supporters arrived. Many participants lost their way, unable to make out which rally was theirs. With supporters running helter-skelter, it became difficult to control traffic, the officer added.																								The Congress supporters, who were marching from Bidhan Bhavan, on CIT Road, to protest Nandigram, gathered near Victoria House, where a meeting continued till well past five. The key junction was almost blocked in the evening rush hours, said an officer. The police claimed they had worked out diversions to keep traffic moving but that hardly helped.

				 Fresh JU storm brews
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 The sit-in at JU to protest the suspension of five students accused of ragging a junior. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								One protest is yet to die down, but murmurs of another are echoing in the corridors of Jadavpur University (JU).																								The students on Thursday threatened to launch an intense agitation to protest the inordinate delay  more than three months  in the publication of results. The authorities in 2003 had set themselves a deadline of 45 days for the declaration of results.																								On Wednesday evening, students of the engineering and science departments had gheraoed several officials, demanding withdrawal of the executive councils decision to suspend five students for ragging a junior. The gherao was lifted on Thursday morning after some officials fell ill.																								The JU authorities, however, are firm in their stand. The five students found guilty will be punished. The executive councils decision is final, said Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher and member of the council.																								On the results issue, Amit Chakraborty, a leader of the faculty of engineering and technology students union, said: We had repeatedly appealed to the authorities to regularise the publication of results. Our pleas have fallen on deaf ears.																								The students demand was placed before the executive council on Wednesday and all members agreed that prompt measures should be taken to publish the results within 45 days of the exams. The members observed that long-term measures are necessary to stick to the 45-day schedule, Biswas pointed out.																								Union leader Chakraborty said the authorities had decided on the 45-day schedule following a prolonged agitation in 2003. But the decision has never been implemented. We will be compelled to launch an intense movement if corrective steps are not taken soon, said Chakraborty.																								The worst sufferers are the final-year students, many of whom have to forego offers of high-salaried jobs as they cannot produce marksheets during interviews.

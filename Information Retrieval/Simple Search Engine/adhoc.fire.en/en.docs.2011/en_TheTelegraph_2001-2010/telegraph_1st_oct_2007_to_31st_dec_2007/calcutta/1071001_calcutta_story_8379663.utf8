 A STAFF REPORTER																								An eight-year-old Delhi girl, who fled her maternal aunts house in Calcutta after being allegedly tortured, was rescued by residents of Garpar on Sunday morning. NGO Cini Asha was awarded temporary custody of Sonu Parveen.																								The aunt had not lodged a missing complaint after Sonu ran away on Saturday night, said a police officer. Sonu told the police that she lived in the city with her uncle and aunt but could not specify where and what their names are.																								Sonu also did not say who had tortured her. They made me do a lot of housework. If I did not do the work well, I would be punished, she said. 																								We saw her around 10am. She was whimpering and trying to hide behind the gate of a house on Garpar Road. She could only tell us her name and that she was from Delhi, said Anjan Mukherjee, one of the residents who took the child to the police.																								A spokesperson for Childline, a forum of NGOs that the police had contacted, said: A bruise on the girls leg suggests that she was beaten up. But we will be able to confirm this only after a counselling session 																								Cini Asha will try to find out information about Sonus home in Delhi. She said that she lived near Jama Masjid with her parents  Mohammad Bappu and Shakila  and used to study in Class II of Dudhkuthi School.																								Sonu also said that one of her uncles, Lailakaka, ran an STD booth near Jama Masjid. She couldnt say when she had been brought to Calcutta.

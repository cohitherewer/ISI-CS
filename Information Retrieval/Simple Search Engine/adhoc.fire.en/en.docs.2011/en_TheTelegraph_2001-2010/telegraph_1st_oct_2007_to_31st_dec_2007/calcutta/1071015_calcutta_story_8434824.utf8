				 Fever refuses to go
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Suchitra Sen: Change in antibiotic																								Suchitra Sens condition has not improved, prompting doctors at Belle Vue Clinic to change the antibiotic for the third time on Sunday.																								She is still weak and running a mild temperature (99 to 100 degrees). We cant release her unless the fever subsides. She has also lost her appetite, said K.B. Bakshi, one of the doctors treating the screen legend.																								On Saturday night, Sen ran a 101-degree temperature. She was better on Sunday morning but the temperature soared again in the afternoon.																								Although her condition was stable, doctors were worried about the fever not subsiding despite antibiotics. She needs to be kept under observation for a few more days, said Bakshi.																								The doctors were, however, happy that for the first time since she was admitted to the nursing home on Tuesday night, Sen had a proper breakfast on Sunday. She had toast, a boiled egg and a banana and fruit juice. For lunch, she had over-boiled rice and fish curry, brought by daughter Moon Moon and granddaughter Riya.																								She told doctors she was very happy having eaten so much after so long, said a hospital source.																								Long courses of antibiotics have affected Sens taste buds, said a hospital source. We are allowing her to eat whatever she wants to.																								Security around Sen continued to be tight. Two private security guards and a policeman were posted on the seventh floor of the nursing home where Sen is being treated in a cabin. More guards are on the ground floor, keeping a watch on all those who came in and went out.

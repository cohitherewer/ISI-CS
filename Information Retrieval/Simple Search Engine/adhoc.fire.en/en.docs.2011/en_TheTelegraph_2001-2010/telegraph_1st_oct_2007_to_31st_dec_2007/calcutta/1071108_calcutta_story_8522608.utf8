Laxman took a break after the second innings of the Ranji Trophy to spend time with the young players of Ultra Plus Steel Balak Sangha School of Cricket at Bhowanipore on November 6. 				 				 																															Laxman, who is in town for the Ranji match at Eden Gardens, made a short visit to the south Calcutta cricket club that was inaugurated by Virender Sehwag on August 23. Three former Bengal stars  Gopal Bose, Devang Gandhi and Utpal Chatterjee  have come together to form the club, the only night coaching camp in the city. It was started on September 1 with 50 children. The camps USP lies in the five towers emitting 650 lux of light to illuminate the four practice pitches.  V.V.S.

It will also be a good experience for those who plan to take up the game seriously as day-night matches are common these days, said Laxman. 				 				 																															I thought of starting this camp because I bagan playing in the same club myself. It was then called Balak Sangha, Gandhi informed Laxman, as the latter was curious about the reason why the opening batsman had started the coaching centre. Cricket coaching at Balak Sangha, a first in south Calcutta, was started in 1981 by Gopal Bose, who was still playing club cricket at the time, and Snigdhangshu Sekhar Mitra (Tuntuda). The camp became defunct in the mid-1990s when Bose and Mitra quit the camp together.				 				 																															The number of students at the camp has increased to 150 now. There are eight coaches now. It has also tied up with a school to train its cricket team. 				 				 																															Anindya Shankar Ray				 				 																
	Best of them allTwenty-four young judges from South Point High School and MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School made a tough decision as they chose the three best pujas for the 9th MP Birla Foundation Puja Utkarsh Samman this year. The awards were introduced in 1999 by Priyamvada Birla.				 				 																															The youngsters (picture left) from the two city schools (18 from South point and six from MP Birla Foundation) had set out on Sashthi and Saptami evenings to select the best puja. 				 				 																															The Best Image Award was won by Lake Youth Corner, the Best Pandal Award went to 25 Pally Sarbojanin and the Best Ambience Award went to Behala Nutan Dal. Appreciation certificates in the three categories went to 22 Pally Sarbojanin (Best Image), Badamtala Ashar Sangha (Best Pandal), and Suruchi Sangha (Best Ambience). 				 				 																															A workshop for the student-judges was held a few days before the puja at the South Point High School auditorium. Besides the students, parents and teachers also attended the workshop. Artist Ramananda Bandopadhyay, scholar Purba Sengupta, and additional police commissioner Sivaji Ghosh, were present at the workshop to talk about issues like safety measures and the history of Durga Puja. This helped the young judges to choose the right pandal. 				 				 																															Anuradha Kar and Somdutta Mitra,

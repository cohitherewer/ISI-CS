 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The house off Ripon Street that caved in. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								A teenaged schoolgirl and her parents were killed when a portion of the Bedford Lane house they lived in collapsed in early on Sunday.																								According to the police, Giridhar Lal, 55, his wife Shikha, 45 and their daughter Kumari Kiran, 14, were killed instantly after the second floor of the house, off Ripon Street, fell on them around 4.15am. The couples son, Rakesh, lives in Topsia with his wife. His uncle, Bhagi Ram, suffered minor injuries.																								Local residents took them to National Medical College and Hospital, where the three were declared brought dead. 																								Shikhas mother Sebanti Devi came to visit the family on Sunday, not knowing about the accident. I hadnt seen them for a long time. Had I come earlier, I would have seen them for one last time, she cried.																								Rakeshs wife said: We were thinking of shifting my in-laws, since the house was in a bad state. We live in a single-room flat and couldnt accommodate them.																								The owner of the building, Hassan Mandal, lives in Bagnan, Howrah. We will ask him what safety measures he had taken. If he is guilty of negligence, action will be taken against him, said an officer of Park Street police station.																								The house was built more than 100 years ago but no one had tried to renovate it, said Farhad Ansari, a neighbour of the Lals.																								Mehrun Khatoon, another neighbour, said: Our rooms are in a terrible state. We are living in constant fear.																								Giridhar worked for Flurys, on Park Street. He had been shifted to T3 when it was opened. Bhagi Ram, too, works in T3.																								The section that collapsed housed the quarters of T3 employees. We have been staying in the house for 17 years, said Vinod Kumar Ram, Bhagi Rams son. A.K. Jain, the director of T3, however, said: We havent given the workers quarters to live in.																								Mohammad Salim, Ajit Panja, Somen Mitra and other politicians visited the spot and demanded that the employer provide compensation to the affected family. 																								Gorachand Mondal, the director-general (building) of the civic body, said: The house was declared condemned a long time ago.																								Keya Choudhury, an advocate, said: The onus of repairing and renovating such old and dilapidated houses rests with the owner, but they dont seem to be bothered and as a result, people have to pay with their lives.

				 Rain fuels wet Puja fears
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Thunderclouds on the Calcutta horizon on Monday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								The Met office on Monday warned of rain in Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal in the next 24 hours, raising fears of a wet Puja.																								There are also chances of heavy rain in a few pockets of Gangetic Bengal, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.																								The cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) that had formed over east-central Bay of Bengal on Saturday weakened after moving northwards on Sunday.																								But a low-pressure system formed over the north Bay, off the Bengal-Orissa coast, on Monday. We are expecting rain under its influence, said Debnath.																								The weatherman, however, was non-committal on whether there will be showers during Durga puja, starting Wednesday. We have to watch the low-pressure system closely before reaching a conclusion, Debnath explained.																								The cyclone season extends from October to December. During this period, low- pressure systems and depressions develop frequently over the sea. But the systems do not always head for Bengal, often veering off to Orissa or Andhra Pradesh, added a Met official.																								Calcutta was greeted by an overcast sky on Monday. A cool breeze brought relief from the humid heat of the past week.																								Todays sky showed signs of the low-pressure system. There was a heavy concentration of thunderclouds, which later drifted away in the breeze. There were scattered drizzles across the city, said a Met official.																								The weather office also warned of a strong south-easterly wind, with wind-speed of over 45 kmph, along the coast. The sea will be choppy.

				 Diabetes count up four-fold
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Diabetes cases in the city have gone up four times over the past three decades, a study has revealed.																								Around 11.5 per cent of Calcuttas population between 20 and 60 years of age are diabetic  four times the figure in the 1970s. The study also points out that more than six per cent of the people are in a pre-diabetic state and at a risk of being diabetics in the future.																								Type II diabetes (mostly found in adults), the commonest type, is on the rise because of growing sedentary lifestyle and consumption of refined high-calorie junk food, said Subhankar Chowdhury, the head of SSKM Hospitals endocrinology department. 																								He, however, said new medicines were coming to market to prolong the lives of beta cells, which produce insulin. The intake of insulin by a diabetic may go down.																								The three-day annual conference of the Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India, starting Friday, will discuss ways to prevent and tackle the disease. More than 2,000 doctors from India and abroad will speak on new research in the field, new medicines, the preventive power of yoga and dietary patterns.																								Experts say Indians are more vulnerable to diabetes than those in western or African countries. Indians have more fat and less muscles compared to people in the west or Africa, said Shashank R. Joshi, a consultant endocrinologist at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai. Fast food, lack of exercise and stress are other contributing factors. Samar Banerjee, of RK Mission Seva Pratishthan, said Type II diabetes is now being detected in children, too.

				 Rage vented on cars
				 	 A car burns during Wednesdays violence. A Telegraph picture																								On Wednesday, mobs looking for things to destroy stopped cars on the road and damaged them. Metro traced some of those at the receiving end...																								I was moving towards Bridge No. 4 from Park Circus in my Honda City when it got stuck in a snarl. Suddenly, I saw a mob running towards the car. When they got close, the rioters started to throw stones at the car. The windscreen and the windows were smashed. The inside of the car was also damaged.																								The rioters took out their anger on the vehicles. The garage has handed me a bill of Rs 1 lakh for repairs.																								Imran Khan,
																							 Airline executive.																								I was on the way home when my Tata Sumo was attacked on Bridge No. 4. There was a sea of people around the vehicle. They pelted stones at the car and hit it with sticks. The car is severely damaged, with no front and back light.																								Even the inside has been damaged. I was stunned by the behaviour of the mob. I have never seen anything quite like this.																								Sheikh Ali,
																							 Barasat.																								We were transferring one of our cars, a black Maruti Swift, from our showroom in BBD Bag to our Topsia outlet. The car was stopped near the Park Circus crossing by rioters. A mob set it on fire. It is charred. 																								Sumita Majumdar,

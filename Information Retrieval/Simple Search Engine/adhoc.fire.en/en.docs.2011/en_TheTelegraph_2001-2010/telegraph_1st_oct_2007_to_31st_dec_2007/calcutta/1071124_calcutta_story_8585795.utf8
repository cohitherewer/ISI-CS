				 Body shield to beat riots
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Missiles from the rioters have sent the cops shopping. 																								Calcutta police bought special equipment to rein in frenzied mobs on Thursday, the day after the riots.																								The equipment will help us to take on rioters, declared police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti on Friday. Wearing the body protectors, our men can enter the lanes and bylanes without fearing the missiles that are thrown at them.																								On Wednesday, the rioters had kept the police out of the narrow lanes by continuously throwing bricks and bottles at them. Twenty members of the Special Action Force (SAF), clad in the black body protectors and with fibre sticks in hand, marched near the Ripon Street-AJC Bose Road crossing  the epicentre of the violence  before Fridays prayers. Policemen and army jawans accompanied the SAF personnel. 																								The men look fearsome in the new jacket and are protected from head to toe. They can advance towards rioters without suffering any injury. Unlike a lathi, the stick is light and will not cause injury, said joint commissioner (armed police) Zulfikar Hasan.																								We were clueless on Wednesday. With the new equipment, we will be in a much better position to deal with violent mobs, said a senior officer at Lalbazar. 																								The new equipment will be given to 100 SAF members, nominated by their seniors. 																								SAF is a specialised force and is trained to tackle crises. The gear the men are getting is used in advanced countries to disperse unlawful assemblies, added the officer.																								According to him, policemen in other metros are being given similar equipment.																								Army withdrawn																								Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said on Friday that the army was being withdrawn from the city. 																								Action will be taken against those who instigated Wednesdays violence, he added. There are no reports of extremist organisation SIMIs involvement in the matter.																								Deputy commissioner (south) Jawed Shamim said: Peace has prevailed in the affected areas. Police are patrolling there.

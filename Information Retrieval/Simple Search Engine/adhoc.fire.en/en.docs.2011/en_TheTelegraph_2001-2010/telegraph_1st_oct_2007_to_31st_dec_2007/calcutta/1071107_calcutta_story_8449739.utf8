				 Reliance matrix in revival of market
 															- Civic body handed responsibility timetable DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND SAMBIT SAHAFor every step Reliance takes on revamping the Park Circus market, it wants to legally bind the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to taking the preceding step.																								The company, wiser after political opposition slowed down its retail rollout in Bengal, has handed the civic body a document spelling out both partners responsibilities before it signs the memorandum of agreement (MoA) for the market project.																								The responsibility matrix  of which Metro has a copy  is meant to be a legal contract binding each partner to a series of time-bound, choreographed steps so that the project proceeds smoothly. (See chart)																								For instance, the CMC must finalise the site for interim rehabilitation of the current stall and shopowners before the MoA is signed. Once the signing is done, it must hand the site over to Reliance by the seventh day and, in turn, is guaranteed a rehab plan by the 15th day, which it must clear within a week.																								The document makes it clear that evacuating the traders is the civic bodys responsibility. It gives the CMC 30 days to hand over the vacated market after the company has completed building structures for interim rehabilitation.																								Reliance gave a presentation on interim rehabilitation arrangements before the civic brass on Monday. 																								The company bagged the Rs 30-crore contract in June 2007 but the final agreement with the CMC is yet to be signed. Reliance sprang the matrix in the first week of October as last-minute additions to the negotiations, civic officials said.																								Left Front partner Forward Bloc is opposed to Reliances entry into farm products retail and also to the company getting the Park Circus civic market revamp project.																								Reliance is aware of these developments and so, wants a commitment that there will be no obstructions and delays, a source said.																								The matrix comes within weeks of Reliance sacking 400 employees after its Rs 2,000-crore farm products retail plan hit a political roadblock. The firm had cited an uncertain business situation as the reason for the sudden downsizing.																								Yes, Reliance has submitted it (the timetable) and discussions are on, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said.																								Reliance officials declined comment when asked what the fate of the deal might be if the civic authorities demanded changes to the matrix. The buzz at the CMC headquarters, however, is that the MoA will be signed by the end of November.

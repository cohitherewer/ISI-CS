				 More silence zones ahead
 JAYANTA BASU 																								Key stretches of roads and the neighbourhood of all educational institutions in Calcutta and the rest of the state should be made silence zones, the state-level noise monitoring committee has recommended.																								The committee members felt that stretches of roads in the city, where educational institutions, hospitals and other important establishments are located, should be silence zones, said environment secretary M.L. Meena, the chairman of the committee.																								The committee also decided that the area within a 100-metre radius around schools, colleges and universities in West Bengal should be declared silence zones, under the Noise (Regulation and Control) Act, 2000. 																								The roads that can become silence zones are Park Street (AJC Bose Road crossing to Jawaharlal Nehru Road crossing), Camac Street (AJC Bose Road crossing to Park Street crossing), College Street (BB Ganguly Street crossing to MG Road crossing) and those adjacent to SSKM Hospital. 																								Unnecessary honking, use of loudspeakers and firecrackers, and any activity that results in noise above 45 decibel are banned in silence zones. The surroundings of hospitals, courts and Raj Bhavan enjoy the status of a silence zone.																								Once the committees recommendations are cleared by the government, we will issue a notification regarding inclusion of the new areas under the silence zone category, said Meena.																								We have decided to ask motor-training schools to stress the issue of honking in their curriculum and start an awareness drive among schoolchildren, he added. 																								The state pollution control board is taking steps to ensure that noise norms are not violated during the Puja. Biswajit Mukherjee, the member-secretary of the noise monitoring committee and a senior law officer of the department, said: On all four days of the Puja, the control room in the board office will remain open from 4pm till midnight to register pollution-related complaints.

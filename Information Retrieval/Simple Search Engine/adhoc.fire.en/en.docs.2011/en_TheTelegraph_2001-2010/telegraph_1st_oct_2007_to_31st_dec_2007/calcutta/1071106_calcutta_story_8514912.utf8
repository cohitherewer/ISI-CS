				 Gate glitch hits Metro
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE																								Thousands of Metro Railway commuters are finding it difficult to enter or leave the stations because of problems in the automated gates.																								The automated gates at almost all the 17 stations are malfunctioning while processing both paper tickets and smart cards.																								Its a daily ordeal for the commuters. The gates meant for smart cards seldom function properly. The commuters are often forced to scream out to the Metro officials to come to the gate and help. This is a common sight at Central, Esplanade and Chandni Chowk, said Ranajit Basu, who works in an airline company with its office near Chandni Chowk.																								According to the passengers, those with multi-ride paper tickets face the same problem. It is common for these tickets not to be detected at the automated gates. The tickets then have to be returned to the counters for refund.																								Metro officials agree. We face a lot of problems with multi-ride tickets. Many passengers turn them in. We have to refund the value of the unutilised rides, said an official at the Girish Park Metro station.																								The automated gates were imported from France and are being used for a decade. We did not face any problems with the paper tickets, which were imported from France and later manufactured here, for years. But as we introduced the contact-less smart system by placing validators on top of the gates, the problems started, said an official of the Metro operations department.																								The smart card and paper ticketing systems work on different software and the problem is arising out of their mismatch, he added.																								The problem has become pronounced at Esplanade station, where software engineers are trying since last week to iron out the glitch. There are nearly 140 automated gates at Metro stations.																								Its true that some automated gates are not functioning properly in stations that handle a large number of passengers. We are in a transition phase and gradually shifting to contact-less technology. We expect to minimise the problem soon, said P. Dutta, the spokesperson for Metro Railway.

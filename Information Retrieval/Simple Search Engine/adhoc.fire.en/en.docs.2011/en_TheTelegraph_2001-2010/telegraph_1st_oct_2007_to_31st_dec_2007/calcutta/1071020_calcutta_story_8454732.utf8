				 Grenade in briefcase
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 The grenade found at Howrah station. Picture by Amit Datta																								A live grenade was found in an abandoned briefcase, believed to be an army jawans, lying near the taxi stand at Howrah station on Ashtami morning.																								Experts said the grenade  defused by a CID team  could have blown off a train compartment, killing hundreds.																								Police said an identity card in the briefcase bore the name of Inbatan Shinchu, of the 39 Battalion of Assam Rifles, based in Arunachal Pradesh.																								Besides the grenade and the identity card, the briefcase contained around Rs 8,900, a uniform and a cheque book. We are in touch with the army, said a senior officer of the Government Railway Police.																								Major Indrajit Ghosh, commanding officer of the 39 Battalion of Assam Rifles, confirmed that Shinchu is from his battalion. A probe has been ordered, he said.																								Panic spread across the station area soon after a few Railway Protection Force jawans found the briefcase next to the ATM counter of a nationalised bank, near the taxi stand, around 11.30am.																								The station premises were crowded as people from the suburbs were arriving in large numbers for a round of pandal-hopping on Friday.																								Soon after the CID team arrived, senior police officers, including a deputy inspector-general of police and the superintendent of railway police, held a series of meetings to beef up security at the station.																								From Saturday, more forces will be deployed to keep a strict vigil on the people entering or leaving the station. Sniffer dogs, too, will be pressed into service, said an official.																								Sleuths are trying to find out whether the briefcase was left behind accidentally or deliberately. The spot where the briefcase was found is always crowded. Had the grenade exploded, there would have been many casualties on the festive day, said a senior officer.

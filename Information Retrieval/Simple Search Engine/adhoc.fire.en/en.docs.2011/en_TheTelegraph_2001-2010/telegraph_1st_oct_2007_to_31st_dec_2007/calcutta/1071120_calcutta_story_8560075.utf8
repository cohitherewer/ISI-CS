		 Tapestries and weaves of a rich culture																																	Artistic Stitchworks is an attempt by Biswajit Mukhopadhyay to showcase the Kantha style of embroidery which is native to Bengal. Mukhopadhyay has studied the different tribal groups to find the roots of all elements present in this style of stitching that is immensely popular in the state and elsewhere till date. Besides what is available to him, Mukhopadhyay has endowed his creations with the stamp of his personality, making them original and individualistic. The works depict pictorial motifs drawn from Bengals cultural history, and sometimes he makes the motifs overlap to create an abstractness born out of concrete, distinguishable images. His use of texture and colour shows his comprehension of this art form as well as its rich cultural context  the works become a confluence of various styles of folk and popular art.

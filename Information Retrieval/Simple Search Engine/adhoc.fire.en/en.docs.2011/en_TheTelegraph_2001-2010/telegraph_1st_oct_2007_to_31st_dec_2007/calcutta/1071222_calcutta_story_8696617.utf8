				 Group of 11 misses flight twice

 OUR BUREAU 
																								Eleven Calcutta-bound passengers missed a flight in Chennai twice on Thursday evening  once for reporting late and then for a technicality.
																								According to airline sources, 13 passengers had arrived late for the Calcutta flight from Meenambakkam Airport. Amid much drama at the airport, two of them managed to take the flight back to Calcutta while the other 11 had to spend the night in Chennai. 
																								Though all the passengers reached around 15 minutes beyond reporting time, two were issued boarding passes and allowed to take the flight. But after that, the airline stopped issuing boarding passes that denied the remaining 11 in the group the chance to fly. 
																								But a snag forced the flight to return to the Chennai airport soon after taking off and a base manager of the airline issued boarding passes to the 11 passengers, as the flight was held up in the airport for around two hours.
																								When the pilot objected to any fresh boarding, it was the second miss of the evening for the 11. The pilot cited the rule that no-show passengers, who miss flight for reaching late, cannot be accommodated on the aircraft.
																								According to a Deccan source, the base manager erred by issuing the boarding passes after the flights return.
																								Though the passengers insisted that they had to reach Calcutta urgently, they were forced to stay back in Chennai on Thursday night. Deccan officials tried to put them on a Kingfisher flight, but it was already booked to capacity. 
																								Deccan provided for their accommodation and they finally took the airlines morning flight back to Calcutta.

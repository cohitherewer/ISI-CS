				 Dream test: Blank question paper
 															- Twice-deferred B.Ed examination cancelled because of goof-up OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 BLANK CHECK: Examinees display the blank question papers for Wednesdays B.Ed test. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Calcutta Universitys B.Ed examination on Wednesday had to be cancelled after the authorities distributed blank question papers to the candidates.																								The test for teaching methods in economics and civics, twice postponed earlier, will now be held on October 8.																								The examinees erupted in protest on seeing the question paper that comprised blank pages, barring the first sheet containing instructions.																								This shows how callous the university authorities are. This is the third time since August that the exam has been postponed, said Debananda Chakraborty, an examinee from Loreto College.																								Debananda, settled in Mumbai after marriage, had come to the city to sit for the exams. She was to fly back to Mumbai on Thursday, but has to stay on till October 8.																								Kajal Banerjee had enrolled for the B.Ed course after taking leave from a Hooghly school, where he teaches. The deferment has left me in a spot. I wont be able to rejoin work till the exam is over, he said.																								After news of the faux pas reached the universitys administrative hub on College Street, senior officials went into a huddle and decided to cancel the exam. In the evening, the authorities announced the new date.																								A committee will be set up to probe the mistake. Action will be taken against those found guilty, said Debashis Biswas, the deputy controller of examinations.																								The B.Ed exams were scheduled to start on August 3, but had to be deferred to September 10 because of a court case. In the revised schedule, the paper on teaching methods in economics and civics was slated for September 25. But the test could not be held that day because of rain and was postponed to October 3.

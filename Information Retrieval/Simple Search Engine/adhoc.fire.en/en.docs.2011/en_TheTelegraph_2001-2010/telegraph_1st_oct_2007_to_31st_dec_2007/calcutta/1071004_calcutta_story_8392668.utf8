				 Groom acquitted
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Bidhannagar court on Wednesday acquitted Manoj Jaiswal of the charge of abducting his wife. The charge was brought by his father-in-law.																								The order followed a report by the police that Manoj, a Howrah resident, was not guilty of the charge, said public prosecutor Anjan Chowdhury.																								Dollys father Chandra Prakash Tulsyan, a Salt Lake-based businessman, had complained to the police that Manoj had abducted his minor daughter and married her. 																								The charge was proved false. Dollys school-leaving certificate showed that she was an adult and she told the police that she had married Manoj of her own will.																								The police also obtained the courts consent to submit a prosecution report against Tulsyan for filing a false complaint, a non-cognisable offence under Section 211 of the IPC.																								Once the police file the report, which is equivalent to a chargesheet, Tulsyan will be summoned for questioning, said an officer.

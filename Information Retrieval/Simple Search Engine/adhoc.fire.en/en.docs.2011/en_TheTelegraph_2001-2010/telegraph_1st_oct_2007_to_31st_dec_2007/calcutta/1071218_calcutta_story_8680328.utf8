				 Murder ring price-less

 A STAFF REPORTER
 The ring for which Shyama Prasad Roy was gagged, tied-up and murdered at his Tollygunge residence would not have fetched even a fraction of the Rs 1 crore that the 54-year-old advocate always claimed it was worth.
																								The trail of the missing ring, the only motive for the murder on August 14, has led police to dealers who claim the ring has no antique value and is not worth more than Rs 1,000. Roy was murdered by four men to whom he had boasted about the ring but refused to sell it.
																								The advocate would claim that he had a diamond ring with a magnifying lens fitted to the metal part. Tiny images of gods from the Hindu pantheon were encrypted on the diamond, he would add.
																								Roy had created a hype about the ring, as he probably wanted to sell it big. The claims that it was an antique and was worth close to a crore attracted a number of buyers and dealers. They wanted to get the ring valued by experts, but Roy refused, Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said on Monday.
																								On August 17, three days after the killing, the police had recovered the decomposed body of the advocate from his flat.
																								The call-records of the victims cellphone helped the police to track down the four accused who had been hired to kill Roy and steal the ring.
																								The mastermind from Howrah, identified as Sanjay, managed to give cops the slip and the ring could not be traced.
																								Sanjay had been visiting several dealers with the ring. We came to know about a man Sanjay had contacted. The dealer told us he had examined the ring and found no diamond. He said it was an ordinary ring made of brass, bronze and a small percentage of gold, said an officer. The four arrested men confessed that Sanjay had promised them Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 for the job. 
																								Sanjay was confident that he would get close to a crore by selling the ring. But then the dealers told him that the ring would not fetch more than Rs 1,000, the officer added.

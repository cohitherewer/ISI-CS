				 Stay sought on fee order 
 															- PLASTIC PERIL AT MEMORIAL  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 FACILITY SCARCE: Victoria Memorial. A Telegraph picture																								The Victoria Memorial authorities have moved the high court, seeking a stay on its directive to introduce a system of collecting a security deposit from visitors who enter the premises with plastic bags and bottles.																								The court had directed the Memorial authorities in September to collect Rs 100. The money should be refunded if the depositor leaves the compound with the plastic goods, stated the directive.																								The order was passed on a petition by environment activist Subhas Datta. He had shown the court pictures of the monument compound littered with plastic bags and bottles.																								The Memorial authorities say they do not have the infrastructure to implement the court directive. Collection centres will have to be built for the purpose but construction is not allowed at the heritage site. 																								The authorities stated that they would need at least 20 more staff members to start collecting the money. Employing new workers requires the Centres nod, said Datta. 																								In 2003, the West Bengal Pollution Control Board had banned the entry, use, sale and processing of plastic carry bags at heritage and tourist spots with immediate effect.																								The decision was taken after observing that the use of non-biodegradable plastic carry bags was leading to the accumulation of a huge quantity of garbage and contamination of water in such areas or in their vicinity.

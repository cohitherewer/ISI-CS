		 Creativity, colour and clarity in crystal																																	Weavers Studio Centre for Arts hosts its inaugural exhibition, Colour in Crystal, showcasing the hand-blown glass works of Srila Mukherjee. Few objects are as intimately connected to everyday life as the vessel. We use them to store, preserve and even offer as gifts. Mukherjees present body of work highlights the absolute necessity, and often ignored beauty of vessels. From a babys cup to the diyas placed at the feet of deities, from varied vases to the funerary urn, her present collection has it all. Mukherjee shows us how tastes can be differentiated through our preferences for these vessels and through our need of them; i.e., whether it is an aesthetic or a utilitarian need. Shape, mould and use are three words synonymous with the idea that she has put into creating these pieces of art. Her works can be distinguished by virtue of the method of creating  blowing. Traditionally understood to enclose, contain, give access, or transport, her vessels can be looked at as sophisticated reservoirs of creativity.

		 Espoused																																	Dance-drama Samavratee explores the various moods and feelings of Vishnupriya, the wife of Chaitanya, the golden avataar of Lord Krishna. Samavratee means one whose values are the same as those of her husband. Through Vishnupriyas frame of reference and reverence, we see the life, values and beliefs of this great philosopher. The choreographer has used the basic movements of Raibanshee, the martial dance form of Bengal, and Mayurbhanj Chhau from Orissa. It has episodes of Holi, Jhulan and Rasleela to depict aesthetically the equation between Vishnupriya and Chaitanya, and the extent of Chaitanyas devotion towards Krishna and Vishnupriyas towards Chaitanya. This dance drama has been conceived and choreographed by Bimbavati Devi.

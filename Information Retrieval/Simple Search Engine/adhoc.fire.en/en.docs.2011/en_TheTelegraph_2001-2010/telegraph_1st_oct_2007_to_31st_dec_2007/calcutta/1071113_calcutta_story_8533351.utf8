		 Layers of consciousness																																	Layers showcases works in hand-made paper by Anupam Chakraborty. The aim of this exhibition is to endow paper making in its rightful place amongst the more established genres of art. Chakraborty, after making the switch from print to paper making a decade ago, has not only shown amazing fidelity to this wonderfully sensuous ancient craft but is proactively engaged in digging out the evocative possibilities and establishing it as a valid contemporary medium of expression. Paper making as a craft relies heavily on the choice of fibres and the resultant colour and texture. Chakraborty uses this to his best advantage to arrive at ends that are amusingly multi-dimensional and layered. Some of the works like Walk with the Moon and In the Zoo have a narrative, while some like Creeper and Da Vinci Quote have famous motifs as their contexts. Still others like Creche (right) are endowed with the artists subdued humour and disarming candour. Chakraborty employs rag cotton fibre along with hand-made paper.

																								The civic authorities have finally woken up to the need for a big, organised parking lot near Park Circus Maidan, one of the most congested zones in the city.
																								Since no space is available for large-scale parking overground, chances are the city fathers will go underground to create the facility.
																								An inspection of the Park Circus Maidan  the venue for Book Fair 2008  by civic engineers revealed that the only space available for creating a parking lot, overground or underground, is on northern side, on Suhrawardy Avenue. The inspection, joined by police, was part of an initiative to identify parking space for Book Fair visitors. 
																								The area is badly in need of a big parking lot and we are considering both overground and underground options, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. Its too early to say whether the Park Circus car park will be modelled on the plaza under Lindsay Street.
																								Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said: We will invite expressions of interest after finalising the site. The car park will be constructed in a joint venture with private parties.
																								Civic engineers think the northern pavement of the Park Circus Maidan is least used by pedestrians, as it has been occupied by encroachers. At 10 ft below the ground, we can set up the largest parking zone in the city that can accommodate 400 cars, said an engineer.
																								If lifts can be installed in the middle of the Suhrawardy Avenue pavement and at its eastern and western ends, motorists can approach the facility from the seven-point crossing, Darga Road-CIT Road and Suhrawardy Avenue, he pointed out.
																								The civic body and the traffic department, over the past 40 years, have never bothered to upgrade the traffic infrastructure of this busy locality, alleged mayoral council member and local councillor Farzana Chaudhury.
																								The seven-point crossing was given its only facelift in the past 50 years during the commissioning of the AJC Bose Road flyover. 
																								So, snarls are a common sight on Darga Road, Suhrawardy Avenue, Congress Exhibition Road, Dilkhusa Street, Shamsul Huda Road, Biresh Guha Street, Broad Street and CIT Road.

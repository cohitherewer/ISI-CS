				 Eden fans barred, blame game on
 RITH BASU				 	 Team India fans scale up barriers and crane their necks for a look inside Eden Gardens. Picture by Amit Datta																								Subhash Jana, 30, would have given up his marketing job and taken up welding if he had known what awaited him on Wednesday.																								The die-hard cricket fan had never missed a practice session of Test teams at Eden Gardens for 12 years. But on Wednesday afternoon, he spent three hours outside the gates, slammed shut to outsiders for security reasons.																								The only fans allowed to get a clear glimpse of their cricket heroes were the youths engaged in welding and painting the galleries of Eden.																								From 1.30pm, when Team India took the field for their first nets in town, youngsters like Rajmanta Bera stopped work to gape at their gods.																								Welder Rajmanta, 20, gushed: I am a big fan of Sachin (Tendulkar). I did see him once at Cuttacks Barabati Stadium. I am also here to see (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni in action.																								The boy from Cuttack did not mention Sourav Ganguly, but the loudest cheers from the handful of workers-turned-watchers were reserved for the local hero  whether playing handball or padding to take strike.																								Among the Sourav devotees denied entry into Eden was Abhijit Ray, a postgraduate student of Rabindra Bharati University. Even till the ODI against South Africa, we were allowed to enter through gate No. 15 and watch the warm-up sessions. Today, we are leaving without a glimpse of Dada.																								The security cover sparked a blame game between the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and police. Samar Paul, the joint secretary of the association headed by former top cop Prasun Mukherjee, said: Watching practice sessions is a tradition for many. The police  not CAB  have taken the decision to debar fans.																								Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner (headquarters), however, lobbed the ball back into the CAB court: They did not tell us that they wanted a gallery opened for the public on Wednesday.

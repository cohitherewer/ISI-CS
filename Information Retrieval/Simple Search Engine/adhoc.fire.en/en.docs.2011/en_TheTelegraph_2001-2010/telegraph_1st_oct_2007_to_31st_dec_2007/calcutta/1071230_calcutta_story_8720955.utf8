The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

				 Clear-eyed and stark

																								Some artists who use the medium of photography in the West today prefer large format cameras and prints on which they capture wide-angle, clear-eyed and unblinking views of a certain scene. Bharat Sikka, whose photographs are being exhibited at Bose Pacia at Stephen Court in Park Street, follows in the footsteps of these photographers.
																								Sikka, who is all the rage in certain circles today, was trained in New York and has done campaigns for high-end products. In this series Sikka reveals himself as a man with a stark vision who looks unsparingly at the urban sprawl of Delhi that has little place for individuals although people  mostly the size of pin men and women  there are aplenty. 
																								These are all archival prints in colour but he uses it sparingly to capture the foggy mornings in Delhi winters as in the sewage pipes lying in a wilderness, a vast open space with puddles and strewn with brickbats before several apartment blocks in a bleak pre-dawn haze, and the top floors of the Microsoft office building peeping from behind a wall of corrugated tin. These are the perfect visual equivalents of the impersonal city that Delhi happens to be.
																								There are two Calcutta photographs. The Maidan with its flock of red-branded sheep and woolly clouds is cliched but the tram depot bathed in the yellow light of sodium vapour lamp is the stuff that dreams are made of.

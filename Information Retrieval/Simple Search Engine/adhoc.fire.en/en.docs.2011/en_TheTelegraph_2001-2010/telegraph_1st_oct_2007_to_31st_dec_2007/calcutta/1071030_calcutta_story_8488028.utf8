				 Assaulted for death of patient 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Junior doctors started an indefinite ceasework at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital on Monday to protest the assault on two of their colleagues and a nurse by a mob late on Sunday.																								The assault followed the death of Tulsi Nandi, 67, a Tollygunge Road resident, who was admitted to the hospital with a breathing problem.																								She suddenly fell ill while watching TV and started gasping. We took her to the hospital around 8.30pm, but she was left untreated for more than 15 minutes, without even oxygen support, before being sent to the female surgical ward. She died around 9.40pm, said Tulsis son Tapan Nandi.																								He has lodged a police complaint.																								The police said that soon after Tulsi died, a 50-strong mob stormed the ward and ransacked it, before thrashing two interns and a nurse.																								I was attending to the woman. I found no pulse and immediately started giving her a cardiac massage. Suddenly, someone punched me on my right ear, said Tapas Bhattacharya, one of the assaulted interns.																								Junior doctors gheraoed superintendent Tarun Kumar Manna for more than two hours before launching their ceasework. Manna, who refused to comment, filed a complaint with Bhowanipore police station against the assaulters.

				 Bandh? Walk it
														 Calcuttan of the week 																								Name: Brajeswar Bhattacharya (picture left by Pabitra Das)																								Right move: On Wednesday, as Mamata Banerjee paralysed the city, the 62-year-old former police officer walked five km from Kasba to his Jodhpur Park office, when an overwhelming majority of service-holders did not go to work. As vigilance manager in a courier agency, his job involves overseeing daily activities in several city offices. He walked to four other offices that day  in Jodhpur Park, Rashbehari Avenue and two on Gariahat Road (South)  covering about 10 km. He is the oldest employee in his company. 																								Letter push: Bhattacharya was inspired by Satarupa Chaudhuris open letter to Mamata Banerjee, published in The Telegraph on October 31. I was touched. I resolved to attend work despite all odds, he says. This, though he did not have any pressing assignment and could take the day off. He was urged by his executive daughter and bank official son-in-law to stay home and have a session of cha and adda. I thought that if this young woman can, then so can I. My youngest brother Prasanta too attended work at Writers Buildings from his Salkia residence. 																								Walkathon: I started at 9.20am from my home near Ruby General Hospital. I took an auto to Kasba police station. After that I found no means of transport and walked, he says. Trinamul Congress workers stopped him after he crossed Bijon Setu and asked him where he was going. He was allowed to go after he said that he was returning home. I was stopped at many other places. At each point, I told them that my house was just a few minutes walk away and was let off. I was wearing jeans and a T-shirt and was able to convince them. 																								Apolitical: I am apolitical. As a salaried person Im not losing out if I miss work on a bandh. But what happens to daily wage earners? Autowallahs, rickshaw-pullers? Hawkers? he asks. He mentions an incident in the early 1980s when six men were burned alive in a minibus during a Congress bandh. This is senseless. Should politics harm the common man? 																 He adds that he had gone to work on a previous bandh called on the Nandigram issue. Buses were running that day. Attending work on Wednesday made me feel proud. I felt as if Id done my bit by protesting silently on behalf of the common man, he says. I dont believe in bandhs. I will try to attend work on other bandh days too. 						MALINI BANERJEE

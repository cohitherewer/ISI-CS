				 Cupid cops save a couple
 															- Brides family was prejudiced about caste difference A STAFF REPORTER 																								Taking a cue from the Rizwanur Rahman-Priyanka Todi case, the men in uniform played it by the rulebook on Thursday and intervened in the nick of time to save a couple from separation. 																								Unhappy with his daughters choice of groom from a lower caste, Anju Kumari Dubeys father had planned to pack her off to Pune. But Anju was rescued before the Azad Hind Express chugged out of Howrah station. 																								Anjus husband Shiv Kumar Rai filed a complaint with Golabari police station. After confirming that the couple were adults and legally married, we intervened, said Neeraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of police (Howrah).																								Thanking the cops, the couple emerged from Golabari police station on Thursday night and left for Shiv Kumars Tandel Bagan home, in Howrah.																								Anju and Shiv Kumar, employed as telecallers with a private bank, were sweethearts from their university days. They completed their MA in Hindi from Calcutta University in 2005 and registered their marriage in April 2006.																								Her family opposed the marriage due to our caste difference. But we decided to get married anyway, Shiv Kumar told Metro. As planned, the couple, with some friends and the boys family, assembled in a temple in Howrahs Nandibagan on Wednesday to tie the knot. 																								Anjus father Ram Bachan and brother Rajen went to Shiv Kumars house and raised objections to the marriage. They finally gave in and agreed to a social ceremony on one condition: Anju would have to go back home with her father.																								Anju accompanied Ram Bachan back to their Rishra home, only to realise her father was plotting to separate her from Shiv Kumar. She called up her husband on Thursday morning. Shiv Kumar promptly lodged a complaint with Golabari police station. A police team left for Anjus residence. It was locked and so we alerted the Howrah GRP, said an officer of Golabari police station. 																								A GRP team located Anju, her parents and her brother on platform No. 10 and handed them over to the district police. The girl has given us in writing that she wants to live with Shiv Kumar and we have reunited them, said an officer.

				 Upgrade work at hospital
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 MAKEOVER Mode: RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. A Telegraph picture																								RG Kar Medical College and Hospital is undergoing a makeover, with the setting up of an oncology unit, a building to house the outpatients departments and a state-of-the art dialysis unit.																								Most of the projects are almost complete and likely to be unveiled during the platinum jubilee celebrations of Asias oldest medical college from December 19 to 22.																								We want to make most of the projects operational during the celebration, said Goutam Mukhopadhyay, a doctor at RG Kar and the organising secretary of the Platinum Jubilee Celebration Committee.																								Doctors said most of the projects were sanctioned much earlier but could not be implemented because of the authorities lack of initiative.																								Things started moving after the government set up a governing council for the hospital, said a doctor. The council is headed by state finance minister Asim Dasgupta.																								A four-storeyed building, set up at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore, will house all outdoor departments of the hospital. The departments are now located on the third floor of the casualty block building.																								For the first time, the hospital will have a dedicated indoor unit for cancer patients. The 40-bed radiotherapy unit is scheduled to be operational soon. Cancer patients in need of radiotherapy or chemotherapy are now admitted in general wards. But the patients often have to wait because of a shortage of beds, said Mukhopadhyay. The unit is being set up at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore. 																								A six-bed dialysis unit is also being set up. The authorities said it will remain open six days a week. The dialysis unit at SSKM Hospital functions six days a week and the one at NRS Medical College and Hospital is open twice a week.																								An underground water reservoir, with a capacity of 2.4 lakh gallons, is on the verge of completion. The authorities hope the reservoir, the biggest in a state-run hospital, will solve the water crisis at the hospital, said Utpal Dutta, the principal of RG Kar. 																								The hospital often faces a water crisis, even forcing postponement of surgeries.																								The authorities are also making night-stay arrangements for resident medical officers. Now, vehicles have to be sent to bring resident medical officers at odd hours, said an official.																								The construction of a new seven-storeyed platinum jubilee building will start soon. It will house a nursing college, an administrative block, an auditorium and a lecture hall.

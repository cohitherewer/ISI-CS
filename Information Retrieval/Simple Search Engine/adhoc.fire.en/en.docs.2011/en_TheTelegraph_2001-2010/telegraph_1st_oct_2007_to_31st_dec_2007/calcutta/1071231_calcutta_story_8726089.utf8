Aftab Alam Ansari had kept the explosives used in the serial blasts in Uttar Pradesh courts last month in a hideout on the eastern fringes of the city for a week, police said.
																								Ansari had brought the RDX to the hideout after collecting it from a point on the India-Bangladesh border in North 24-Parganas, said an officer of the Special Task Force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh police, that arrested the wing commander of Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami at his Baranagar home on Friday night.
																								The STF officers left the city with Ansari on Sunday morning. Before leaving, the officers, accompanied by a CID team, took Ansari to a few spots in Rajarhat where a number of Bangladeshi gangsters had been arrested in the recent past.
																								Ansari, who worked in a power supply company, reportedly told the sleuths during interrogation at the CID headquarters in Bhabani Bhavan that he had gone to Pakistan a few years ago to attend a training camp organised by militant outfits.
																								We came across his name after the arrest of Mohammad Khalid and Tariq in Barabanki in connection with the blasts, said an STF officer. Ansari came in touch with Tariq, a Harkat operative, during his frequent visits to his ancestral house in Gorakhpur. It was Tariq who introduced the 27-year-old to the top Harkat leaders in Kashmir.
																								The outfit decided to appoint Ansari as wing commander possibly because he was from Calcutta, which has always offered a safe passage to militants. His prime task was to receive explosives and ferry them to destinations, the officer pointed out.
																								The sleuths suspect that several Harkat operatives had met Ansari in Calcutta. We are yet to examine him extensively. We are sure he could provide us with leads in our probe into the blasts in Lucknow, Varanasi and Faizabad, said another officer.
																								Ansaris mother Ayesha Bibi denied that he was a terrorist. The police are claiming that he was in Uttar Pradesh when the blasts took place. But the last time he went there was in July. He cannot be a terrorist. All the charges against him are false, she alleged.
																								Ansaris neighbours on Cossipore Road, too, expressed surprise that he could be a terrorist. He was a quiet chap and seldom talked to us, said Debdutta Sharma, a neighbour.
																								Ansari was the sole earning member of the family of seven that lives in a one-roomed shanty on Cossipore Road.

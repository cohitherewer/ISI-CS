				 Stand clogs traffic
 							 - Authorities ignore street encroachment A STAFF REPORTER				 	 CHAKKA JAM: The sea of two-wheelers that can be seen parked outside Metro Railways Tollygunge station on any weekday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhaya																								The approach to Tollygunge tram depot via Deshapran Sashmal Road is a picture of permanent traffic chaos.																								Two-wheelers of Metro Railway commuters that are illegally parked near the crossing throughout the day are a primary reason for the congestion. Several fatal accidents have taken place on the stretch, but the authorities turn a blind eye to the problem.																								The cycle and motorcycle stand has eaten into the carriageway. This results in bottlenecks and forces the vehicles to flout rules. Its scary to cross the area, said Rumki Chakraborty, a postgraduate student who stays in Behalas Haridevpur.																								The stand is barely 10 metres away from the spot where a constable mans traffic. He, however, refuses to say why the illegal encroachment isnt removed.																								South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said: We will look into the matter and take necessary steps.																								Kudghat resident Ashis Kumar Guha said: The illegal parking lot became popular with the increase in the number of Metro Rail commuters. Such parking lots are seen outside many railway stations in the semi-urban areas. People reach the station on two-wheelers, park them at the stand and catch trains to work. They ride back home on the two-wheelers from the station. To allow a parking lot at the Tollygunge crossing is madness.																								The chairman of Borough X of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), Arup Biswas, said he had received many complaints about the stand from local residents.																								I have spoken to the transport minister at least thrice in the past 12 months about the parking lot. I also informed the local authorities and Regent Park police station about it. No one has taken any step, said Biswas.																								Local councillor (ward 97) Prahlad Chakraborty could not be contacted.																								Gopal Halder, 75, runs the illegal stand with the help of his grandsons and some local youth. The daily charge for a cycle is Rs 2, while that for a motorcycle is Rs 5. There is no monthly scheme, Halder told Metro.																								His youngest grandson, Babusona, 15, said they regularly bribe the police, Metro Rail officials and local goons. At the end of the day, there is very little left for us.																								Even on a lean day, about 250 cycles and 100 motorcycles are parked near the crossing. Do they know it is illegal to encroach on the road? The parking lot has been here since the time of Indira Gandhi. If it was right then, why shouldnt it be right now? asks Halder.

		 Trials of the entertainer																																	Academy Theatre presents Bangarangamancher Binodini, based on the achievements of actress Binodini Dasi (1863-1941), the prime of her genre who was deprived of her deserved glory by her colleagues as well as her guru, Girish Chandra Ghosh, but blessed by Ramakrishna Paramhansa. Joining the Bengali stage at the tender age of 11, Binodini became a phenomenal star. But like many of her female colleagues, she had to depend on patrons and protectors for survival. In 1883, a young man became very enamoured of her and offered to build a theatre in her honour, if she agreed to become his mistress. After much deliberations, she succumbed, and it was decided the theatre would be named B. Theatre after her name. However, when it was finally built, her guru and colleagues felt it would not be apt to name a theatre after her, as society regarded her as a fallen woman. It was named Star Theatre instead. Binodini was compelled to accept defeat and take deprivation in her stride for the sake of Bengali theatre. That was 125 years ago. The ongoing festival is an effort to pay homage to the bold, talented artiste who was instrumental in developing and enriching Bengali theatre, and paving the way for female actors. The festival consists of performances by theatre groups of Delhi, Calcutta and Dhaka, along with performance of theatre songs on the related perspective. Also, an exhibition on Binodini Dasi and her contribution to the rangamancha (stage) of Bengal is being showcased.

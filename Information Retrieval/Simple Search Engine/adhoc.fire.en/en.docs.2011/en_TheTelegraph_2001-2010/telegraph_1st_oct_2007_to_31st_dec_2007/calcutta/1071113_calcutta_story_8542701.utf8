				 Move with Blank Noise
				 				 When the city got crippled by the bandh on Monday, these young commuters took a break at the airport as some of the international and domestic flights were cancelled. Picture by Pabitra Das				 				 																															Jagannath De was thrown off a bus in Salt Lake for protesting against a woman being harassed. The reality of Indian streets can well be attested to by women who deal with it everyday. Yet it is often brushed under the carpet. 				 				 																															The Calcutta chapter of Blank Noise, a group that tries to address the problem of street sexual harassment, is organising a walk on November 16, from Gariahat Anandamela crossing to Jadavpur University, as part of an awareness drive. Called Wear What You Want, the walk will have participants sporting clothes they want to wear but cannot for fear of discomfiting reaction.				 				 																															Blank Noise was begun in 2003 by Jasmeen Patheja in Bangalore as her graduation project at Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology. From there, it has spread to major cities in the country, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad, with plans of starting a chapter at Chhattisgarh as well. Blank Noise is not about male bashing, explained Jasmeen.				 				 																															In Calcutta, Sunayana Roy, a writer, was one of those who initiated a chapter for the city. I had been on the mailing list of Blank Noise for the last two years and I felt it was time to get into action. The chapter started in May with 12 members. Currently there are more than 20 members, ranging in age from 18 to 50 years. The Internet is the main means of staying in touch, along with the blog, www.blanknoiseproject.blogspot.com. The Calcutta chapter has a blog of its own, www.blanknoisekolkata.blogspot.com. The chapter also has an Orkut community. 				 				 																															One of the first things the Calcutta group did was to organise a survey where people were asked about facing sexual harassment on the streets. A questionnaire was circulated among friends through email, with members even speaking to passers-by on the streets. The response threw up the differing nature of sexual harassment in Calcutta. Unlike cities like Delhi and Mumbai where the harassment is more of a physical nature, it is alarming to see that in Calcutta, it is more a case of people being in denial. Victims often dont react, and people witness to it look away as well. There are women who have said that they find the streets safe, and that their daughters are not harassed as they are different from those girls, said Sunayana. 				 				 																															Blank Noise wants to address the notion that women provoke the unsavoury treatment they might receive on the streets because of the way they dress. A woman in a sari and sindoor hears catcalls the same way as a college student wearing a skimpy dress, she explained. The aim of the Friday walk is to make people aware, through the clothing they sport, that molestation has little to do with provocation. The objective is to address the fear within the self as much as changing the attitude of others. 				 				 																															Saptarshi Chakraborty, a member and a student of Future Institute of Engineering and Management, said: Pointing an accusatory finger and doling out punishment is a primitive way of looking at the issue. We try to see it as a social problem and look for a solution, rather than seeing men as monsters and women as those who deliberately provoke.

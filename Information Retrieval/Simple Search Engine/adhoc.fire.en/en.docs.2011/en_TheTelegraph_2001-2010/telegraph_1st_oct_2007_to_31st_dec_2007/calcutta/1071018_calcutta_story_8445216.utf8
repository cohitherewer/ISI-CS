				 Add-ons for Lakes
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A host of facilities are to be added to beautify Rabindra Sarobar. A Telegraph picture																								Rabindra Sarobar is to undergo an image makeover, with the authorities planning a host of add-ons to draw in crowds.																								The facilities will include an underwater observatory, bubble rides, a dance floor, laser and fog shows, fountains, a fairy-tale ride for kids, green hoardings and boat rides.																								For the benefit of nature-lovers, there will be nine artists decks on the banks of the waterbody. Add to that the music and drama courts and an aroma garden, the Dhakuria Lakes will be in league with the most-sought-after hangouts in town.																								The changes have been outlined in a master plan that Jadavpur University submitted to Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) on Tuesday. 																								The plan, which has estimated the project cost at Rs 50 crore, incorporated several suggestions from urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya. 																								Sources in the CIT said the government has accepted the master plan in principle.																								Once the new facilities come up, an entry fee will be introduced for most of the green expanse. But certain parts could be accessed for free during particular periods of the day, said Biman Bandopadhyay, the acting valuation officer of the CIT. The authorities will see to it that the entry fee remains affordable for most visitors.																								The CIT had assigned a multi-disciplinary applied research team of Jadavpur University to prepare a rejuvenation plan for the Lakes. The team, comprising teachers and students from six disciplines, has prepared the report in 10 months.																								The university team has suggested that the status of the waterbody be upgraded from Class D (fit for only pisciculture) to Class B (where bathing is allowed). 																								Preserving the ecology of Rabindra Sarobar, included on the National Lake Conservation Programme list four years ago, was another thrust area of the beautification proposal.																								We need to make sure migratory birds continue to come to the Lakes. Boating and the fountains will keep the water aerated and fight hyacinth, a team member said.																								The team also examined the number of members of the clubs on the premises, the facilities they enjoy and the rent they pay to the CIT.																								The study found that the rents could be hiked five to six times, depending on the facilities enjoyed by the clubs. The 12 cricket coaching centres in the area together pay us Rs 2.10 lakh a year. The figure can be hiked to Rs 15 lakh, said Bandopadhyay.																								The rent, however, will remain the same for the 26,000-seat Rabindra Sarobar stadium, which has been leased to the state government.																								Funds for the makeover are likely to be shared by the Centre and the state government.

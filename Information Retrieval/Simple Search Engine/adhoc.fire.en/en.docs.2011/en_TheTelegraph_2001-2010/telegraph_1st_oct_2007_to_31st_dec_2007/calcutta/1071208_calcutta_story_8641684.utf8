				 Lift fees set to rise

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The annual licence, application and other fees for installing elevators and escalators in highrises and malls in Calcutta and its neighbourhood will go up, with the state government passing a bill to the effect on Friday.
																								Participating in the discussion on West Bengal Lifts and Escalators (Amendment) Bill, 2007, power minister Mrinal Banerjee said the fees, including late fees, had last been revised in 1955.
																								There is an urgent need to augment the infrastructure to cater to the demand for lifts and elevators. The fee hike will help us meet the additional expenditure, said Banerjee.
																								According to him, a few years ago, the power department used to receive hardly 30 applications a year for installing lifts. The number has gone up to 1,200. The corresponding figure for escalators is 30.
																								The government takes Rs 200 each as application fee and annual renewal fee. The annual inspection fee is Rs 100. 
																								The revised amounts will be announced later. The fine for late payment has been increased from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000. The daily late fine will rise from Rs 50 to Rs 200. 
																								Trinamul Congress MLA Sougata Roy said the fees were very high. The government should conduct regular inspection of lifts and escalators, he stressed.
																								Congress MLA Abdul Khaleque Molla also called for security measures for elevators and escalators at malls and highrises.

				 Demand up for seafarers 

 A STAFF REPORTER 
																								Maritime recruitment and training agencies and colleges are gearing up to meet the growing demand for qualified seafarers.
																								There has been a boom in the industry and the fleets are being doubled. Hence, the demand for trained people has gone up manifold, said Sanjay Srivastava, the managing director of Selandia, a marine recruitment and crew management agency that recently set up shop in the city.
																								With few marine engineering colleges in the city, the company will look to recruit fresh engineers in other disciplines. It will hire masters, first, second and third officers, fleet electronic officers, radio electronic officers, chief engineers, first, second and third engineers, and electrical officers.
																								Several agencies are recruiting engineers and training them to meet the shipping industrys demands, said A.K. Bakshi, president (officers association), Marine Engineering and Research Institute. The institute, with 120 seats per batch, has recorded 100 per cent placements with an average monthly salary of $1,000.
																								To cater to the industry better, the institute has restructured its four-year course. The six-month sea time needed for fresh recruits to be eligible for the fourth engineers test has been incorporated by the institute into the course.
																								With more firms and recruitment agencies setting up city offices, there will be growth in the industry, said Priyanka Mukherjee of Trident College of Marine Technology.

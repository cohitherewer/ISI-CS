 SUBHRO SAHA																								Cricket is a given in Indo-Australian ties, nowhere more than on Sourav terrain. But Calcutta has the potential to reach out on many other planes besides leather and willow, feels Australian high commissioner to India John McCarthy (picture right).																								Of course, the first hard-core business reason for Australians to be in Calcutta is mining, since Bengal remains the mining hub of India. At the same time, given the preparedo (Spanish for preparedness) of Bengal and its chief minister to catch the current drift, many more avenues for collaboration are opening up, McCarthy, in town for a mining conclave, told Metro on Thursday.																								While the number of students from the state choosing Australia for higher studies has been rising steadily, Bengals inherent strength in intellectual resources makes science and technology a key area for enduring relationships, the envoy felt.																								Identifying IT and ITES, food-processing and sub-contracting as other fields of possible collaboration, McCarthy, who had a fruitful meeting with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday, said Calcutta could have a full-fledged Australian consulate in the near future.																								It all depends on how soon the city can reach a critical mass in terms of business activity, tourist and student traffic. If and when Calcutta can reach the desired density, not just a consulate mission, but a direct flight by Qantas is also on the cards, the high commissioner smiled.																								McCarthy felt Bengal can also do its bit to boost tourist traffic to the state from Australia through better packaging and information dissemination.																								As of now, the Delhi-Agra-Jaipur golden triangle remains the first choice for Australian tourists travelling to India, followed by Goa and Kerala and then Varanasi and the Ganges trail. Bengal, with the Sunderbans, Santiniketan and the Bishnupur-Murshidabad-Bankura belt, can become a viable option for repeat tourists, he said.

				 Fog rejigs foreign flight roster 
 SANJAY MANDAL																								A forecast of heavy fog at Calcutta airport has prompted several international airlines to reschedule their operations from the city.																								British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa will change their departure timings from Calcutta and some others may follow suit. 																								These flights are most affected by fog, as they operate late at night, said an airport official.																								The fog this winter is feared to be heavier than last year, with visibility at times dropping below 50 metres, said A.K. Das, the meteorological director of the airport. The city received heavy rainfall till late in the year. Such showers are usually followed by heavy fog in winter.																								Airport sources said fog is often engulfing the runway in the early hours since late October. On quite a few occasions, the visibility was 50 metres, way below the minimum 350 metres that the Category II Instrumental Landing System allows flights to operate in.																								The Category II system was installed in 2006, but became fully operational only recently. In the earlier (Category I) system, flights required a visibility of at least 550 metres to operate.																								The most fog-affected month in Calcutta is January, when visibility often drops below 350 metres from 2am to 7am.																								Despite having the advanced Category II system, flights scheduled to land or take off during this period will be affected, said an airport official.																								To make matters worse, even the Category II system is suffering from glitches. The runway visual range equipment  a vital component of the system  on the northern side of the runway fails to work at times, the official said.																								The equipments cables were once stolen by some contract labourers. The cables have been restored, but they often malfunction as they have been left uncovered because of runway extension work.																								Airports Authority of India regional executive director (east) S.P.S. Bakshi, however, said: The Category II system is functioning smoothly and we are ready for the winter.

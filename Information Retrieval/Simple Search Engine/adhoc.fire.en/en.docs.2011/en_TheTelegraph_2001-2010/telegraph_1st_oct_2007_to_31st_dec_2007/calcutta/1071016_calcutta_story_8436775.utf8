		 Charting civilisation on canvas																																	Written Image is artist Hiran Mitras exploration of the language of art as it stands as document to the evolution of civilisation. He attempts to plumb the depths of universal symbolism and the emotional drama of colour. His paintings are the representation of the evolution of the artistic inclinations of man. Influenced by nature, folk music, dance forms and cross-cultural graphic expressions, Mitra here, too, lives up to the reputation that he has garnered with his significant contribution to the visual stimulus in the field of regional cinema, theatre and literature. Through his paintings he gives us that wondrous escape route; a fresh perspective on our everyday reality. Mitra is considered to be one of the masters of abstraction among his contemporaries.

				 ID cards set right, returned 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								More then 6,000 residents of Mominpore  from part Nos. 118, 119, 120, 121 and 122 of Kabitirtha Assembly constituency  heaved a sigh of relief on Monday, after their voters identity cards were sent back with the necessary corrections. 																								On November 26, Metro had reported about the voters identity cards that were riddled with errors but were being distributed among the local residents. 																								The date of birth of the voters was missing from all the cards and in most cards, the road names in the address were wrongly spelt. 																								The pin code on the cards, too, was wrong  it should have been 700027 but read 700023. 																								Residents of the five parts that received the electoral cards full of errors were very angry. They gheraoed the election commission officials who were giving out the cards at Kidderpore Milani High School. The day after the report was published in Metro, all the cards were called back. The poll commission officials have rectified all the mistakes and sent the cards back, said Bablu Karim, the secretary of the Trinamul Youth Congress. 																								The residents had refused to accept their cards. The voters identity card is such an important document. The election commission was callous but now the errors have been rectified, said Ismail, a local resident.

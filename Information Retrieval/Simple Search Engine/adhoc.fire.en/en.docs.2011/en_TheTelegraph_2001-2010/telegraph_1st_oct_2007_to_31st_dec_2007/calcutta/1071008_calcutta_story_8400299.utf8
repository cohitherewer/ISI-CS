		 Mastery in miniature																																	Small is beautiful 2 is an exhibition of miniature art works featuring 40 contemporary Indian arists including Paritosh Sen, Suhas Roy, Shuvaprasanna, Wasim Kapoor, Subrata Gangopadhyay, Anup Giri, Shyamal Mukherjee, Beena Pradhan, Bratin Khan, Sutapa Khan, Sanjib Gogoi, Avijit Dutta, Sibsaday Chowdhary (a painting by him appears right) and Subhamita Nanda. The recent boom in Indian art has shown an exponential rise in prices of art works. Since the demand for large works are great at national and international levels, the prices of art pieces have rendered them almost ungettable for many art lovers. The ongoing exhibition features paintings in oil, pastel and watercolour on mixed media and canvas, besides pieces of sculpture done in metals and stone. A look at the exhibits is enough to impress upon the mind of the viewer the grandeur of these small artefacts. The artists have addressed the same concerns and shown the same convictions in this diminutive version of their individual and collective signature brilliance.

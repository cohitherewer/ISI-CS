				 Vehicle bane of tiny lane
 															- MATADOR MENACE JULIUS GOMES				 	 Illegally parked Matadors make a mockery of the no-parking signs on lamp posts in Mitra Lane, off Mahajati Sadan. A Telegraph picture																								Residents of Mitra Lane, near Mahajati Sadan, are facing a tough time because of illegally parked Matadors and the unruly, often obscene, behaviour of the drivers and their helps.																								Three no-parking boards hang from lamp posts in the 40-metre lane, yet around 20 Matadors can be seen parked there at any time of the day or night.																								We have repeatedly complained to the officer-in-charge of Jorasanko police station and the joint commissioner of police (traffic), but the problem persists, said Arpan Goenka, a resident of Mitra Lane. Police raid the stretch every time a complaint is lodged, but its back to square one after a few days.																								Traffic snarls are perennial in the lane, thanks to the Matadors. The residents who own cars find it inconvenient to take out their vehicles. At night, the residents are woken up by the revving engines and blaring horns.																								Sweepers cannot clean the lane as it is blocked almost round-the-clock by the vehicles. Garbage remains strewn around and the drains are clogged, resulting in waterlogging after every spell of rain.																								Its a hazard for women to step out after sunset, as the drunk drivers and their helps pass lewd comments at them. They at times fight among themselves and hurl obscenities at each other. We are concerned about the safety of our families, said Shekhar Agarwal, a local resident.																								The drivers and the helps, along with a few rickshaw-pullers and potters, have even set up illegal settlements in the lane.																								We are aware of the situation and occasionally launch raids to clear the lane of the illegally parked vehicles. But we dont have the manpower for a sustained drive, said a senior police officer.																								Local Trinamul Congress MLA Dinesh Bajaj said: I have not received any complaint on the issue. If the residents approach me, I will definitely take steps to curb the Matador menace.

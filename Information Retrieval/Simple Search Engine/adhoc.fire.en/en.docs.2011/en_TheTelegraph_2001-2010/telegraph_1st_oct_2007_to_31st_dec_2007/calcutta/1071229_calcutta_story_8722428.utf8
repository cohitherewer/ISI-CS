				 				 																															Alipore Tiny Tots Nursery School held their annual carnival (picture below by Anindya Shankar Ray) at the school grounds on December 9. The carnival has been an annual event at the 45-year-old institution. 
				 				 																															We organise a programme for children every year, either a sports meet, concert or handicraft exhibition. A carnival is held every three years, informed Chaitali Sinha, who has taught at the school for the last 22 years. 
				 				 																															Parents accompanied their children to school, joining them for a day of fun and games. With the school gate decorated with red and white balloons and the playground decked with colourful decorations, the grounds had a festive air.
				 				 																															The nativity scene had been recreated in a corner, with the three wise men, shepherds, Mary, Joseph and the newborn Christ. A Christmas tree had been placed alongside. 
				 				 																															Disney was not given a miss either, with Mickey and Minnie Mouse mingling freely with the children. Santa Claus on a sledge filled with goodies welcomed all.
For many, it was a return to the grounds where they has taken their first steps in the institution of learning. Its great to be back in school, exclaimed Jayeeta Kar, now a law student at a city college. 
Returning to her alma mater after nearly 15 years, she was pleasantly surprised that some of her teachers remembered and warmly received her.
				 				 																															Founder Neena Varma described the carnival as an attempt to blend different elements, containing something for all family members. 
				 				 																															Food and game stalls attracted large crowds. Children vied to take turns at games like pinning the tail on the donkey, bowling, Wishing Well, and Ringing the Gift. 
				 				 																															Bouncy Castle with kids taking turns at bouncing on the inflated castle,was a success, as was the magic show. The treasure hunt stall also attracted many, with a gift for all who joined in.

	 Natures wrath
				 				 																															When rains lashed my city, 
				 				 																															An Atlantis it had become. 
				 				 																															Mother Nature had to speak. 
				 				 																															For we had stood there mum. 
				 				 																															As trees lost their place, 
				 				 																															And city lungs were paved. 
				 				 																															Who has time to see, 
				 				 																															If Mother Nature is saved? 
				 				 																															The rain was just a rebuke, 
				 				 																															This time Mother was mild. 
				 				 																															But the brat we know as man, 
				 				 																															Will he ever learn, the spoilt child? 
				 				 																															God forbid the day, 
				 				 																															When on revenge she is bent. 
				 				 																															But man the fool he is, 
				 				 																															Wont learn until his time is spent.

Picture by Amit Datta																								The chairman of the West Bengal Minorities Commission has asked state home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray to submit a report on the circumstances leading to the death of Rizwanur Rahman and the role of police in the case.																								Considering the sensitivity of the case, I have written to the home secretary, asking him to send us a report at the earliest, S.Z. Adnan, the chairman of the panel, said on Tuesday.																								We have started a suo motu case, but are awaiting for Rizwanurs family to lodge a complaint. The commission has expressed its anxiety over the possibility of the issue being given a communal overtone, Adnan added.																								The administration has also come under attack for its handling of the Rizwanur case from the Shilpo Sanskritik Karmi Buddhijibi Mancho  a platform of artists and intellectuals set up after the Nandigram firing.																								The association held a meeting on Shamshul Huda Road, in Park Circus, on Tuesday afternoon, demanding immediate suspension of the tainted police officers and a CBI probe into Rizwanurs death. Among those present were painter Shuvaprasanna and theatre personality Bibhas Chakraborty.																								We are not happy with the judicial inquiry as it will lead nowhere. The matter should be handed over to the CBI and all accused police officers, including the police commissioner, should be suspended for the sake of an impartial probe, said Amitava Banerjee, a member of the organisation.																								Kishwar Jahan, a social activist, said the people have lost faith in the administration. Rizwanurs death has once again exposed the nexus between the administration and the rich. Todi has influenced the administration by using his money power. Its a clear case of murder, she claimed.																								Around 500 people who had gathered at the rally shouted anti-police slogans and later marched from Rizwanurs Tiljala Lane house to the Park Circus connector.

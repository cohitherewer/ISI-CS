				 Woman found dead
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Ruksana Begum, 25, was found dead at her in-laws house in Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city, on Friday morning.																								A preliminary probe suggested that Ruksana, who left behind a one-and-a-half-year-old son, had committed suicide by consuming poison.																								Ruksanas uncle Sheikh Jainal alleged that she was often tortured by husband Jahangir Sheikh, a trader, and her in-laws for dowry.																								Jahangir demanded money to expand his tailoring business, said Jainal. Jahangir and the other members of the family are absconding.																								It seems Ruksana had taken mental preparation to end her life, as she left her son with her parents on Thursday, said Jainal.																								The superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), Praveen Kumar, said the sleuths are waiting for the post-mortem report to ascertain whether there was any foul play behind the death.																								A clearer picture will emerge after Ruksanas husband and in-laws are arrested, Kumar added.

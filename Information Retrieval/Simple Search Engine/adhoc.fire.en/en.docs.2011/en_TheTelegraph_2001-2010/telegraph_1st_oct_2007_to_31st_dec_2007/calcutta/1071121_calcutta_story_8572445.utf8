				 FIR slap for functions
 															- NOISE NORM VIOLATION JAYANTA BASU																								The state pollution control board has lodged FIRs against Nalban Boating Complex and Nicco Park for allowing programmes that violated noise norms on their premises on Monday night.																								Complaints have also been lodged against the organisers of the programmes  the Impex Group, involved in the iron and steel sector, in Nalban and a private TV channel in Nicco Park.																								While the TV channel organised an entertainment programme, the Nalban function was the wedding of Rohit Patni, heir to the Impex Group.																								The FIRs followed several complaints of noise-norm violations, resulting from bursting of high-decibel fireworks, at the functions, said state environment secretary M.L. Meena.																								Our officials went to both Nalban and Nicco Park on Tuesday. Remnants of banned fireworks were found in Nalban, said Debal Roy, the member-secretary of state green board.																								Local residents echoed the officials views. It was so noisy that we could not hear Haimanti Shukla sing at a soiree in KC Block, more than two km from the Nalban-Nicco Park area, said Nabarun Sen, a local resident.																								We allow the programmes on our premises only if the organisers produce requisite permissions. The Impex Group had produced a permission letter from the sub-divisional officer, said Gorachand Sarkar, the project manager of Nalban, run by Bansilal Leisure Parks Limited.																								We didnt receive any complaint last night, said Ravi Bhatia, the general manager of Bansilal Leisure Parks.																								A Nicco Park official said permission was granted after the organisers produced consent letters from the administration.

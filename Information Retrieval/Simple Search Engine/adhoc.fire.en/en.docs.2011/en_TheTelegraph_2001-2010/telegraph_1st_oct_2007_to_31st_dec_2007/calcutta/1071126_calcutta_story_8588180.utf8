				 Probe into cop duo assets
 TAPAS GHOSH AND PRONAB MONDAL				 	 Rizwanur Rahman: Mental agony																								The CBI will seek permission from the high court to initiate criminal proceedings against two officers of Calcutta police, and also start cases against people close to Rizwanur and Priyanka. This is the first time the CBI has pointed the needle of suspicion at family and friends of Rizwanur for their alleged role in his death.																								If the court shows the green light, the agency will probe the disproportionate assets of the police duo. Since lakhs of rupees have changed hands in the Rizwanur Rahman case, we need to look into the assets of the officers, said a CBI official.																								The CBI will not disclose the names of the officers, who allegedly instigated Rizwanur to commit suicide. We will reveal the names after further investigation, added the official.																								The agency is going to submit its preliminary report to the court on November 30, a fortnight before the deadline. We have wrapped up our work and will submit the report on November 30, the day fixed for hearing of the petition by Rizwanurs mother and elder brother, said the official.																								According to another CBI official, the agency has come to the conclusion that tremendous mental agony because of unlawful interference by the two Lalbazar officers contributed to the death of the 30-year-old graphics designer on September 21.																								The report will mention how the police had left no other option for Rizwanur. The role played by people close to Rizwanur and Priyanka will also be dealt with.																								We will appeal to the court for permission to start cases against people close to Rizwanur and Priyanka. We want to charge the accused with abetment to suicide, said the official.																								While ordering the CBI inquiry into the case, Justice Soumitra Pal had said the agency would have the liberty to initiate criminal proceedings against any accused. But before starting the proceedings, we want to inform the court about the circumstances that triggered the suicide, added the official.																								According to him, Rizwanur had realised that Priyanka would not come back to live with him. He could not contact his wife for five days before his death. The silence from the Todi end made him fear the worst.

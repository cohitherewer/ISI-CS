				 Nandigram delay at JU 
 																											- Tabling of report on campus violence put on back burner OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The Nandigram crisis has forced the executive council of Jadavpur University to press the pause button on a number of key decisions. 																								From punishing students involved in campus violence to revamping the examination system  important academic and administrative decisions were put on the back burner after Wednesdays five-hour meeting of the universitys highest decision making body. 																								It is clear that they do not want to take harsh decisions after the Nandigram crisis, said a campus source, explaining the councils approach on announcing punishment for those involved in campus violence on the night of April 5.																								No decision on tabling the report of the one-man commission, which probed the campus violence on April 5 night, also came as a surprise to many at JU. 																								The authorities had decided to table the report in todays meeting. They pushed it to November 21 but no one knows when it would be placed, added the source. 																								P.N. Ghosh, the vice chancellor of JU, admitted that no dates have been finalised for tabling the report. 																								 It will take time to hold a discussion on the report. In our next meeting, we will only discuss budget proposals for the next financial year, said Ghosh. 																								On April 5, a mob comprising some students and outsiders had allegedly ransacked the office of the CPM-controlled Jadavpur University Karmachari Samsad and set it on fire.																								The Samsad started an indefinite strike and later withdrew it after the authorities gave them an assurance that the culprits would be punished on the basis of the inquiry commission report.																								The authorities are unnecessarily delaying the process of placing the inquiry report before the executive council. We are determined to start a fresh agitation if we find that the culprits are not punished, said an aggrieved employee.																								The executive council also avoided taking a final decision on previewing of answer scripts for undergraduate and postgraduate students. 																								The only proposal that the executive council endorsed was a proposal of the universitys faculty councils to discontinue the system of allowing examinees to seek review of answer scripts of supplementary examinations.

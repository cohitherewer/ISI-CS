				 Mental patients and hunt for roots
 															- NGOs, families provide food and medicine  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A mental patient at a camp organised by an NGO in Behalas Haridevpur. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Rajlakshmi (name changed), a mentally-challenged woman in her mid-30s, was rescued from the streets by NGO workers. She was weak, covered in filth and could speak only Tamil. She was rehabilitated after sustained efforts and last week, handed over to an NGO in Chennai that is trying to locate her home, which she left 12 years ago.																								Rumki Pramanik (name changed), 22, was rescued at Itkhola, in Haridevpur. The rescuers could not make out what she was saying. Luckily, a neighbour saw her being rescued on TV and informed her mother. Five years later, Rumki is back with her family in Habra. A local NGO keeps track of her progress.																								Reuniting mental patients with their families is a challenge that NGOs in the city are taking up.																								Putiary Club, in Behalas Haridevpur, is one of the NGOs. It looks after 21 homeless mental patients in the city. Thirteen of them were brought to a camp organised by the club in July. The patients were given food and provided a washroom to take a bath. Doctors spoke to them and prescribed medicines.																								Putiary Club organised a second camp on Saturday. Apart from the 13, eight new patients  picked up from the streets  attended the camp and were treated.																								We escorted them back to the places from where they were picked up. Our volunteers visit them regularly and give them the prescribed medicines, said Subrata Guha, the secretary of the NGO.																								Another NGO, Iswar Sankalpa, has got together with organisations like Bandhu Chakra in Kidderpore and Behala Youth Association, apart from Putiary Club, under a project called Naya Daur. We have identified over 250 mentally ill and homeless people in about 60 wards of Calcutta, said Saikat Das, a member of Iswar Sankalpa.																								We want to involve the community in serving the people. Residents of some localities are arranging food for mental patients staying in their area. The results have been good. Some of the patients are much better now, added Das.																								The secretary of Iswar Sankalpa, K.L. Narayanan, told Metro that tea stall-owners in two areas have volunteered to provide dinner and medicines to the mentally ill in their locality.

				 Unfortunate act: Buddha
 A STAFF REPORTER			A Congress rally passes down Howrah bridge on Monday morning with a blood-splattered poster of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Picture by Pabitra Das		Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has apologised  not to the people of Nandigram, but to the culturati he has long considered his core constituency.																								Before leaving Writers Buildings on Monday, Bhattacharjee said: Its very unfortunate that the incident occurred. It would have been better if police action could have been avoided.																								The chief minister was referring to the manner in which some writers, artists, actors and film-makers were stopped from protesting against the violence in Nandigram on Sunday. A few were even arrested.																								I had a talk with some intellectuals and will have discussions with others, too. I will also speak to Sankhada, who is a very respected person, added Bhattacharjee.																								The Buddha balm did not seem to work. Late on Monday, poet Sankha Ghosh told Metro: Its good that the chief minister has apologised for Sundays incident, but he has not spoken to me yet.																								Asked whether Bhattacharjee should have apologised to the people of Nandigram first, Ghosh said: He has to do much more than just apologise. The two things are very different.																								According to the chief minister, police were not prepared to tackle the protests at Nandan but they would not not have cracked down if it had not been for political intervention. Can the police be harsh on playwrights and intellectuals? It was only when Congress and Trinamul Congress men rushed to join the intellectuals that the police reacted, claimed Bhattacharjee.																								The chief ministers apology, followed by police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabartis expression of regret over police action has not pacified the protesters. 																								I saw on television that he (Bhattacharjee) has apologised. But we will carry on with the demonstrations, said film-maker Aparna Sen.																								Fellow-protester Goutam Ghose added: The chief minister should definitely apologise; what happened on Sunday was very sad.

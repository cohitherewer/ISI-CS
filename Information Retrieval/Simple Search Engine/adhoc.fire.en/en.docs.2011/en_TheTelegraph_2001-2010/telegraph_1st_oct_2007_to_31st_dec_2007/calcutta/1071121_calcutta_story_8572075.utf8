 																											- CPM worker accuses wife of torture, affair in suicide note A STAFF REPORTERThe alleged extra-marital affair of his wife drove Kaushik Chatterjee, a CPM worker and small-time trader, to suicide in his Shibpur house on Monday afternoon (picture by Gopal Senapati).																								Chatterjee, 46, left behind a suicide note in which he accused wife Sonali, 35, of having a relationship with Ujjal Chatterjee, 45, also a CPM worker.																								Both Sonali and Ujjal have been arrested following a complaint from Kaushiks relatives and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.																								Kaushik wrote that Sonali would often torture him mentally in front of their 11-year-old son. She insisted that Ujjal come to their house despite Kaushiks objections.																								The trader had even asked local party leaders to persuade Sonali to stop seeing Ujjal, an employee of Howrah Gramin Bank. Ive no clue whether the leaders have acted on my request, Kaushik wrote in the suicide note.																								Srideep Bhattacharya, the secretary of the CPMs Howrah district committee, said: Kaushik was a dedicated party worker. I will inquire what our local leaders did after receiving his request for help.																								On Monday afternoon, children in the neighbourhood saw a placard  with the words I am dead, door is open written on it  pasted on the grille of the Haldarpara Lane house where Kaushik lived with his family.																								They informed their elders, who came to the house and found hundreds of typed suicide notes littering the compound. They entered Kaushiks room and found him hanging from the ceiling. A copy of the suicide note was found in his shirt pocket, too.																								The relatives informed Sonali, who had left for her ancestral home in Harinavi, South 24-Parganas, with their son on Saturday. 																								Sonali came back but put up in her mothers house in Kashinath Chatterjee Lane, in Shibpur, from where she was arrested on Monday night. The police then took her to Ujjals Baishnabpara Lane house and picked him up.																								Kaushiks nephew Rajib said: I saw my aunt moving around with Ujjal several times but did not suspect anything. My uncle was an introvert and did not us tell us anything about the affair.																								A probe has been ordered, said Howrah police superintendent N.K. Singh.

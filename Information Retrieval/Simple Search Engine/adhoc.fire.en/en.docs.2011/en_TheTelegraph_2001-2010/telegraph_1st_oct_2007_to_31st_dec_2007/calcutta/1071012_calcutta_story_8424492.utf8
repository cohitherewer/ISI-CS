				 Governor red over green
 A STAFF REPORTERGovernor Gopalkrishna Gandhi on Thursday expressed concern over the style of functioning of the state pollution control board and other agencies in the environment sector.																								Speaking at an international workshop on climate change in the city, he also asked the state board to act independently on critical green issues.																								The programme was organised by Jadavpur University, in collaboration with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, the departments of environment and science and technology, and the South Asian Capacity Building Networks. 																								I would like you to have power, like the election commission, so that the pollution control board can act independently, said the governor to state board chairman Asok Nath Bose, who was present on the dais.																								Say no to any development initiative that threatens the environment, said Gandhi, expressing concern over the indiscriminate filling of wetlands. He stressed that often, the environment department did not get its due importance and was overshadowed by glamourous departments like industry.																								The stage of thinking that this (problems of climate change) may pass, is no more there and it is now a matter of life and death, said the governor, as he reminded the audience that a large number of people in India, Maldives and Bangladesh are at risk owing to climate changes.																								West Bengal has reason to be concerned, as a vast population depends on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture and forestry for livelihood, said environment minister Sailen Sarkar. 																								The state government will soon implement two climate-related projects in the state  a World Bank-supported scheme in the coastal areas to execute the Swaminathan committee recommendations and another internationally funded project on capacity building.																								The governors comments are a clear indicator of the status of implementation of environmental regulation in the state, observed environmentalist Subhas Dutta.

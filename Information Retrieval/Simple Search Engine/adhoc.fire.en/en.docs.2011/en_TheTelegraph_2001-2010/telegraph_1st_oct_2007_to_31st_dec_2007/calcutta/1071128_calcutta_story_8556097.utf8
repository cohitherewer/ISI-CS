				 Cheers, Scotch just got cheaper
 															- Excise duty on imported liquor slashed, prices down by 15 to 25 per cent  ZEESHAN JAWED																								The state government has slashed the excise duty on imported liquor, bringing down prices by 15 to 25 per cent.																								The duty on imported liquor is now on a par with that on Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL). The price cut will be effected on stock rolled out on or after November 1, said a senior excise department official.Red Label at Rs 1,167 now costs only Rs 50 more than Teachers. Naturally, people will go for Red Label, claimed Asif Adil, the managing director of Diageo India, which imports brands like Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Smirnoff. The rate re-jig follows a complaint by the US and the European Union to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) that additional duties levied on imported spirits in India were not in sync with the countrys commitment to the international body. Additional duties  from 150 per cent to 550 per cent  were being charged to protect domestic manufacturers. The WTO rules allow duties up to 150 per cent.																								In India, the states decide the rate of excise on liquor. Bengal, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh imposed the steepest excise rates in the country. The high rates have translated into a small market for foreign liquor in Bengal. For example, of the 40 lakh cases of beer consumed in the state annually, only 4,000 cases are of foreign beer. The new rates in Bengal, however, are comparable with those in Punjab and Maharashtra, which charge the lowest excise duties on foreign liquor. 																								The move has been welcomed by traders and consumers. The rate cut will provide a much-needed impetus to the imported liquor segment, said Sarat Kumar Parsan of Parsan Brothers, the biggest importer of foreign liquor in the state.																								I love Scotch but could only have it rarely because of its price. I can have Scotch more often now, said businessman Subhojoy Banerjee. 																								Restaurants and nightclubs, however, have not passed on the benefit to customers. Officials of some establishments cited overhead costs as the reason.																								Some stores which stock imported liquor, including single malt, are BN Law and VP Stores in New Market, Solace on Prince Anwar Shah Road and Cheers in Triangular Park.

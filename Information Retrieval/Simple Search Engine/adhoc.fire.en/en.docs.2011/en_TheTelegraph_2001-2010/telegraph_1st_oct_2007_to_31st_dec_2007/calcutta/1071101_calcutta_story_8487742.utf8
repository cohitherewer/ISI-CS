		 Ode to the festival of lights																																	Taj Bengal, in association with Standard Chartered Priority Banking, Patton, Seagram Chivas Regal, Open Doors and Anjika, presents Celebration of Lights, where several well-known artistes, through music, dance and the spoken words, dedicate a joyous ode to this season of happiness and hope. Communication is a multi-layered function, each layer complementing and enriching the other. The same can be said of the spoken word, dance and music, all of which evoke the same emotional response in us. From the poetry and lyricism of Manipuri dance, to the classical appeal of Bharata Natyam, from the irresistible call of rhythm to the mesmerising power of vocal virtuosity, all ensure a rich experience of the plurality of life. Arjun Chakraborty and Dhritiman Chatterjee weave the spell of poetry, Bickram Ghosh enthralls with the rhythmic variations and Shuvaprasanna infuses his vision into his canvases. Usha Uthup does what she is best at, while Sharmila Biswas drive for perfection is seen in her Odissi recital. Jaya Seal performs a Bharata Natyam recital as Tanushree Shankar recreates her personalised dance idiom. Priti Patel, who shares with Oindrilla Dutt, the credit for the concept of the programme, presents her own version of Thang-ta, the Manipuri martial art form, providing a befitting finale with her stunning aesthetic offer to Agni.

				 Lights go beyond Bengal
 POULOMI BANERJEE				 	 Chandernagore lights illuminate a puja pandal in Calcutta. A Telegraph picture																								The electricians of Chandernagore who deck up the crowd-pulling city pujas with lights have started looking beyond the state border for festive orders. For the past few years, lights from Chandernagore have been illuminating pujas not only in the neighbouring states but also in Delhi, Mumbai and South India.																								We have been sending lights to Assam, Jharkhand, Orissa, Mumbai, Delhi, Ayodhya and many other places. The number of orders from outside West Bengal is increasing steadily, says Babu Pal of Pal Electric Company.																								Sagar Datta, of Sagar Electric, says: I have been in this field for 17 years. We have been getting a significant number of orders from outside the state only in the past four to five years. According to him, the electricians were not keen on outside orders earlier as their time and energy were spent on Calcutta pujas.																								Monetary gain has made the electricians do a rethink. Puja committees from other states pay in advance, and in cash. Calcutta pujas pay a portion of the bill and make us wait till the money from the ads come in, says Samir Chatterjee of Habul Electrical.																								Even after accounting for extra labour and transportation costs, there is more profit in orders from outside Bengal. We make at least 30 per cent more profit on outside orders compared to those from Calcutta, adds Datta. 																								The popularity of theme pujas in Calcutta, with focus on pandals, has made the electricians look beyond Bengal. This year, the city market was a little better. Maybe the people are tired of themes, says Pal.																								The electricians have started coming up with themes themselves. But high electricity bills are a deterrent. Obtaining permits and digging up roads to lay power lines is also a hassle.Theme lights are motor-operated and more expensive, explains Anjan Ukil, the secretary of Ballygunge Cultural puja committee.

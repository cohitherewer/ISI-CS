				 The big fat wedding, OSO-style
 															- Bollywood and TV stars shine bright at evening extravaganza KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR				 	 Malaika Arora Khan																								Deepika Padukone and Malaika Arora Khan, a wedding plan running into crores and a grand finale on a stage shaped like a ship  welcome to the big fat Calcutta wedding, OSO-style.																								Nalban Boating Complex played host to a star-studded sangeet on Monday evening in the run-up to city-based Rohit Patni marrying Neha Jain from Cochin on November 21. Rohit, 24, is the heir to the Impex Group while Neha, 23, hails from a family dealing in iron and steel.																								Set against the Nalban waterbody, the stage was crafted like a ship adorned with masthead and sails. The sangeet started with a short performance by family members before the stars descended. Im very happy and we look forward to welcoming the celebrities on this joyous occasion, said Divya Kumar Jain, the brides brother, before the star parade among the 800-odd guests began at Nalban.																								The dominant theme was Om Shanti Om. For the past three years, Calcutta has been trying to adopt the Bollywood style of sangeet so popular in Mumbai and Delhi, said Vinod Bhandari of Wedding Xtraordinaire at Nalban on Monday.																								The small screen was represented by Shekhar Suman and Mini Mathur as emcees for the evening, Benaf Dadachanji, Baby in Baa Bahu Aur Baby, and Pulkit Samrat, who plays Lakshya in the TRP-topper Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.																								The big bang came from Bollywood with Malaika Arora dancing to a medley of Maiya Maiya, Aaj ki raat, Crazy kiya re and, of course, Chhaiya Chhaiya. If our presence makes it more memorable when they go back to the album in the years ahead, then why not? smiled Malaika, justifying her presence at the family function. Sonu Nigam and his troupe set the tone for a tuneful sangeet, while Raima Sen and Geeta Basra also took the stage.																								But shining the brightest on this star-spangled evening was OSO star Deepika Padukone. Dressed in a red chiffon sari, she said: When I come to functions like these I feel so special. It makes me realise what one movie can do. All those who havent seen the film, please do, she said before wishing the couple, Happiness Always. And yes, she did sway to the Om Shanti Om title track.

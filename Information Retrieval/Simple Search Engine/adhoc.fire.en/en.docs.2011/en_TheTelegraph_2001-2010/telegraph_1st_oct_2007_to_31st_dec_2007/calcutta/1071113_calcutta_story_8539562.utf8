				 Swifter disposal by Lok Adalats
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The state legal aid services committee is trying to dispose of long-pending cases through Lok Adalats, in an attempt to lessen the load on courts.																								Around 1.1 million cases are now pending in Calcutta High Court and lower courts across the state.																								Resolution of cases through Lok Adalats will cut down the figure, said Justice Pinaki Ghosh, a judge of the high court and the chairman of the committee, which functions under the state legal aid services authority.																								The committee is also trying to settle disputes before the matters reach court.																								Soon after taking over as chairman in August, Justice Ghosh launched a drive to spread awareness about the functioning of the legal aid committee.																								The committee provides lawyers free to people with an annual income less than Rs 50,000, deserted women and the mentally challenged to fight their cases in various courts, including the Supreme Court.																								We are trying to reach the common people  especially the underprivileged and those belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes  and explain to them how they can take our help in their quest for justice, the judge said on Monday.																								The Centre had enacted the Legal Aid Services Authority Act in 1987, making it mandatory for the states to set up legal aid services authorities. The state government had given effect to the act in 1998, following which several legal aid committees were formed to function at the state and district levels.																								All the committees are accountable to the State Legal Aid Services Authority.																								The office of the state legal aid committee is on the first floor of a building premises at 2 and 3 Kiron Shankar Roy Road.

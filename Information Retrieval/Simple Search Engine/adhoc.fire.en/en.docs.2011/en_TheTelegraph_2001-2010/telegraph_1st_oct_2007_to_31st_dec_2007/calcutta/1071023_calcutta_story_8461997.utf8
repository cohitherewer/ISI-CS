 															- Puja awards inspire organisers to look ahead, learn and improve A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The 41 Pally pandal, adjudged Model Puja 2007. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Ashche bochhor abar hobe (Once more, next year)  even as the idol is consigned to the river, this cry rises like a pledge renewed. The CESC The Telegraph Puja Award has been announced for the year, but the participants are already busy chalking out plans to keep up the good work in their para till Puja 2008.																								We can now run our orphanage better, was how 41 Pally puja chief coordinator Dipankar Chatterjee reacted to the news of being chosen Model Puja 2007, with a booty of Rs 50,000. The club so far was providing educational facilities for 35 young inmates. We will be able to provide them with sports and fitness facilities, too, he added.																								The True Spirit award is not a contest, but a celebration of what the Puja ought to be. Otherwise, organisers like Senhati Club in Behala would not have made it to the top six. We will never change the character of our puja to join the race for awards. Our pandal ambience is that of a community get-together. We do not want rituals to become secondary to some theme conceived by an outsider, states Surajit Bhattacharya. Senhati Durgotsav Samity plans to stick to tradition next year too, while allocating the Four Star award amount of Rs 20,000 to round-the-year activities like eye camps and blood donation drives.																								Taking the theme path but not deviating from its social commitment is Yuvak Gosthi in Thakurpukur. The work on the theme puja was done by us, the residents, under the guidance of a para art teacher. Both the initiative and funds came from residents, says Subhas Sinha, insisting that this has boosted community spirit and initiative. A doctor treats patients for free every week in the locality. On Dashami, a health camp was held. This award will boost our efforts, adds the Four Star winner.																								If there is one common rallying point among the 225 True Spirit participants it is a commitment to care, from one Durga puja to another.

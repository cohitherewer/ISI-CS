				 Firms warm to model slum plan
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Private developers have agreed to join hands with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to execute a Rs 120-crore model housing scheme for slum-dwellers in east Calcutta.																								Representatives of Bengal Peerless, Bengal Ambuja, DCL, Forum, Silver Spring, Srachi and other companies  all having a tie-up with one or the other state development agency  attended a meeting called by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya last Tuesday and expressed interest in being involved in such projects.																								The first such project will roll out in the Rajarhat-Katcharipara-Hatgachhia belt in east Calcutta, where the CMC arranged a visit for the private developers on Monday.																								The CMC wants the developers to construct apartments for each of the 6,480 families living in a slum in the area. The rate of construction will be fixed by the civic body.																								The developers told me that they would be happy to be associated with a social uplift scheme like the model housing estate for slum-dwellers, the mayor told Metro. We want several companies to be involved in the project, because that would ensure completion of the project involving construction of more than 6,000 flats  at the earliest.																								The specification of the apartments and the cost per square foot will be fixed later, said civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.																								The project, being taken up under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, will cost Rs 120.92 crore. Half the cost will be borne by the Centre and 30 per cent will be shared by the civic authorities and the state government. 																								The slum-dwellers will have to cough up the rest. 																								A civic source said each family will have to shell out around Rs 1.4 lakh. Each flat will have its own toilet and kitchen.																								Once the housing estate comes up in the place of the slum, around 15 acres of land will be released, which can be put to commercial use.

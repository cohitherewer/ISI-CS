 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sweety Sahu and husband Rakesh have lodged a formal complaint against Golabari thanas inspector-in-charge. A Telegraph picture																								Sweety Sahu and her husband Rakesh have lodged a formal complaint against the additional inspector-in-charge of Golabari police station, Prasun Kumar Biswas, for exerting pressure on the girl to part company with her husband and return to her father in Mumbai.																								The couple met Howrahs superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh at his office at Telkalghat Road and handed over the letter to him. Singh said: Sweety and Rakesh had come to me and they handed over the petition to me. They alleged in their petition that the additional inspector-in-charge of Golabari police station had pressured Sweety to go back to her parents. I have asked the additional superintendent of police (town) Prasun Kumar Biswas to inquire into the allegation. If the additional inspector-in-charge is found guilty, he will be punished.																								In their complaint, the couple alleged: We were being harassed and threatened repeatedly by the said officer. He wanted us to part company. We went to the officer in the police station to inform him about our marriage. But to our surprise, he pressured us to part ways and go back to our parents. He even compelled us to spent the night in the police station. 																								The couple had met the superintendent of police on November 7 and told him of their woes. 																								The superintendent assured the couple of all help, including police protection. 																								The couple felt reassured after meeting the superintendent. Sweetys husband, Rakesh, said: After we met the superintendent on November 7, policemen from Golabari police station have been visiting our home frequently to find out if we needed any help. Now, we are breathing easy. But we are scared of visiting Mumbai so that my wife can appear in court. This would allow my father-in-law to take revenge on us. He is an influential person. Besides, we have no money to visit to Mumbai. We are considering meeting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and seek his help.																								Rakesh, 24, and Sweety 21, married in March. Hunuman Mal Tater, Sweetys father, who kept pressuring Sweety to leave Rakesh, moved to Mumbai as the director of a financial company in April. He persuaded Sweety to accompany him for a few days but would not allow her to return.

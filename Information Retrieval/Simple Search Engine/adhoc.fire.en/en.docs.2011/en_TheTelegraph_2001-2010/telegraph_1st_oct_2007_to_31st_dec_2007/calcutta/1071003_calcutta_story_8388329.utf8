 A STAFF REPORTER																								Snehasish Ganguly, elder brother of Sourav, had introduced the Todis to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.																								This was revealed during the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) probe into the role of police officers in the run-up to the mysterious death of Rizwanur Rahman.

Snehasish, 39, did not deny his role in introducing Todi to the citys top cop in the first week of September.																								I have known the Todis for a long time. A few weeks ago, they came to me with a family problem and requested me to get them an appointment with the police commissioner, the former Bengal captain told Metro.																								When Prasun Mukherjee agreed, I went and introduced Pradip Todi (younger brother of Ashok Todi) to him on September 7. I know nothing more about the matter, concluded Snehasish.																								The very next day, Rizwanur and Priyanka were called to Lalbazar and the youth was given a choice  let your wife go back to her parents for a week or face arrest on charges of abduction and theft of valuables, slapped by Ashok Todi. 																								Priyanka went home on September 8 and never returned to Rizwanur, who was found dead on September 21.																								The role of the elder Ganguly brother came to light following the questioning of Ashok Todi, owner of the Rs 200-crore-plus Lux Hosiery Industries, by the CID on Thursday.

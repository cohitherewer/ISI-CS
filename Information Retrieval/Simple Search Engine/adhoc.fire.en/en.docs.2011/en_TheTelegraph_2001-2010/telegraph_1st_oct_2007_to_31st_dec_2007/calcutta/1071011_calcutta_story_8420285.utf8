				 Robbers attack old couple
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Two youths raided the Park Circus flat of a former deputy commissioner of police, assaulted him and his wife with a chopper and fled with ornaments and garments worth about Rs 25,000 on Wednesday evening.																								On being informed by local residents, a team from Beniapukur police station took the couple  Mrinal Kanti Ghosh Roy, 79, and Kalpana  to National Medical College and Hospital.																								They were later shifted to a nursing home, where their condition was stated to be stable at night. The elderly couple lived alone in the flat. Their only son is settled abroad.																								Its difficult to assess the extent of loss right now. It seems the youths have taken away ornaments and garments worth Rs 25,000, said an officer of the police station.																								A preliminary investigation suggests the youths, in their mid-20s, entered the apartment block on Darga Road through the main gate and walked up the stairs to reach Ghosh Roys flat.																								As Kalpana opened the door responding to the bell, the youths sprang upon her and hit her on the head with a chopper. Hearing her screams, Ghosh Roy rushed out but he, too, was hit on the head with the weapon.																								While the couple lay on the floor in a pool of blood, groaning in pain, the youths snatched the jewellery Kalpana was wearing and took the other valuables from one of the two almirahs.																								Alarmed by Ghosh Roys cries for help, some local residents rushed to the flat and informed the police station.																								Later, sleuths from the detective department, along with senior officers, came to the apartment and conducted an investigation.

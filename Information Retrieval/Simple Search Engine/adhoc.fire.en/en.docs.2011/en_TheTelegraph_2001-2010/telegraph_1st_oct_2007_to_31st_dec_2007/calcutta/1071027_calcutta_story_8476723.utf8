				 Civic one-time sop for small units
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								The civic authorities have come up with a one-time concession for over 1,000 small units in the industrial estates run by the state small industries development corporation in Kasba, Behala, Pagladanga, Blackburn Lane and other pockets.																								The package will enable small entrepreneurs to get their sheds mutated in their name. The owners will also have their property tax dues waived and illegal sheds approved against payment of only the sanctioning fee.																								The small industries development corporation has been running half a dozen industrial estates across the city for small-scale entrepreneurs for the past 30 years. Most sheds in the estates came up without the approval of the civic building department.																								The unit-owners and the estate authorities had objected to the rate of property tax slapped by the civic body, resulting in accumulation of dues over decades.																								Several sheds have changed hands over the years, with the new owners refusing to clear the dues. As a result, the sheds have not been mutated in the name of the current owners.																								The civic authorities have come up with the concession package in an attempt to clear the irregularities.																								As part of the package, the property tax of the units will be fixed following discussions between the civic body and small industries development corporation.																								The unit-owners will not have to cough up property tax dues and can get the sheds mutated in their name by paying only the current tax.																								The civic body will not impose any surcharge or development fee for sanctioning the sheds that came up without the building departments approval. Payment of only the sanctioning fee will be enough.																								The package has been finalised following talks between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the small industries development corporation, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.																								We will give post facto approval to the sheds if the corporation produces clearance from other agencies, like the fire brigade and police, said civic director-general (building) Gorachand Mondol.

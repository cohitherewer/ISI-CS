		 Of human bondage																																	Adapted from the Marathi play, Mitra, by Shirish Athwale, Gandhars latest production, Kachher Manush, is an intense and touching story of human relationships. It is the story of the protagonists ultimate realisation of the oneness of mans soul, as British poet Robert Browning once said, ...in earth the broken arks, in heaven the perfect round.. What is heaven? We know not. Perhaps it is here we can make our own heaven if we erase the fragments that constitute each of us. Dadasaheb Purohit is an old widower. Honest, idealistic, and outspoken, Purohit is conventional in his staunch hatred for dalits, the lower-caste. His children have inherited the same beliefs, but are removed as they remain pre-occupied with their own lives. They are emotionally detached from him. Dadasaheb protests against the violence indulged in by the dalits, who resort to these activities when disrespect is shown to the statue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, their messiah. In the ensuing trouble, Dadasaheb is assaulted and this leaves him paralysed. Rendered helpless, Dadasaheb finds little willingness on the part of his children to do anything for him: his son, in spite of knowing his hatred for dalits, is forced to hurriedly appoint experienced dalit physiotherapist Savitribai Rupvate to help him recover. He cannot accept it and erupts every now and then. But as he gets better, he gradually learns to depend on his only companion  Rupvate. He is cured not only of the paralysis, but also of his equally paralysing prejudices. The play is adapted into Bengali by Kamal Sanyal and Bijoylakshmi Barman. Direction: Gautam Halder, filmmaker.

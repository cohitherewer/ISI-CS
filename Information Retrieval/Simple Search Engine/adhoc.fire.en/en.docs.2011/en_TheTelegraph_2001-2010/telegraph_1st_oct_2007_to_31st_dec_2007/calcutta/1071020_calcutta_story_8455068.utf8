				 Crowd count surges
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A clear Ashtami sky drew out pandal-hoppers in large numbers, all eager to make up for the loss owing to the rain on Saptami morning.																								The crowds swelled as the day progressed, causing snarls on key arteries, including Rashbehari Avenue, Diamond Harbour Road (up to Behala), Biren Roy Road (East) in New Alipore, the Kasba connector to the EM Bypass and stretches of Chittaranjan Avenue.																								We were not prepared for the crowd that hit the road from noon. Though traffic was generally under control, there were snarls in some places, said an officer of the traffic police department.																								The Metro Railway, too, saw a surge in passenger turnout, thanks to the pandal-hoppers.																								Pritam Mukherjee, standing in the queue to enter the Mudiali Club pandal, said: We had to cancel our plans yesterday morning We went to some pandals last night. Today, we plan to visit the others that we had shortlisted.																								Among the pandals that registered the maximum footfall were Mohammad Ali Park, College Square, Ekdalia Evergreen (picture left), Mudiali Club, Santosh Mitra Square, 41 Pally, Maniktala Chaltabagan, Naktala Udayan Sangha and Barisha Club.																								We have no complaints. Every year, its the same. Well be happy if we could see Mohammad Ali Park and College Square in 90 minutes, said Ashok Jana, from Bally. 																								He was keen on wrapping up pandal-hopping by the evening. Things will get worse after that.																								With the Met office predicting fair weather on Navami, too, the crowd count on Saturday is likely to beat the Ashtami high.																								We have deployed around 15,000 personnel to manage the crowd and traffic. It is a difficult task, but we will try our best, said Ranvir Kumar, the joint commissioner of police (traffic).

				 Gangster gunshot kills Tiljala trader
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Tiljala trader was shot dead near his house early on Tuesday. Three youths have been detained and a search is on for the alleged mastermind.																								All four were with Mohammad Alimuddin, the victim, on Monday night.																								Police said Alimuddin, 25, who ran a bag-making unit at home, and the other four youths went to sleep on the roof of a three-storeyed building in Brick Field Lane, off GJ Khan Road.																								My wife woke me up around 4.15am and told me that Alimuddin was shot dead, said Mohammad Salauddin, the victims elder brother.																								We ran to the roof and saw Alimuddins blood-stained body. A bullet had pierced his forehead. Three of the youths who were with him were there, but the fourth, Sheikh Kalia, was absconding. We suspect he was the mastermind behind the murder, Salauddin added.																								We saw the youths talking among themselves for a long time before going to sleep, said Sheikh Sarifuddin, a neighbour of Alimuddin. The residents of the area woke up hearing a gunshot. Some of us also saw a person fleeing the locality.																								The superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), Praveen Kumar, said Alimuddin had a criminal background.																								He was involved in criminal activities in the area, though of late he had dissociated himself from his gang. He had also organised a campaign against extortionists of the area and earned the wrath of the local gangsters, said an officer working on the case.																								Alimuddins mother Akbari Begum told the police that her son was leading a reformed life. She said Alimuddin was killed because he was trying to sever links with his friends who are still into crime, the officer added.																								Police superintendent Kumar said: We have come across some crucial clues in the case. We have launched a hunt for Kalia.

				 Trouble on flight over food
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Food sparked a fight between three passengers and the crew on a JetLite flight from Mumbai on Monday night.																								The airline officials said the passengers had pushed a food trolley towards an air hostess after she told them the airline had run out of non-vegetarian food. The passengers complained of harassment and misbehaviour by the crew.																								Tapas Kumar Hazra, an advocate of Calcutta High Court and a central government counsel, was travelling with daughter Monica, a law student in Pune, and his cousin Ishani Banerjee. They were on seats 18D, E and F on JetLites S2306 flight that took off from Mumbai around 8.15pm.																								After half an hour, the air hostesses started serving dinner. When an air hostess brought the food trolley to our seat, we asked for non-vegetarian meals, said Hazra. She told him that non-vegetarian food wasnt available and explained that the airline has been carrying 80 per cent vegetarian and 20 per cent non-vegetarian food during Navratri.																								Hazra said that he had asked for a complaint book. The crew gave me a white piece of paper and an envelope, and claimed that the complaint book was not available, he said. The flight captain, too, allegedly refused to help him.																								The plane touched down around 10.45pm. The airline officials told Hazra, Monica and Ishani that they would not be allowed to leave the airport as there were complaints against them.																								They misbehaved with an air hostess and pushed a trolley towards her, said a JetLite official. The three were taken to airport police station. 																								Hazra lodged a complaint against the airline. The trio were allowed to leave the police station at 2am.

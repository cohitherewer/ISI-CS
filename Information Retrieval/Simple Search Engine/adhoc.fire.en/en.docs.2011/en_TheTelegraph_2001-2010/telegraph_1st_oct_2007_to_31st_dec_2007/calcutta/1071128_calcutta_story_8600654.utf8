				 Middle Ages foundry in Howrah slams gates shut
 																											- Signboard off, activity behind closed unit door A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The massive aluminium gates of Shakti Industries, in Howrah, shut and with the signboard removed on Tuesday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Shakti Industries, a foundry unit at 51 Benaras Road, in Howrah, slammed its gates shut on Tuesday, removed its signboard and blamed the closure on labour trouble.																								The Telegraph had on Tuesday carried a New York Times story on the foundry that supplies manhole covers to New York.																								The story highlighted the plight of the foundry workers, subjected to inhuman conditions like something from the Middle Ages.																								It was difficult to locate Shakti Industries on Tuesday afternoon, despite having the address in hand. Factory workers on the bustling Benaras Road finally pointed to towering aluminium gates with no signboard.																								Otai Shakti (That is Shakti), confirmed a passerby. A discoloured patch with drilled holes bore telltale signs of a signboard that had been there till Monday evening. Kal obdhi to chhilo board ta, aaj khule phelechhe (The signboard was there till yesterday. They must have removed it today), he observed.																								The bid to enter Shakti Industries proved futile. We have orders not to allow anybody inside. The factory is closed because of labour trouble.... No, the owner isnt here. No, not even the manager, droned a security guards voice through a narrow opening in the factory gates.																								Through the same gap in the gates, Metro spied movement of men and goods on the premises, belying claims of labour trouble.																								Some workers from an adjoining unit stepped forward. We do not know what happens inside Shakti. Everything is very hush-hush, said Laltu Deb, a moulder from Howrah Iron Cast Factory.																								A nearby tea shop frequented by workers from Shakti wore a deserted look. They all come here during a tea break around 4pm, offered Shibu, the tea-seller. Till 5pm, no worker emerged from behind those closed gates.																								Kanak Das, the secretary of Centre for Indian Trade Unions, Howrah, said: I have no knowledge of any foundry being closed today due to labour trouble.																								Subrata Mukherjee, the state president of the Indian National Trade Union Congress, added: I did not know foundry workers in Howrah work in such inhuman conditions. I shall send a team to the factory to probe the allegation.

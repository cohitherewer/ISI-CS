				 Litter bins on roads
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The litter bins that the civic body has decided to install across the city. A Telegraph picture																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to place 30,000 litter bins on roads across the city by March 2008.																								We have started placing the bins. By this Puja, the civic conservancy department plans to install around 3,000 bins on 21 thoroughfares, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.																								Around 900 trash bins have been placed on Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani, New Park Street, Chittaranjan Avenue, APC Road, AJC Bose Road, Gol Park and in Gariahat, said mayoral council member (solid waste management) Chandana Ghosh Dastidar.																								The civic authorities estimate the project will cost Rs 15 crore. The CMC has approached the Bengal Engineering and Science University to design trash bins that would be more durable and easier to handle than the present ones and would also cost less.																								The university is likely to give us the design by this month, said chief engineer (solid waste management) Arun Sarkar. A trash bin now costs over Rs 6,000. We hope the new ones will be cheaper.																								The CMC is convinced that it is not possible for the 12,000-odd civic sweepers to keep the city clean unless the residents play their part. Some of us had suggested spot fines or other penal action against litter bugs, but I think we must first give the citizens a chance to keep their city clean. Hence, our decision to place the 30,000-odd bins where the people can dump litter like chocolate wrappers, banana peels and waste paper.																								A joint effort by the civic conservancy department, householders, shopkeepers, councillors, NGOs and private agencies can help change the citys looks, feels the mayor.

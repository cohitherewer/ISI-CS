				 Lessons from film magazines
														 Calcuttan of the week																								Name: Satyanarayan Ray, or Satish (picture left by 																								Bishwarup Dutta), from Seohar district of Bihar 																								Age: About 12 years 																								Job: Minding a newspaper stall outside Chandni Chowk Metro station every day except Sunday 																								Dream: To study in a school and play cricket for Team India 																								School years: There was a story about a tiger and a fox and one about a king who could change things to gold. He had loved to read them and knew all the rhymes in his school book by heart. But now stories for Satyanarayan, or Satish, mean newspaper copies and stories about film stars. Satish hasnt been to school for two years, he cant afford to  as he sells newspapers, magazines and posters from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. I studied at Sheela Day School on Ripon Street for seven years from pre-nursery to Class IV, he says, wistfully adding that he left only when his father, a car mechanic, fell ill. 																								All work: Life changed overnight. His mother, two sisters and a brother had to return to their village Pasuari Biaz in Bihar and he and his father began hawking newspapers. While his father Ramakant hawks newspapers in the New Market and Treasure Island area, Satish minds a stall just outside the Chandni Metro station. But Satish makes the most of his new situation. 																								As he sits overlooking the colourful spread of dailies and magazines with a backdrop of calendars and posters of gods, film stars and cuddly babies, he reads almost anything that takes his fancy. Since childrens magazines find no takers in this area, his choice is limited to newspapers and film journals like Stardust, Anandalok and Saras Salil. The Hindi daily Prabhat Khabar reminds Satish of Bihar and sisters Amrita and Rani and brother Guddy who loves fish. So Prabhat Khabar starts his day after he opens shop early each morning. But he adds: I love reading the sports page of English newspapers.																								Some play: Cricket comes second to reading. Every Sunday while his father cooks spicy fish in their makeshift home on the stairs of the Nandaram market in Burrabazar, Satish sits reading or playing galli cricket with friends Moni, Suraj and BK. His yearning for school has led him to device his own tasks. In between handing out papers and handling change Satish sits calculating Kumbles scores on the back of a bunch of old bills. After all one of his dreams is to play in Team India, the other to return to school. 																 Handed childrens magazines like Suktara and Magic Pot Satish is overjoyed. In two hours he has finished reading the mystery story in Suktara but found to his dismay that Magic Pot was too childish. By the next day father Ramakant had added the two magazines to the items on sale, he has no illusions that in the end it is business that Satish must learn to survive. 						SEBANTI SARKAR

 															- OTHER STATES JOIN TOURISM FEST
 A STAFF REPORTER
																								The West Bengal tourism festival, to be held in the New Year, is all set to go national with the participation of other states.
																								The festival, an annual feature since 2003, will be held at Nalban Ecopark and Water Sports Complex from January 2 to 13, and will be open from noon to 9pm. It aims to project Bengal as a major tourist destination.
																								Five days of the festival will be dedicated to the five partner states. Speaking at the curtainraiser on Friday, state tourism minister Manabendra Mukherjee said: Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, along with Bengal, will partner the tourism festival this year. The other participating states are Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Tripura.
																								The festival will provide a platform to the states to highlight their tourism potential, including their art, culture, dance and music, said T.V.N. Rao, the managing director of the state tourism development corporation.
																								Elaborating on the reason for organising the festival, Rao said: The idea is to take tourism in Bengal to the national level. We want this festival to become one of the premier ones in the country.
																								The stalls at the venue will provide all necessary tourism-related information to the visitors and the kiosks will display the arts and crafts of the states.
																								There will also be a food plaza on the waterbody. Hotel Astor, Tamarind, Red Hot Chilli Pepper, Bhojohari Manna, Hotel Hindusthan International and Kenilworth, among others, will set up stalls.
																								The states will also put up traditional performances to add to the ambience of the festival, said Mukherjee.

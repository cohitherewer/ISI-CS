				 Reshuffle in police ranks
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								The officer-in-charge of Topsia police station, Gobordhan Panda, was on Tuesday transferred to the detective department. D.K. Aich became the new officer-in-charge of the police station.																								The state government is keen to find out more about Wednesdays riots. Many of the rioters came from Topsia, so Panda can help in preparing a detailed report. Aich was selected as his replacement, keeping in mind that he worked as an additional officer-in-charge of the police station, said a senior officer at Lalbazar. 																								The reshuffle also saw Jawed Shamim take over as the new city police detective chief. Ajoy Kumar had held the post before being shunted out over the Rizwanur Rahman case. 																								Vineet Goyel is now the deputy commissioner (headquarters). 																								Deputy commissioner (north) Damayanti Sen will replace Goyel as deputy commissioner (special branch). 																								S.K. Gazner, the CID officer working with East Midnapore district police for rehabilitation of the homeless, has been drafted into Calcutta police as deputy commissioner (second battalion). The post of deputy commissioner (south) has not been filled up.

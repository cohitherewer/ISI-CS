		 The long road home																																	Abanchhita, meaning unwanted, addresses the social stigmas attached to the girl child. It narrates the story of a family where a son has married and his wife is expecting a child. On the insistence of the father-in-law, the would-be mother undergoes a foetus test and it is finally known that the child is a girl. The father-in-laws worst fears, as if, are realised. The birth of the child is not celebrated. That day, the man decides to get the child killed and hires a murderer. In the stealth of the dark night, the man takes the child to the jungle, but his conscience stops him from committing the dreadful deed. He takes the child home and brings her up. The family then witnesses the birth of the much desired male child. With indulgence this child grows up to become a highly irresponsible and wasteful young man while the girl becomes a lawyer. The family now realises the utter shamefulness of their act and are too happy to accept the girl child as their own. The story hits out at the age-old presumptions which the oppressive patriarchal society associates with the girl child.

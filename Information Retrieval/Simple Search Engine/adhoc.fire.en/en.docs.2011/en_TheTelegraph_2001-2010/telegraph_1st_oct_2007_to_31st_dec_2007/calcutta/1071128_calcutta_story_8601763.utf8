				 IT park green twin
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Sector V is set to have its second green building after Technopolis by June 2008, with the PS Srijan Tech Park plugging in to add 500,000 sq ft of environment-friendly space to the citys IT district.																								The tallest monolithic IT park in Calcutta, soaring 16 levels and coming up opposite Manikanchan, is being developed by the PS Group and Srijan Group. Being built at a cost of Rs 100 crore, the green structure hopes to earn over Rs 50 lakh worth of carbon credits (incentive for reduction of greenhouse gases) through energy savings annually, according to an Ernst amp; Young estimate.																								Worldwide, sick building syndrome, a fallout of unhealthy working conditions, has been fuelling attrition rates, even as people are becoming more and more health-conscious. We took a green position with the IT park, since we felt it would soon become basic hygiene and mandatory, Pradip Chopra, the chairman and managing director of PS Group, said on Tuesday.																								With a planned indoor fresh air quality of 20 cfm (cubic ft per minute) per person, the tech park is the largest LEED (Leadership in Environment Engineering amp; Design) gold-rated green building in the world, providing direct workplace for around 5,000 professionals, say the developers.																								A green building gets the US Green Building Councils LEED certification if it saves 20 per cent more energy, 35 per cent water, 38 per cent solid waste and 30 per cent construction waste compared to an ordinary building. Technopolis was Indias first IT infrastructure conforming to LEED norms.																								Architecturally, the PS Srijan Tech Park is different from Technopolis, though the basic principles are the same. The five-level car park, the lobby landscaping and mix of solid and void create an exciting experience, said J.P. Agrawal, who designed both the green IT domains.																								While talks are on with the software heavyweights, the developers would like to retain STP (software technology park) status by renting out space to a minimum of 30 tenants.																								The IT workspace will also have a bicycle parking lot, to encourage professionals to cycle to work and reduce carbon emission. A charging station for electric vehicles is also being planned.																								The cost of developing a green building is around Rs 500 per sq ft extra. However, in todays scenario, its a huge risk if you are not going green. You could be saddled with office space no one wants to take up. For end-users, it translates into better employee health, higher productivity, lower attrition and lower operation costs, Chopra added.

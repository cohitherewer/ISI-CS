				 Advanced options in diabetes therapy
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Molecular drugs, cell transplants and state-of-the-art equipment are the new hopes for diabetics in the city.																								Advances in medical science have made it possible to measure the blood glucose level more accurately and administer insulin more easily.																								GLP 1 Analogue, a molecular drug available in Calcutta for a couple of weeks, is one of the new treatment options. It has proved more effective than standard methods in controlling the glucose level.																								The drug works in the gastrointestinal tract and controls the spread of glucose in the body, Tirthankar Chowdhury, diabetologist and endocrinologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals said on the eve of World Diabetes Day on Wednesday.																								GLP 1 Analogue helps decrease the absorption rate of glucose by the gastrointestinal tract and stimulates beta cells, which secrete insulin, according to the doctor.																								Other molecular drugs are on the way. Rapid progress has been made on development of non-invasive glucometers. Infrared technology is being tried for measuring the glucose level without pricking the skin. There are technical difficulties to be overcome, though, added Chowdhury. 																								The focus is on making the body produce more beta cells. The researchers are trying to make pancreatic duct cells produce insulin. Stem cells can also be used. There are, however, safety issues to address, said city-based endocrinologist Sudip Chatterjee.																								Consultant physician Sukumar Mukherjee said: Understanding of diabetes at a molecular level has opened up avenues. Newer drugs to control the risk factor in adult diabetes are being developed now. 																								Closed loop real-time insulin pump, which senses the glucose level and then injects the appropriate dose of insulin, is another treatment option in the development stage. Open loop pumps, in which the delivery of the insulin dose has to be programmed manually, are available.

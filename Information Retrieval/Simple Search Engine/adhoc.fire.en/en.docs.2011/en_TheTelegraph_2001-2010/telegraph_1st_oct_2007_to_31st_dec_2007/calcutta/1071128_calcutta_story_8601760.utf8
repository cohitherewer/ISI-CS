  Ground reality: Apropos the report Better deals bring artisans online, September 12, it is good that some artisans are getting fair price for their products, thanks to the Internet. Unfortunately, the Internet remains out of bounds for many talented rural artisans. They remain totally dependent on middlemen. Many great artisans of the past also had to spend their lives in penury despite huge demand for their products at home and abroad. The benefit of Internet has come too late for them.  Violation of rules has become the rule at National Library as the report 500 fake cards in library, September 21, shows. Irregularities, corruption and smuggling out of rare books seem to threaten the very existence of the library.  The circulation of 500 fake membership cards, mostly among foreign nationals, show the authorities in poor light. The reason the cards were issued  to spare applicants the trouble of going through the elaborate membership process  says much about the sorry state of affairs. The foreigners who misused the facilities naturally do not care about the library as much as they care about their own research.  The extent of the problem suggests that a large section of employees is involved in malpractice. Senior officials, too, are guilty. Otherwise, at least some of them would have taken steps.  The library employees in their greed for easy money are destroying a national treasure. They should be meted harsh punishment.  B.N. Bose,
 Dum Dum Park  The dumping of two newborn girls wrapped in a gunny bag in a bush near Behala airport is shocking (Dumped, twin girls die, September 11). We often hear of such cases and in almost all of them it is the girl child that is left to die. Babies are innocent and must be allowed to live. Those who try to kill children need to be punished without mercy.  Tracing the culprits in such cases is a challenge, but can be done with cooperation of hospitals and nursing homes. Those who do want to raise their baby should be allowed to easily hand them over to orphanages for adoption.  Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
 Behala  Apropos the report JEE tests ticked off, September 12, students and their parents are as guilty in the JEE scam as the coaching centres that fielded the dummy candidates. The coaching centres would have closed down if the guardians and students did not take up their unfair offers. An overhaul of the exam system is a must to ensure that only deserving candidates get through.  Ranjita Kar,
 Rishra  Apropos the report Drowning in JU pond, September 14, ponds, canals and rivers abound in the state. Given that numerous people drown in these every year, school and college students can be given mandatory swimming lessons during summer and puja vacations by teachers who are good at it.  Prahlad Agarwala,
 Majdia, Nadia  That the authorities are planning to improve roads is good news (Rs 650-cr plan to unclog roads, September 13). In addition to widening some roads, the heights of Beleghata bridge, Narkeldanga Main Road bridge and Maniktala Main Road bridge need to be raised  so that the Canal East and Canal West roads can pass under them. The two roads currently merge with the bridges, causing traffic snarls and occasionally, accidents.  Raising the heights of the bridges will reduce traffic jams and mishaps in the area.  Shyamal Kumar Datta, 
 Salt Lake  Apropos the report Adhesive addiction among station kids, September 19, it is unfortunate that the lives of kids who are forced to live in stations are being made even more miserable by adhesive addiction. The society is to blame for the plight of these children, who have no access to the bare minimum facilities to lead a healthy life. Smoking is also rampant among street children. Crackdown by police is not the only way to stop the practice. Each of us must contribute to rehabilitate these children.  Ratan Kumar Halder,
 Behala  Apropos the report Online nod for township plans, September 12, it is good to know that Hidco is moving in the right direction. Online plan approval will save plot-owners a lot of time, while Hidco will not have to employ people to receive forms. The city civic body will hopefully take a similar step.  Sourish Misra,
 Salt Lake  Apropos the report Run down hospital shunned by patients, September 6, there was a time when government hospitals were well looked after by the authorities. Now, not only are they ignored but their infrastructure is feeling the strain of age. There are many state-run hospitals in the city that are in as bad a shape as Ramrik Das Haralalka Hospital is. The government agencies play the blame game while they rot.  Atif Ayaz,
 Address not given  The report Endless moan of air, November 16, resurrected the horror of the super cyclone of 1999. The cyclone hit Orissa on October 29 and not October 17.  Rajiv Bhattacharya,

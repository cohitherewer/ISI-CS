 							 - CBI probe cited for adjournment A STAFF REPORTER				 				 (From top): Ajoy Kumar, Gyanwant Singh, Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das at Bhabani Bhavan on Monday. Pictures by Amit Datta 																								Four police officers, including two senior IPS officers, appeared before the state human rights commission on Monday in connection with the Rizwanur Rahman case. 																								The hearing was, however, adjourned on a petition by the officers lawyers, appealing for postponement of the inquiry. The lawyers cited the ongoing CBI inquiry on the high courts order as the reason.																								The commission adjourned the hearing to December 18. The last date for the CBI to submit the inquiry report is December 16. We will decide on our course of action after the high court passes it judgment, said Braja Mahapatra, the secretary of the state human rights commission.																								The four officers  former deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh, former deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar, assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das  entered the commissions office at Bhavani Bhavan around 12.30pm.																								The officers have been accused of interfering in the personal lives of Rizwanur and Priyanka Todi. The policemen had allegedly pressured Rizwanur to sever connections with his wife. The human rights commission started a suo motu inquiry into the matter. It had sought an explanation from former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee about his statements after Rizwanurs death on September 21.																								We had set the date of the hearing a month and a half ago, said Mahapatra.																								In a petition submitted on behalf of the officers, the lawyers pointed out that the CBI was probing Rizwanurs death and whether the policemen had a role in it. Another probe cannot be continued simultaneously. This was why we appealed for the commissions hearing to be adjourned, said Abhrajit Mitra, one of the lawyers.																								The four cops spent 40 minutes at the commissions office. Their lawyers filed the petition before the commission during this time. The officers refused comment on the matter.

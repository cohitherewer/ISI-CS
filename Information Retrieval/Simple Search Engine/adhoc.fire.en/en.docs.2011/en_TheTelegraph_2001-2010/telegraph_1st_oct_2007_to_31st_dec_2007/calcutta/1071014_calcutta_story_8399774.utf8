				 The pleasure of a bargain
														 inside out																								We are moving to Calcutta, declared my husband. Not that I am a weak woman, but this blow had me reeling. It took months for the idea to sink in, because my prejudiced mind refused to comply. But its been three years and when I am called a Kalkatiya, I dont mind that at all. 																								I remember how my first step on the rain-drenched Sealdah station platform confirmed all my fears. Born and bred in Rajasthan, I wondered how people breathe here. My lungs yearned for the dry and rough winds of the west.																								My oasis in this city, Anudidi, who is like an elder sister, and a combo of mother, cousin, friend and guide, taught me to wade and surf through the tides. She introduced me to the newspaper column of exhibitions and took me to Ice Skating Rink and Swabhumi for a grand sale.																								If a mans way to his heart is through his stomach, a womans is via her shopping bag. My sprees began and so did my liking for the city. Koto kore?  I learnt to shop for basics. I insist on renaming Calcutta as a shoppers paradise (sounds more appropriate than city of joy). 																								Calcutta gives you a freedom and satisfaction in living with however much your pocket allows. The next fascinating aspect of the city is the variety of communities that thrive here. Each has a flavour to add. The sights and sounds give me an insight into the underlying harmony of the human society that we take for granted. 																								On the naughtier side, I enjoy taking advantage as a woman. A cabbie would by-pass a queue to chivalrously serve a lady first, a sergeant would sometimes stop the traffic for her. A shopkeeper would mostly relent to your bargaining and a bus could stop to give you a lift. 																								There is no denying that Calcutta appears to be an unplanned, over-populated B-grade city. There is much to be done in raising the living standard and the quality of infrastructure. But as an outsider I have also seen growth towards a more powerful and conscious Calcutta.																								And not to miss the best  the ability of the people here to bunk work because of a deluge, to laze or to just reach out. When that is lost nothing else remains and I think Tomader Calcutta contains those little pleasures of life.

				 Priyanka items sent back
 															- TODI FRIEND CLAIMS SOME STUFF MISSING A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rukbanur Rahman and his mother Kishwar Jahan hand over Priyanka Todis items. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 																								Rizwanur Rahmans family on Wednesday handed over Priyanka Todis items that she had left behind at 7B Tiljala Lane to two employees of her father.																								A friend of the Todis later said Priyanka found the following things missing  15 CDs in a blue holder, a packet of keychains and small miscellaneous items, an Archies packet containing greeting cards, photographs that had been shown on TV, a small note pad and a duplicate copy of her birth certificate.																								Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur had earlier said that there were many CDs in their house and it was not possible to identify which ones were Priyankas. She had asked for 200 photographs but we could find only 143. Apart from the CDs and the photographs, we have returned everything to her representatives.																								Rukbanur asked Nazmul Karim Kazi and Narayan Chowdhury, who had come to receive the items, to search the house, but they declined.																								The items that the Rahmans handed over to the Todi men included four polythene bags stuffed with Priyankas clothes, a brown bag containing her toiletries and cosmetics, a yellow folder with her educational certificates, the original birth certificate, a pair of slippers, a black purse, 143 photographs, a diary, an address book, an autograph book, four shoppers cards, 12 letters, a few scribbles and greeting cards.																								Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan broke down as Karim took possession of the articles. If Priyanka had come herself, she could have identified all her items, she said. Rukbanurs wife videotaped the handover.

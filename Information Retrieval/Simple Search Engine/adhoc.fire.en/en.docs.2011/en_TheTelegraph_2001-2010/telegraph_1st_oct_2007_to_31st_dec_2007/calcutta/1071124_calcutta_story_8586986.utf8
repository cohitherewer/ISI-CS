				 Hawker case draws rap
 OUR LEGAL REPORTERThe high court on Friday gave the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) seven days to reveal its action plan for removing hawkers from eight important roads in the city.																								The court had given the CMC two months time in March this year to remove hawkers from the roads, most of which are in the central business district. The case did not come up for hearing after that. 																								The eight roads from which the hawkers have to be removed are Strand Road, Brabourne Road, Kali Krishna Tagore Street, Rabindra Sarani, Netaji Subhas Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kalakar Street and AJC Bose Road.																								We are giving you seven more days to inform us about the civic bodys action plan for removing hawkers from the roads. The CMC will also have to inform us what programme it has undertaken to implement the action plan for settling the hawker issue, stated the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Pinaki Ghosh on Friday. 																								The case will come for hearing on November 29.																								Nearly three years ago, the CMC, in an affidavit, had informed the court that it had drawn up a scheme to solve the hawker problem. 																								The aims of the blueprint included removal of hawkers from busy roads, clearing of encroachments on carriageways and eviction of hawkers from within 50 ft of crossings.																								The situation is getting worse by the day. But the CMC is yet to implement its action plan. Hawkers are still present on Brabourne Road and regularly cause traffic snarls. The civic body did not bother to carry out the earlier orders of the court, environment activist Subhas Dutta, the petitioner in the case, told the division bench. 																								Appearing for the civic body, advocate Alok Ghosh said: It is very difficult to solve the hawker problem. Whenever we try to remove them, they start a movement. The issue will have to be tackled slowly.																								The judges asserted: Enough is enough. We want a report by seven days.

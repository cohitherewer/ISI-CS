				 Suicide by ill man

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								A terminally ill man in his late 50s hanged himself at his Muchipara home on Sunday afternoon. He was afraid that his family would have to borrow money for his treatment, said police.
																								Dhrubojyoti Biswas, a telephone operator in West Bengal Poultry and Dairy Development Corporation, had been ill for a couple of years. He had suffered renal failure and was on dialysis, said an officer of Muchipara police station.
																								According to Biswass wife, son and daughter, he had taken his lunch, as instructed by doctors, around noon. The family members did not find anything wrong with Biswass behaviour. He even discussed the cost of his treatment with them, said an officer of the police station.
																								The family members suspected something was wrong after they noticed that the door to Biswass room was bolted from inside. When there was no response to knocks, they broke open the door to see Biswas hanging from the ceiling, added the officer.
																								Anil Jana, the officer-in-charge of the police station, said: Biswas had spent his lifes savings on his treatment. His family members, too, had spent thousands of rupees. He was afraid that the family would have to approach moneylenders.
																								Though no suicide note was found, the police have ruled out foul play. We have not yet found any evidence of abetment to suicide, said Jana.

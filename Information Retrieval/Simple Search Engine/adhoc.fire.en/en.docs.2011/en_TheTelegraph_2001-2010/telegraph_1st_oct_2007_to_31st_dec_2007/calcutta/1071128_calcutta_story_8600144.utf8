				 AC taxi a dial away
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Airconditioned Tata Indigo taxis will ply on the city roads from early next year.																								The state transport department has decided to initially grant permits to 300 such taxis. They can be summoned over the phone, said transport minister Subhas Chakraborty at Writers Buildings on Tuesday.																								Special phone booths will be set up at strategic points in the city, from where the taxis can be booked. Personal phones cannot be used to call a taxi. The passenger has to mention from where he or she wants to be picked up. 																								A hub will route the request to the appropriate driver. He will also be given the passengers phone number, added Chakraborty. 																								Like the existing taxis, the Indigo taxis will be privately owned. The fares will be 25 per cent higher than that in ordinary taxis. 																								Also, the meters of the new taxis will start to run as soon as the driver receives a request. The passenger has to pay for the distance the taxi travels to pick him or her up.																								Transport department officials said the 300 taxis would be on the road within the next two months. The number of taxis may be increased after gauging the public response.																								We have plans to increase the number of airconditioned taxis. Unless we are sure about their service, we cannot do so. We will keep an eye on the new taxis for a couple of months and then decide whether to increase their number, said a senior official. 																								BUS FLEET: Besides taxis, new buses are set to ply on the roads. The state cabinet on Tuesday approved a plan to buy 400 new buses. The bill will come to Rs 68 crore, with each bus costing Rs 17 lakh.																								Five per cent of the amount will be funded by transport corporations like the North Bengal State Transport Corporation, South Bengal State Transport Corporation and the Calcutta Tramways Company, said the transport minister. 																								The government will take the remaining amount as a loan from the state cooperative bank.

				 Party zone where everyones afraid
														 An open letter to the chief minister after a visit to Nandigram Guest Column
 Mudar Patherya																								Dear chief minister sir, 																								Considering that you have been too busy to go to a place called Nandigram in your state over the last few months, I thought I might zip down and keep you posted.																								Sir, please keep it a secret; some funny things are happening behind your back. 																								I visited the large Nandigram School with books and pencil boxes. There were no students; I found every single classroom occupied by women, men and their children. Somebody called them refugees. I kept hearing the words party all the time, but I could not see any balloons or festoons; only people with fear in their eyes.																								I asked the children Babu, ki poda-shona koro? (What do you study?) and one of them replied: Bomb ki rokom feylety hoy, dekhey-dekhey sheekhey gechhi (I have learnt how to hurl bombs just by watching others).																								I asked an old woman her name and she took her thumb and index finger and clasped her lips shut. 																								I asked the enthusiastic young Raju whether he cut his finger playing cricket. Oh, kichhu na, kaalkey shudhu I protested about something in the village, they caught me, chopped my finger with a knife and I survived by diving into a pond and swimming across it.																								I asked a 12-year-old why he was lying inside when he could well have been playing football outside and he replied: Kono din kheltey parbo na. Mathai gooli legechhe (Cant play ever. A bullet hit my head). 																								I asked the young woman with a two-year-old on her hip why she was not in her kitchen feeding her baby and she replied: Because in our village we have been asked to sleep at night with our doors unbolted.																								I asked a young man why he was not bothering to go home for days and he said: Chhilo. Jaani na ekhon aachhey ki na (I dont know if I still have any). 																								I told the old man with a beard what we had brought  blankets, rice, gur, chira, biscuits  and asked him what he wanted; he replied Proshaashon (administration). 																								I am thoroughly confused. Is there something you know that I dont? 																								Abaar jaabo. Aashbeyn? 						(THE WRITER IS A COMMUNICATIONS EXPERT)

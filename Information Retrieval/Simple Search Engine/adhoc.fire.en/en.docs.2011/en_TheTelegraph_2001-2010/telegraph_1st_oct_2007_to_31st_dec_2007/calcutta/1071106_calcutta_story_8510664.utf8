				 Murder charge on mother 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sutapa Bag, who had witnessed the murder of her nine-year-old daughter and suicide of her husband at their Jagacha home, in Howrah, will be charged with murder.																								The Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which probed the case, has written in the chargesheet that Sutapa remained a mute spectator to Tiyashas murder by her father Jayanta Bag. Sutapa, the only accused in the case, is yet to be arrested.																								She never tried to save her daughter while her husband, a quack, was slitting her throat and slashing her wrists and legs with a surgical knife. She is as guilty as her husband, said a CID official who probed the murder.																								On April 3, Tiyasha and Jayanta Bag were found dead at their Andul home while Sutapa was lying unconscious on the floor, bleeding from her throat and wrists. She was taken to Howrah district hospital.																								The post-mortem revealed that Jayanta and Tiyasha were murdered. The findings seemed to corroborate Sutapas claims that a group of local youths had raided their residence and murdered the two.																								The CID took over the probe and came to know that the Bags were involved in a racket that dealt with pornography. The local youths stormed the house when they came to know about the racket. The couple decided to commit suicide after killing their daughter. Sutapa survived, said P. Nirajnayan, the deputy inspector-general of the CID.																								Sutapa confessed during interrogation that she and her husband had decided to kill Tiyasha before committing suicide after a gang of four raided their house. 																								She said she did not make any effort to save Tiyasha, said a CID official.																								The forensic report said the injuries on the couples bodies were self-inflicted, while those on Tiyashas were inflicted by assassins.																								The sleuths recovered three surgical knives with which the couple killed their daughter from their home. A suicide note written by Jayanta and Sutapa was recovered, too. There is enough evidence to prove that Sutapa was a party to the childs murder, said a sleuth.																								Asked why Sutapa has not been arrested yet, a CID official said: Its not mandatory to arrest an accused. We have not taken her into custody as she is unlikely to abscond.

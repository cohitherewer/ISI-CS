					 Todays question: Should immersion in the river be stopped to save the Hooghly?				 				 Rite and wrong: The Hooghly sullied by immersion refuse									 Gitanshu Naskar, 
									Domjur								 																																																														Immersion in the Hooghly cannot be stopped. The number of pujas in Calcutta has been rising. Immersion of so many idols creates a pollution threat. The CMC has to create an alternative site for immersion, as we see in Chandernagore. The remains should be cleared promptly. For this, some fees may be charged from the Puja organisers. 									 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
									Behala								 																																																														Immersion of idols in holy water is a custom. But, with the increase in pollution we must think of ways to save the river. The total number of Durga pujas in Calcutta exceeds 2,000. After the Pujas, we may sprinkle holy water on the images and hand over them to the artisans who made those idols. They may recycle the clay, bamboo structure, weapons and ornaments etc. The risk of pollution may be minimised thereby. 																																																														Naren Sen,
																																																														Ramrajatala																																																														The poisonous chemical colours that are increasingly being used on idols are the main pollutants. Immersion is an age-old practice but the number of pujas has increased manifold. The CMC should serve a notice on all the puja committees so that they use eco-friendly colours and make the idols smaller. Religion should never overshadow practical necessity. 																																																														 Suranjan Bonnerjee, 
									Parnasree Pally 																																																														Reduction of pujas can save the Hooghly. We cant immerse idols in the sea like in Mumbai. Earlier, baroari pujas used to immerse their idols in local ponds. Now promoters are filling up ponds for highrises. Only the Hooghly is left. Reduction of pujas will also reduce traffic jam. 									 Samir Cassim Ariff,
									Amartalla Lane								 																																																														Yes, immersion should be stopped in the river, but the mayor must keep his pledge of taking measures to keep the Hooghly pollution-free.																																																														NARAYAN DAS,
																																																														Naktala																																																														Immersions affects all waterbodies of Bengal where post-immersion refuse disposal by the civic bodies is rarely seen. Slamming a ban may be of some help in the short run. But it would be better if the civic bodies form committees including puja organisers to chalk out sustainable alternatives and encourage use of eco-friendly materials. Thus the duty of saving the waterbodies will be divided among managers and stakeholders. 																																																														 Kshama Agarwal, 
									C.R. Avenue 																																																														Immersion no doubt pollutes the river, but it takes place for just five days. Just stopping immersion will not solve the problem. We also need to discover some other measure by which to bid farewell to the gods.									 Subhankar Mandal, 
									Palta								 																																																														If the civic authorities, Puja organisers and volunteers are careful then litter in the river can be restricted without marring immersion.									 PANKAJ KHANNA,
									Salkia, Howrah								 																																																														Pollution in the river could be minimised if immersions could be stopped. The situation is worsening every year. The Hooghly is an asset to us and CMC must frame rigid rules to save it.									 Pousali Mukherjee,
					 Behala								 																																																														Stopping immersion in the river is not a solution. The authorities should ensure that the idols are made of clay and nothing else. They should remove the refuse immediately. The wooden structure of the idol should be dragged back once the immersion is done. Thus the river would stay clean after the ritual.									 Paramananda Pal 
									Karaya Road								 																																																														Is it desirable to ban immersion in the river? Will it not be tantamount to infringement on the religious faith of the Hindus? A better alternative would be to ensure a regular arrangement to clear the debris immediately after the immersion ceremonies. The port trust as well as the municipal authorities need to take up this assignment jointly with finances sourced from the puja organisers.									 Himansu Talukdar, 
									Rishra								 																																																														It is ridiculous that our government has still not solved this problem. We can use confined water bodies for immersion provided they are cleaned subsequently. The maintenance cost should be borne by the puja committees. The number of pujas should be reduced. The artists should use natural colours. Use of plastic and non-biodegradable materials in making of idols should be banned. 									 UJJAL BHATTACHARYYA,
									Entally								 																																																														Is immersion the only cause polluting rivers? This is a ritual and not just any other activity that can be controlled by imposing a law. As regards immersion in the Hooghly, the authority should draw up an action plan to clear the garbage and people should be made aware of these rules.									 Nishith Mitra, 
									Mahinagore								 																																																														Stopping immersion in the river may cause religious and sentimental uproar. Some spacious immersion ghats, duly barricaded with wired fencing up to a distance inside the river along the shores must have to be explored and earmarked for orderly immersion. Fees for removal of immersed images and sundry wares may be charged by the concerned authorities.									 Sajit Krishnan Kutty, 
									Dum Dum								 																																																														No, immersion should not be stopped. The factories spewing industrial waste are greater culprits. Stopping of immersion will hurt our faith. If the government wants to save the Hooghly, let it tackle the factories first.

				 Boy gets hospital bed  A STAFF REPORTER			Bulu Mir at SSKM Hospital. A Telegraph picture		Eleven-year old Bulu Mir, who was writhing in pain on the SSKM Hospital floor since Saturday night, was finally allotted a bed on Monday afternoon.																								Bulus head was pierced by a bullet in Nandigrams Satangabari village on Saturday afternoon and he is in danger of developing a cerebral infection.																								Yet, the hospital authorities did not shift him to the paediatric ward as he was not accompanied by his mother or a female relative.																								Hospital rules state that a child can be admitted to the paediatric ward only if he is accompanied by a female guardian.																								Bulus mother Anjuman Bibi could not come on Sunday because of an East Midnapore bandh called by the Trinamul Congress.																								She arrived at the hospital around 3.30pm on Monday. The child was allotted a bed (S17) in the paediatric ward around 12.30pm.																								The moment we heard she is on her way to the hospital, we shifted the child to the ward, said SSKM medical superintendent Ashok Ghosh.																								Its difficult to leave home now, given the situation in Nandigram. But when I heard that my son was lying on the hospital floor, I could not stay put, said Anjuman Bibi.																								Bulus family members said the doctors and nurses turned down their repeated pleas to let the child sleep on a bed on Sunday night. We had asked them to arrange for a female attendant so he could be shifted to a bed, but they did not pay heed to our plea, said Syed Habibul, Bulus uncle.																								Bulus father Mir Sarafat Ali said he desperately searched for a female attendant on the hospital premises and outside, but could not find one.																								A CT scan on Monday revealed that the pellet was still lodged in the childs head. Its on the surface of the brain, but he doesnt need an immediate surgery, said one of the doctors treating Bulu. He is in his senses, but we are worried that the wound can cause a cerebral infection.																								The childs eyes are swollen because of blood clots. There is a severe pain in my eyes, but I am happy that my mother is with me, Bulu said, lying on the hospital bed.																								The condition of three other patients from Nandigram with bullet injuries were stable. Gokul Das, 50, of Kalicharanpur village, was injured in his right arm and abdomen. One of his kidneys had to be removed.																								Debabrata Jana, 17, from Takapura village, was injured in the waist. He will appear for Madhyamik next year. Shankar Majhi, 28, is admitted in the Woodburn ward. He was injured in one of his legs.

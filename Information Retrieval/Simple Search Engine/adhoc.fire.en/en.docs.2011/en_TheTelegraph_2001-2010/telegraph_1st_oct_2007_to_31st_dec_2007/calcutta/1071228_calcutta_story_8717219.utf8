				 Car flow in fair way

 							 - Traffic regulation, parking plans made
 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Police are working on plans to regulate traffic in the heart of the city during Book Fair 2008, to be held on the Park Circus Maidan from January 29 to February 11.
																								Traffic will not be suspended altogether on any road. We are chalking out a consolidated plan and there will be elaborate police arrangements. We will try to ensure normal flow on the EM Bypass and the Park Circus connector, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.
																								Senior officers had earlier expressed the fear that Book Fair in the congested zone will result in a traffic disaster that can extend up to the Bypass, Park Street and even Gariahat.
																								An initial traffic-management plan has been chalked out, said traffic department officers. Parts of Darga Road, CIT Road and Suhrawardy Avenue will be taken over for car parking. And for this, Darga Road will be made one-way, said an officer.
																								Vehicles headed for the seven-point crossing from the Bypass will have to take Congress Exhibition Road.
																								We will have to regulate vehicles on CIT Road, one of the busiest thoroughfares, the officer added. 
																								The cops are bracing for the challenge to ensure normal vehicular movement on Gariahat Road and the AJC Bose Road flyover.
																								Asked about the traffic woes, Tridib Chatterjee, the general secretary of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, the organisers of the fair, passed the buck to the police, saying: Were holding a book fair, not a parking fair.
																								The Guild, he added, wanted to hold the fair at Milon Mela, off the Bypass, but the site is not yet ready. Book Fair 2008 will not have any IT enclave or food stall to make room for book and magazine stalls, he signed off.

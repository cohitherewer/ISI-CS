The south Calcutta school organised akshartravels.com, an exhibition on tourism. The two-day event started on November 5. Students from Lower KG to Class X participated in the event that is organised every alternate year.				 				 																															The exhibition was divided into three levels, each depicting a single or a group of places. Level One on the ground floor showcased places in Rajasthan  Jaipur, Pushkar and Udaipur. The Sunderbans were also present on this level.				 				 																															Level Two had countries of the northern hemisphere in store. Students briefed visitors about the way to visit places like Holland, the Yellowstone National Park and the Great Wall of China. The third level focussed on countries in the southern hemisphere. There were presentations on Australia, Brazil and Argentina.				 				 																															Students had put up displays that described the routes and the respective places. They were dressed in the traditional attire of the places they showcased. More than 130 children participated in the event.

	Representing India				 				 																Loreto Day School, Sealdahs Sister S.M. Cyril is back in the city after a trip to New York, where she attended former US President Bill Clintons third Global Initiative (CGI) meeting, which also played host to Al Gore, Tony Blair, Angelina Jolie and Jane Goodall.				 				 																															The veteran educator was invited to speak at the meet in September, which addressed global challenges like education, energy and climate change, global health and poverty alleviation with participation from heads of state, CEOs, media, philanthropists, religious leaders and non-profit organisations.				 				 																															Sister Cyril spoke on adolescent girls education in developing countries, sharing the forum with innovators from Afghanistan and Africa who had worked in the field of education for women. She was commended for her efforts to maintain a non-biased system of education in her school, where half the girls come from underprivileged families.				 				 																															Sister Cyril also had a chance to interact with Clinton. I found Bill Clinton very charming, with a very clear agenda to get together as much money as possible to help the poor of the world, said Sister Cyril, who was awarded the Padmashri earlier this year.				 				 																															Clinton convinced a host of invitees to pledge millions of dollars for development projects across the globe. One by one, the donors stepped up to the stage and were presented a certificate for their public commitment. Even though Sister Cyril made no such commitment, (I did not have a million dollars to pledge!) Clinton still called her on to the stage. When she asked him what he thought made her deserve such an honour, he answered: What is 51 years in India?

St Pauls School, Darjeeling, organised Maths Lab Workshop on November 2 and 3 to address ways to improve the quality of math education. It was the brainchild of Educational Initiatives, a group that has been conducting programmes like teacher evaluation, understanding by design and science workshops. 				 				 																															The two-day workshop focussed on teaching and learning mathematics. The hands-on approach towards mathematics helped students pick up concepts through manipulatives, games and activities. It was also a platform for the teachers to explore different tools for solving problems.				 				 																															whatsup				 				 																 Fairly good				 				 																															Its a fair with a difference!

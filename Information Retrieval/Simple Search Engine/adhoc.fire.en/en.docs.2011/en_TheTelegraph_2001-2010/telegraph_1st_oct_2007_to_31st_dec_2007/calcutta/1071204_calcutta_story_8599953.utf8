				 Boom in animation
 															- Courses become popular with jobs on offer CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE				 	 A still from an animation film on HIV and AIDS																								The animation training industry in the city has witnessed tremendous growth, with a spurt in the number of students enrolling for courses over the past few years.																								Training institutes attest to the trend. At Arena Multimedia, the number of students has grown by 50 per cent since last year. Webel Animation Academy, the only state government-sponsored animation institute in the country, has also done well since opening doors in 2004.																								We started with 50 students in 2004. Now, we train 300 students every year. The growth in number is testimony to the tremendous interest in the animation industry, says Srimati Mukherjee, the project head of Webel Animation Academy.																								The students have become more focused about what they want to learn. It is no longer a case of trying out new avenues. Those who come to us know exactly what skills they want to pick up and why. They are taking up the subject because they have keen interest in it, says R. Krishnan, global head, Arena Multimedia.																								Fuelling this growth is the boom in the animation industry nation-wide. More full-length animation feature films and a growing gaming industry has boosted the demand for professionals.																								Significant work is being done locally. For example, a series of short films on issues like child labour, HIV and AIDS by Metaphor Studios were screened in the short film section at 13th Calcutta Film Festival.																								According to the latest Nasscom report on animation, the Indian market is estimated at $354 million. It is expected to become more than double by 2010. The demand for manpower is expected to go up to 26,000 from 16,500 in 2006.																								The demand for trained manpower is on the rise. Studios have more vacancies than there are students, says Ranjini Mukherjee, COO, Metaphor Studios.																								The animation industry in Calcutta is, however, yet to mature and there are not many jobs on offer. The problem is the dearth of big animation studios in the city, says Srimati Mukherjee. The lack of jobs is forcing Calcutta students to move to other cities. 																								While almost all students from the Academy of Animation Art and Technology are taken in by Metaphor Studios, 70 per cent of the students trained by Webel move to animation studios outside the city, such as Crest Animation, DQ Entertainment, UTV Toons, Green Gold Animation and Prana Studios.																								According to Srimati Mukherjee, the animation park being planned by the government bodes well for the city industry. Many big studios have shown interest in setting up shop. It will not only provide jobs to local students but also help reduce the attrition rate.

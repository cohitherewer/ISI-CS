				 Doubts over safety in sky

 SANJAY MANDAL
																								The ministry of civil aviation is observing Air Safety Week with the claim, Indian Skies. Safe Skies. For the ever-rising volume of fliers, the ministry has come out with a reassuring message: any airline, any airport, any time, you are safe. 
																								But a closer look at the Air Traffic Control (ATC)  that controls aircraft movement from take-off to landing  in Calcutta airport raises serious safety concerns. 
																								With messages for one aircraft reaching another, faulty radar making aircraft tracking difficult and voice communication with Yangon airport breaking down, one is tempted to rephrase the slogan to Calcutta Skies. Unsafe Skies. 
																								There is a severe problem in communication via the very high frequency in the ATCs area south, covering the Bay of Bengal. We should be communicating with pilots over an area of 400 nautical miles (740.8 km) south of Calcutta. But very often, we cannot communicate with an aircraft beyond 100 nautical miles (185.2 km), said an ATC official. 
																								As the ATC officials are forced to repeat a message several times to a pilot, it creates problems for other pilots flying in the same zone. The message often gets transmitted to them as well.
																								A situation like this can be dangerous in a busy sky and it can lead to planes coming very close to each other, explained the ATC official. 
																								At night, the Calcutta skies have a heavy load of traffic  around 300 aircraft fly over Calcutta between 12.30am and 3.30am every night. 
																								False blipping of radar is the other safety concern. The Calcutta ATC has one approach and three route radar and all the four are more than 10 years old. We depend on radar to track aircraft movement. False blips confuse the radar controller, as tracking gets difficult, said the ATC official. 
																								The Centre okayed Rs 200 crore earlier this year for upgrading the surveillance and communication system in Calcutta airport, but the situation has not changed. 
																								The communication system will be overhauled as part of the Rs 2,000-crore revamp plan. It is expected to start by next year, said an Airports Authority of India official, adding that some navigational equipment have arrived and sites are being selected to install them. 
																								The direct speech circuit (DCS) at the Calcutta ATC, which provides hotline communication with Yangon airport, has not been functioning for three months. All aircraft to and from southeast Asia fly between Yangon and Calcutta. 
																								We are lucky to have escaped major trouble despite the shortcomings. But we cant depend on luck for long. An overhaul of the system is a must, summed up the official.

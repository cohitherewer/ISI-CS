																								Sixty women weavers of Deganga, in North 24-Parganas, are being trained in using design software for a workshop by the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT).
																								The month-long training, under the aegis of the panchayat, ends on December 31. The workshop in the city is scheduled to begin on January 7. It aims to provide a direction to the embroidery work of the women, in keeping with the demands of the market, so that they can get better prices.
																								About 95 per cent of the craftswomen in Deganga block live below the poverty line and belong to a minority community.
																								North 24-Parganas assistant district magistrate Atanu Chatterjee told Metro that the 60 women being trained will serve as instructors to 527 other artisans who are part of self-help groups (SHGs) in the area.
																								Sabina Yasmeen, one of the 60 weavers, said she has been able to overcome her jitters about using the computer. We are learning about colour combinations and design trends. The training will help us improve the quality of our work.
																								Craftswomen are now paid next to nothing by the mahajans who help sell the products, said Yasmeen. With improvement in quality, we will get better deals, as the demand for the products will go up. According to her, for embroidering a cotton sari, a worker gets no more than Rs 25.
																								The Chinese consulate has shown interest in one of the products. The talks are in the final stages, said Chatterjee.

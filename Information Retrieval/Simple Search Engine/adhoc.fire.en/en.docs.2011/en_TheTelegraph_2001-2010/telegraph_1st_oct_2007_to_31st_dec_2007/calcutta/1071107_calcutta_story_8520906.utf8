				 Roster of items to return 
Priyanka note via law firm A STAFF REPORTER 																								In a typed letter through a law firm, Priyanka Todi has asked Kishwar Jahan to return the items she had left behind at 7B Tiljala Lane.																								Priyanka also spelt out in the letter that she would not return to the house, where she had moved in after marrying Rizwanur Rahman. This was her first communication with her in-laws since she left the house on September 8.																								The letter  sent in a sealed envelope by Victor Moses amp; Co., which represents Ashok Todi  was addressed to Kishwar Jahan, her elder son Rukbanur and her daughter Mina.																								The note, insiders said, lists the items that Priyanka had left behind  four packets of clothes and one big packet containing nearly 200 private and personal photographs of her and her family members and friends, greeting cards and letters, her certificates of age, school and college, 10-20 recorded CDs and four-five diaries.																								Priyanka has urged the Rahmans not to make her photographs available to the media.																								The firm, naming Priyanka as its client, has stated in the letter: We have been instructed by our client to write to you as follows.																								Our client, like you, is devastated by reason of the unfortunate death of her husband Rizwanur Rahman on September 21, 2007. Our client, like you, is in grief and could not recover from the shock as yet. You are aware that while she was at her husbands residence, she had taken along with her articles, which were kept in an iron almirah in the room.																								The letter, which has the signature of Deep Narayan Mitra of the firm, asks the Rahmans to send the articles through one of its peons.																								The missive goes on to mention that Priyanka is struggling to come to terms with the death of her husband and the aftermath, and that she would stay on at her fathers house.																								The letter reached us late on Monday evening and has been sent by Priyankas lawyer. Since it was meant for Rizwanurs mother and others, we didnt open it. Later, we handed it over to our lawyer, said Rizwanurs uncle Akilur Rahman.The Rahmans discussed the letter with their lawyer Kalyan Banerjee on Tuesday. In the evening, Rukbanur spoke with the family members about the next course of action.																								We have important things to discuss. It will be improper of me to speak about the letter now, he said. 																								Banerjee, however, said: We would first give a fitting reply to the letter and then consider what to do next.

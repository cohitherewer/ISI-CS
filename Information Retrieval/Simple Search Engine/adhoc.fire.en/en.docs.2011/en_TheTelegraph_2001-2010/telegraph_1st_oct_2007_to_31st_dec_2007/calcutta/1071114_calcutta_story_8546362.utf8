				 Mayor eyes deal to free slum land 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 LAND RIGHTS: The civic body wants the right to develop shanty plots across the city after rehabilitating the slum-dwellers. A Telegraph picture																								The mayor wants to reach an out-of-court settlement with the former owners of slum-land in the city to facilitate development of the areas.																								Around 10,000 bighas of slum-land is lying locked because of its peculiar legal status. An early resolution of the impasse will help us develop the precious plots, said Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.																								Several former owners have moved court against the Thika Tenancy Act, 1981, through which the state government had taken control over the plots to abolish private ownership of slums.																								But instead of acquiring the plots after paying compensation to the owners, the government had vested them with the controller of thika tenancy. The slum-dwellers have been paying rent to the controller.																								The governments status in this situation is that of a landlord without title rights of the plots, a civic law official pointed out.																								As the government has not acquired the land, the title rights, by default, are still enjoyed by the former owners.																								According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Act, construction on a plot can be sanctioned only in favour of the title-holder. 																								Hence, until the government or the civic body acquires the slum land, it will be difficult to sanction any proposed construction on it.																								The civic body is considering two options to break the impasse: acquiring the thika land after paying a compensation to the former owners or entering into a tripartite agreement with the former owners and the government. The second option has found more takers in the CMC.																								Under the agreement, the government will allow the CMC to develop the thika land after rehabilitating the slum-dwellers and share the profit with the former owners.																								A civic official said some promoters are exploiting the situation by illegally building highrises on the shanty plots. The 10,000 bighas of locked slum-land are spread across Judges Court Road, Gariahat Road, Alipore Road, Bhowanipore, Sealdah, Ashutosh Mukherjee Road, Kalighat, New Alipore and Kidderpore.

				 Reservations over hall makeover New look draws frown
 															- Theatre veterans not impressed with revamp of century-old Minerva SEBANTI SARKAR AND MOHUA DAS				 	 The first-floor balcony of the revamped Minerva, which offers a poor view of the stage. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								The century-old Minerva theatre, flaunting a makeover with fresh paint and cushioned seats, has failed to impress theatre veterans. On chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees invitation, they inspected the 6/1 Beadon Street address  renovated at a cost of over Rs 5 crore  on Sunday morning and found it riddled with faults.																								The problem points ranged from poor visibility to shrunken stage space, faulty seating arrangements to ill-positioned greenrooms. We have been asked to approve of this mess and we will not do so because what we see here is an instance of misuse of funds, said Rudraprasad Sengupta, who visited the site along with Manoj Mitra, Meghnad Bhattacharya and Ashok Mukhopadhyay.																								Architect Dulal Mukherjee, who had drawn up the revamp plan, pleaded helplessness, citing tremendous pressure from government officials to accommodate 500 seats, though the optimum capacity of the theatre was 400.																								The inspection on Sunday revealed that visibility of the stage is partially or totally obstructed from several parts of the 514-seater auditorium. The front row is too close to the stage for people to see anything, alleged Ashok Mukhopadhyay.																								What irked the theatre team the most was the first-floor U-shaped balcony, where very few seats offer a proper view of the performance space. The railings have been replaced with concrete walls and broad pillars have come up, blocking the view, complained Meghnad Bhattacharya.																								The reconstruction of Minerva started in 2001 at the chief ministers behest and was steered by the CMDA.																								Architect Mukherjee blamed all the fault lines on government pressure. We wanted to break down the ring balconies but government officials insisted on retaining the old structure. Though knocking down the balconies is no more possible, well try to remove at least 50 seats for a better view if stage experts so demand, he added.																								To make matters worse for actors, the depth of the stage has been reduced to 25 ft and the greenrooms are located on the second floor. The lack of an aisle between the ground-floor seats will make it difficult for spectators to reach the seats in the middle, while the height of the stage near the wings is not enough to allow easy movement of sets.																								The team of four stage veterans felt the second-floor balcony, reserved for an archive on Utpal Dutt, offered a better view of the stage. Seating arrangements can be made here and the archive shifted to the annexe, where a library and restaurant are planned, suggested Manoj Mitra. 																								The team will place its suggestions at a meeting with urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and MP Sudhangshu Sil.																								The government is keen to unveil the new-look stage address in November.

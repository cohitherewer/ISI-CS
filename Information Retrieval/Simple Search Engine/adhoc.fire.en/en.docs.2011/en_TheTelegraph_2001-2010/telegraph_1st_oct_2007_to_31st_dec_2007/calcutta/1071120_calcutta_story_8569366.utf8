				 Refund rap for bank 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A city consumer court has asked a private bank to refund money to a customer who had submitted a cheque that was fraudulently withdrawn by someone else.																								Bhogilal Mehta, a city-based businessman, had received a cheque for around Rs 2.28 lakh from a company in April 2004. He dropped the cheque at the ABN AMRO banks Brabourne Road branch, where he has an account.																								Later, while checking his account statement, Mehta discovered that the cheque was not credited to his account. The bank told him that the payment was made in cash to someone else and defended its action on the grounds that the cheque was not marked account payee.																								Mehta then approached the Banking Ombudsman of the Reserve Bank of India. The Ombudsman, following a hearing, concluded that the encashment was most likely an act of criminality and suggested a probe by an appropriate authority.																								The Ombudsman also criticised the bank for not exercising caution and making an inquiry before paying such a huge amount in cash to someone other than the payee, Bhogilal Mehta Associates.																								But the Ombudsman did not order refund of the money to the payee, prompting Mehta to move Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Calcutta, Unit-II.																								He pointed out in his appeal that the odd amount on the cheque  Rs 2,27,573  indicated that it was a trade transaction not meant for cash payment.																								Alleging negligence of the bank authorities, Mehta stated: Had there been a system of cross-checking for such big payments, the fraudulent withdrawal could have been avoided.																								The consumer forum on November 5 ordered ABN AMRO to credit the amount, plus interest at the rate of 8 per cent from the date of encashment (May 17, 2004), to the complainants account. The bank was also asked to pay a legal fee of Rs 1,000 to the complainant.																								The forum observed that the bank should have asked for more details from the complainant and the presenter of the cheque before effecting the payment.																								A bank spokesperson said: We have received the order and are in the process of evaluating it. Appropriate steps will be taken.

				 Woman stakes claim to forsaken baby girl
 A STAFF REPORTERA woman has approached Jadavpur police station, claiming to be the mother of the three-month-old girl abandoned in a Puja pandal on Dashami night (picture on left).																								Half a dozen couples also approached the police station to adopt the baby. She has not been handed over to anyone.																								Members of Vidyasagar Central Club Netaji Pathagar made repeated announcements over the loudspeaker for the babys parents after finding it lying on a chair in the pandal. The girl was well-dressed and a bag kept beside her had a feeding bottle in it.																								When no one claimed the child, she was handed over to the police, who admitted her to MR Bangur Hospital.																								A woman turned up at Jadavpur police station today to claim the baby. We are yet to verify her claims. She seemed mentally deranged. Theres no question of handing over the child to her, as we have to follow certain procedures, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar on Tuesday.																								The superintendent of MR Bangur Hospital, H.K. Chanda, said those who want to adopt the baby would have to come through court. The girl will be sent to a home after a few days.																								The nurses are taking care of the baby in the hospital. She has been given new dresses. She prefers sleeping on someones lap to a bed. During visiting hours, we dare not leave her alone, lest someone takes her away, said a nurse of the childrens ward.																								Chanda echoed the nurse: The baby has become very popular among the doctors and nurses.

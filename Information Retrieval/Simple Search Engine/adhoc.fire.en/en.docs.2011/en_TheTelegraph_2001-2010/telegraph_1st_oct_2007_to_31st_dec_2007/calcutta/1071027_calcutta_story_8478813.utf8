				 Sleuths get CID papers in probe
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								The CID on Friday handed over documents related to its probe into Rizwanur Rahmans death to the CBI.																								A team from the central agency, led by superintendent Zaki Ahmed, reached the CID headquarters in Bhabani Bhavan in the afternoon to take possession of the documents. 																								We gave them all the papers. We are trying our best to help the probe, said P. Neeraj Nayan, the special inspector-general (CID).																								The list of documents includes the case diary, call records of Rizwanur and some members of the Todi and Rahman families and the statements of 82 people examined by CID since it started the probe on September 24. The probe was stopped after the high court on October 16 declared it illegal.																								In the evening, a CBI team visited a PCO on APC Road, near Rajabazar, from where Rizwanur had called his cousin Ijaz an hour before his body was found on the rail tracks near Dum Dum on September 21.																								The sleuths during the day interrogated Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur and his wife Zahida. Debraj Banerjee, Rizwanurs colleague, was questioned twice. Rizwanur had called Banerjee on the morning of September 21.																								I was asked about our last conversation and my association with Rizwanur, and whether I knew Priyanka, said Banerjee. The sleuths asked Rukbanur about Rizwanurs call statements. They did not seek details of my bank account.

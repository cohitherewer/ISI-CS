				 Held for disc brawl

				 	 The facade of Souravs: The Food Pavilion, off Park Street. A Telegraph picture
																								A tiff between two groups over a girl turned into a brawl at Souravs on Sunday night. Two were injured and furniture at the food pavilion, off Park Street, were damaged in the fight. Najish Altaf, 20, was arrested in connection with the incident. 
																								The youth, a resident of Zakaria Street, was released on bail on Monday. Altaf was attending the jam session in the discotheque on the fourth floor of Souravs with three friends. They came across a girl they knew on the dance floor. She was with two other youths. After preliminary investigation it appears that Altaf and his friends had asked the girl to join them but she refused, said a senior officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.
																								There was an exchange of words when the trio objected to the advances of the four. The matter ended with Altaf and his friends hurling glass bottles at the other group outside Souravs. Howrah-resident Anutosh Singh sustained a cut on his head after being hit by a bottle. We have recorded his statement. A woman employee of Souravs was hit on the leg, added the officer.
																								We had turned out the troublemakers. They went to a nearby stall and started throwing bottles at us. As things were spiralling out of control, we called the police, said a senior manager at Souravs.
																								According to the police, Altaf and his friends partied every weekend. Altaf had left a job in New Delhi to return to the city and be with his friends, said an officer.
																								The incident  a week ahead of Christmas, which is celebrated by food and entertainment stops in the area  has sent alarm bells ringing. The police vigil has been stepped up and the owners of establishments have been asked to be careful.

				 Partner hunt for model slum
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 																								The city civic authorities have sought the participation of private firms tied up with state development agencies in a Rs 120-crore slum development project in east Calcutta.																								The companies that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has in mind for the project  approved under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission  include Bengal Shelter, Forum, Bengal Ambuja and Silver Spring.																								Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has sought a meeting with the chief executive officers of these firms at the CMC headquarters on Wednesday. The secretary-general of Credai Bengal, Pradip Sureka, and sheriff Rathin Dutta have been requested to attend.																								Under the scheme, a model housing estate will come up for 6,480 families living in a slum in the Rajarhat-Katcharipara-Hatgachhia area in east Calcutta. It is estimated that 15 acres of land will be released  and can be put to productive use  if a multi-storeyed housing estate comes up in place of the slum.																								The civic bodys conditions state that the apartments will have to be built on a no-profit-no-loss basis. Civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhay said of the project cost of Rs 120.92 crore, half will be borne by the Centre and 30 per cent will be shared by the CMC and the state. The rest will have to be coughed up by the beneficiaries.																								Each apartment will have a toilet and a kitchen. I hope the covered area for a family will be more than in the slum, he added.																								Its time the city got rid of its slums. It will add to the dignity of a slum-dweller if he becomes a flat-owner, said the mayor. 																								From 1981 to 1991, the slums in the city grew by 31.8 per cent, against the national average of 21.3 per cent.

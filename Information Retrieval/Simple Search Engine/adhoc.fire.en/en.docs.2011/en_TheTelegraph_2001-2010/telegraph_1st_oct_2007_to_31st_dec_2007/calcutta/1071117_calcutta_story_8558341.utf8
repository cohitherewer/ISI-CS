				 Woman injured in bus fall
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A woman in her late-20s was injured after falling off a private bus on Friday when it started moving before she could get off. The woman, who had to be treated at NRS Hospital, lodged a complaint with police.																								Anindita Bhattacharya, an employee in a jewellery shop, boarded the bus on route 240 at Park Circus Maidan. I was going to Moulali, where my shop is located. After the bus stopped at the Moulali intersection, I was getting off from the rear gate, she said.																								The bus started moving before Anindita could get down. The conductor did not bother to instruct the driver to stop. The vehicle sped away and I fell on the road. I was injured in the legs, she said.																								A traffic sergeant came to her rescue. I handed over the ticket of the bus to him. I saw him instructing his colleague over the walkie-talkie to stop the bus, added Anindita.																								The officer recorded the womans statement and took her to the hospital. We are yet to arrest the conductor, said an officer of the traffic department.

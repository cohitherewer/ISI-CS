 The City Diary

nA 65-year-old woman from Canada, who landed in Calcutta on Sunday morning, was sent back on the return flight as she was not carrying her visa. Gouri Bose, a Canadian citizen, arrived at Calcutta airport early on Sunday on a British Airways flight. Bose told immigration officials that she did not bring her visa by mistake but demanded entry on the grounds that she possessed a Person of Indian Origin certificate. But officials said she could not produce that document, too, and was sent back.
nSaboor Ali, 50, a supplier of building material, was found dead on a road in Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, on Sunday morning. Police said the body bore several cut marks. There were also a few marks of stabbing on the neck. No one has been arrested, but the police suspect that a dispute over supplying building material to a developer had led to Alis death.
nENT surgeon Dulal Kumar Basu has been nominated the citys sheriff for 2008. He will take over from R.N. Dutta on January 7.

				 In pursuit of dengue drug 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A research project by IBM is trying to develop antiviral drugs for dengue, which has become common in Calcutta.																								The first phase of The IBM World Community Grid Dengue Project began in August and will end in early-2008. The second phase will start soon after and will be completed by the year-end, said Daniel Dias, the director of IBM India Research Laboratory.																								Till November 7 this year, nine cases of dengue were reported in the city. The figure in 2006 was 394, of which one was fatal. In 2005, there were 3,546 cases with 12 deaths. The dengue menace can come back any time and such projects are always welcome, said a doctor.																								The research effort was launched to develop drugs for dengue, West Nile encephalitis and a host of related diseases, including Yellow Fever and Hepatitis C.																								In the first phase of the project, the proteins that enable the virus to replicate are being theoretically tested with six million drug molecules that might inhibit the process. Which of the drug molecules inhibit replication the best will be found out in the second phase of the project. The researchers will have dozens of drug molecules to work with after the second phase and develop a drug.																								The project is using the computing power of World Community Grid, which is as powerful as one of the worlds top five supercomputers. The grid is made up of the processing powers of volunteers computers. 																								More than 315,000 people and 700,000 computers are part of the grid.																								Grid computing can bring together the collective power of thousands or millions of individual computers to create a giant virtual system with massive computational strength, explained Dias.																								Volunteers from around the world download and install a free, small software on their computers. When idle, the computers request data from World Community Grids server. Computers perform computations using the data and send the results to the server, added Dias.																								Dengue virus has four distinct serotypes and is transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Infection with any of the four serotypes of dengue virus can cause mild fever to severe haemorrhage and shock.																								Dengue is primarily endemic to Asia and in areas around the equator. The West Nile virus is found in Africa, Asia and Europe and the US.

				 Small sector tie-ups eyed
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The first-ever business delegation in town from the headquarters of Mercedes and Porsche has identified automobile components, medical technology, outsourcing, small machine tools and food processing as key areas for tie-ups.																								We are here to look for sales partners for our SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and also avenues for outsourcing, which is their only chance to stay competitive, Hans-Dieter Roth, the commissioner for industrial locations, Baden-Wurttemberg International, said at a seminar hosted by the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce on Friday.																								The biz team from the south German state of Baden-Wurttemberg had representation from nine SMEs, who engaged in partnership meetings with prospective local collaborators during the day.																								Roth felt, once the Tata Motors plant starts production in Singur, some German auto parts suppliers could establish production base in the area. Who knows, Calcutta could become a hub for automobiles, like Pune and Chennai.																								Sabyasachi Sen, the principal secretary in the state commerce and industries department, admitted that Bengal has slipped a few rungs on the industrialisation ladder. But perception is changing, and the industrial climate is improving... Our geographical location and human capital are other big advantages.																								Human resources remain Calcuttas biggest strength, agreed Hans-Heinrich Werny, the chairman of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce (east).

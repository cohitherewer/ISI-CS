		 Fledgling fantasies																																	The phoenix is the symbol of re-birth, of resurrection. As an image it has, over the ages, been associated with the mythical figure of Prometheus, and Christ the Saviour to the persona of the artist, who dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create, burning to give light to the collective human intellect. Like God, the artist creates cosmos out of chaos. It symbolises an eager soul that is willing to learn, to receive, to soar. For Shukla Chowdhury, the phoenix is her constant companion, an alter-ego that goads her to relentlessly explore the vastness, the plurality of natures beauty where all birth, death and re-birth occur. The current series of paintings, titled The Search of the Phoenix, presents on canvas the impulsive moments of intense introspection. Rough and smooth rocks, silver rays of the moon, the gold aura of dusk, lilac meadows fill in her canvas as do the mysterious sands, the darkness of the night and the vibrant passion of the sun. The phoenix, Chowdhury promises, shall inspire us to rise above the ordinary and mundane, and gift ourselves ideas of verve and expression. All works are in acrylic on canvas.

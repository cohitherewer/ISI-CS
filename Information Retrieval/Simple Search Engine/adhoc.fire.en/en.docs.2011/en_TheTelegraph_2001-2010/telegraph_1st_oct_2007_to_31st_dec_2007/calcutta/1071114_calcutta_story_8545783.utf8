				 Top cops go to the people 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Senior officers of the rank of deputy commissioner and above will start visiting police stations from Wednesday to hear the grievances of local residents.																								Deputy, joint and additional commissioners will take turns in visiting all 48 police stations in five divisions across the city.																								The date and timing of the visits will be put up on the notice board of the police stations and also posted on the Calcutta police website, said Vineet Goyel, the deputy commissioner (headquarters).																								On Wednesday, deputy commissioner (central) Ajay Ranade will be at Posta and Burrabazar police stations at 5pm and 6pm, respectively, said a senior officer.																								The Lalbazar top brass said the interactions would help senior officers get a feel of discontent brewing among residents. Direct interface will help us know the situation on the ground, as intelligence inputs do not always reach the top, said an officer.																								Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had learnt soon after assuming office that officers-in-charge and assistant commissioners do not always play a pro-active role in addressing peoples complaints.																								He made his displeasure known to the officers at his first crime conference.

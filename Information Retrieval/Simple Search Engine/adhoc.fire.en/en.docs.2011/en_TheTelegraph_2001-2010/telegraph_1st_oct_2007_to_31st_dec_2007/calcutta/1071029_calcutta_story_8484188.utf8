				 Debt spurs suicide
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rajib Naths mother Mamata grieves over her sons suicide. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Rajib Nath would have turned 20 on Sunday. But, unable to bear the insult of his father at the hands of moneylenders, he chose to take his life a day before.																								Mother Mamata found the BA first-year student of Sarsuna College hanging from a rod attached to the asbestos ceiling of his room at their Behala Mukunda Das Palli home on Saturday afternoon.																								Rajibs father Panchu Nath, a contractor, had taken loans totalling Rs 35,000 from the moneylenders.																								But an exorbitant interest rate soon saw the amount cross the six-digit mark. The family stretched its means to repay the loans, but soon got into a debt trap, taking fresh loans to repay the old ones.																								The money for the last loan never exchanged hands. In the second week of October, the family approached Kalu, a local moneylender, for Rs 10,000. But he demanded Rs 100 a day as interest. He made my husband sign a document, stating that we were accepting the loan. We later told him we didnt want the money, but he refused to return the papers and kept threatening us to repay the amount, recalled Mamata.																								On Saturday morning, Nanigopal (from whom Panchu had earlier taken loans) and his gang came to the Mukunda Palli home. They called Panchu out and threatened to chain him to a lamp post and beat him to death if he did not repay the loans. They also insulted Rajibs mother in front of their neighbours, said Rajibs cousin Soma.																								Rajib kept to himself for the rest of the morning. Around 12.30pm, when Mamata entered his room, she found him hanging.																								He was our only son. He was very sensitive and could not bear the insult of his parents. Today is his birthday. He had asked me to cook meat for the occasion, cried Mamata.																								The family said it would lodge a police complaint.

				 Trail of woe for families 
Mother too ill to see CM A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Students of St Lawrence School for Boys, where Rizwanur Rahman studied, at the candle vigil in front of St Xaviers College on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta																								Kishwar Jahan, mother of Rizwanur Rahman, fell ill on Tuesday, forcing her to miss the proposed meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.																								She has not been keeping well for the past few days. Late on Monday, her blood pressure suddenly shot up. She was also running a temperature. She is better now but the doctor has suggested complete bed-rest, said elder son Rukbanur.																								So, I told Rabin Deb (the CPM leader) when he called this morning to cancel the meeting with the chief minister, he added.																								According to friends of the family, Kishwar Jahan had not been able to sleep properly since September 21, the day her younger son was found dead on the railway tracks at Patipukur.																								She barely eats and hardly sleeps. The tiny house at 7B Tiljala Lane is always crowded with outsiders and there is little respite for Rizwanurs mother, said a neighbour.

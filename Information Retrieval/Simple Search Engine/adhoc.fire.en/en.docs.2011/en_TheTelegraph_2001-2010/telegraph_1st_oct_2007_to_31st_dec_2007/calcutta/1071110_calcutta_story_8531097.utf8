				 Rahman salvo over item return
 																											- To Todi home, if Priyanka wont go to Tiljala A STAFF REPORTER The Rahmans are ready to return Priyanka Todis items, but they want her to receive them personally.																								Rizwanur Rahmans family members have tentatively worked out two options, which they want to discuss with their lawyer Kalyan Banerjee after he is back in town next week. 																								Either Priyanka will have to come down to the Rahmans 7B Tiljala Lane home to collect the items or Kishwar Jahan, Rizwanurs mother, will visit the Todis Salt Lake home to hand them over to her, a family member said on Friday.																								And if Kishwar Jahan does make the trip, she will be accompanied by her elder son Rukbanur, other family members and Banerjee. Besides, the handing over of the items will have to take place in front of journalists.																								We will not enter the Todi home. Priyanka will have to come down and meet us at the doorstep, said Rizwanurs uncle, Akilur Rahman.																								On Thursday, Priyanka had written to Kishwar Jahan, her first communication with Rizwanurs family since his death on September 21, asking her to hand over the items to the bearer of the letter (employees of father Ashok Todi).																								We are not trying to hold them back. Why should we? The items are not very costly. We only want to ensure that Priyanka gets them and identifies them as her own, Rukbanur said. There are 300 CDs stacked in our house. How will we know which are Priyankas? Let her check all the CDs and identify the ones that are hers.																								Family members claimed that among Priyankas items lying at the Tiljala Lane home are two dairies, an address book, an autograph book, four packets of clothes, a few CDs and a file containing her certificates, including the birth certificate. There is also a packet containing greeting cards and a small bag of cosmetics.																								What will happen if we hand over the items to a messenger and Priyanka discovers that some among them are not hers? Will she have to write another letter? Obviously, this cannot go on, said Akilur Rahman. So, we want her to identify the items before returning them to her.

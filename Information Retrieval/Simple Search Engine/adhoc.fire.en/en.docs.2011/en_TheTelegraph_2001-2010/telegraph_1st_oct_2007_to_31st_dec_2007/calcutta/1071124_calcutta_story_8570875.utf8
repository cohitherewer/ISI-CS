				 Rename flip-flop
 															- Mayor frowns, CMC set to change road names DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has called for more stringent parameters for renaming city roads.																								He feels that a lack of objective criteria for the exercise has resulted in several roads in Calcutta being named after undeserving people. 																								The qualifying criteria have to be made more stringent and objective, the mayor said, while expressing resentment over the way roads are being renamed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), on recommendations from a state-appointed panel.																								Historian Barun De, film-maker Mrinal Sen and author Mahasveta Devi had earlier objected to the CMCs road-renaming exercise.																								There was no organised demand for naming a road after Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, CR Das, Netaji or Rabindranath Tagore. The urge to name roads after them was spontaneous and the decision unanimous. But now, several groups are demanding that roads be renamed after persons who are not big enough names. Such demands should not be met, he pointed out.																								In the midst of this debate, the Left Front civic board is set to rename 11 more roads. The proposal, cleared by the state panel headed by Pratap Chandra Chunder, will be tabled in the civic house on Wednesday for approval.																								Of the 2,700-odd named roads in the city, more than 800 have been renamed over the past three decades, during the tenure of the Left Front government.																								The road-renaming panel was formed by former PWD minister Jatin Chakraborty, who was instrumental in changing the name of Ochterlony Monument to Shahid Minar.																								A senior civic official said: Its strange that the civic body that is trying to preserve the citys heritage is indulging in meaningless renaming of roads. Road names often suggest distinctive features of the locality. He suggested that the renaming exercise be carried out in Salt Lake and New Town.

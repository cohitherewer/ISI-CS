				 At the head marches Alam
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 HAND OF FURY: Aurangzeb Alam. Picture by Amit Datta																								Aurangzeb Alam, 24, has never read Taslima Nasreen but he read her the riot act on Wednesday.																								Agar sarkar ne Taslima Nasreen ko Calcutta se nahin bhagaya to yahan pe khoon ka dariya bahega (If the government doesnt chase Taslima out of Calcutta, a river of blood will flow here), thundered Alam, a rioter-in-chief at the AJC Bose Road-Ripon Street crossing.																								Clad in T-shirt and Bermudas, the unemployed youth of CIT Road led a mob of around 35, all aged between 15 and 20, all armed with bricks and soda bottles, and all targeting the cops.																								Zakir Ahmed, accompanying Alam, explained how it all happened on Wednesday. We were told by our leaders to be present at a rally against Taslima Nasreen. We were also told to attack policemen if they intervened. When they launched a lathicharge, we hit back. We were prepared for the battle.																								When asked who their leaders were, Ahmed snapped: Yeh humara mamla hai, (That is our business).																								Alam and Ahmed were joined by teenagers like Raju, a resident of Alimuddin Street. The 16-year-old, a Class III dropout, said: They told me Taslima had written against our religion. I came here as there was no point sitting idle in the locality. I am happy to see policemen running for cover.																								What did he know about Taslima Nasreen? Woh ek aurat hai jo Islam ke baare mein galat likha hai. Bas itna hi jaanta hoon (She is a woman who has written wrong things about Islam. Thats all I know).																								That was reason enough for Raju to join in the rioting, till a teargas shell hit him on the leg. He fell to the ground, but not before hurling the shell back at the cops with a vengeance.																								Teenagers from Rajabazar, Metiabruz, Kidderpore, Park Circus, Topsia and Ripon Street formed the first line of offence. They hurled bricks and bottles hard and moved away swiftly when chased, said one of the mob leaders.																								The senior members were at the back, supplying bricks and bottles to the youngsters. Our gameplan worked on Wednesday but we will have to be careful on Thursday, as the army will play a role, he added.

				 Fire destroys two factories
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Two factories located on the ground and first floors of a building on Cossipore Road, in Chitpur, were razed in a fire that broke out on Saturday night.																								Sixteen tenders fought the blaze for over 14 hours to bring it under control. The flames were doused around 2.15pm on Sunday.																								The fire services department lodged two FIRs with Chitpur police station against the owner of the two factories for operating without the mandatory fire clearance.																								The factory on the ground floor produced plastic and chemical items, while that on the first floor manufactured paper products.																								There might have been a disaster had the fire spread to the godowns in the adjacent buildings. Three firemen were injured while fighting the blaze. One was admitted to SSKM Hospital with head injuries, said an official in the fire services department.																								Soon after the fire broke out, the whole area was engulfed in thick smoke, said Alok Das, a local resident. 																								The police have sealed the building and forensic experts have been asked to find out the cause of the fire. An officer said the adjacent godowns will be raided to find out whether safety measures are in place.

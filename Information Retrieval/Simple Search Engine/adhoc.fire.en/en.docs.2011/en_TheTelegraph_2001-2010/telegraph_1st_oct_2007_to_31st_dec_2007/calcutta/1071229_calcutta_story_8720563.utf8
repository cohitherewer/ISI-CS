The 30-year-old driver of a rental car was arrested on Friday for molesting a nine-year-old Bangladeshi passenger. 
																								Saheb Jaan was taking the girl, her sister and their parents to a hotel on Sudder Street. 
																								The family from Dhaka had arrived at Howrah station from Puri in the morning. Saheb lured them into his car around 9am, before they could reach the taxi stand. 
																								The nine-year-old was seated beside the driver, while her parents Mohammad Sarfuddin and Nurul Nahar Begum occupied the rear seat with their two-year-old younger daughter. Forty minutes into the journey, Saheb allegedly molested the girl while changing gears. 
																								Pedestrians and motorists heard the couples cries for help while the car was speeding down Lenin Sarani. A taxi swerved and intercepted the car near the Moulali intersection. Saheb was pulled out by the pedestrians, who alerted us, said an officer of Taltala police station.
																								Before that, Saheb was beaten up severely and left badly bruised.
																								Sarfuddin, a 40-year-old cloth merchant, stated in his complaint that Saheb had offered to take them to the hotel on Sudder Street, where the family wanted to put up. Nurul Nahar Begum was witness to the driver molesting her elder daughter while she was feeding her younger one.
																								When Sarfuddin asked Saheb to take them to a policeman, the driver started speeding, probably towards his home in Beniapukur. It was then that the couple started screaming for help, added the officer. 
																								Taltala police arrested Saheb, who has been earning his livelihood by ferrying visitors to the city in his old green Ambassador. 
																								He frequented the railway stations for gullible passengers. The police have charged him under Section 354 of Indian Penal Code, which pertains to outrage of modesty. 
																								The family had come to the city by bus from Dhaka a week back. They left for Vishakapatnam soon after, before moving to Puri. They returned to Howrah by the Jagannath Express on Friday.

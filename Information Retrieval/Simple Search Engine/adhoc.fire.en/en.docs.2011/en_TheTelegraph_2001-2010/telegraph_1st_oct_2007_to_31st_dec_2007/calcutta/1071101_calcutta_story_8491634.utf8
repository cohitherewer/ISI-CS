				 Autonomy lost, partial freedom on hold
 MITA MUKHERJEE				 	 Presidency College: In a rut. A Telegraph picture																								Presidency College has long missed the autonomy bus. Even partial freedom that a state-appointed panel has recommended for the college seems a distant possibility.																								The panel submitted a report to the government in July, suggesting partial autonomy for Presidency, so it could retain its ties with Calcutta University. The system, the committee feels, will benefit both institutions.																								The government has accepted the recommendations, but is yet to take any step to implement them.																								There has been no change in the status of Presidency College, said principal Mamata Roy. We will be in a position to work out a plan to restructure the functioning of the college only after receiving a government order.																								The panel has recommended filling up of all vacant posts in the college in the current fiscal. It also wants immediate recruitment of experienced teachers at the professor and reader levels on a permanent and non-transferable basis.																								But the higher education department, which directly controls Presidency College, is yet to take any initiative to fill up the vacant posts.																								Nearly 40 teaching posts are lying vacant in the college. The government is not likely to create more teaching posts. We will be happy if it fills up the vacant ones, said a senior teacher of the college.																								As for the other proposals, an official in the higher education department said the college should send a detailed proposal for implementation.																								The seven-member committee has suggested that a substantial number of scholarships be created to encourage students to study traditional subjects at the undergraduate level.																								Adjunct and visiting professors from foreign universities should be invited on a short-term basis in each academic year. The panel also wants the college to have more say on money management.																								The principal should send us a detailed proposal on the implementation of these recommendations. The college should inform us how it would like to utilise the funds, said a senior official.																								Since the panel was against absolute autonomy, it did not recommend freedom for the college to recruit teachers.

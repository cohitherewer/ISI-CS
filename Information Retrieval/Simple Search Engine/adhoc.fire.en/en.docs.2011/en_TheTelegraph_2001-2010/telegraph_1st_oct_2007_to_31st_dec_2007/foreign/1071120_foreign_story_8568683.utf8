				 Iran dollar snub
																								London, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Iran, at odds with the West over its nuclear programme, has effectively cut all ties with the dollar when it comes to oil revenues, a top Iranian oil official said today. 																								For nearly two years, Opecs second biggest producer has been reducing its exposure to the dollar, saying the weak US currency is eroding its purchasing power. Tehran is now fetching roughly $87 a barrel on daily crude sales of 2.4 million.																								This is an economic decision and weve been proven right. Over time the dollar has got weaker and weaker, Hojjatollah Ghanimifard, international affairs director of the state-owned National Iranian Oil Company said. On a macro-economic level, nearly all of Irans crude oil sales are now being paid for in non US currencies. Ghanimifard said less than 20 per cent of Irans oil export earnings are in yen and the rest in euros.

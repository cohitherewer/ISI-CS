				 Osama may be in city: Ex-spy
																								London, Oct. 9 (Reuters): Osama bin Laden could hide more easily in a city than a remote tribal region, a former Pakistani intelligence chief said today, challenging the notion that the al Qaida leader is probably holed up in a mountain cave.																								Lieutenant-General Asad Durrani, former head of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI), said news of outsiders presence travels fast in the tribal areas and it would be hard to keep it secret for years.																								In the countryside or in tribal areas ... its difficult to hide yourself because there people live ... and operate in a manner in which finding out about unusual presence is very important, Durrani said in an interview in London.																								He said: I am not sure over a period of four, five or six years that it would be possible even for the tribesmen to keep his presence under wraps.

				 BlackBerry opens up to music 
																								Hong Kong, Oct. 23 (Reuters): Research in Motions BlackBerries will come with a cheap, unlimited music service from next month for the first time, marking the latest foray by a handheld device maker into a burgeoning music arena.																								Rob Lewis, CEO of British mobile music provider Omnifone, told Reuters today his firm had inked a deal to supply the BlackBerry with unlimited tracks from their MusicStation service, sounding the latest challenge to App-les iTunes for the newly lau-nched iPhone.																								Omnifone, which has sea-led a wide-ranging, exclusive pact with Vodafone, which al-so markets mobile devices, would kick off the service in England in November before expanding it worldwide, Le-wis said.																								The iPhone is a very attractive device... but its very limited in terms of music capability, Lewis said.																								I have to download music at home over iTunes using my own computer. I cannot download music when Im out and about, he said after unveiling a deal to provide music downloads for a Hutc-hison Whampoa Hong Kong unit. A spokesperson for Research in Motion did not comment.																								Mobile handset makers and network operators have invested heavily in music in past years to boost revenue.																								Omnifones MusicStation now partners some of the biggest names in the music business, from EMI and Warner Music to Sony BMG and Universal Music, and claims to be able to supply some 10 million songs across 30 countries.																								Vodafone recently signed an exclusive deal with Omnifone that will give customers an unlimited number of tracks from a catalogue of over 1 million.

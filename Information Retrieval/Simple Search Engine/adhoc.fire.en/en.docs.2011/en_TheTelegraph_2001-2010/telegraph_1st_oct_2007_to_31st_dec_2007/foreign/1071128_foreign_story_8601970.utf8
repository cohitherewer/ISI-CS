				 A boys best friend: python
 SALLY PECK																								London, Nov. 27: While many children might wish to curl up with a dog or cat, a young Cambodian boy prefers to spend his time with a 4.8-metre-long python.																								In the village of Sit Tbow, 50 km east of Phnom Penh, Sambath Uon, seven, reportedly refuses to go to sleep without the company of his pet.																								While the boys father tried to return the snake to the forest three times, the Burmese python loyally returned to her young master and has earned the acceptance of villagers, who think she brings good fortune. Young Sambath said of his faithful companion: I love the python like my sister. 																								The affection appears to be mutual, despite the fact that pythons are typically afraid of people and avoid humans.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

				 Bulgari gems boycott
																								Milan, Oct. 11 (Reuters): Italys Bulgari added its name to the list of jewellers boycotting gems from Myanmar after a crackdown by the countrys military rulers on pro-democracy protesters.																								The worlds third largest jeweller said today it had told its suppliers to declare the origin of the stones they provide, adding that it had stopped buying stones mined in Myanmar some time ago.

Its announcement follows one by Cartier which said it had stopped buying rubies and sapphires which may have been mined in Myanmar.

				 Nobel for iPod tech creators
				 				 Fert (left), Gruenberg 																								Stockholm, Oct. 9 (Reuters): Frances Albert Fert and Germanys Peter Gruenberg won the 2007 Nobel Prize for physics today for a breakthrough in nanotechnology that lets huge amounts of data be squeezed into ever-smaller spaces.																								Gadgets from powerful laptops to iPods owe their existence to the discovery.																								The 10-million Swedish crown ($1.54 million) prize, awarded by The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, recognised the pair for revealing a physical effect called giant magnetoresistance.																								It is thanks to this technology that it has been possible to miniaturise hard disks so radically in recent years, the academy said in a statement.																								Giant magnetoresistance  GMR for short  works through a large electrical response to a tiny magnetic input. When atoms are laid down on a hard disk in ultra-thin layers, they interact differently than when spread out more. This makes it possible to pack more data on disks.																								Fert and Gruenberg, 68, figured out how to stack nanometre-thin layers of magnetic and non-magnetic atoms to produce the GMR effect.																								Fert and Gruenberg each made the discovery independently of the other. The two join the ranks of some of the greatest names in science, including Albert Einstein.

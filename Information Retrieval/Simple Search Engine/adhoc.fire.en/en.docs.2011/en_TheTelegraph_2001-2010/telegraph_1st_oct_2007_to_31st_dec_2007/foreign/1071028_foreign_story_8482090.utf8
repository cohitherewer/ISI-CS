				 Myanmar frees 87
																								Yangon, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Myanmars junta has freed 87 more people arrested during last months crackdown, including over 50 members of the Opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), a party spokesman said.																								The released detainees included Hla Pe, an 81-year-old NLD central executive committee member, and Tayzaw Bartha, a 76-year-old Buddhist monk. Bartha was arrested in early August for staging a lone protest outside City Hall. There were 14 students among those set free.																								Official media say 10 persons were killed when soldiers were sent in a month ago to end the biggest anti-junta protests in two decades, although western governments say the real toll is likely to be far higher.																								The junta also says nearly 3,000 people and Buddhist monks were arrested, though all but a few hundred have been released after questioning.

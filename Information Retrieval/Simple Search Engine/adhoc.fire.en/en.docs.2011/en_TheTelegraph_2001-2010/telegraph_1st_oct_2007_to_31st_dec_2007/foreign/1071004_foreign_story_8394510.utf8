				 Bloomberg victim of fraud attempt
 HELEN NUGENT				 	 Dual threat																								New York, Oct. 3: Two men tried to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from the bank account of Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York city, a court was told yesterday. 																								One of the men spent nearly $10,000 of the total $430,000 stolen funds, according to prosecutors in New York, who discovered the alleged fraud after two banks notified authorities in June of unusually large cheques at their branches. Odalis Bostic, from Elizabeth, New Jersey, deposited two cheques  $190,000 in one bank and $230,000 in the other  drawn on Bloombergs account at Bank of America, prosecutors said. 																								The cheques were deposited into accounts in PNC Bank and Sovereign Bank opened by Bostic for a company he had created, the Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, said. The mayors account information appeared on both cheques, he added. 																								Morgenthau also said that investigators learnt that the second man, Charles Nelson, transferred $10,000 from the mayors Bank of America account to an E-Trade stock trading account in an online transaction in May. Nelson, of Newark, New Jersey, spent virtually all the stolen cash, Jeremy Glickman, for the prosecution, said. 																								It is not known how the men, who are believed to have been working separately, obtained Bloombergs details. The mayor, whose fortune is estimated by Forbes at $11.5 billion, was not told about the investigation until yesterday. 																								Bostic, 23, was arrested in New Jersey in August and waived extradition to New York. At the court hearing yesterday he pleaded not guilty to second-degree attempted grand larceny, which is punishable by up to seven years in prison. His bail was set at $10,000. 																								When Nelson, 31, was arrested in Newark, New Jersey, a computer, documents and two guns were found as a result of search warrants. He was placed in custody on a number of charges, including gun possession. He is now waiting extradition to New York to face charges of first-degree identity theft, punishable by up to seven years in prison. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

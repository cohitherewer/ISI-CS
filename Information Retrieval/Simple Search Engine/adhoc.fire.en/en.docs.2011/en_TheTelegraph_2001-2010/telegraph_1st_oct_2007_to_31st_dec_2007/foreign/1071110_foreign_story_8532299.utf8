				 Thai king unleashes pink on his subjects
																								Bangkok, Nov. 9 (Reuters): Thailands revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej has unleashed a new colour on his country  baby pink.																								Since he left hospital on Wednesday wearing a pink shirt and pink jacket, Thais have rushed to the stores to buy pink clothes.																								Pink shirt sales jumped 60 per cent today from yesterday after people saw the King in the colour, a woman selling polo shirts emblazoned with the royal emblem at a Bangkok street market said today. Some caught on sooner than others.																								The Matichon newspaper quoted a woman working for Crown Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn as saying astrologers had advised that Mars, represented by pink, would help strengthen King Bhumibol, who spent more than three weeks in hospital.																								Since Her Royal Highness had been aware of the suggestions at the beginning of the year, she started to wear pink every Tuesday, Matichoon quoted Katevalee Napasap as saying.																								In Thailand, Mars rules Tuesday, which translates into Thai as day of Mars. Each day is also associated with a colour. Monday, the day King Bhumibol was born, is yellow.																								So Bangkok is awash with people wearing yellow on Mondays to show their support for the King, a genuinely revered figure in a country which has had 18 coups since it became a constitutional monarchy in 1932.

				 Hiroshima bomber dead
				 	 Tibbets																								Columbus, Ohio, Nov. 1 (AP): Paul Tibbets, who piloted the B-29 bomber Enola Gay that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, died today. He was 92 and insisted almost to his dying day that he had no regrets about the mission and slept just fine at night.																								Tibbets died at his Columbus home, said Gerry Newhouse, a longtime friend. He suffered from a variety of health problems and had been in decline for two months.

It was the first use of a nuclear weapon in wartime.

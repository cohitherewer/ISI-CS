				 Airports in UK face strike threat

																								London, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Thousands of workers at seven of Britains busiest airports have voted to strike in a dispute over pensions that could cause widespread disruption and closures in the New Year, their union said today.
																								The strike will affect Heathrow, in London, as well as Gatwick, Stansted, Southampton, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen airports.
																								The Unite union said its members will walk out three times next month in protest at the closure to new employees of the final salary-linked pension scheme of airport operator BAA. Without doubt, in my view, it will result in the closure of those seven airports during that timeframe, its national aviation secretary Brendan Gold said. 
																								Union members will stage three strikes: two 24-hour walkouts starting at 0600 GMT on January 7 and January 14 and a further 48-hour strike from 0600 GMT on January 17.
																								Those taking part include fire crews, security staff and clerical workers.

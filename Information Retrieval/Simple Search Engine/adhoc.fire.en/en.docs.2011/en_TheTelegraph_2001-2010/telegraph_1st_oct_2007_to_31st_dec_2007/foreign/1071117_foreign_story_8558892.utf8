				 After splash, comet gets bigger than the sun
				 	 Comet Holmes as seen through a telescope in Florida. (Reuters)																								Chicago, Nov. 16 (Reuters): The normally sedate Comet Holmes made a bright splash in the sky about two weeks ago, unexpectedly becoming a million times brighter than normal overnight.																								The comet and its expanding ball of dust have become the biggest object in the solar system, with a diameter appearing even bigger than the sun, according to astronomers at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy.																								The fireworks began on October 23, when the comet brightened in a 24-hour period. It is now fading but can still be seen by the naked eye in the northeastern sky.																								Something that spectacular is almost like a supernova going off, said Hal Weaver, a comet expert at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.																								Weaver and fellow astronomers, using the powerful Hubble telescope, have some clues that may help explain the display. So far they have noticed that the comets nucleus, the small solid body that is the main source of all the comets activity, is still surrounded by dust.																								He believes some sort of explosion sheared off a pancake-shaped slab of the comet, which crumbled into tiny dust particles that are being lit up by the sun.

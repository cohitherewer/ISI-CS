				 Pioneers of designer mice scoop up medicine Nobel
																								Stockholm, Oct. 8 (Reuters): The researchers who pioneered the creation of designer mice to track the role of different genes in human development and disease have won the 2007 Nobel medicine prize, Swedens Karolinska Institute said today.																								The prestigious 10 million Swedish crown ($1.54 million) prize recognised Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies for helping discover the roles of numerous genes in embryonic development, adult physiology, ageing and disease.																								In 2001, the three took the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, seen as the US version of the Nobel since many of its recipients have gone on to become Nobel Laureates. Italian-born Capecchi is a US citizen, as is Smithies. Both Evans, who was knighted for his contributions to science, and Smithies are British-born.																								Its certainly something that everybody would love to hear and its marvellous news both with respect to our laboratory as well as our university, Capecchi said after hearing he had won the prize.																								What we developed is a way of modifying genes in the mouse which allows us to model human disease, study their pathology as well as ... developing new therapies.																								 The prize awarders said the discoveries made by the three have led to a new branch of medicine known as gene targeting  turning mice genes on and off to determine their effect on diseases and physiological development.																								The development of gene targeting technology in the mouse has had a profound influence on medical research, said Stephen Rahilly, head of the department of clinical biochemistry, University of Cambridge. Thanks to this technology we have a much better understanding of the function of specific genes in pathways in the whole organism and a greater ability to predict whether drugs acting on those pathways are likely to have beneficial effects in disease.																								Capecchi and Smithiess research showed genes can be targeted, modified and repaired if defective. Evans offered the means for achieving this by isolating embryonic stem cells in mice, which give rise to all the cells in the body. Their work led to breakthrough revelations about the development of organs, the causes of some human birth defects along with models for diseases such as cystic fibrosis, hypertension and atherosclerosis.																								The Nobel Laureate for physics will be revealed tomorrow, followed by that for chemistry on Wednesday, literature on Thursday and the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday in Oslo.

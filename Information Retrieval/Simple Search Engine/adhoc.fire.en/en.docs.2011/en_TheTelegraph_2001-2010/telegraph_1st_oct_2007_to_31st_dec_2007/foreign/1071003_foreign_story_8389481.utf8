				 Brown to bring more troops home
																								Basra, Oct. 2 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced today that 500 more soldiers would be home from the unpopular war in Iraq by the end of the year, fuelling speculation he may soon call a national election.																								On his first visit to Iraq as Prime Minister, Brown said Iraq could take responsibility for security in Basra province within two months, completing the transfer of power in all four southern provinces for which Britain was once responsible.																								Britain has been trimming its Iraq force from 5,500 since moving 500 soldiers from a palace in the city of Basra to a vast airbase on its outskirts in early September. The total now stands at about 5,250 and was due to fall to 5,000 soon. I believe that by the end of the year British troops can be reduced to 4,500, Brown said.

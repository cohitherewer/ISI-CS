				 Sharif loses appeal

																								Islamabad, Dec. 18 (AP): Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has been eliminated from Pakistans elections after his appeal against the rejection of his candidacy was rejected, an official said today.
																								Sharifs party slammed the decision as evidence that the January 8 ballot will be rigged in favour of President Pervez Musharraf.
																								The election commission turned down Sharifs appeal yesterday, commission spokesman Kanwar Dilshad said. It also rejected an appeal by Sharifs politician brother, Shahbaz Sharif, against the refusal of his nomination papers. The decision leaves Sharif with no further avenue to appeal and denies him a platform in parliament.

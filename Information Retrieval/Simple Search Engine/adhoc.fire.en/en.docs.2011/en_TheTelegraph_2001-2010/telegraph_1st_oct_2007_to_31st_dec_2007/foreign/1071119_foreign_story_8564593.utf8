																								Islamabad, Nov. 18 (AP): Washingtons No. 2 diplomat has delivered a blunt message to Pakistans military ruler, telling him that the emergency must be lifted and his opponents freed ahead of elections.																								But there was no immediate sign that President Pervez Musharraf would heed that advice, with a presidential aide saying the Pakistani leader insisted that the emergency would only be lifted once security improves.																								I urged the government to stop such actions, lift the state of emergency and release all political detainees, US deputy secretary of state John Negroponte told a news conference at the heavily guarded US embassy at the end of his visit today. Emergency rule is not compatible with free, fair and credible elections.																								Musharrafs aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Pakistani ruler believes the state of emergency is needed to have a peaceful vote.																								Hours after Negroponte spoke, foreign ministry spokesperson Mohammed Sadiq said the government was taking steps to hold free and fair elections. He said any decision on lifting the emergency would be taken according to the ground situation and added that what Negroponte said was nothing new.

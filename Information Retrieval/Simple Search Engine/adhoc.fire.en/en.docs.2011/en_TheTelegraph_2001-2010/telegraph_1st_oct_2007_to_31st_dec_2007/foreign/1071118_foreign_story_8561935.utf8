				 Pak students protest with flowers
																								Islamabad, Nov. 17 (PTI): Gandhigiri is now visible on Pakistani streets.																								Inspired by the Bollywood hit Lage Raho Munnabhai, scores of Pakistani students have started offering flowers to deposed judges and politicians who are supporting the emergency.																								Gandhigiri refers to the practice of the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and was popularised in the film Lage Raho Munnabhai.																								 Waving roses and dahlias and singing patriotic songs, the students marched from the cricket ground in Margalla, Islamabad, to the judges colony to show their solidarity with the deposed judges who have been under house arrest since November 3.																								The students, who carried large bouquets of roses for ousted supreme court Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, were prevented by police from visiting the judges residence.																								 Mominah, a student from Headstart School, said: We want to show our support for the chief justice. Unfortunately, we were stopped mid-way. It seems the police have been given a free hand to crush any kind of opposition. 																								Flowers were also offered to ruling Pakistan Muslim League politicians. We offered a bouquet to a politician to protest against government policies, said a student. The students from Froebels International School, City School, Headstart, Beacon House and Bahria School were joined by workers arrested leader Imran Khans party.

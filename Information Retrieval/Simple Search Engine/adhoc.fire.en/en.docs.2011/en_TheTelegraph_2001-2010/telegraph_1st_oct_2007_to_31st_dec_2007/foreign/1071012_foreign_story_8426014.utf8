				 14-year-old held for plotting raid on school
																								Philadelphia, Oct. 11 (Reuters): A 14-year-old boy armed with a rifle and home-made grenades was arrested late today after confessing to plotting a Columbine-like attack on a suburban Philadelphia high school, police said today.																								The boy, who was not identified, told police he was a planning an attack on Plymouth Whitemarsh High School similar to the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado in which two students killed 13 people, said Joe Lawrence, deputy chief of police in Plymouth.																								Acting on a tip from a neighbour, police arrested the boy at his home in Plymouth Township north of Philadelphia where they found one Hi-Tech 9 mm rifle with a laser sight, 30 to 50 pellet guns and four hand grenades, one of which was live and three of which were still being made.																								The boy was schooled at home where he lived with his mother and father, both of whom knew about the weapons, Lawrence said. He would not say whether the boy was inspired by events in Ohio yesterday, when a 14-year-old student shot and wounded two adults.

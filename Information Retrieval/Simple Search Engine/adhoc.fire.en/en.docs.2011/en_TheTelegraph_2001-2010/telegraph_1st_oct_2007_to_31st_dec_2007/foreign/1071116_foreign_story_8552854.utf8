				 Radical UK cleric can be sent to US
																								London, Nov. 15 (Reuters): A British court ruled today that radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri could be extradited to the US to face terrorism charges including trying to set up an al Qaida training camp in Oregon.																								Egyptian-born Hamza, 49, serving a seven-year jail term in Britain for inciting his followers to murder non-believers, is wanted by US authorities on 11 charges.																								The US indictment accuses Hamza  who used to wear a hook in place of a missing hand  of attempting to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, from 1999 to early 2000, and also providing support to al Qaida and the Taliban.																								Hamza, who applauded the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, also faces charges that he was involved in plotting the taking of 16 western hostages in Yemen in 1998. Four of the hostages, three Britons and an Australian, were killed.

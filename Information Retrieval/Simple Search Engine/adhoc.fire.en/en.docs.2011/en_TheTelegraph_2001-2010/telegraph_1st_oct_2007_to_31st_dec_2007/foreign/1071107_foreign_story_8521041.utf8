				 Diwali dilemma for White House 
 K.P. NAYAR				 	 Hughes (right) with Bush and Rice																								Washington, Nov. 6: Diwali will be celebrated at the White House on Wednesday, but for the fifth year in succession, President George W. Bush may not attend the celebrations.																								Bushs White House is not known to be superstitious. But there is speculation among Indian Americans that the Presidents steadfast refusal to attend Diwali events may have to do with the repeated coincidence that no chief guest at any previous Diwali celebration at Americas chief executive mansion has completed his or her full tenure in office.																								The latest in what is now sometimes known here as the Diwali casualty in the White House is Karen Hughes, whose standing in Bushs inner circle was considered unassailable. Hughes had a long association with Bush and was his communications chief during his first bid for presidency in 2000.																								She had two stints in the administration, one by the Presidents side in the White House and later at the state department, tasked with promoting American values among the worlds Muslims.																								Hughes was the chief guest for the Diwali celebration at the White House last year. She resigned her job as under-secretary of state for public diplomacy last week, somewhat symbolically on Halloween, the day when monsters and witches are supposedly free and about in America.																								Karl Rove was the chief guest at the first Diwali celebration in the history of the White House in 2003. If there was anyone in the Bush team who was more secure in his job than Hughes, it was Rove, whom the President described as the architect of his second-term victory in 2004.																								The two men have been so close since Bushs days as Texas governor that it was often said that Rove decides and Bush merely announces those decisions.																								But Rove, who had the grossly understated title of deputy chief of staff, is gone. 																								So is Robert Blackwill, a former White House aide on Iraq policy, who lit the Diwali lamp on the White House premises in 2004.																								Blackwill, a former US ambassador to India and once teacher to Bush on foreign policy along with secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, was brought back here from New Delhi in 2003 with great expectations that he would set Iraq right. Blackwill was considered a sure shot in the second presidential term to be national security adviser.																								No one is saying that Diwali did these men and women in. Some lacked qualifications for the job, like Hughes, who offended Saudi women during her first few weeks in office and actually saw Americas standing in key Muslim countries decline during her tenure in office.																								Rove was always a proxy target for those who took potshots at the President himself. Blackwill had many weaknesses, among them his short temper, which contributed to his astounding fall.																								But even the level-headed, far from controversial Andrew Card, the White House chief of staff, lost his job some time after he agreed to be the chief guest for a Diwali event at the White House in 2005.																								Card who was deputy chief of staff to the current Presidents father in the White House and a veteran of administration jobs under both father Bush and his predecessor Ronald Reagan, was one of the very first appointees to George W. Bushs White House in 2000.

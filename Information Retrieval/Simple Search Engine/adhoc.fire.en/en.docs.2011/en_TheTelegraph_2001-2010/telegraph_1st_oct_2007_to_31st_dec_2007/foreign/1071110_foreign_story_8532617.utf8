				 To please US, seize Osama
																								Islamabad, Nov. 9 (Reuters): Satirists from Lahore to Washington gave Pakistans embattled President Pervez Musharraf simple advice on how to deflect the US governments criticism of his imposition of emergency rule  capture Osama bin Laden.																								Can you imagine the response from the US if you justified the state of emergency by bringing in Osama in an orange jump suit, wrote James S. Robbins, a director of the Intelligence Centre at Trinity Washington University, in an article published in Pakistans Daily Times today.																								My advice is just go get bin Laden, Robbins advised in an article cast as a memorandum to Musharraf from Niccolo Machiavelli, a political philosopher from the Italian Renaissance. For all the militant threats present in Pakistan, foreign diplomats said Musharraf had made it clear to them this week that his main reason for invoking emergency powers and suspending the constitution was to stop the supreme court ruling his re-election in October was invalid because he had stood while army chief.																								US officials, more used to praising Musharraf for his role as an ally fighting al Qaida and the Taliban, have been highly critical of his latest move. Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said Washington doesnt have all its chips on Musharraf.																								A humourist at the Friday Times struck a similar theme on the bin Laden ruse in the weekly magazine published in Lahore. In an supposed transcript of hotline conversations between Musharraf and President George W. Bush  a regular back-page column called Mush amp; Bush  the Pakistani leader asks for a little patience in order for him to secure his own position. Bush: How little?																								Mush: Oh, only about a year or so and I can promise you I can deliver bin Laden to you ... and if you like I will destroy al Qaida in Iraq and completely finish off world terrorism and...																								Bush: Gee whiz!! Sounds great, you kin have all the time in the wo...																								The exchange is then interrupted by another voice  usually taken to be Rice  telling Bush to tell Musharraf to quit the army and hold elections as promised. On Wednesday, the real Bush said he had given Musharraf that exact advice.

 Fine Print				 				 				 																After sex, its rape																																	 Kuala Lumpur, Oct. 16 (Reuters): A Malaysian woman who mistakenly had sex with a guest, believing him to be her husband, has complained to police that she was raped.

About an hour later, she felt a man next to her and proceeded to make love to him, although she did not see his face, the New Straits Times newspaper said. When the womans 34-year-old husband walked into the room a short while afterwards, she was surprised to see him in his work clothes, and only realised her error when he questioned her about a man he had seen walking out of the room, the paper said.

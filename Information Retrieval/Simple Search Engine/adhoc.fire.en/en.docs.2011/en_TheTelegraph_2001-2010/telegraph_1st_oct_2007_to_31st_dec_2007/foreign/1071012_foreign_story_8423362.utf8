				 Elizabeths discuss bad breath
				 	 Class apart																								Los Angeles, Oct. 11 (AP): When Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench co-starred in last years drama Notes on a Scandal, their off-camera conversations naturally turned to Queen Elizabeth I, a role each has played.																								They did not chat about the grand legacy of the long-reigning monarch, though. According to Blanchett, they spoke of stench and halitosis.																								I think we talked sort of generally about how smelly Elizabethan England would have been, Blanchett told The Associated Press in an interview. We did talk about the smell and how bad everyones breath would have been.																								Blanchett, 38, shot to stardom in 1998s Elizabeth. She reprises the role in Elizabeth: The Golden Age, which opens tomorrow and centres on the queens dalliance with the dashing Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) amid a holy war Catholic Spain wages on Protestant England in the late 16th century.																								The 1998 film earned a best-actress Academy Award nomination for Blanchett, who later won the supporting-actress prize for The Aviator.																								Dench won the supporting-actress Oscar for playing the queen in Shakespeare in Love, released the same year Elizabeth came out.																								Blanchett recalled that while she initially had been reluctant to revisit the character, Elizabeth director Shekhar Kapur always seemed to have a second film in mind.																								He literally started talking about it the minute we wrapped. I honestly thought he was joking, Blanchett said. 																								So I didnt really pay it much mind. Then over the years, he just kept returning to the idea, and I thought, hes not simply being provocative. He actually believes theres something more that we could say.																								The story of Elizabeth may not be over for Blanchett and Kapur. At a recent question-and-answer session with an audience after an advance screening of The Golden Age, Blanchett again expressed reluctance about a third chapter.																								But the crowd clapped heartily when Kapur raised the idea.																								I keep saying that, because the more people applaud, the more she will be persuaded, Kapur said.																								While its taken some convincing by filmmakers for Blanchett to agree to some parts, she said her choices generally come from the gut.																								People say: How do you choose a role? In the end, I think you really decide in about two and a half seconds, Blanchett, 38, said during an interview at a Los Angeles theatre before a question-and-answer session with an audience catching an advance screening of The Golden Age.																								Its a purely instinctual response. And then you spend the rest of your time trying to rationalise your way into it or out of it. Sometimes that takes a couple of weeks and sometimes it takes 10 years, like Elizabeth.

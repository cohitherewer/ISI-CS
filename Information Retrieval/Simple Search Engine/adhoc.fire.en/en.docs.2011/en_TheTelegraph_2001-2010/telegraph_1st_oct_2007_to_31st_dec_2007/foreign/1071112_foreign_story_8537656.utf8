				 Dirty tricks stalk prince
																								London, Nov. 11: Prince Harry is the victim of a dirty tricks campaign over the alleged killing of two birds of prey at Sandringham, his friends fear.																								Two rare hen harriers killed while hovering over the Queens Norfolk estate were not even shot at, those close to the prince now suspect.																								Friends of the prince, 23, are angry that the royal family has been dragged into the affair despite no firm evidence that any bird of prey was illegally killed and Harry could be the victim of a campaign by the anti-shooting lobby.																								The Sunday Telegraph has learnt that senior staff at Sandringham  the Queens country house in Norfolk which has a 600-acre estate  have carried out their own investigation into the shooting with the help of the suspects, Prince Harry, his friend William van Cutsem, 28, and David Clarke, a gamekeeper.																								The inquiry has concluded that there was probably no such shooting and that the supposed eye witnesses were, at best, mistaken over their claims.																								The alleged incident happened just before 6.30pm when it was nearly dark. No birds carcasses were found, even though the police were quickly on the scene.																								It is understood that only one of the alleged three witnesses gave a statement to the police and none of them wants to be identified.																								The story involving Prince Harry was disclosed 12 days ago. However, on Wednesday  just two weeks after the alleged incident and after a police inquiry  the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges.																								There are believed to be only 20 breeding pairs of hen harriers in England. Shooting the birds is illegal and the offence carries a prison sentence of up to six months or a 5,000 fine.																								One friend of the prince said: Harry is an experienced shot and knows the difference between duck and harrier hawks. He simply didnt shoot the birds. This story was based on, at best, thin evidence. I wouldnt be surprised if someone had an agenda here.																								The pro-shooting lobby suspects that an anti-shooting group leaked details to a newspaper to get publicity for its agenda once it realised the prince had been on the estate at the time.																								Members of conservation and bird protection groups have accused gamekeepers of shooting birds of prey to stop them from killing the chicks of birds, particularly pheasants, reared for shooting. The National Gamekeepers Organisation has denied the charge.																								According to bird experts, hen harriers hover as they search for their prey and then drop suddenly to swoop on it. If someone had heard shots and, in the gloom, seen one or even two birds drop suddenly (on their prey), they could have made two and two make five, said one source.
																								 Harry splits 																							 with girlfriend
																								Britain rsquo;s Prince Harry and his Zimbabwean girlfriend Chelsy Davy (in picture) have split up, the Mail on Sunday has reported.
																								The newspaper said Davy, 22, had told friends she and Harry were having a trial separation.
																								 ldquo;She kept saying she needed to take some time out to re-establish herself. She still loves him but she feels she needs to carve an identity as her own person rather than as																								Harry rsquo;s girlfriend, rdquo; it quoted a friend as saying.
																								The paper said Harry, 23, a second lieutenant in the Household Cavalry, could not deploy with his unit to Afghanistan. 
																								He was kept home when his unit was sent to Iraq because it was too dangerous a mission for the third in line to the throne. (Reuters)					 THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

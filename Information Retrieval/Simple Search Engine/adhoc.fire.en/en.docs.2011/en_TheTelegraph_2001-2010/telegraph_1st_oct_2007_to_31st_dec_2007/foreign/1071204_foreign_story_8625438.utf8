				 Madarsa blast kills six
																								Chaman (Pakistan), Dec. 3 (Reuters): A bomb exploded in a madarsa in a Pakistani town on the Afghan border today killing six people and wounding four, officials said.																								The explosives were placed in the bag of a student at the madarsa in the southwestern town of Qila Saifullah, Baluchistan province, officials said. The bag was placed in a student dormitory, said provincial police official Mohammad Asif said.																								An intelligence official in the town said the man who left the bag had returned to the madarsa from Afghanistan earlier today. He left the madarsa before the explosion, the official said. The madarsas principal had been taken into custody for interrogation, Asif said. Thousands of madarsas sprang up along the Afghan border in the 1980s, many supported by the government which backed Afghan guerrillas fighting Soviet forces.

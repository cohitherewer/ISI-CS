				 Mills, lawyers part ways
				 	 Negative vibes																								London, Nov 9 (Reuters): Heather Mills has parted ways with the law firm representing her in a bitter divorce battle with former Beatle Paul McCartney, the firm said today.																								The news emerged just over a week after the 39-year-old charity worker and former model lost her main PR adviser, who quit before she gave a series of emotional television interviews for which she was slammed in the media.																								We can confirm that she is no longer a client, a spokesperson for top legal firm Mishcon de Reya said.																								The Sun tabloid reported that the company had fired Mills over her recent outbursts, during which she spoke of her relationship with McCartney in defiance of orders not to speak about the marriage or their daughter Beatrice.																								Asked if she could comment further, the spokesperson said: We dont comment on client business, whether a current or former client. I cant say anything further.																								Last August, Mills appointed Mishcon de Reyas Anthony Julius, the same lawyer who represented Princess Diana in her divorce with Prince Charles. McCartneys lawyer is Fiona Shackleton, who acted for Charles in those proceedings.																								Last week Mills appeared on a series of British television shows, accusing the media of branding her a whore and golddigger and driving her to the brink of suicide. She accused McCartney of failing to do enough to protect her and Beatrice.																								Yesterday, she returned to the GMTV studio to say she was feeling better as a result of the tirades, which earned her more negative publicity from tabloid newspapers.

				 Fire? No bar on prisoners
																								Santa Ysabel, Oct. 26 (Reuters): As California struggles to extinguish some of the states most devastating forest fires, it has turned to a record number of prisoners for some of the most demanding work.																								Overnight, women like Carmen Rebelez, 38, a convicted drug offender, and Michelle Millard, 33, serving five years for counterfeit checks and money, were uprooting plants and clearing flammable trees and shrubs.																								Such work is designed to create a perimeter around the Witch Fire, the most dangerous of the California blazes, and keep it from spreading.																								Ive been doing time my whole entire life, since I was 14, Millard said. Its time I learned something different.																								Added Rebelez: I want to make a change in my lifestyle, so when I get out, I can do something positive. We made some wrong choices and we are making an effort to change.																								Of about 9,000 firefighters battling the southern California flames, nearly 3,000 are inmates. The prisoners typically get two days off their sentence for each on the fire lines. About 300 are from all-women prisoner brigades.																								Millard worked with a small team of women in a remote area about two hours northeast of San Diego. To get to the mountainside that needed protection, the women hiked for an hour over charred landscape and brush.																								Its backbreaking work. Its the hardest work Ive ever done, said Tonya Randall Evans, a former hotel cleaner with a 5 1/2-year prison sentence for dealing cocaine. But its given me six months off my sentence.																								Inmate Susan Segal, 42, fell about 25 feet down the precarious mountainside, but was soon back on the job.																								She and the others wore orange fire protective garb (regular firefighters wear yellow), hard hats and 27-kg backpacks. Their faces were blackened by soot. Such work earns praise from many firefighters, who said this weeks fires were among the most difficult theyve had to fight.

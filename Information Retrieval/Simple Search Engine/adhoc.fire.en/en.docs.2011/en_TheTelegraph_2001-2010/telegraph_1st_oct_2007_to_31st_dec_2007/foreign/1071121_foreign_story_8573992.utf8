				 Apex court to decide on Washington gun ban
																								Washington, Nov. 20 (Reuters): The US supreme court said today it would decide whether handguns can be banned in the nations capital, a case that could produce its first ruling in nearly 70 years on the right of Americans to bear arms.																								The nations highest court agreed to hear an appeal by officials from the district of Columbia government arguing that the citys 31-year-old law banning private possession of handguns should be upheld as constitutional.																								The justices said they would review a precedent-setting ruling by a US appeals court that broadly interpreted an individuals constitutional right under the Second Amendment to bear arms and struck down the citys law for violating those rights.																								The supreme court will hear arguments in the case most likely in late February or in March, with a ruling expected by the end of June. 																								The Second Amendment says: A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.

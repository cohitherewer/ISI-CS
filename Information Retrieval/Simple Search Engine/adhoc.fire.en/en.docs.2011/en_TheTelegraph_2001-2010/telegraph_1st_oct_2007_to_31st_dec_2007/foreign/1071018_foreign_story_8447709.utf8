				 Turkey MPs back Iraq attack
																								Ankara, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Turkeys parliament resoundingly approved a motion today allowing troops to cross into northern Iraq to crush Kurdish rebels hiding there, brushing aside appeals from the US and the Baghdad government.																								As parliament voted in Ankara, President George W. Bush said it would not be in Turkeys interests to send troops into northern Iraq. Washington fears a Turkish incursion could destabilise the most peaceful part of Iraq and possibly the wider region by encouraging others such as arch-foe Iran to intervene.

Ankaras stance has helped propel global oil prices to new record highs.

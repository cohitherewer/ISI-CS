				 Malaysia cracks down on Indians before rally
																								Kuala Lumpur, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Malaysian police swooped today on organisers of a planned protest by minority ethnic Indians, arresting them for sedition and warning of racial strife if the rally went ahead as planned at the weekend.																								The organisers, from a Hindu rights group, complain that the government, a ruling coalition dominated by politicians from the ethnic Malay majority, has discriminated against ethnic Indians.																								The group has promised to hold a peaceful rally in the capital on Sunday but the government has warned Indians not to take part, saying it could stoke racial tensions. Police have set up road-blocks around Kuala Lumpur, causing huge traffic jams to deter would-be protesters from coming into the city.																								Today, police went further and arrested three Indians from the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf), charging them under Malaysias colonial-era Sedition Act for making seditious speeches at a recent rally outside the capital.																								We believe they are promoters of Hindraf. We believe they are influential people in the group, Ismail Omar, deputy chief of federal police, told a news conference.We believe we are making the right decision in order to ensure public order.																								Police also took the unusual step of securing a court order preventing anyone from attending the rally.

				 Doctors testiculate, have disco biscuits

				 	 Hasselhoff: Source of inspiration
																								Paris, Dec. 20 (AFP): Doctors have always used tribal vocabulary to communicate between themselves, but now their secret lingo is being enriched by the electronic media and urban slang, the British Medical Journal reports today.
																								Paul Keeley, a consultant in the department of palliative medicine at Glasgow Royal Infirmary in Scotland, wrote to the weekly journal to report a sample of new words that British doctors use among themselves.
																								They include:
																								 Disco biscuits: The clubbers drug ecstasy. As in: The man in cubicle three looks like hes taken one too many disco biscuits
																								 Hasselhoff: Term for any patient who shows up in the emergency room with an injury for which there is a bizarre explanation. Source: Baywatch actor David Hasselhoff, who hit his head on a chandelier while shaving. The broken glass severed four tendons and an artery in his right arm
																								 Agnostication: a substitute for prognostication. Term used to describe the usually vain attempt to answer the question: How long have I got, doc?
																								 Blamestorming: apportioning of blame after the wrong leg or kidney is removed or some other particularly egregious foul-up happens
																								 404 moment: the point in a doctors ward round when medical records cannot be located. Comes from worldwide web error message, 404  document not found 
																								 Testiculation: description of a gesture typically used by a hospital consultant when holding forth on subject on which he or she has little knowledge.
																								 Gesture is of an upturned hand with outstretched fingers pointed upwards, clutching an invisible pair of testicles.
																								Other slangs used by doctors, according to past letters to the journal, include UBI (for unexplained beer injury), Pafo (pissed and fell over) and code brown, or a faecal incontinence emergency. CTD means circling the drain, GPO signifies good for parts only and rule of five means that if more than five of the patients orifices are obscured by tubing, he has no chance.
																								A patient who is giving the -sign is very sick, lying with his mouth open. This is followed by the q-sign  when the tongue hangs out of the mouth  when the patient becomes terminal.
																								As for genetic quirks or inbreeding, FLK means funny looking kid and NFN signifies normal for Norfolk, a rural English county.
																								General practitioners may use LOBNH (lights on but nobody home) or the impressively bogus oligoneuronal to mean someone who is thick.
																								But they also have a poetic option: pumpkin positive, referring to the idea that the persons brain is so tiny that a penlight shone into his mouth will make his empty head gleam like a Halloween pumpkin.

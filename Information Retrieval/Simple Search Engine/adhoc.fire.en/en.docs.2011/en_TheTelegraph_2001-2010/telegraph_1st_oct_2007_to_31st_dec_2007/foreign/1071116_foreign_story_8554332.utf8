				 New attorney-general makes Bush see red
 ALEX SPILLIUS				 	 President Bush with attorney-general Mukasey in Washington. (Reuters)																								Washington, Nov. 15: George W. Bush has been forced into an embarrassing climb-down by his new attorney-general within days of his appointment. 																								Michael Mukasey, who was sworn in on Tuesday, has reopened a dormant inquiry into the US governments warrantless wiretapping programme which was effectively blocked by the President 18 months ago. 																								Bush said Mukasey had my complete trust and confidence, but has agreed to let the investigation by the justice departments Office of Professional Responsibility restart. 																								It was shut down in 2006 when the National Security Agency refused to grant the departments lawyers the necessary security clearances to quiz officials. 																								The scheme aroused controversy because it allowed the NSA to listen in on telephone conversations of terror suspects or those suspected of links with terrorist activity without gaining a warrant from the courts. 																								Democrat Congressmen, led by New York representative Maurice Hinchey, have long demanded an inquiry to test the programmes legality. Hinchey said he was happily surprised by the decision. 																								It now seems because we have a new attorney-general the situation has changed. Maybe this attorney-general understands that his obligation is not to be the private counsel to the President but the chief law enforcement officer for the entire country, he said. 																								 Mukasey, formerly chief judge in Manhattan, was approved by the Senate for the countrys top legal job by the slimmest margin in living memory, after he refused to condemn as torture the interrogative technique known as waterboarding. 																								But during his appointment hearings, it was clear he would be more of his own man than his predecessor Alberto Gonzales, a personal friend of Bush, who was forced to resign after numerous controversies and failures.

																								Former interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao, who was praying at the time of the blast, escaped unhurt. However, his son Mustafa and a nephew were wounded. Sherpao, who had ordered several crackdowns on Islamic militants as minister, had survived an earlier suicide bombing in April this year.
																								Body parts and shoes were scattered around the mosque floor covered in pools of blood. Police found a torn jacket, believed to belong to the attacker, and ball bearings aimed at causing maximum damage.

																								After the bombing, dozens of police and intelligence agents raided an Islamic school in the nearby village of Turangzai and arrested seven students, some of them Afghans, two police officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

				 From First Lady to President 
 							 - Baton to pass from husband to Argentinas new Eva MONTE REEL				 				 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner celebrates in Buenos Aires, and Nestor Kirchner. (Reuters) 																								Buenos Aires, Oct. 29: The presidency of Argentina has been handed from husband to wife as First Lady Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner crushed 13 opposition candidates on the promise of adhering to the political principles that made President Nestor Kirchner one of Latin Americas most popular leaders.																								Multiple exit polls released after Sundays election indicated that she had received about 46 per cent of the vote, enough to outdistance her nearest rival by about 20 percentage points and avoid a second-round runoff. 																								The victory makes her the second woman to be elected president in South America in the past two years, after Chiles Michelle Bachelet.																								Fernandez de Kirchner, 54, was a nationally recognised senator before her husband was elected President in 2003. But she pegged her presidential campaign to the successes of his term, in which there were four years of strong growth following the countrys 2001 economic collapse and $100 billion debt default. 																								She offered few concrete proposals during the electoral race, but promised to deepen the change that her husbands government instituted.																								Like her husband, Fernandez de Kirchner is a fiery and often combative orator whose politics are rooted in the brand of populism made famous here by former strongman president Juan Peron and his wife, Eva. 																								Nestor Kirchners government steered the country away from the free-market policies of the 1990s that the Kirchners  along with a large percentage of the population  blame for the economic crisis. 																								Fernandez de Kirchner has vowed to remain defiantly opposed to the advice of global lending institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.																								To her supporters, such declarations of economic independence  together with a long history of holding Argentinas 1976-83 military dictatorship responsible for human rights abuses  count as the Kirchners principle strengths. 																								Fernandez de Kirchners campaign literature drew parallels between her and Eva Peron, who is revered here as a champion of social justice and defender of the poor.																								Cristina will lead a government that represents all of the people, but the rest of the candidates want to govern just for the elites, said Nestor Arevalo, 38, who cast a ballot for Fernandez de Kirchner in the province of Buenos Aires on Sunday. 																								She has proven herself to be a fighter for human rights, and that is very important in a country with a history like ours.																								Raised in the provincial city of La Plata, she was a student activist in the 1970s who supported the Peronist party and opposed a military dictatorship that had no tolerance for dissent. 																								She met her husband while in law school there, and after the two moved together to the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz, they formed an alliance that soon dominated the regions political landscape. 																								He was elected the provinces governor, and she became its senator. After he was elected president, she won a third term in the senate in 2005, this time representing the province of Buenos Aires, the countrys largest.																								Her initial terms in the legislature established her as an active lawmaker, regularly challenging then-President Carlos Menem and championing reforms calling for more transparent government. 																								But aside from aggressively promoting reforms of the countrys Supreme Court, her most recent term has been comparatively inactive and marked by reversals of some of her earlier positions.

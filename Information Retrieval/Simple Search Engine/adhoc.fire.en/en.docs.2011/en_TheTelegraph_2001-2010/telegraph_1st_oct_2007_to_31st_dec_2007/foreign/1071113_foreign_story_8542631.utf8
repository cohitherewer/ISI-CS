				 UN envoy visits key Yangon jail
																								Yangon, Nov. 12 (Reuters): UN human rights envoy to Myanmar Paulo Sergio Pinheiro today visited Yangons notorious Insein prison and other sites where protesters were held after soldiers crushed anti-junta marches in September.																								A statement by the UN office in Yangon gave no details of the visits, but a diplomat said earlier Pinheiro would try to meet Min Ko Naing and Ko Ko Gyi, two leaders of Augusts fuel price protests believed to be held at Insein.																								He is expecting to interview detainees before the end of his mission and receive further details on their records, the statement said. 																								The Brazilian law professor, on his first trip to the former Burma in four years, also visited Yangons former Government Technical College and a police headquarters where some detainees from the biggest anti-junta protests in 20 years were held.																								He met senior abbots of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, the state body governing Buddhist clergy, and visited two monasteries.

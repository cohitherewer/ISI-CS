				 Students clash with Iran leader supporters
																								Tehran, Oct. 8 (Reuters): More than 100 students scuffled with police and hardline supporters of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today on the Tehran University campus and chanted Death to the dictator outside a hall where the Iranian President spoke.																								Revolutionary President, we support you, the hardline students shouted back, pushing and shoving those who were voicing opposition to Ahmadinejad, a Reuters witness said.																								Liberal-minded students and academics have criticised the President for clamping down on dissent on Iranian campuses, although the President and his government insist they support free speech and welcome constructive opposition. Todays protest was the second rowdy reception Ahmadinejad has received at a university in less than a year. In December, students tried to disrupt his speech on another campus by hurling firecrackers, chanting and burning his picture.																								Students should feel responsible in the international arena ... Todays world needs them, state television quoted the President as telling university officials and students in the hall. One of the pro-reform students said those allowed inside to listen were handpicked because they supported the president. We were not invited, said the student.

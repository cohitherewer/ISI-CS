				 3 killed in Bangla bridge collapse
																								Dhaka, Nov. 24 (Reuters): At least three persons were killed and nearly 100 injured in Bangladesh today when a road bridge packed with hundreds of cyclone survivors waiting for food aid collapsed into a river, police and witnesses said. 																								A further 20 people were missing.																								The cyclone-battered bridge in Kalapara village in Patuakhali district gave way beneath a crowd of people who were hoping for the arrival of vehicles with food and other relief after the countrys deadliest cyclone in 16 years. Cyclone Sidr killed about 3,500 people and left thousands missing or injured. Some 2 million were displaced.																								Witnesses said thousands of hungry survivors were thronging river banks and road sides in cyclone-torn coastal areas even though relief operations had quickened. At least 10 people were hurt when police baton-charged a group of angry survivors at a Patuakhali village, police said.																								Many came from remote areas hoping for food handouts from the government and non-governmental organisations.																								We have walked for several kilometres to reach this river bank to get some food because relief operators just distribute to the people on the banks and roadside, said Marzina Begum, who lost her son and husband in the storm. They dont think there are many survivors in the interior parts.																								The amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge is in Bangladeshi waters to assist the authorities and another US ship, the USS Essex, was due to arrive soon.

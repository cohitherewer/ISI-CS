				 Myanmar crackdown skeletons tumble out

																								Geneva, Dec. 7 (AP): Myanmars military killed 31 people who can be identified by name during a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators  more than double the amount acknowledged by authorities, a UN investigator who visited the country said today.
																								But Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, the UN human rights expert assigned to the country, said the death toll was probably much higher because there were reported cases of killings where victims names were not given.
																								He gave authorities a list of 16 people killed in the military juntas September crackdown, which are in addition to the 15 dead he said have been acknowledged by Myanmars authorities.
																								The new list contains only those incidents where the names of the people involved are cited, Pinheiro said in a 31-page report released by the UN today.
																								There are a number of incidents where no names were reported but where there were allegations of groups of people reportedly killed, which have also been shared.
																								Pinheiro said the report has a list of names of 653 persons detained, 74 persons disappeared and 16 killed  in addition to the list of 15 dead provided by the authorities.

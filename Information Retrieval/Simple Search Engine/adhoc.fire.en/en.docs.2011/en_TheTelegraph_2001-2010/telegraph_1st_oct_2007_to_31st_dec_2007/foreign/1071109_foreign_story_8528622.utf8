				 Musharraf like Potter villain, say school kids 
																								Islamabad, Nov. 8 (PTI): Pakistani schoolchildren compared President Musharraf to Lord Voldemort, the villain in J.K. Rowlings hugely popular Harry Potter series, and former Premier Benazir Bhutto to Umbridge, an evil witch who gave the teen wizard a tough time at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry																								Responding to an assignment to gauge their general knowledge of current events, the 12-year-old students surprised their teacher at a private school in Karachi. They were aware of the imposition of emergency rule and told the teacher that only Harry Potter could save Pakistan. 																								My students may be young but it is heartening to learn how well-informed they are, Sehar Rizvi, the Class 7 teacher, told the Daily Times. 																								What distresses the students the most is the absence of a character like Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore, she said.																								Another teacher, Sophiya, who gave the assignment to the students, said she is eager to put up their responses on the school notice board.																								When the students were prodded to name a person who could be Dumbledore of Pakistan, they suggested it was Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of the nation. 																								Twelve-year-old Saad Zia said: Dumbledore and Jinnah are similar. Jinnah was a lawyer and today lawyers are in danger. Dumbledore was the headmaster and his students and school were in danger.																								Another student, Niazi, said Musharraf and Voldemort are similar because both supported militancy.																								The students compared Musharrafs imposition of emergency rule with Voldemort and the death eaters. 																								Though the students could not find a Harry Potter in Pakistan, sacked supreme court chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry came close to being the wizard and the protesting lawyers were seen as Potters friends.

				 Indian boys set ablaze
				 	 A school picture of Om and Vishv Patel. (AP)																								Glendale Heights, (Illinois), Nov. 22 (AP): Police were questioning a father in the case of two boys who were doused with petrol and set ablaze at their home in a Chicago suburb.																								However, the investigation has been slow because the father requires frequent burn treatments himself, police said. Kaushik Patel, 34, an Indian immigrant, was being treated for burns at Loyola University Medical Centre in the Chicago suburb of Maywood, the Chicago Tribune reported.																								His two sons, Om, 4, and Vishv, 7, were at the hospital in drug-induced comas after being severely burned, authorities said.																								Their mother Nisha Patel was keeping a vigil in a waiting room of the hospital, but has not been allowed to see her sons, friends told the newspaper. Im just tired of all this. Im just praying theyre OK, she told a reporter.																								Authorities suspect Kaushik Patel set fire to the couples two sons on Sunday night at their home in Glendale Heights in Chicagos western suburbs.																								Kaushik Patel has not been arrested or charged yet in the case, said DuPage county states attorney Joseph Birkett yesterday. 																								Police said their investigation has been slowed because Kaushik Patel requires frequent treatment for his burns, said Glendale Heights police Commander Dennis Schar. Weve encountered some roadblocks with his medical condition, Schar said. Were limited in how long we can talk to him. We dont want to interfere with his treatment.																								Kaushik Patels sister-in-law Kamini Patel told the Tribune on Tuesday that he described the incident as a botched suicide involving himself and his two sons.																								Kaushik Patel moved to the Chicago area from Gujarat in 1992, and later married and brought his wife to the country, Kamini Patel said.

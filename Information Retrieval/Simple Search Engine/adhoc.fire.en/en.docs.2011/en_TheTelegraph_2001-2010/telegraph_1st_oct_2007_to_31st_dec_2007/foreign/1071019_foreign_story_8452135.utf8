				 Sarkozy splits with wife
				 	 Sarkozy and Cecilia				 																								Paris, Oct. 18 (Reuters): President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Cecilia have divorced after 11 years of marriage, dealing a severe personal blow to the French leader just six months after he was elected to power.																								Ending months of spiralling speculation about a marital rift, Sarkozys spokesman issued a terse statement saying the pair were separating by mutual consent and would not discuss the issue any further. He later confirmed they were divorced.																								The couples lawyer said they had already seen a judge to formalise the split and had agreed financial terms.																								There was no problem, they resolved everything amicably, lawyer Michele Cahen said.																								It was the first time in modern French history that a serving president has divorced and Sarkozys reaction to the split will come under intense scrutiny.																								Cecilia, 50, played a crucial role in his rise to power, serving as an adviser during his previous stints as interior and finance minister. Sarkozy, 52, himself vaunted their relationship, telling aides she was the only non-negotiable part of his career.

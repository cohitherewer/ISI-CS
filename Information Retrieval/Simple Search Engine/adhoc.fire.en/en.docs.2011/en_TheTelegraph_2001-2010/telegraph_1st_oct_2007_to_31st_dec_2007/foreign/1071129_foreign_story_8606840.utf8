				 Twin suicide attacks in Colombo kill 19
				 	 Police officers outside a department store in the Colombo suburb of Nugegoda after the suicide bombing. (Reuters)																								Nugegoda (Sri Lanka), Nov. 28 (AP): Tamil Tiger rebels set off a bomb at the entrance of a popular department store in a Colombo suburb this evening, killing at least 18 people and wounding 37 others, the military said.																								Earlier, a handicapped suicide bomber blew herself up at Sri Lankas social services ministry in the heart of Colombo, the military said.																								The attack targeted the offices of Douglas Devananda, the minister of social services and the leader of the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party, an ethnic Tamil party considered a rival to the rebels, the military said.																								Devananda, the target of repeated assassination attempts, was not injured in the attack, but the blast killed one of his staff members and injured two others.																								We know that the attacks bear all the hallmarks of the LTTE. It is nobody else but the LTTE, military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said, referring to the group by its formal name, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.																								The Tamil Tigers, listed as a terror organisation by the US and the EU, have carried out more than 240 suicide bombings and countless other attacks. This evenings blast occurred just outside the four-storey No Limits store in Nugegoda as commuters crowded a nearby bus stop during the rush hour, officials said.																								The powerful explosion shattered the department stores windows and sent piles of crumbled concrete pouring onto the bloodstained sidewalk, according to an Associated Press photographer at the scene. Crumpled and charred parts of motorcycles and three-wheeled taxis were scattered nearby. Police and firefighters were digging through the rubble in a search for more bodies.																								I was on the top floor of a shoe shop with my wife and child when I heard a big blast and there were glass pieces all over us, local resident A. Jayasena told AP Television News. As we ran away, I saw the entrance of the No Limit shop burning, and in the midst of it a schoolgirl on the floor trying to get up and then falling back again.																								Jayasena and his daughter suffered minor injuries, while his wife was in a hospital being treated for more serious wounds, he said.																								The military said in a statement that at least 16 people were killed and 37 others injured. At a nearby hospital, residents came in search of missing relatives. One girl who suffered a broken arm in the attack sat with her mother as she received treatment.																								The bomb may have exploded when a security guard at the mall became suspicious about a parcel and tried to open it, a defence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, police at the scene said the explosives may have been in one of the three-wheeled taxis that were destroyed.																								The attacks came a day after 22 civilians  including 11 schoolchildren  were killed in separate attacks inside rebel-controlled territory in northern Sri Lanka. The rebels blamed the military for the attacks.																								The military denied responsibility for the roadside bombing that killed the children and two others, but said it was behind the bombing of a rebel radio station that killed nine people.

				 Assassins bind two generations

																								Islamabad, Dec. 30 (Reuters): A grim twist of fate saw Pakistani doctor Mussadiq Khan struggling to save the life of a Pakistani leader struck down by an assassin, just as Khans father had done 56 years ago.
																								Khan battled in vain to save Benazir Bhutto when she was brought to his hospital in Rawalpindi following a gun and bomb attack as she left an election rally at a city park.
																								Khans doctor father, Sadiq Khan, was on duty at his Rawalpindi hospital in October 1951 when Pakistans first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, was brought in after he was gunned down at a rally in the same park where Bhutto was attacked. Liaquat Ali Khan was also killed and the park was later named Liaquat Bagh after him. Bagh means garden in Urdu.
																								Its Gods will, Khan said when asked about the coincidence of father and son attending to two Pakistani leaders attacked in the same place.
																								Khan said Bhutto was almost dead when she was brought in. She was not breathing. She had no blood pressure, no heartbeat. We did a full resuscitation. We worked hard but unfortunately we could not revive her. 
																								I did my best but I didnt succeed. What can I say?... She was a great leader. She was our leader.

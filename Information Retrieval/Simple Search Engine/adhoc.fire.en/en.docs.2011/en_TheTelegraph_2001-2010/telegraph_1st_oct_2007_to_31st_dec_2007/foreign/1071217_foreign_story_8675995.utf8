				 Basra security off Britains hands

																								Basra, Iraq, Dec. 16 (Reuters): The UK handed over security in Basra province to Iraqi forces today, effectively marking the end of nearly five years of British control of southern Iraq.
																								Today we stand at a historic juncture and a special day, one of the greatest days in the modern history of Basra, provincial governor Mohammed Mosbah al-Waeli said at a ceremony at the last British base at an airport outside the city.
																								The British commander, Major-General Graham Binns, said Iraqi security forces had proved that they are capable.
																								I came to rid Basra of its enemies but I now formally hand Basra back to its friends, said Binns, who also led the force that captured the city from Saddam Husseins troops in 2003.
																								A scaled-down UK force will remain in sout- hern Iraq confined to its base at Basras airport, with a training mission and a rapid reaction team on stand-by.
																								Responsibility for Iraqs main oil export hub, the last of the four provinces once controlled by Britain, will be the biggest test yet of the Baghdad governments ability to keep the peace without troops from the US.
																								With Iraqs second-larg- est city, only major port and nearly all its oil exports, Basra is more popu- lous, wealthier and more strategically located than any of the other eight of Iraqs 18 provinces previously placed under formal Iraqi control.
																								It has also often been more violent, although Iraqi for- ces say their 30,000 troops and police in the area can keep peace.
																								Many Basra residents expressed optimism: You can see this happiness on the faces of everyone. It feels like a heavy burden has been lifted off our chests, said teacher Adel Jassem.
																								However, others questioned whether Iraqi troops were up to the job.
																								The handover is a good step, but we hope that Iraqi forces are ready. I do- t think they are fully ready and the handover should have been delayed, said merchant Faisal Sharhan, 28.
																								Iraqs second city is a lively place, with restaurants open late and little of the barricaded neighbourhood siege mentality found in the capital, Baghdad.

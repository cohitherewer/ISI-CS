				 Brown profoundly regrets data loss
 GORDON RAYNER, ANDREW PORTER AND EMMA HENRY				 	 Gordon Brown in London on Wednesday. (AP)																								London, Nov. 21: Gordon Brown has said he profoundly regretted the loss of the personal data of every family in Britain and apologised to the millions affected.																								Two compact discs containing bank details and addresses of 9.5 million parents and the names, dates of birth and National Insurance numbers of all 15.5 million children in the country went missing after a junior employee of HM Revenue and Customs sent them in the mail, unrecorded and unregistered.																								But in a bruising question hour session in the House of Commons, Brown faced accusations from David Cameron, the Tory leader, that there had been systematic failures at Her Majestys Revenue amp; Customs (HMRC) and that he is taking control of everything but can run nothing.																								Telling MPs that rules in place on the handling sensitive information included it only being accessed by authorised staff and the data being encrypted, the PM said : This is the procedure, it just wasnt followed and this is what the inquiry is to look at.																								But Cameron countered: It (the data) was sent not once, not twice but three times and that is evidence of systematic failure.																								The encounter between Cameron and Brown came as Alistair Darling, the Chancellor, condemned the loss of the data as unforgivable but refused to step down over the security breach.																								The Chancellor, who first learnt of the security breach eleven days ago, told TV channel GMTV that he apologised unreservedly to the British people.																								Speaking later to the BBC Radio 4s Today programme, the Chancellor denied that Gordon Browns merger of customs and excise and the inland revenue was to blame for the incident. Darling said: It is not the merger, it is not the reductions in staff that led to processes being breached.																								The rules appear to have been breached, with catastrophic results. I dont think it was the merger that actually caused the problem.																								However, current and former civil servants from the department have contacted the Telegraph to disagree.																								I have just retired from HMRC and I know that this latest fiasco was an accident waiting to happen, said one. The organisation has been in general meltdown since its two very different parts were forced together.																								Another said: This is just the tip of the iceberg. Cost cuts mean that staff are discouraged from sending post first class, let alone registered delivery, he added.																								The discs  which were not encrypted  also contained all the information a criminal would need to commit identity theft by applying for loans, credit cards and goods in someone elses name. 																								Childrens charities have warned that the information would be extremely useful to paedophiles who could target specific children and pose as their parents.																								The failure by an agency which reports directly to Darling piled further pressure on the Chancellor in a week when he has already faced huge criticism of his handling of the Northern Rock crisis and on the same day that figures showed he was likely to overshootp his 38billion borrowing target for the year.

				 Sudan teacher pardoned
																								Khartoum, Dec. 3 (Reuters): The British teacher jailed in Sudan for letting her students name a teddy bear Mohammad won a pardon today and was released into British care.

An adviser to Sudanese President Hassan al-Bashir, asked to confirm Gibbons had been pardoned, said: Definitely, yes.																								Students waved flags and beat drums in protest outside the British embassy in Khartoum, following demonstrations on Friday when sword-waving Islamists called for the teachers death.																								Gibbons apologised after the pardon announcement for any discomfort she had caused to the people of Sudan. The British embassy said she was in its care.

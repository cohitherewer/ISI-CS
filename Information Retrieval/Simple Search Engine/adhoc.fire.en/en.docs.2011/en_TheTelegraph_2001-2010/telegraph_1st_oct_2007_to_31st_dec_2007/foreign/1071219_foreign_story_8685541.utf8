				 Death star wiping out alien life

																								London, Dec. 18: A black hole blasting an immense jet of energy into a neighbouring galaxy has been observed by astronomers for the first time. 
																								In a burst of galactic violence recorded by astronomers in the US space agencys ground and space-based observatories, the black hole of a death star is seen shooting the jet of radiation into the adjacent galaxy, Nasa said. 
																								Weve seen many jets produced by black holes, but this is the first time weve seen one punch into another galaxy like were seeing here, said Dan Evans, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and leader of the study.
																								This jet could be causing all sorts of problems for the smaller galaxy it is pummeling, said Evans, who led the research team making the discovery.
																								The stream erupted in a galactic system called 3C321, which consists of two galaxies orbiting each other in relatively close proximity of just 20 thousand light years.

				 Dont hinder Sharif return: Pak SC
 NASIR JAFFRY 																								Islamabad, Oct. 30: Pakistans supreme court today ordered the government not to hinder the return of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to the country. 																								Who can stop him (Sharif) from coming to Pakistan? asked a furious Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. He added that it was Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz who violated the courts order. 																								Chaudhry, who was suspended by President Pervez Musharraf in March but was reinstated by the apex court in July, said the August 23 judgment, which said Sharif had an inalienable right to return and remain in the country as a Pakistani citizen, was required to be implemented in letter and spirit. 																								However, on his arrival after seven years in exile, Sharif was sent back to Saudi Arabia by a special plane. 																								We have already made it clear that a Pakistani citizen cannot be restricted upon entering the country, Chaudhry said as foreign secretary Riaz Muhammad Khan and the governments chief of protocol appeared before the court with written statements. 																								Khan said he had verbal orders from Aziz to make available a special aircraft. The chief of protocol said he got instructions from the principal secretary to the Premier. 																								It means that the arrangements were being made by the Prime Minister to violate the courts order, Chaudhry said. We are now proceeding against him.																								Ex-PM wife in Delhi																								Sharifs wife Kulsoom underwent knee surgery at Fortis Hospital in New Delhi today, adds PTI. The 56-year-old Kulsoom was admitted to the hospital on Sunday. Kulsoom had not accompanied Sharif when he returned to Pakistan, fuelling speculation that she might land in the country later to keep up the fight.

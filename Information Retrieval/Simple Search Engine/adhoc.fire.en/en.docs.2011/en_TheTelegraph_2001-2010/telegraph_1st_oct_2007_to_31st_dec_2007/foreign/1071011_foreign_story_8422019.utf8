				 Condom gift
 NASIR JAFFRY Islamabad, Oct. 10: Chaudhry  Shehbaz Hussain cant understand why his peers have  turned on him with such anger after the Id gift he sent  them.																								But Senator Latif Khosa says he felt humiliated by the population welfare ministrys move. Educated people like him, he bristled, dont need such gift-wrapped messages.																								We all know the benefits of contraceptives, he fumed.																								The gift in question, if you havent guessed by now, is a pack of 100 condoms each to all parliamentarians on the eve of Id-ul-Fitr. The entire exercise is aimed at creating awareness among representatives of the people about population boom and the threat of AIDS, Hussain told The Telegraph, confirming that the gifts had been dispatched.																								According to world body UNAIDS, about 85,000 of Pakistans 16 crore people are living with HIV. 																								Chaudhry said he cant fathom why his fellow parliamentarians are so angry. I am really at a loss to understand why we feel shy in promoting public messages about birth control, safe sex and prevention of AIDS, he said. 																								And its not that Islam discourages birth control. 																								But most of Hussains fellow parliamentarians are indignant. Condoms as Id gift? Outrageous, they say. A member of the National Assembly says he is so outraged that he would raise the matter when the parliaments lower House meets again. I will send it (the packet of condoms) back to the ministry if they send me the gift, said Senator Khosa, adding that his party, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos PPP, had taken strong exception to the governments move.

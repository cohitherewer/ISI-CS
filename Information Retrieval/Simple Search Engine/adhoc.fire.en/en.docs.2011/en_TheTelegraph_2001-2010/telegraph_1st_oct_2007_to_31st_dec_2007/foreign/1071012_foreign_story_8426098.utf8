				 Benazir return
																								Islamabad, Oct. 11 (Reuters): Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto will return as planned on October 18, a spokesman said, despite a call from President Pervez Musharraf for her to wait until a court rules on the legality of his re-election.																								Bhutto is scheduled to fly home from eight years in self-exile a day after the supreme court reconvenes to consider challenges to Musharrafs eligibility in a presidential election last Saturday in which he swept most votes. It is not clear how long the court will take to reach a decision on Opposition objections to Musharrafs re-election while still army chief.																								Bhutto will return to Pakistan as scheduled on the 18th of October, said her spokesman, Farahtullah Babar.																								He declined to comment on why Musharraf might have asked Bhutto to stay away until the supreme court had ruled.

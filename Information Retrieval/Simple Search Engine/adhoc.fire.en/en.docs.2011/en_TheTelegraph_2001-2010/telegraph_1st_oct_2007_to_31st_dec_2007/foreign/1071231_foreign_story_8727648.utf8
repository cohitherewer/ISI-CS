																								Islamabad, Dec. 30: Long live Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto shouted, waving to the crowd surging around her car. They were her last words before three gunshots rang out and she slumped back on to her seat.
																								She did not say anything more, said Safdar Abbassi, her chief political adviser, who was sitting behind her.
																								In the first eyewitness account from inside the car, Abbassi told The Sunday Telegraph: All of a sudden there was the sound of firing. I heard the sound of a bullet.
																								I saw her: she looked as though she ducked in when she heard the firing. We did not realise that she had been hit by a bullet.
																								He had looked up to see Bhutto sliding back through the aperture in the roof of the white Land Cruiser. Moments later, the car was rocked by a huge explosion.
																								There was no sound from the fallen leader.
																								Abbassi leant forward to see what was wrong. At first glance, she appeared to have escaped injury. Then he noticed the blood. It was seeping from a deep wound on the left side of her neck.
																								His account is confirmed by photos that have surfaced in Pakistan showing a man in dark glasses aiming a handgun and standing only few feet from Bhutto, moments before she died. His accomplice, the suspected suicide bomber, is further back amid the heaving crowds thronging around the cavalcade.
																								Naheeb Khan, Abbassis wife, cradled the injured womans head in her lap, reaching up for her own headscarf, pulling it from her head, pressing it into the wound, trying to stem the flow. But the wound was deep and the blood seeped out, spreading down her neck and across her blue tunic.
																								The official Pakistani government line is that Bhutto caught her head on the sunroofs catch as she ducked inside, fracturing her skull. Absolute facts  nothing but facts, the government said of its account.
																								But Abbassi leaves little room for doubt. There was too much blood, he said, and a gaping wound in her neck. She had been shot.
																								A Pakistan TV station has been broadcasting the dramatic images taken by an amateur photographer of the suspected assassin, apparently contradicting the government explanation, and a man shrouded in white standing further back, believed to be the suicide bomber who blew himself up killing 20.
																								It was the first rally that Bhutto had addressed since the attempt on her life in October, and she was on a high. As she walked from the podium, she had turned to Abbassi, her friend as well as adviser, and urged him to join her in working the crowd.
																								Why dont you join me? she said. 
																								They headed towards the two waiting Land Cruisers, Bhutto leading. The charismatic leader would never decide until the last minute which car to ride in; not even her head of security was party to the decision until she opened the car door. On Thursday, she chose the lead vehicle.
																								She was smiling and she was extremely happy, Abbassi said. She took me inside the car and she sat in front of me. I started chanting slogans because there were crowds all around.
																								Bhutto clambered on to her seat and lifted herself through the sunroof to wave to supporters. Behind her, Abbassi took up the chanting again. Nar-e Bhutto (lets cheer for Bhutto), he shouted. Jai Bhutto, she replied. Then the gunman opened fire.
																								We thought she had ducked in but she had not, she had fallen down, said Abbassi. She did not say a single word. For a few seconds, we thought she was confused by the firing and that is why she was not talking. We did not realise.
																								Before anyone had a chance to speak, the attacker detonated his explosives, peppering the vehicle with ball bearings.
																								There was a big bang. Some of the shrapnel hit the car and then the driver sped away. In the following car, Farhad Ullah Babar, Bhuttos chief spokesperson, saw his leader disappear back inside her car.
																								There was a huge bang and everyone was running from one place to the other but the vehicle was still moving, he said. She disappeared. So we thought, because she had gone inside, that she was safe.
																								But inside the car in front, realisation was dawning. We saw the blood: the blood was everywhere, on her neck and on her clothes and we realised she was hit. She could not say anything, Abbassi said, his shirt still stained with Bhuttos blood.
																								Able to do nothing more than stanch some of the bleeding, they made for the nearest hospital. 
																								Bhutto was still alive when she was carried into the intensive care unit, but her injuries were so severe that she stood no chance.
																								The doctors really tried their best but it was too late, Abbassi said, amid tears. I was so optimistic: I thought nothing would happen to her. I still feel she is alive. I cannot believe she is with us no more.

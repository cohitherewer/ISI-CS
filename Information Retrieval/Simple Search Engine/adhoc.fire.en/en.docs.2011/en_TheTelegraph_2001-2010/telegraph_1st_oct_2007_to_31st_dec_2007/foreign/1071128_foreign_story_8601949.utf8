				 Smoke horror
																								Washington, Nov. 27 (Reuters): One third of people who breath in high levels of second-hand smoke have damage to their lungs similar to that seen in smokers, doctors reported yesterday.																								They used a special kind of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scan to look at the lungs of non-smokers who had high exposure to other peoples cigarette smoke and found evidence of damage that causes emphysema.																								We interpreted those changes as early signs of lung damage, representing very mild forms of emphysema, said Chengbo Wang, a magnetic resonance physicist at The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, who led the study.																								Almost one third of nonsmokers who had been exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke for a long time developed these structural changes, Wang said.

				 80 Indians charged in Malaysia for protest
																								Kuala Lumpur, Nov. 28 (AP): At least 80 ethnic Indians were charged in court today for taking part in a massive, banned rally to demand equal rights for minority Indians in the Muslim-majority country.																								The Indians, who were charged in at least five different courts, pleaded not guilty to participating in an illegal assembly on Sunday by about 10,000 people, defence lawyer Saha Deva A. Arunasalam said Many were freed on bail.																								Some were also charged with refusing to disperse and trying to injure police officers, said Arunasalam and his colleague, Joshua Sambantha. If convicted, they could be jailed for between six months and five years, the lawyers said.																								The 80 people were arrested during the unprecedented demonstration in downtown Kuala Lumpur which stunned the normally peaceful nation. The protests lasted about seven hours despite the repeated firing of tear gas and water cannons by police.																								People wont be deterred. They want to put their foot down, said P. Uthayakumar, one of the organisers of the rally. To me it is racially motivated. The public will have more hatred for the government.

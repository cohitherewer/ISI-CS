				 Kate Moss thinks Tory chief is a plumber
 TIM CLARK				 	 lost in drainage																								London, Nov. 10: David Cameron, the Conservative leader, has told how he was recently mistaken for a plumber by the model Kate Moss. 																								The pair were introduced by Sir Philip Green, the billionaire businessman who owns Topshop, at a charity dinner.																								A star-struck Cameron had no idea what he should talk about, so he instigated a conversation about flood damage.																								The model was so impressed with his knowledge that she asked him for his phone number so that she could ask his advice on drainage.																								Appearing on the Parkinson TV programme, Cameron was asked about the fun side of his job as politician. 																								I suppose you get to meet some quite interesting people, he said. I went to a charitable dinner the other night and Philip Green came up to me and said: Would you like to meet Kate Moss? So I said: Well, of course Id like to meet Kate Moss. I went over to her table and, on the way over, I thought, what on earth am I going to say?																								And I remembered she actually has a house in my constituency  and wed had these terrible floods in west Oxfordshire. So I said: Very nice to meet you, very sorry about the flooding in your house. I know your local pub has been flooded, Ive been to see the publican and I know you like to go to the pub and so I know its going to re-open in six months.																								So I went on like this and she turned around and said: God, you sound like a really useful guy, can I have your phone number? I went back to my table and said: The good news is, I met Kate Moss and she wanted my telephone number. The bad news is, I think she thinks Im something to do with drainage.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

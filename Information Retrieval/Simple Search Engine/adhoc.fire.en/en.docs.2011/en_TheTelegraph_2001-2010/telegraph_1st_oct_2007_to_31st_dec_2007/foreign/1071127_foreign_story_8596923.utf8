				 Pervez to quit in days
 NASIR JAFFRY 				 	 Musharraf in Islamabad on Monday. (AP)																								Islamabad, Nov. 26: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf will step down as army chief in the next couple of days to take oath as a civilian President. 																								General Musharraf will step down as the army chief by Wednesday and take oath as civilian President on Thursday, highly-placed sources told The Telegraph. 																								Musharraf, who used to describe his uniform as part of his skin, is also likely to attend a farewell conference of his top military commanders in the garrison town of Rawalpindi on Wednesday. 																								However, a senior official, who requested anonymity, told The Telegraph that Musharraf will take oath as a civilian President on Thursday. He will also pay farewell visits to different army bases on Wednesday and Thursday. 																								Vice-chief of army staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kiyani, who has already been named as the army chief-designate, will assume command of the land forces after Musharraf gives up his uniform. 																								Kiyani was picked by Musharraf from among top lieutenant generals in October 1998 to lead the army. 																								The defence ministry is all set to notify appointment of the new army chief, the sources said as media reports said the change of command ceremony will take place within the next 48 hours.																								Musharraf is under pressure at home and abroad to roll back the emergency which he used to purge the supreme court of judges he feared would annul his October 6 election by parliament.																								Unpopular, politically isolated and desperate for support from a new parliament, Musharraf now has to contend with two rivals he accused of corruption and spent much of the last eight years trying to marginalise.																								He allowed Bhutto, a two-time Prime Minister, to come back last month protected from old graft charges in the hope she would become a post-election ally.																								Relations between Musharraf and Bhutto soured almost at once when a suicide attack killed at least 139 at her homecoming parade on October 19.

				 Airports alert for remote toys 
																								Washington, Oct. 2 (AP): Airport screeners will be taking a closer look at remote-control toys in carry-on luggage because of the possibility that they might be capable of detonating bombs, US officials say.																								The new practice is a result of reviewing recent intelligence but is not based on any specific threat, according to the Transportation Security Administration.																								Were always looking at the dots, TSA Administrator Kip Hawley said yesterday. And we got to the point on this one that we felt it was advisable to alert our officers. Passengers, including children, carrying these toys on airplanes may have to go through secondary screening. 																								The TSA does not have statistics on how many people bring remote-controlled toys in their carry on luggage, Hawley said, although in our informal survey, we were told that there are more than we think.																								Airport screeners have been trained for a while on the possibility that remote-control toys could detonate bombs, but they have now been told to pay even closer attention.																								Authorities recently arrested two Florida engineering students and accused one of them of posting a video online with instructions on how to use a remote-controlled toy to set off a bomb. In the video one suspect shows how a remote-control toy vehicle is operated, and gives instructions as to the range and distance the remote will operate, according to the FBI.

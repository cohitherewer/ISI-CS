				 Saddam confessed over coffee
 ALEX SPILLIUS																								London, Nov. 14: America has used some highly questionable methods to glean information from suspects during the war on terror, but with its most famous detainee it deployed coffee, West Asian sweets and cosy chats.																								According to an FBI agent who spent five hours a day questioning Saddam Hussein for seven months, the softly, softly approach paid handsome dividends, as the jailed dictator opened his heart, confessing to slaughtering 180,000 Kurds.																								There was no sign of waterboarding, deafening music or blinding light, and when it was time for Special Agent George Piro to depart, Saddam burst into tears of sadness. The two men then enjoyed Cuban cigars together on the patio behind his cell at Baghdad airport.																								Piro, an Arabic-speaking American, revealed the secrets of his prolonged encounter with Saddam in a new book by Ron Kessler published yesterday, The Terrorist Watch. He explained that after Saddams capture, in December 2003, he built a rapport with the Iraqi leader, by acting as his sole conduit with the outside world.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

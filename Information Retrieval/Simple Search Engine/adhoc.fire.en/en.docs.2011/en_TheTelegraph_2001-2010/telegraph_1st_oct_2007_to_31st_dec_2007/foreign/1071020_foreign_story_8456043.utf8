				 Bush nudges Delhi on junta 
				 	 Bush																								Washington, Oct. 19 (Reuters): George W. Bush will announce further sanctions against Myanmars military rulers tomorrow and will call on India and China to do more to pressure the country to end its repression of pro-democracy protesters, White House said.																								White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the President had threatened additional sanctions if the Burmese regime did not end its repression when he announced strengthened measures last month.																								Unfortunately, the Burmese regime did not respond, he added.																								Bush will make a public statement at 5.50 GMT.																								White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Bush would ask Myanmars neighbours to help. He will call on, in his statement, China and India to do more, Perino said. And so this is all headed towards pressuring the regime to try to make a difference.																								China is the closest, the isolated Myanmar junta has to an ally, acting as a key trading partner and arms supplier, and is seen as the linchpin for any international pressure campaign. India also has some economic clout in Myanmar.																								Fratto said the treasury department, responsible for implementing sanctions against Myanmar, would also make an announcement about steps being taken in response to the crackdown on protests against 45 years of military rule. But he declined to give details.																								Washington imposed a new set of sanctions on Myanmar military officials last month, toughening measures that had been in place for years but had forced little change.																								Earlier this month, pro-democracy protests in Myanmar were crushed by the nations military leaders. Many protesters were arrested, and some killed, and police have since made further detentions.																								Bush on Monday called for enormous international pressure to make it clear to the generals that they will be completely isolated.

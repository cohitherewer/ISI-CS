				 Lukewarm wife a worry for Sarkozy
 SUSAN BELL				 	 Cecilia Sarkozy																								Paris, Oct. 7: Cecilia Sarkozy is lukewarm about living at the presidential residence she shares with her husband, a friend of Frances first lady has revealed.																								It is the image of France in the world but it is not necessarily a convivial place to live with her children, said Isabelle Balkany. In comments that fuelled rumours that the Sarkozys marriage is on the rocks, Balkany added: She is lukewarm about living there.																								In stark contrast with Cherie Blairs appetite for life at Downing Street with her political spouse, the wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy is said to be far from comfortable in the sumptuous surroundings of the Elyse Palace in Paris.																								Balkany, who emerged last week to make less-than-convincing claims that a mysterious love letter seen tucked under Sarkozys arm was in fact just an affectionate note sent by her to Cecilia, said that the couple preferred their home in the wealthy Paris suburb of Neuilly, where Sarkozy was formerly mayor.																								Cecilia was also more comfortable at La Lanterne, a pretty villa attached to the Chteau de Versailles traditionally used as a retreat by the Prime Minister, she said.																								At the end of a week when Frances rumour mill went into overdrive after Cecilia pulled out of an official trip to Sofia with her husband, Balkanys other comments may also give the president cause to worry.																								She doesnt feel she has entered into the history books. Her spouse, yes, and she is accompanying him but thats not what preoccupies her, said Balkany, who is the vice-president of the local council in Hauts-de-Seine, west of Paris. She isnt a rebel just for the sake of being rebellious: she is free, that is the word.																								She is a woman with her own ideas and her own convictions which she defends. She doesnt do just anything. The first ladys family was her absolute priority, said Balkany in a magazine interview.																								As in all recomposed families, it was necessary to face up to difficulties but she resolved them, she added, in reference to the Sarkozys marriage after each had had children in previous partnerships.																								The French President again cut a solitary figure last night as he attended the Rugby World Cup clash in Cardiff between France and New Zealand, although for once his wifes absence was not unexpected: she is not known to be a sports fan.

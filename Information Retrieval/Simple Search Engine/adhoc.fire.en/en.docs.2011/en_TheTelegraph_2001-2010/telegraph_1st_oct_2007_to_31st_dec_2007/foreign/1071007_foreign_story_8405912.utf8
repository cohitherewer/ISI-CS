				 Loser: Public
																								Islamabad, Oct. 6 (AP): A court must still rule whether President Musharrafs landslide win in todays presidential election is valid, but one loser was clear before the voting even began: public faith in Pakistani politics.																								Opposition boycotts, legal wrangling and the efforts of former leaders Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif to mount a comeback are the stuff of media debate in Pakistan. But many ordinary Pakistanis feel confirmed in their view that power is the preserve of a corrupt elite, too busy securing their own interests.																								All politicians are the same, said Ali Ahmad, a 28-year-old school teacher in the eastern city of Quetta. They are the enemy of poor people. They gave us nothing but suicide attacks, terrorism and violence.																								 Zafar Abbas, a 30-year-old carpenter sitting under a tree opposite parliament building where lawmakers were voting, said the court should disqualify Musharraf. This is not happening under the Constitution and law. This is disappointing, Abbas said. Some admire Musharrafs political craft. Zafar Iqbal, a 28-year-old shopkeeper in Multan, said todays vote was just a drama, not an election. But he added that the general played his cards wisely.

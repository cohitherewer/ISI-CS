				 Imran in video urges protests
																								London/Karachi, Nov. 7 (PTI): Former Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan, who was in hiding last night after escaping house arrest, has appealed to his countrymen to protest against President Musharrafs draconian regime.																								Khan, who dramatically escaped after police surrounded his home near Islamabad following the proclamation of emergency on Saturday, issued the call in a video released to the media from an undisclosed destination.																								If we dont resist and we dont raise our voice against (emergency), it will take us on the path to destruction, he said in Urdu. Inshallah, I will be with you in the coming days. I will use all my powers, we will not accept this under any circumstances and we will resist in every way possible, said an unshaven Khan. He looked haggard and was clad in a salwar kameez and a brown waistcoat.																								Khan also spoke in English in the video. He alleged that Musharraf had carried out a second assault on the judiciary because he was petrified that the judgment of the supreme court in the case challenging his candidature in the October 6 presidential poll would go against him. And so in the garb of fighting this war on terror  and this war on terror is his only legitimacy as far as the west is concerned  what he has done is that he has unleashed brutality that has not been known in this country before, Khan said. 																								Admiral Jawaid Iqbal, a spokesman for Khans Tehreek-e-Insaf party, said from an undisclosed destination that the former cricketer was fine but traumatised by the efforts to detain him as well as the arrest of party workers.

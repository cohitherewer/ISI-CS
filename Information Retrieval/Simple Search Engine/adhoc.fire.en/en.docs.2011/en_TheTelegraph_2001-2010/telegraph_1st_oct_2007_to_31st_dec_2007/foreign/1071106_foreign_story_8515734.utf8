				 Indian family tops search for UK brainiest
 AMIT ROY				 	 The Chouhan family with host Lorraine Kelly (extreme left) after the London finals																								London, Nov. 5: Are Indians getting sickening good at everything?																								A nationwide search for Britains brainiest family by Nintendo, the technology giant, has found the answer and, yes, they are Indian.																								 The Chouhan family from Leicester won a 20,000 prize which will go towards university fees and other educational costs.																								The mother, Karen, 51, a charity worker and her daughter, Chhaya, 17 and son Amar, 10, got the highest score of all the families who took part in the Nintendo contest.																								They had to complete various puzzles and brain teasers in the Big Brain Academy computer game.																								 In the search for the cleverest family in the land, executives from Nintendo hunted far and wide. 																								They held regional heats held in shopping centres across Britain.																								 The battle began on October 13 and took in Glasgow Braehead Centre, Gateshead MetroCentre, Sheffield Meadowhall, Manchester Trafford Centre, Birmingham Bullring, London Brent Cross, Milton Keynes Midsummer Place, Southampton WestQuay, Bristol the Mall Galleries and Kent Bluewater, before yesterdays final in London.																								More than 300 families were shortlisted and took part in the competition, with the Chouhans coming out on top.																								The carrot promised was that Nintendo would pay towards university education. 																								The 20,000 prize money is being divided equally between the children. It will be used to pay for their further or higher educational costs, according to an agreement signed by the family, Nintendo said.																								Chhaya will get her 10,000 straight away to put towards university fees and other costs. The remaining 10,000 will be put into a trust fund for Amar until he starts further education.																								A thrilled Karen said: Were both amazed and speechless. This is such an amazing prize and Chhaya and Amar will benefit so much from the free university fees.																								The father, J. Chouhan, who works for De Montfort University in Leicester, played an important role, too. He cheered from the sidelines when wife and children won the London finals. 																								With him was the eldest Chouhan child, Ashok, who works for Carphone Warehouse in Leicester.																								Nintendo UK marketing director Dawn Paine said: We all know what an expensive necessity education can be so this is an amazing prize for the family.																								 The campaign, developed by a research company, BD-NTWK, encouraged families to compete against one another in trials of the Wii game Big Brain Academy in shopping centres across the UK and gain a place in nationwide finals, which was hosted by TV personality Lorraine Kelly. 																								 Allan McLaughlin, director of BD-NTWK, said at the start: Through the Britains Brainiest Family activity we hope to engage customers with the product, drive awareness and encourage trial. Weve designed this campaign with Nintendo, so that consumers of all ages are compelled to give it go. The campaign, whilst being a lot of fun, will also ensure that consumer engagement and trial is maximised.																								 Karen is a busy lady. She is chairman of the Black Londoners Forum, the London Equalities Commission, and the Peepul Centre, a popular community gathering place, in Leicester.

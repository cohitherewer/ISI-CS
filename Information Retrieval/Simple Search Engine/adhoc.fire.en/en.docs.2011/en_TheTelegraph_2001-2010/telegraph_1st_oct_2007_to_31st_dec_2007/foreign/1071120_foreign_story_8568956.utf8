				 Suu Kyi in secret meet
				 	 Aung San Suu Kyi																								Yangon, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Myanmars detained Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi met a senior junta official today, state media said, but it was not known what they discussed.																								MRTV showed 30 seconds of footage from the third meeting between the Nobel laureate and ruling junta member Aung Kyi since he was appointed as a go-between after Septembers crackdown on pro-democracy protests triggered world outrage. We heard about the meeting between U Aung Kyi and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi this afternoon, said Nyan Win, a spokesman for Suu Kyis National League for Democracy.																								He did not know the substance of Suu Kyis one-hour meeting with the liaison minister at a state guesthouse, but believed it might have focused on the juntas preconditions for direct talks between Suu Kyi and regime leader Senior General Than Shwe.																								Than Shwe has offered direct negotiations if Suu Kyi abandons confrontation and her support for sanctions against the military which has ruled the former Burma for 45 years.																								Some observers said the meeting might have been timed to deflect criticism at this weeks annual get-together of the 10-nation Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean). Summit host Singapore expressed its revulsion shortly after the army crackdown in which the junta says 15 people were killed, but the grouping has resisted calls to impose sanctions.																								Myanmar Prime Minister Thein Sein was due to brief his Asean counterparts for the first time since the monk-led protests were crushed and nearly 3,000 people arrested. The regime says all but 91 have been freed.

				 Yangon arrest
																								Yangon, Nov. 13 (Reuters): Prominent Myanmar rights activist Su Su Nway was arrested in the main city Yangon today after being on the run since the army crushed pro-democracy protests in late September.																								The 34-year-old was putting up leaflets when she was detained, an Opposition source said, on the same day that UN human rights envoy Sergio Paulo Pinheiro met junta officials in the capital, Naypyidaw, 400 km north of Yangon.																								The Brazilian law professor, on his first trip to the former Burma in four years, visited Yangons notorious Insein prison and other sites yesterday where protesters were held.																								The Special Rapporteur was given assurances that he will be able to interview detainees, before the end of his mission, as requested, a statement from the UN office in Myanmar said today.																								It was not clear if Pinheiro was aware of the arrest of Su Su Nway. She became a well-known activist after being jailed for nine months in 2005 for helping to prosecute two officials from her village for using forced labour, a practice that is officially outlawed.

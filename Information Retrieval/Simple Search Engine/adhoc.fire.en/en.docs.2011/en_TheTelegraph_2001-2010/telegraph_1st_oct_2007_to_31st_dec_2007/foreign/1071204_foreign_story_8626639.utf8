				 Sex, chocolate power
 LEWIS CARTER				 	 Brain boosters																								London, Dec. 3: Lots of sex, dark chocolate and the Scandinavian routine of cold meat for breakfast are the best ways to boost brain power, a new book claims.																								And watching soap operas, mixing with serial moaners and fat-free diets should be avoided in the quest for increased mental ability, the book says. Much of the advice in Teach Yourself Training Your Brain is unconventional, but its co-authors, Terry Horne and Simon Wootton, say it is based on leading scientific research. 																								They claim that people can combat the considered wisdom that the brain deteriorates with age.																								Horne, a university lecturer, said: For decades we have thought that the capacity of our brains is genetically determined, whereas its now clear its a lifestyle choice. People can make lifestyle choices that will not only prevent what used to be seen as an inevitable decline in cognitive ability after the age of 17, but will constantly increase it throughout our adult lives.																								Our suggestions will empower people to develop their cognitive capacity or just to let it die.																								The book analyses how diet, the environment and stress affect mental capacity. It offers advice and mental exercises for people hoping to increase their brain power.																								Much of the books suggestions are based upon the chemicals that certain activities release in the body.																								It says that sexual intercourse increases the bodys levels of the hormone oxytocin, which induces a readiness to think of novel solutions, while the post-coital rise in serotonin levels also helps both creative thinking and logic.																								In terms of food, the book suggests that the hidden ingredients of dark chocolate  such as magnesium and antioxidants  help get more oxygen to the brain. It also recommends eating cold meat for breakfast to increase the bodys energy levels and nutrient intake.																								The book also advises on the kind of company one should keep. Horne said: Mix with people who make you laugh. Avoid people who whinge, as people who are negative will make you depressed.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

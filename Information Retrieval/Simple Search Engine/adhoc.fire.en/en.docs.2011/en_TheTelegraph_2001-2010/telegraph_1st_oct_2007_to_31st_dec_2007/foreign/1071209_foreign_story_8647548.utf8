																																	 New York, Dec. 8 (Reuters): Two New York museums asked a judge yesterday to declare that they are the legitimate owners of two Picasso paintings whose ownership has been challenged by a man who says they were sold under duress in Nazi Germany.
																																	The 1935 sale of Boy Leading a Horse and Le Moulin de la Galette was legitimate, the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation said in a suit filed in a Manhattan court.
																																	The two museums are suing Julius Schoeps, a scholar at the University of Potsdam, who says he is the heir of wealthy German Jewish art collector and banker Paul Robert Ernst von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. He says the banker was forced to sell the paintings in Nazi Germany before his death in 1935.

				 Whats the fuss, asks Rowling on revelation 
																								Toronto, Oct 23 (Reuters): J.K. Rowling, whose Harry Potter series made her the first billionaire author, said today she was surprised at the fuss surrounding her announcement the boy wizards head teacher, Albus Dumbledore, was gay.																								It has certainly never been news to me that a brave and brilliant man could love other men, Rowling told a news conference in Toronto.																								Rowling made the surprise revelation in New York on Friday, during her first US tour in seven years.																								She said Dumbledore was once infatuated with the winsome wizard Gellert Grindelwald, but the two became rivals when Grindelwald turned out to be more interested in the dark than the good arts. Dumbledore went on to destroy Grindelwald.																								Reaction has been mainly supportive on fans websites, such as The Leaky Cauldron (www.leakynews.com), where news of Dumbledores outing has drawn more than 3,000 comments.																								Rowling declined to say whether her outing of Dumbledore might alienate those who disapprove of homosexuality.																								He is my character. He is what he is and I have the right to say what I say about him, she said.																								Rowling said she made no revelations about Dumbledores sexuality before Friday, because she had never before been asked directly.																								People wanted so much information in advance of the story, that just to keep my sanity and keep my eye on my own plot, I did not give masses away ahead of time, she said.																								Rowling said she probably wont write a prequel to the series, but did not rule it out.

				 Pak court heat on police chief
 NASIR JAFFRY 																								Islamabad, Oct. 1: Spurred by a supreme court order, the Pakistan government today suspended the Islamabad police chief and two senior officials for a violent crackdown on anti-Musharraf protesters that left dozens of journalists and lawyers injured on Saturday.																								Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, who headed a three-judge bench probing the violence, today summoned interior secretary Kamal Shah and ordered the suspension and arrest of Islamabad inspector-general Marwah Shah. This is a very serious matter.... The civil administration is not doing any service to the people, said Chaudhry. The court order came after the judges watched television footage of the crackdown. Kamal Shah said a committee had been set up to probe the incidents. However, Chaudhry said he wanted immediate action. 																								The chief justice ordered the government to suspend the three officials immediately or the court would decide the matter in its own way. 																								The events, as shown by the electronic media, indicate that if the police officials had handled the situation wisely, there would have been no chance of what happened on Saturday, Chaudhry said. He also charged Marwah Shah and deputy commissioner Chaudhry Muhammad Ali with contempt of court for not stopping the firing of tear gas shells into the court premises. The other suspended official was senior superintendent of police Naeem Khan.

				 Bush welcomes Gore to Oval Office
 PETER BAKER				 	 Gore with Bush at the Oval Office of the White House. (AP)																								Washington, Nov. 27: It must be the season. President Bush tried yesterday to make peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. And he tried to make peace with Al Gore.																								For the first time since Bush moved into the house Gore coveted, the two adversaries from the tumultuous 2000 presidential election sat down to talk. When they later let in the people with pens and cameras, they were all smiles, but mum about their discussion.																								The official purpose of the historic summit was not the West Asia peace conference Bush is also hosting this week but the normally more prosaic photo op the White House typically schedules each year with the latest American winners of the Nobel Prize. As it happened, this years laureates included none other than the guy Bushs father once called Ozone Man.																								The President decided to go a step beyond duty by meeting Gore in the Oval Office for 40 minutes before the formal pictures were taken. With just two aides on hand, the two reportedly talked about global warming, an issue that has divided them almost as much as the contested recount in Florida. Gore did not bring the famous slideshow that formed the basis for his Oscar-winning movie, An Inconvenient Truth, but he probably doesnt need his laptop anymore.																								After leaving the White House, Gore decided to forgo the easy escape by car and instead walked with his wife, Tipper, out of the gates into the street, trailed by a mob of reporters and photographers. Beyond saying that they talked about climate change, the former Vice-President would not describe his conversation with Bush in detail. He was very gracious in setting up the meeting and it was a very good and substantive conversation, Gore said. And thats all I want to say about it.																								A bit anticlimatic after seven years of buildup. No matter how much time has passed since one of the most bitter elections of modern times, the bitterness has lingered, at least among supporters. 																								And along the way, Gore has evolved into one of the Presidents toughest critics, condemning the war in Iraq, warrantless surveillance, harsh interrogations and other policies of an administration his team believes was illegitimately installed by the supreme court. The Nobel Peace Prize for Gores efforts to stir awareness and action against climate change was seen by many in the Bush team as another slap against the President.

				 Korea leaders in historic talks
				 	 Kim Jong-il (left) with Roh Moo-hyun in Pyongyang on Tuesday. (AP)																								North-South Korea Border, Oct. 2 (Reuters): South Koreas President arrived in Pyongyang today to the cheers of North Koreans and the handshake of leader Kim Jong-il for a summit aimed at ending a half century of animosity born in the Cold War.																								North Koreans dressed in their finest clothes waved pink and red plastic flowers when Kim arrived and broke into cheers when Roh Moo-hyun stepped out of his open car supplied by North Korea. A solemn-faced Kim then shook hands with Roh.																								Roh started his journey to the North by becoming the first President to step across the heavily armed border and then leading perhaps the largest civilian motorcade between the two capitals.																								I am crossing this forbidden line of division, Roh said as he become the first South Korean leader to walk into the reclusive North, stepping across an 80 cm-wide yellow strip with the words peace and prosperity written on it.																								There is nothing in sight but this line is the wall that has left our nation divided for half a century. Because of this wall, our nation has suffered so much pain. Analysts say the South may pledge billions of dollars to help raise its communist neighbours ruined economy. I intend to concentrate on making substantive progress that will bring about a peace settlement together with economic development, Roh said.

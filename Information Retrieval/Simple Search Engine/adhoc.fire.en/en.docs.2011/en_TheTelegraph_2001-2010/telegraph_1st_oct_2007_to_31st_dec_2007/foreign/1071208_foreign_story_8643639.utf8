				 	 Ethnic Indians at the protest in Kuala Lumpur
																								Shah Alam, Malaysia, Dec. 7 (AP): Malaysian authorities are investigating an ethnic Indian protest group for possible links to terror networks, including Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers, an official said today.
																								The Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) denied any terrorist ties, and accused the government of trying to stem support for the group after it staged a massive rally last month to highlight the economic plight of Malaysias minority ethnic Indians.
																								Attorney-general Abdul Gani Patail said concerns have surfaced that Hindraf is trying to establish links with organisations like the Tamil Tigers, which has been branded a terror group by the US and the European Union.
																								Police have started investigating, Abdul Gani told reporters. He however declined to comment on whether the Hindraf leaders might be charged with any terrorism-related offence, saying the police need to finish their probe first.
																								Malaysias national police chief, Musa Hassan, said yesterday that there have been signs of Hindraf trying to get the support and assistance of terrorists. He did not elaborate.
																								Lawyer P. Uthayakumar, a top Hindraf leader, called the claims of terror links the governments desperate attempt to divert from the real issues, which are racism, marginalisation and permanent colonisation of the Indians.
																								Its plain and obvious that we have always pursued legal and peaceful means, Uthayakumar told reporters. Theyre running out of ideas. 
																								Fears of ethnic unrest have emerged in Malaysia after some 20,000 people participated in a rally in Kuala Lumpur on November 25, the largest protest in years involving Indians, who form 8 per cent of the population.
																								Hindraf, which organised the protest, is demanding equality and fair treatment for Indians, saying an affirmative action programme that gives preferential treatment to Muslim Malays is tantamount to racial discrimination.

				 Pervez to quit army this month
				 	 Musharraf																								Rawalpindi, Nov. 14 (AP): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said today that he expects to step down as army chief by the end of November and begin a new presidential term as a civilian.																								However, Musharraf warned that the country risked chaos if he gave into Opposition demands to resign.																								In an interview with The Associated Press, the military ruler accused former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, currently under house arrest, of fuelling political turmoil and rejected western pressure to quickly lift emergency rule.																								Musharraf also indicated that the emergency was likely to continue till elections in January. 																								All those who are blunt enough to tell me to my face what the reality is, all of them think, yes, it will lead the country to chaos if I do not handle the political environment now with me remaining as the President, he said at his army office near Islamabad.																								Eleven days after imposing the emergency rule that has drawn widespread condemnation at home and abroad, Musharraf, dressed in a dark lounge suit, was in an affable but defensive mood.																								The general had originally planned to quit as chief of the powerful army tomorrow, when his presidential mandate and the term of the current parliament expire, but said he was forced to delay the restoration of civilian rule until a court ruling on his recent re-election.																								He said the exact timing would depend on the supreme court  which he purged of independent-minded judges when he suspended the Constitution on November 3  but expected it to happen within this month.																								He dismissed a threat from the Commonwealth to suspend Pakistan unless the emergency is lifted by November 22. I take decisions in Pakistans interest and I dont take ultimatums from anyone, he said.

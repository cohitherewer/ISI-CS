				 Howard suffers huge poll loss

(Reuters)																								Brisbane, Nov. 24 (Reuters): Australias Labor leader Kevin Rudd, a Mandarin speaking former diplomat, swept into power at national elections today on a wave of support for generational change, ending 11 years of conservative rule.																								Today Australia has looked to the future, Rudd, flanked by his wife Therese and family, told jubilant supporters. I will be a Prime Minister for all Australians.																								The surge to Labor left conservative Prime Minister John Howard struggling to win even his own parliamentary seat, which he has held since 1974, putting him in danger of becoming the first Prime Minister since 1929 to lose his constituency.																								Rudd, 50, presented himself as a new generation leader by promising to pull Australian combat troops out of Iraq and sign the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, further isolating Washington on both issues.																								Rudd is expected to forge closer ties with China and other Asian nations and has said he wants a more independent voice in foreign policy, but today again promised Australia would retain its close alliance with the US.																								His message of new leadership attracted a swing of more than five per cent across the nation from the previous election, locking in only the sixth change of government since World War II.																								Weve all got goose bumps that finally we might have a leader who is passionate about fairness in this country, Celeste Giese, 39, told Reuters at Rudds victory party. Finally, after 11 years, its happening, she said.																								The election was fought mainly on domestic issues, with Labor cashing in on anger at workplace laws and rising interest rates which put home owners under financial pressure at a time when Australias economy is booming.																								During the campaign, Rudd said one of his first actions would be to lead his countrys delegation to Decembers international climate talks in Bali.																								Howard, who had won four consecutive elections and held power for 11 years, conceded his government had lost power in front of a crowd of supporters in Sydney late today, saying he took full personal responsibility for the defeat.																								This is a great democracy and I want to wish Rudd well, Howard said. We bequeath to him a nation that is stronger and prouder and more prosperous than it was eleven-and-a-half years ago. Election analyst Antony Green predicted Labor would win more than 80 seats in the 150-seat parliament, giving it a clear majority in its own right.

				 Rights sleuth in Myanmar
																								Yangon, Nov. 11 (AP): A UN human rights envoy arrived today in Myanmar on a mission to get inside the countrys prisons to determine the number of people killed and detained since the regimes crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.																								Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, the UNs independent rights investigator for Myanmar, had been barred from visiting the country since November 2003. He has said he will abandon his current visit unless he gets full support from the junta. 																								I hope I will have a very productive stay, Pinheiro told reporters after arriving at his hotel in Yangon, Myanmars largest city. He added: Im just very happy to be back here after four years.																								Accompanied by authorities, Pinheiro headed first to Bago, a town 80km north of Yangon, a government official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. Buddhist monasteries in Bago were among those targeted by the crackdown after monks joined anti-government street protests.																								Pinheiro has submitted a proposed itinerary for his five-day visit to the Myan- mar government, which was still being fine-tuned, said Aye Win, a UN spoke-sman in Myanmar.																								After getting initial permission last month for his visit, Pinheiro said he would demand access to prisons and try to determine the number of people killed and detained since the juntas crackdown.																								If they dont give me full cooperation, Ill go to the plane, and Ill go out, he said ahead of the visit.																								Pinheiro has a history of prickly relations with the ruling generals. He abruptly cut short a visit in March 2003 after finding a listening device in a room at a prison where he was interviewing political detainees. Later that year, he accused the junta of making absurd excuses to keep political opponents in prison.																								Pinheiros trip comes three days after the departure of UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari, who attempted during a six-day visit to kick-start talks between the junta and the pro-democracy opposition.																								As a result of Gambaris trip, detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was allowed to meet the leaders of her opposition party on Friday for the first time in three years.																								Suu Kyi said through a party spokesman she was very optimistic about the prospects of dialogue with the government.

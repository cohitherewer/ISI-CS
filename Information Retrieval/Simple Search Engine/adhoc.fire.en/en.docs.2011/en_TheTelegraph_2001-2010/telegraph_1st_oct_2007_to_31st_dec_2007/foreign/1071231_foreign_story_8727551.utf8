																								London, Dec. 30: Nicole Kidman, the Oscar-winning star of The Hours and Moulin Rouge, is expecting a baby, it has been disclosed.
																								The baby would be Nicole Kidmans first natural child. The actress, 40, and Keith Urban, her husband of 18 months, reportedly broke the news to their families over the Christmas period.
																								The baby, whose expected arrival date has not been announced, would be Kidmans first by birth, though the actress, who is winning rave reviews for her role as the evil Mrs Coulter in The Golden Compass, adopted two children during her first marriage to fellow Hollywood star Tom Cruise.
																								Kidman, who has refused to discuss her break-up from Cruise in any depth, recently revealed she had suffered an ectopic pregnancy and a miscarriage during their 10-year marriage.

				 Vienna US embassy intruder arrested
				 	 The remains of the rucksack that was filled with explosives in Vienna. (Reuters)																								Vienna, Oct. 2 (Reuters): Austrian police are investigating the motive of the Bosnian who tried to enter the US embassy in Vienna carrying an explosives-filled rucksack yesterday, an official said today.																								Public security director Erik Buxbaum told journalists at a news conference the man gave police the impression of being confused and had been in psychiatric care in the past.																								We cant say anything at the moment about a possible motive for his action, Buxbaum said. To talk about an Islamist background would be premature. We can neither confirm that nor rule it out.																								The man, identified by Austrian newspapers as Arsim C, ran away from the embassy yesterday after his rucksack triggered metal detectors at the entrance. He dropped the bag in the next street and was arrested soon after.																								Bomb squad specialists found two hand grenades and other explosive material in the rucksack, as well as nails and screws  often used by suicide bombers in West Asia to kill or wound as many people as possible. Buxbaum said police found no fuse for the explosives and was investigating whether they could have blown up at all.																								A search of the mans home had produced about half a kg of plastic explosives of a variety often used in the former Yugoslavia, Buxbaum said. The mans backpack contained a religious book typically read by Bosnian Muslims during Ramazan. The Bosnian, who is living in Tulln near Vienna, told police that a countryman living in the same town had given him the backpack and told him to take it to the US embassy.

 NASIR JAFFRY 
																								Islamabad, Dec 7: Pakistans combined Opposition parties remain undecided on the deadline for the government to accept their charter of demands. 
																								An eight-member committee of the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy (ARD) and the All Pakistan Democratic Movement (APDM), formed by former Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif on Monday, arrived at a consensus on 13 out of 15 demands after deliberations over three days. 
																								However, two points  reinstatement of judges and a deadline for the government to accept the Oppositions list of demands  remain undecided. 
																								The APDM wanted the reinstatement of the sacked judges on top of the list while the ARD did not want to press for this demand. 
																								The ARD mainly comprises of Benazirs Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz while the APDM consists of all religious, political and nationalist parties. 
																								PPP senator Raza Rabbani conceded that there were differences on the two points, which he refused to divulge. 
																								We have informed both Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif about our discussions and the points agreed upon, Rabbani told The Telegraph . 
																								He said the two leaders had also been informed of disagreements on the remaining points and that they would take a decision. 
																								Benazir and Sharif have repeatedly said the charter will be aimed at ensuring free, fair and transparent elections in the country in January. 
																								The charter of demands will be finalised with a deadline for its implementation by the government after Bhutto returns from Dubai next week, Rabbani said. 
																								Sharifs aide Ahsan Iqbal also confirmed that the committee had finalised almost all demands. 
																								However, he today said that there were certain legal and constitutional points which still need to be sorted out prior to the announcement of the demands. 
																								Benazir and Sharif had on Monday agreed that their decision about taking part in the polls would depend on President Pervez Musharrafs response to their charter of demands.

				 Benazir cases
																								Islamabad, Oct. 2 (AP): Top Pakistani government officials today agreed to grant exiled former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto an amnesty from prosecution in corruption cases pending against her, a cabinet minister said.																								 Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, who attended a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz that discussed the issue, said ministers and top officials had agreed in principle to quash the old cases.																								There was a consensus of opinion that there will be no harm in taking back the cases against Benazir, Ahmed said on Geo TV. It was not immediately clear if there were any conditions and when the amnesty would take effect.																								Bhutto has held months-long talks with President Pervez Musharraf over a possible power-sharing agreement. Among her demands has been for longstanding graft cases against her and other politicians to be dropped.																								Bhutto has been charged in Pakistan with illegally amassing properties and bank accounts overseas while in power. She was also convicted of money laundering in Switzerland in July 2003 and ordered her to pay $11 million to the Pakistani government.

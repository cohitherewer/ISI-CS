				 Lion Tom is now a lamb 				 Cruise in London (Reuters)																								London, Oct. 23 (Reuters): Actor Tom Cruise spent more than two hours signing autographs and greeting fans in London at the world premiere of his new movie Lions for Lambs, Hollywoods latest examination of US foreign policy.																								Lions for Lambs, which follows a slew of films related to the war in Iraq and the US military response to the September 11, 2001, attacks, is about two soldiers serving in Afgh-anistan and political intrigue back in America.																								Directed by Robert Redford and also starring Meryl Stre-ep, the film has been branded anti-war by some media gro-ups, and its backers are hoping its controversial subject matter will boost the film at the box office and going into the awards season.																								I think that films like this are interesting and important and I think its anyones place if they want to do it, Cruise told Reuters on the red carpet ahead of the premiere at the London Film Festival.																								We are free to communicate about anything we want and any subject we want, so I think its absolutely correct, he added.																								Cruise managed to avoid any of the controversy that has surrounded some of his public appearances. In 2005, he lost his temper after being squirted with water from a fake microphone by a crew filming for a Channel 4 comedy show at the War of the Worlds premiere.																								Asked if he studied any po-litician in particular for his role as an ambitious senator, 45-year-old Cruise said: I stu-died many. Ill never tell exactly who, but theres many mon-ths of research that went into this character, to not make him into a caricature but into a human being with real problems and to reflect that idea.																								Streep, who plays a journa-list in the film, was not at the premiere, while Redford avoided the media glare and slipped into the cinema via the back entrance.

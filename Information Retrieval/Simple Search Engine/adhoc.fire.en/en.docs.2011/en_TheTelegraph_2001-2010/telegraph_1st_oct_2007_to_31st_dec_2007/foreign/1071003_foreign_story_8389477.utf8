				 Britney to lose sons
 CATHERINE ELSWORTH				 	 Troubles mount																								Los Angeles, Oct. 2: A judge has ordered Britney Spears to turn over custody of her two young sons to her ex-husband Kevin Federline.																								In a closed session, Judge Scott Gordon ruled the troubled pop star must hand over Sean Preston, two, and Jayden James, one, by noon tomorrow and that Federline would retain physical custody ... until further notice of the court.																								Gordon did not set out the reasons for his decision in the written ruling but it came 10 days after Spears was charged with a hit and run accident and driving without a valid licence. It also follows claims by a bodyguard who worked for the singer after she was released from a rehabilitation facility in March that she was still using drugs and posed a danger to her children. 																								After Tony Barretto submitted evidence to the court about the alleged drug use, Gordon found Spears to be a habitual, frequent and continuous user of alcohol and controlled substances and ordered her to submit to random twice-weekly testing.																								He also ruled that both Spears, 25, and Federline, 29, could not consume alcohol or non-prescription drugs at least 12 hours prior to taking care of their children.																								In addition, the singer was ordered to meet a parenting coach at least twice a week for a total of eight hours and both she and Federline were told to complete the courts Parenting Without Conflict class. Yesterdays ruling came after lawyers for both sides met Scott in a private session requested by Federlines lawyer.																								Federline, who met Spears when he was a backing dancer, recently launched a legal bid to gain full custody of their children, which they had shared equally. He subpoenaed former employees of Spears, informing them they would be called to testify at a custody hearing.																								The singer, who recently staged a much-ridiculed attempt to re-launch her career at the MTV video music awards in Las Vegas, was seen out with her children in Los Angeles over the weekend.																								On Sunday, they had dinner at a restaurant in Malibu. She seemed fine, Tony Koursaris, the restaurant owner, told People magazine. She was very comfortable having dinner here with her boys ... The kids had a good time. Then we had to fight the paparazzi, of course.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

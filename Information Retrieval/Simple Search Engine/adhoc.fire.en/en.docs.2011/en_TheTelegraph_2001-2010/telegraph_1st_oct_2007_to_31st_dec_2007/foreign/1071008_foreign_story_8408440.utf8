				 Marilyns millions caught up in row
 PHILIP SHERWELL				 	 Monroe: Timeless appeal																								New York, Oct. 7: Her sultry pout and peroxide blonde hair helped make Marilyn Monroe one of the most famous faces in showbusiness. Now her instantly recognisable looks are at the centre of a bitter legal row over the control of dead celebrities images, one that is pitting some of the biggest names in entertainment and sport against each other.																								Yoko Ono, Al Pacino and the estates of the tennis champion Arthur Ashe and the baseball legend Babe Ruth are among those backing new legislation that would give the heirs of dead celebrities full control over commercial use of their names and images.																								Opponents, who include the children of Ray Charles and Marlon Brando as well as the photographers who captured iconic images of Monroe, contend that new laws proposed in California and New York would restrict public access throughout the world to the pictures and work of hundreds of actors and artists.																								The intensity of the confrontation reflects the highly lucrative business of marketing the famous names that keep filling the coffers even in death. 																								Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor-turned-politician, now has a pivotal role in the process. As the governor of California, he must decide whether to sign a bill passed last month by the state legislature that expands the control of heirs over how deceased celebrities are marketed.																								The immediate controversy is over who has the right to control images such as the world famous pose of Monroe, with dress billowing over a subway grate, in a photo shoot taken by Sam Shaw for the film The Seven Year Itch.																								The stars sole heir, Anna Strasberg, the Venezuelan-born widow of Monroes acting coach Lee Strasberg, to whom she left her estate, is pitted against the children of four photographers who worked closely with the international sex symbol. 																								It has turned into an ugly and unpleasant fight.																								The enduring allure of Monroe, who died of a sleeping pill overdose aged 36 in 1962, earned $8 million for her estate for 2005-06 from perfumes, handbags and advertising campaigns for the likes of Dom Perignon and General Motors.

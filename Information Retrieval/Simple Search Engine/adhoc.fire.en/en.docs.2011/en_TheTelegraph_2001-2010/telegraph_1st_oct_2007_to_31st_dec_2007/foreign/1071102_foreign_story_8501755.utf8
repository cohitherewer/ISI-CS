				 Rowling fairy tales under hammer
																								London, Nov. 1 (Reuters): J.K. Rowling is to say goodbye to Harry Potter with a handwritten set of fairy tales mentioned in her last wizard saga that she will auction for her childrens charity.																								Fans hoping for another dose of Potter will be disappointed as the tales will not be published, but Rowling today said she was halfway through writing another childrens book.																								A copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard with illustrations by the author is to be sold at an auction next month to raise money for The Childrens Voice charity she set up.																								Writing it has been the most wonderful way to say goodbye to a world I have lived in for 17 years, said the author (in picture) of the teenage wizard stories that have sold more than 350 million copies and made her the first billionaire author.																								The Tales of Beedle the Bard are mentioned in the last Potter book as having been left to Harrys friend Hermione by their head teacher Albus Dumbledore, recently outed by Rowling as being gay.

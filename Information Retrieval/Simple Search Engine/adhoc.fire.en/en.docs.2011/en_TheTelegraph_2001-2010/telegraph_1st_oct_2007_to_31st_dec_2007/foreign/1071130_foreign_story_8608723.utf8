				 Daniel Craig jumping off buildings for new film
																								London, Nov. 29 (Reuters): Hes jumping off tall buildings again, but this time it is just rehearsals ahead of the next James Bond blockbuster due in theatres in 2008.																								British actor Daniel Craig, who won over the sceptics with his dark and dangerous interpretation of the worlds most famous spy in his hit Bond debut Casino Royale, is set to reprise the role in an as yet untitled sequel.																								We are rehearsing stunts and Im throwing myself off tall buildings ... again, Craig said in a recent interview.																								Asked whether Bond 22 would be based on an Ian Fleming novel in the same way as Casino Royale, he replied: Its a completely new story and it does go straight on from the end of the last one. Weve picked some themes that come up in the last movie ... They are pretty fundamental ones and theyre good fun to do.																								The 39-year-old hesitated before accepting the role of Bond in Casino Royale, aware that he would be expected to commit to several more films in the hugely successful franchise and run the risk of being typecast as an action hero.																								But Craig said he had had few problems doing what he wanted to do since then, and the clout that Bond has given him had actually opened up new possibilities.																								I produced a movie this year which has been a new experience, he said of Flashbacks of a Fool due out next year. Craig also stars in the tale of a fading Hollywood star who examines his past after the death of his best friend.																								It may happen (that I am typecast), he said. Maybe I should just relax and let it happen. Maybe Im just working too hard. Craig next appears in cinemas in December in The Golden Compass, an adaptation of Philip Pullmans novel Northern Lights.

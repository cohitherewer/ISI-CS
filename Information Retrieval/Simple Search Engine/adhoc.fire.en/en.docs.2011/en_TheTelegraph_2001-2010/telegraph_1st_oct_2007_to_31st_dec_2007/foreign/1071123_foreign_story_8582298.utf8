				 For first time in Italy, C word will be used
																								Rome, Nov. 22 (Reuters): The word condom is to be uttered for the first time in an advertisement to raise AIDS awareness in Italy, breaking a bizarre taboo in the Catholic country.																								Since the spread of HIV/AIDS started in the 1980s, the Italian government has run health campaigns about the disease, some of which have featured pictures of condoms. But they have always omitted using theC word.																								Movie director Francesca Archibugi, filming the TV advert at a pharmacy in Romes Fiumicino airport today, described the new advert as a triumph against taboo.																								The Catholic Church equates promotion of condoms to fostering immoral and hedonistic lifestyles.																								The prudish treatment of the word contrasts with the risque nature of Italian advertising and media, where gameshows and adverts routinely make sexual references, or feature scantily clad women, often for purely decorative effective.																								Although the sale of condoms is far more widespread in Italy than many other parts of Europe, slogans until now have been restricted to phrases such as: Protect your love!. Archibugis campaign is unlikely to impress the Vatican, which teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage, chastity and abstinence are the best ways to combat AIDS.

				 Nepal denies UN wider role 
 J. HEMANTH 				 	 Girija Prasad Koirala																								Kathmandu, Nov. 14: The Koirala government today ruled out expanding the role of the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) beyond the management of arms and armies of Maoists and the Nepal Army and supervision of the Constituent Assembly elections. 																								The UN missions role was discussed at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala. They decided to ask the world body to follows its mandate in Nepal. 																								Government sources told The Telegraph here today that some cabinet members were concerned about UNMINs recent activities, especially its continued interest in the troubled Terai region. 																								A recently-held secret meeting between UNMIN officials and leaders of Terai armed factions in an Indian town was also discussed. 																								The sources said recent statements by mission chief Ian Martin on the expansion of the UN bodys role was mentioned at the meeting. The cabinet felt that such statements will send wrong signals at a time when the political situation is none too rosy with the Maoists upping the ante, the sources said.																								The cabinet meeting decided to ask the UNMIN formally to restrict itself to its assigned tasks like managing the weapons and armies of both the Maoists and Nepal Army and overseeing the polls. 																								Soon after the meeting, foreign minister Sahana Pradhan told reporters that the cabinet decided against widening the mandate of the UNMIN. It was decided not to give responsibilities to the UNMIN, she said. 																								The minister said the cabinet decided to extend the tenure of the UNMIN, set to expire on January 22, 2008, by six months.

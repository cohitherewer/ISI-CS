																								Fort Wayne (Indiana), Oct. 11 (AP): Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Carl Bernstein took reporters at a news conference to task for not spending enough time on stories when he found out many were not staying to listen to his speech.																								 Bernstein, who along with reporter Bob Woodward broke the Watergate scandal that helped bring down the Nixon administration, spoke to journalists before a speech yesterday at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne.																								When he asked how many reporters were covering his evening speech, many said they were not, citing early deadlines.

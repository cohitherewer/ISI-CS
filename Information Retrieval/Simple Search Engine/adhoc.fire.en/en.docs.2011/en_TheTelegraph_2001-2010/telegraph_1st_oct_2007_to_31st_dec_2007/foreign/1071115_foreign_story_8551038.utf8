				 Strong earthquake rattles Chile
																								Santiago, Nov. 14 (Reuters): A powerful 7.7 quake hit mineral-rich northern Chile today, injuring some people and damaging buildings in and around Antofagasta, a coastal city that is the countrys mining capital, the government and media reports said.																								Tocopilla, a city 120 km north of Antofagasta, was the hardest hit by the quake and Chiles interior ministry said it had preliminary reports of minor injuries.																								Television images showed cars crushed under the concrete awning of a hotel in Antofagasta, where power was knocked out by the quake. Frightened residents stood in the streets.																								The US Geological Service, or USGS, said the quake, 60 km deep, was centered 106 km west of the town of Calama and struck at 1540 GMT. The quake was initially reported at 7.8 magnitude by the US agency and later verified at 7.7. 																								The quake hit an area where there are many large copper mines. Chile is the biggest copper producer in the world, providing more than a third of annual supplies of the red metal.																								Chilean state copper miner Codelco said it did not yet have a report on the effect on its mines.

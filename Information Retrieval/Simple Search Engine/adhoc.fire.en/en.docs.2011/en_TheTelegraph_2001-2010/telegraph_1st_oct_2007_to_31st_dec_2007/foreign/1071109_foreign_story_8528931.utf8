				 7 die in Dubai bridge collapse
																								Dubai, Nov. 8 (AP): A bridge under construction in a new development in Dubai collapsed today, killing seven workers and injuring 15, police said.																								The workers were employees of the Wade Adams Group, a West Asia-based contracting company, said N.M. Naushad, the companys human resources director, without confirming the number of dead and injured.																								The bridge, spanning a small canal, was being built in Dubai Marina, a new residential and commercial development in this booming Gulf city-state. Police cordoned off the scene with tape to investigate, and ambulances took away the bodies of the dead and injured as their colleagues from the construction site stood around and watched, witnesses said.																								Officials from Rashid Hospital in Dubai said they admitted 15 injured workers, including five with serious injuries, who were airlifted from the accident site. Both the police and hospital officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media. We tried to put a huge piece of metal in a wall when it collapsed, said Muthu Raj, one of the 30 Indian workers he said were on the bridge when it collapsed. I saw colleagues trapped inside, but I managed to jump back and stepped on the road.																								Raj Kumar, head of safety for a nearby site where the Al Hamad Contracting Company is building a high-rise, said at the accident scene that the Wade Adams Group workers were not properly equipped to ensure their safety because they did not have helmets, gloves, proper shoes or harnesses.																								I know this because I am in charge of safety at my construction site and we are safe and properly equipped, said Kumar. Naushad, the Wade Adams Group official, said his company would compensate the families of the dead workers with a total of 90,000 dirhams ($24,508).

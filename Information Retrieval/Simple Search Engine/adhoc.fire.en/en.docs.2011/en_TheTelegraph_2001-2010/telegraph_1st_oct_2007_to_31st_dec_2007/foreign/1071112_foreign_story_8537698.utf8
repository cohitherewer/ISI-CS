				 Tigers bleed, Lanka takes aim at Big Cat
				 	 Prabhakaran																								Colombo, Nov. 11 (AP): Clashes between troops and Tamil Tiger rebels left 12 guerrillas and one soldier dead in Sri Lankas restive north, the military said today as the air force chief reportedly vowed to target reclusive rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.																								Soldiers pushed into rebel territory in the northern Mannar district on Saturday and attacked a line of bunkers, killing nine insurgents, a military official said on condition of anonymity, citing government rules.																								Government forces later attacked another series of bunkers in neighbouring Vavuniya district, killing two rebels.																								Elsewhere in Mannar, one rebel was killed in a clash with the troops, the official said.																								One soldier died and two others were wounded in a separate clash yesterday in Periyathampanai village, also in Vavuniya, he added.																								Rebel spokesman Rasiah Ilanthirayan said there had been occasional mortar exchanges on Saturday, but denied military claims of large-scale fighting. He said the rebels suffered no casualties, adding that the government made up figures for political gain.																								Independent confirmation was impossible because the area is restricted. Both sides routinely exaggerate their opponents casualties while downplaying their own.																								Air Marshall Roshan Goonetilleke, in an interview with the government-owned Sunday Observer, said it would not be a difficult task for the air force to get Prabhakaran because he was confined to a very limited area in the rebel-held northern Wanni region.																								I do not think it is that difficult for us to get him now. We will find him somehow soon. We need a great deal of patience, Goonetilleke was quoted as saying in the newspaper. The air marshall could not be reached to confirm the report.																								His comments came a week after the air force bombed a rebel communications centre, killing the Tigers political chief, S.P. Thamilselvan, and five other rebels.																								While Prabhakaran is almost never seen in public, Thamilselvan, assumed by some to be the groups second-in-command, had become the rebel leaderships link to the outside world.																								Thamilsevans death was widely seen as a public relations coup for the government and a sharp blow to the guerrillas morale.

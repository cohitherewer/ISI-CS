																								Beijing, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Chinas quality control watchdog said today initial investigations had found bead toys recently recalled in the US and Australia contained toxic substances, the Xinhua news agency reported.

Australia too announced a ban on the popular toy, sold there in a version called Bindeez, and Spain also announced a recall.																								Chinas General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said the toys, products of Australia-based Moose Enterprises, were manufactured by the Wangqi Product Factory in Chinas southern city of Shenzhen.																								China froze exports of the Aqua Dots on Friday and the AQSIQ said today it had also suspended the toy makers export licence. The quality watchdog, battling a string of international recalls, had promised a swift investigation.

				 Hillarys question gaffe
 PHILIP SHERWELL			Hillary ClintonLondon, Nov. 11: Hillary Clinton has been caught answering a planted question on global warming from a member of the audience during a supposedly spontaneous session with voters in the key state of Iowa.																								The embarrassing disclosure is the latest campaign stumble for the Democratic presidential frontrunner who is involved in a heated fight in Iowa with rivals Barack Obama and John Edwards.																								It came last week as the senator called on a student for a question. Muriel Gallo-Chasanoff asked how she planned to combat climate change.																								The former First Lady replied: You know, I find as I travel around Iowa that its usually young people that ask me about global warming.																								The student later said one of Hillarys staff asked her to put the question to her and then signalled to the candidate to choose her.					 THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

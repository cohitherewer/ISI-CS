				 Age no barrier as Queen gets in Vogue
				 				 (From top) The Queen, Helen Mirren, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss 																								London, Nov. 5 (Reuters): One is in vogue.																								At the age of 81, Queen Elizabeth today joined models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell and actress Helen Mirren on Vogue magazines list of the worlds most glamorous women.																								The style bible slavishly worshipped by dedicated followers of fashion decreed that age was no barrier. Sensible brogue shoes, waxed jackets and headscarves knotted firmly under the chin are clearly no passing fad.																								Its a great compliment. She has a very practical approach to fashion and a great sense of occasion, a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said when asked about the fashion icons tip of the hat to the queen. This month she becomes the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary and next month she becomes Britains oldest ever reigning monarch, she added.																								Even model of the moment Agyness Deyn has said of the octogenarian monarch: Shes cool.																								Kate Moss is reported to have told her once at a Buckingham Palace reception: I love the stuff you wear. You have great fashion sense.																								Vogue was gushing in its praise, declaring the queen to be as glamorous in her brogues and headscarf at (her country estate) Balmoral as she is wearing the crown jewels.																								Glamour, the magazine declared, is about how you wear something, not about what you wear. You cannot buy glamour and you cant fake it.																								When actress Helen Mirren took to the screen as the British monarch in the Oscar-winning movie The Queen, sales of Barbour waxed jackets were given a major boost in the US. Mirren joined the Queen on Vogues list of glamorous women on the list. 																								The older generation certainly holds its own in the list with 70-year-old Vanessa Redgrave and 62-year-old Charlotte Rampling up there with the supermodels of today.

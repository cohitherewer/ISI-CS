				 Howard calls risky polls
				 	 Howard in Canberra. (AP)																								Canberra, Oct. 14 (Reuters): Australias veteran Prime Minister John Howard has called national elections on November 24, stressing experience over his Labor opponent and shrugging off polls that show he faces near-certain defeat.																								Howard, 68, in power for 11 years but lagging well behind youthful Labor leader Kevin Rudd in opinion surveys, said that only he was able to lead Australia into the future.																								Love me or loath me, the Australian people know where I stand on all the major issues of importance to their future, said Howard, who is danger of losing in his own Sydney-based seat.																								Howard, Australias second-longest serving leader, said the country was enjoying remarkable prosperity, but promised voters the best years could lie ahead.																								But that wont happen automatically. This country does not need new leadership, it does not need old leadership, it needs the right leadership, he said, unveiling what will likely become the conservatives fighting slogan.																								But if Howard wins he has already said he would hand over power to his deputy, Peter Costello, some time during the next term.																								The election will determine the future of Canberras military contribution in Iraq and climate change stance, with Labor promising to bring home combat troops and sign the Kyoto climate pact. But the poll will be fought and won on domestic issues.

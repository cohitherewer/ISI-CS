				 Cherie book plan worries hubby
 PATRICK HENNESSY				 				 Cherie,Tony																								London, Sept. 30: Tony Blair is extremely concerned about the potential political fallout from the decision by his wife, Cherie, to publish her memoirs next year, The Sunday Telegraph has learnt.																								A friend of Tony Blair has revealed that the former Prime Minister is far from an enthusiastic supporter of his wifes project, for which she has reportedly secured a 1million fee.																								However, Tony felt he was powerless to prevent the book being written, the friend said.																								In particular, Tony, who is now a West Asia peace envoy, is said to be concerned about the effect on his relationship with Gordon Brown, which is better now than it has been for years, according to those close to him.																								Cherie has made little secret of her dislike for Brown, who for 10 years was her neighbour in Downing Street and the most important figure in her husbands government.																								At last years Labour conference in Manchester, Cherie was overheard to say thats a lie when Brown declared from the platform that it had been a privilege to work with Tony.																								Cherie is also said to have been the decisive influence on Tony in his decision not to step down early in 2004 after his wobble in the spring of that year.																								While the current Prime Minister and his predecessor now speak regularly and cordially, their relationship could once again take a turn for the worse if Cherie lifts the lid on volcanic rows between the two men during her husbands premiership.																								The book is due to come out in the autumn of next year  one of the possible points at which Brown could choose to call a general election.					 THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

				 Armitage regrets Plame leak
																								Washington, Nov. 12 (AP): Former deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage says he was foolish to have revealed the identity of a CIA employee.																								Armitages acknowledgment yesterday came in response to comments by Valerie Plame, who said the former Bush administration official had no right to talk to a reporter about where she worked.																								A year ago, Armitage publicly apologised to Plame and her husband. The former number two state department official remains the only principal in the leak to have done so. At least three one-time administration officials in addition to Armitage discussed Plames CIA status with reporters. 																								They are former White House political adviser Karl Rove, Vice-President Dick Cheneys ex-chief of staff, I. Lewis Scooter Libby and former presidential press secretary Ari Fleischer. Armitage and Rove were the sources for a 2003 newspaper column by conservative commentator Robert Novak that disclosed Plames CIA employment.

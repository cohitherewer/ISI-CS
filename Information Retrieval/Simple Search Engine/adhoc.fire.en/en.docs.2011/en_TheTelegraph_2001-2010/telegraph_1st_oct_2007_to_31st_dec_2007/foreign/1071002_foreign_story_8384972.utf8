				 Putin eyes PM job, to keep power
				 	 Putin in Moscow on Monday. (AP)																								Moscow, Oct. 1 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin said today he could be a future Prime Minister, giving a clear sign he plans to keep power after his second term ends next year.																								At a congress of the main pro-Kremlin force, United Russia, he also announced he would head the partys list for December parliamentary elections, guaranteeing him a place in the State Duma (lower house of parliament).																								As far as heading the government is concerned, this is a quite realistic suggestion but it is still too early to think about it, Putin said to thunderous applause.																								Two conditions must be met first. United Russia must win the election and a decent, capable and modern person with whom I work as a team should be elected President, he said from a stage decked out in Russias national colours, red, white and blue.																								Putins remarks fitted a scenario rumoured for some time in Moscow  that the popular President could continue to wield power from the Prime Ministers chair after he leaves office, installing a loyal but weaker figure as President. 																								All polls published so far give United Russia, whose campaign slogan is Putins Plan  Victory For Russia, a huge lead for Decembers vote.

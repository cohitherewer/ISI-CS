				 Death during questioning in Myanmar, say exiles
																								Yangon, Oct. 10 (AP): A Myanmar Opposition party member died during interrogation and two activists were arrested, an exile group said today  a sign the juntas crackdown on pro-democracy groups persists despite the apparently calm streets.																								The Thailand-based Assistance Association for Political Prisoners also said security officers had been threatening dissidents relatives and neighbours in an attempt to get information on the whereabouts of those involved in last months pro-democracy protests, which were brutally suppressed by the military.																								The Opposition members alleged death drew a harsh reaction from the US, which called for an investigation and threatened further sanctions against the impoverished country unless the embattled junta backs away from its violent prosecution of dissidents and moves toward democratic reforms.																								The Myanmar exile group, made up of former political prisoners, said authorities had recently informed the family of Win Shwe, 42, that he had died during interrogation in the central Myanmar region of Sagaing. He and five colleagues had been arrested on September 26, the first day of the crackdown.																								The group said Win Shwe, a member of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy, was cremated at the detention centre. 																								The report could not be independently verified, although in the past the group has provided detailed, accurate information on political prisoners in Myanmar.

				 Britney sister pregnant at 16

				 	 Jamie Lynn Spears
																								Los Angeles, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Britney Spearss 16-year-old sister, who stars as a schoolgirl in Nickelodeons popular TV show Zoey 101, is pregnant.
																								The cable channel confirmed a report in the coming edition of celebrity gossip magazine OK! that Jamie Lynn Spears is expecting a child.
																								We respect Jamie Lynns decision to take responsibility in this sensitive and personal situation. We know this is a very difficult time for her and her family, and our primary concern right now is for Jamie Lynns well being, Nickelodeon said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
																								A high school student who lives in Louisiana, Jamie Lynn Spears reportedly met the father, Casey Aldridge, the son of a Tennessee papermill worker, at church. Jamie Lynn Spears personal publicist was not available for comment.
																								Her big sister, Britney Spears, may not be the best source of parenting advice. The 26-year-old pop star lost primary custody of her two sons, aged 2 and 1, to ex-husband Kevin Federline after their divorce last year and is engaged in a bitter custody battle that has shone a harsh spotlight on her maternal shortcomings.
																								Zoey 101, which wrapped production on its fourth and final season in September, revolves around a headstrong student at a co-ed boarding school in California. Fresh episodes will air in 2008, a spokeswoman for the Viacom Inc-owned network said.

				 Ford serves hot meals to LA homeless
				 	 Harrison Ford in Los Angeles. (Reuters)																								Los Angeles, Nov. 22 (AP): Kirk Douglas, Harrison Ford and other American celebrities jump-started the Thanksgiving sprit by serving hot meals to homeless people in Los Angeles.																								Wearing red aprons and plastic gloves, they stood alongside volunteers at the annual feast at downtowns Los Angeles Mission giving out turkey drumsticks, mashed potatoes and gravy, rolls, vegetables and pumpkin pie.																								Actresses Nia Long and Calista Flockhart and The Hills reality TV star Spencer Pratt were among others passing out almost 3,000 plates of food to lines of men, women and children. 																								Its very grounding, said Long, who dished out vegetables and rolls with her 7-year-old son. I feel grateful for all the things I have.																								A house band pounded out music as people sipped on bright green and orange punch at rows of tables outside. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who said he has volunteered at the event for nearly a decade, helped people clean up.																								I just washed the feet of some homeless people, boasted the mayor, wearing a white chefs outfit.																								 Skid Row resident Yasmine Villalobos stepped up behind him smiling ear-to-ear and requesting a hug. He washed my feet, and it was so special, she said. I will remember it forever.

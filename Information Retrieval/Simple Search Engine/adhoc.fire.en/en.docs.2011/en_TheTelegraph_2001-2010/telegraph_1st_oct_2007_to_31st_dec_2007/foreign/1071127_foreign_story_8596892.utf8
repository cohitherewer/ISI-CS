				 Teacher held for Islam insult
																								Khartoum, Nov. 26 (Reuters): A British primary school teacher has been arrested in Sudan, accused of insulting the prophet by letting her class of seven-year-olds name a teddy bear Mohammad, her school said today.																								Police arrested Gillian Gibbons, 54 of Liverpool, yesterday at her home inside the Unity High School premises after a number of parents complained to Sudans ministry of education, said Unity director Robert Boulos.																								 The countrys state-controlled Sudanese Media Centre reported late yesterday that Gibbons had been accused of insulting the Prophet Mohammad. It said charges were being prepared under article 125 of the criminal law which covers insults against faith and religion. Teachers at the school in central Khartoum said Gibbons made an innocent mistake and simply let her pupils choose their favourite name for the toy as part of a school project.																								We are very worried about her safety, he added. This was a completely innocent mistake. Miss Gibbons would have never wanted to insult Islam.																								A spokesman from the British embassy in Khartoum said she had not yet been charged with violating state law against insulting religion. An embassy official visited her today and said she was in good health but shaken.																								If convicted, Gibbons could be sentenced to 40 lashes, six months in prison or a fine, said Ghazi Suleiman, the head of the Sudan Human Rights Group.																								No one was immediately available for comment from Sudans ministries of education or justice. Boulos said he had decided to close down the school until January for fear of reprisals in Sudans predominantly Muslim capital. 																								Earlier Gibbonss colleagues said they feared for her safety after receiving reports that young men had started gathering outside the Khartoum police station where she was being held. But a Reuters witness at the police station said no one was gathering there.

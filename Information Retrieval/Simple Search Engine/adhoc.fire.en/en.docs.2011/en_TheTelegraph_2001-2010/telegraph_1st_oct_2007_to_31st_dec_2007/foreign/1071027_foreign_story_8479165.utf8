				 Che hair fetches $119500 
																								 The lock of hairDallas, Oct. 26 (Reuters): A lock of Ernesto Che Guevaras hair and related items were auctioned today in Dallas to a Houston-area bookstore owner for the very capitalist sum of $119,500.																								The curious collection had belonged to Gustavo Villoldo, 71, a former CIA operative who helped hunt Guevara down in the jungles of Bolivia in 1967 and who claims he cut off the lock before burying the guerrilla fighter with two of his comrades.																								There was media speculation that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a Left leader who greatly admires the iconic Guevara, would bid for the items.																								In the end, it went to Houston-based Bill Butler.																								The auction house said the hair could provide DNA proof that the remains of Guevara  affectionately known by his admirers as Che  are in Cuba, where he is venerated as a hero of the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power five decades ago.																								Then 39, the bearded revolutionary was captured by CIA-backed Bolivian soldiers on October 8, 1967, and shot dead the next day in a schoolhouse.																								Guevera has came to symbolize rebel chic with his likeness emblazoned on countless T-shirts and buttons.

				 Passengers saved from sinking ship
				 	 The MS Explorer lists heavily on its starboard side off King George Island in Antarctica. (AFP)																								Buenos Aires, Nov. 23 (Reuters): More than 150 passengers and crew escaped unhurt after their cruise ship hit ice in the Antarctic and started sinking today, the ships owner and coast guard officials said.																								A Norwegian passenger boat in the area safely picked up all the occupants of the Explorer from the lifeboats they used to flee the ship when it ran into problems off King George Island in Antarctica at 0524 GMT, the Explorers owners said.																								A spokesman for Gap Adventures, the Canadian travel company that owns the vessel, said 154 passengers and crew had been on board the ship. He had told Reuters earlier the number was 100.																								We were passing through ice as usual... we do that every day... But this time something hit the hold and we got a little leakage downstairs, the Explorers first officer Peter Svensson told Reuters Television by satellite phone from the Norwegian ship, the Nordnorge.																								He said the rescue had gone smoothly. No one was hysterical, they were just sitting there nice and quiet, because we knew there were ships coming.																								The passengers and crew were being taken to Chiles Eduardo Frei base in the Antarctic from where they would later be flown to Punta Arenas in southern Chile, a Chilean navy commander told local television.																								The stricken vessel had set sail from the southern Argentine port of Ushuaia last week and was heading south toward the barren, icy continent, officials said.																								Pictures taken from Chilean navy helicopters showed the vessel listing severely in dark grey waters. At least 10 lifeboats and rafts could be seen.																								Apparently they crashed into an iceberg, Pedro Tuhay, of the Argentine coast guard, told local radio. The boats got a 23-degree list, but its keeping steady very well.

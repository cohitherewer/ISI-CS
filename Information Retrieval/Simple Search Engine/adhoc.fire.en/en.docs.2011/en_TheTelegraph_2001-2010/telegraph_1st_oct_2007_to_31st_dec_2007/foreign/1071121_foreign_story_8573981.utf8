				 Drink rat milk: Heather
				 	 Heather Mills McCartney in London. (AFP)																								London, Nov. 20: Heather Mills McCartney has urged people to drink milk from rats and dogs to help save the planet.																								McCartney said that livestock created far more carbon emissions than transport, so we should go vegan  someone who eats no meat or dairy produce  or at least find something else to put in tea or coffee.																								At Speakers Corner in Hyde Park, central London, she said: There are many other kinds of milk available. Why dont we try drinking rats milk and dogs milk?																								Sir Paul McCartneys estranged wife, who is engaged in a bitter divorce case with the former Beatle, was launching a campaign by the vegetarian group Viva!																								The former model, who lost a leg in an accident, appears on posters backing the campaign which state You havent got a leg to stand on and Hey meaty, youre making me so hot.																								Wearing a green T-shirt bearing the message Vegan, you cant get greener, McCartney said: Eighty per cent of global warming comes from livestock and deforestation. Im not telling people to go vegan overnight. But if they stop drinking their cows milk lattes, maybe this sort of thing wont have to happen. quot;					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

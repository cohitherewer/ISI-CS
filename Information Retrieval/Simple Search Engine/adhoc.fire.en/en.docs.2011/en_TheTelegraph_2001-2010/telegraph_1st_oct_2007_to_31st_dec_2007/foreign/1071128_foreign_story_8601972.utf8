				 Malaysia PM warns protesters
																								Kuala Lumpur, Nov. 27 (Reuters): Malaysia threatened today to use a tough colonial-era security law, which allows years of detention without trial, to stop a wave of street protests that have rocked the nation in recent weeks.																								More than 10,000 ethnic Indians staged the minority communitys biggest anti-government protest at the weekend to complain of racial discrimination.																								Two weeks earlier, another crowd of about 10,000 people rallied in the capital to demand electoral reform ahead of possible early elections in the next few months. They were the biggest street demonstrations in a decade.																								The ISA (Internal Security Act) is a preventive measure to spare the nation from untoward incidents that can harm the prevailing peace and harmony and create all sorts of adverse things, the official Bernama news agency quoted Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi as saying.																								The ISA will be there. When it is appropriate to use it, it will be used, said Abdullah, who is also internal security minister overseeing the police. Deputy internal security minister Johari Baharum had yesterday raised the possibility of using the ISA, a colonial-era law first aimed at curbing a 1960s communist revolt, to clamp down on street protests.																								A group seeking abolition of the law condemned Joharis remarks and urged the government to free 74 people detained under the law for several years.																								The ISA is indefensible and unjustifiable in any circumstances and should be abolished immediately, said Syed Ibrahim, who heads the campaign against the law.																								The detainees include suspected Islamic militants, some in custody since the September 11, 2001, attacks in the US.																								Ethnic Indians have complained of a lack of educational and business opportunities, saying a government affirmative-action policy in favour of majority ethnic Malays had marginalised them.																								In an interview with Reuters, S. Samy Vellu, the combative head of the main ethnic Indian party and Malaysias longest-serving minister, branded protesters as trouble makers and said he was not losing sleep over the bloody demonstration.																								We have fought worst battles than this during elections, the ebullient 71-year-old leader said.																								We dont worry about this. We are confident of winning the next elections handsomely, said Samy, the works minister and an architect by training. 																								They (the protesters) are fighting to create problems. They are trouble makers, said Samy, dressed in a smart black suit and red tie, as he attended to a handful of Indians at his ministry. His luxurious Mercedes Benz was parked on the driveway. He has been leader of the Malaysian Indian Congress and a cabinet minister since 1979.

				 Boy kings true face to be revealed
																								London, Oct. 22: The true face of Tutankhamun, the boy king who ruled Egypt 3,500 ye-ars ago, is to be revealed to the public for the first time.																								To coincide with the opening of the exhibition of the treasures of Tutankhamun in London next month, Egyptian archaeologists are to put his mummified body on display in Luxor. Only a handful of experts have ever seen the Pharaohs true likeness.																								Although not the most important of Egypts ancient rulers, Tutankhamun has exercised a strong pull on the imagination since the discovery of his virtually intact tomb by the British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922.																								Zahi Hawass, head of Egypts archaeological services, who arranged the London exhibition, intends to remove the mummy from its original golden sarcophagus which lies in a stone sarcophagus and place it in a climate-controlled plexiglass case in the antechamber of the tomb.

				 Wilde best wit
 LAURA CLOUT																								London, Oct. 15: One a playwright feted for his literary genius, the other a rock star renowned for his foul mouth: but Oscar Wilde and Liam Gallagher now share the accolade of being voted among Britains greatest wits.																								Wilde, who even on his deathbed remarked, either those curtains go or I do, was voted number one in the list of comic masters, ahead of comedian Spike Milligan, who had engraved on his tombstone the epitaph: I told you I was ill. 																								Third was Stephen Fry, who played Wilde in the 1997 eponymous film of his life. He once quoted the playwright when passing through airport customs, announcing: I have nothing to declare but my genius. And in reference to his homosexuality, the comedian, actor, and quiz show host declared: My first words, as I was being born... I looked up at my mother and said: Thats the last time Im going up one of those. 																								The poll of 3,000 comedy fans placed Liam Gallagher tenth. 																								The Oasis singer, famed for his drunken antics and abrasive attitude, once said of his brother Noel: Id do time for him. I love him. Me and him are cool. If anyone stepped on his toes, Id cut them off. 																								In fourth place was the host of the motoring programme, Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson. The self-confessed petrolhead is unafraid of stirring up controversy with his caustic comments. Speed has never killed anyone, suddenly becoming stationary Thats what gets you, he once declared. Wartime Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill came in fifth. Accused of being drunk by the MP Bessie Braddock he is said to have replied: Madam, you are ugly. And I shall be sober in the morning.

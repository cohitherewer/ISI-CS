				 Setback to peace process: Experts

 BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA
				 	 Mishra: Good for India
																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: Benazir Bhuttos assassination will not only have a major impact on Pakistan but also on the peace process with India, foreign policy experts have said.
																								Satinder K. Lambah, the Prime Ministers special envoy on Pakistan, said Bhutto was a moderate leader and would have been good for the improvement of bilateral relations.
																								It is no doubt a tragedy for Pakistan, which will have a major impact on the results of the forthcoming elections and also the post-election government in the country. Benazir was supposed to have played a major role in the elections, Lambah said.
																								He said Pakistan was likely to go ahead with elections as scheduled, but could place restrictions on campaigning.
																								The spread of terrorism is bad news for the sub-continent, he added. This is the second political assassination in Rawalpindi after former Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan.
																								Terrorism is like wildfire. Once it starts, it cannot be contained and spreads like wildfire, he said.
																								Ejaz Haider, the executive editor of Lahores Daily Times, said though Benazir had been under threat from al Qaida and its splinter groups, it was probably a combination of political rivals and some extremist elements that killed her.
																								My take is that the job was done by extremist groups but who was behind them is anybodys guess as of now. Suicide bombing is a typical al Qaida job, said Haider, also a Brookings scholar specialising in India/South Asia foreign policy.
																								He did not rule out the involvement of rogue elements in the Pakistani Army that had links with extremist groups.
																								Haider said Bhuttos assassination would not have any impact on Indo-Pak relations as the countries had no option but to work towards normalising ties, irrespective of who was at helm. The impact would be much greater in Pakistan, he added.
																								Bhutto, he said, had clearly been the leader for the forthcoming elections. Her Pakistan Peoples Party had always got the highest percentage of votes, he said.
																								 In the 2002 elections, PPP had got the largest percentage of votes (29.2 per cent) but could not form the government because the votes had been split.
																								There were indications that her party would have done very well. Now, unless something drastic happens, President Musharraf will have to go ahead with elections, he said, adding PPP would get a huge number of sympathy votes. But if that party lost, there could be a violent backlash, he said.
																								It is like the Congress, which came back with huge numbers of sympathy votes after Rajiv Gandhis assassination. Something like that may happen in Pakistan now, Haider said.
																								Former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra said Bhuttos assassination was a great loss for Pakistan. In 2003, she had discussed bilateral relations with then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee over tea. 
																								She came across as a very good politician and would, no doubt, have been good for India too, he said.

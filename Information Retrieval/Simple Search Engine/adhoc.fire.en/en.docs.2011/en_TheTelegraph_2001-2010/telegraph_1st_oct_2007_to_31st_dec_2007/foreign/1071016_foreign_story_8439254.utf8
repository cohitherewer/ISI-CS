(AP) 																								Stockholm, Oct. 15 (Reuters): American economists Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson won the 2007 Nobel for economics today for laying the foundations of an economic theory that determines when markets are working effectively.																								Hurwicz, a Russian-born American citizen, is at 90 years old the oldest-ever recipient of a Nobel prize.																								The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the three established mechanism design theory, which looks at how well different institutions fare in allocating resources and whether government intervention is needed.																								Hurwicz initiated the theory and it was further developed by Maskin of Princeton University and Myerson of the University of Chicago, the academys citation said.																								Hurwicz, born in Moscow in the year of the Russian revolution, is a professor emeritus of economics at University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.																								The economists will share a prize of 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.57 million).																								Maskin, reached by telephone at his home in New Jersey, said he was overwhelmed by the news. Im completely delighted. Its a thrill to be in their company, he said, referring to other economists who had won the coveted prize. But it hasnt really registered yet. Im still so befuddled by the news.																								Maskin, whose son is disabled, said he planned to donate some of his award to the Camphill Foundation, which works with disabled people.																								My wife and I have thought in the past about what would happen if we won the lottery, he said.																								Hubert Fromlet, chief economist at Swedish banking giant Swedbank, said that the microeconomic theories these three had developed had become increasingly popular. Microeconomics has gained momentum in research, he said.

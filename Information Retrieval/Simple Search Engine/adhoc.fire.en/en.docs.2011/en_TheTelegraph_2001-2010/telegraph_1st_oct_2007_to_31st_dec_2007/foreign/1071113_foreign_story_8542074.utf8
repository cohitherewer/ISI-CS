				 Hollywood misreads response to terror war
 															- FILMS BOMB AT BOX OFFICE				 	 Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise in a scene from their latest film Lions for Lambs. (AP)																								Hollywood has misjudged the publics appetite for films about Iraq and the war on terror as a slew of new movies have flopped at the box office. 																								The latest casualty, Robert Redfords verbose Lions for Lambs, starring Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise, took just over $2 million when it debuted on Friday, lagging far behind the animated adventure Bee Movie, which opened the week before. 																								Despite its A-list cast  Redford not only directs but stars in the film  the release has been savaged by critics as a ponderous, worthy sermon on American foreign policy. 																								Anthony Lane, writing in the New Yorker, said Lions for Lambs is most charitably described as Ibsen with helicopters while online magazine Slate claimed the film ought to have been called Slugs for Snails, so leisurely does it creep toward its predictably bombastic conclusion. The films poor opening  which puts it on course to be Cruises lowest-grossing movie of all time  follows the lacklustre performances of similarly themed releases such as Rendition, In the Valley of Elah and A Mighty Heart. 																								All three boasted Oscar-winning stars  Reese Witherspoon and Meryl Streep in Rendition, Tommy Lee Jones in In the Valley of Elah, and Angelina Jolie as murdered reporter Daniel Pearls widow in A Mighty Heart  yet bombed spectacularly. 																								Rendition, about the CIAs outsourcing of interrogation of terror suspects, was beaten on its opening weekend by a re-release of the 14-year-old A Nightmare Before Christmas and has so far taken just under $10 million . 																								The slim takings bode ill for other coming releases including Brian De Palmas Redacted, based on the real-life rape and murder of an Iraqi schoolgirl by US soldiers, Grace Is Gone, in which John Cusack plays a man whose wife is killed in Iraq, and Stop Loss, with Ryan Philippe as a soldier who refuses to fight. 																								Critics say the films failure shows just how badly Hollywood has misread Americans response to the war on terror, confusing the publics war-weariness with their own carefully cultivated rage, as Jonah Goldberg, in the Houston Chronicle, put it. Hollywood and the Left generally have misread this political discontent thinking theres a mandate for their trite Vietnam-era nostalgia for mass protest and Joan Baez specifying, he wrote.

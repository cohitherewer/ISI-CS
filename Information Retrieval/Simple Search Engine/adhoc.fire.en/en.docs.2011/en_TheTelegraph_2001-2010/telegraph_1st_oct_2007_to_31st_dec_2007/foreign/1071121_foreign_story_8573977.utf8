				 Bangla plea for foreign aid
				 	 Sisters Fatema Begum (right) and Layla Banu mourn the loss of their parents in the cyclone at Patharghata, Bangladesh. (AP)																								Patharghata (Bangladesh), Nov. 20 (AP): Bangladesh sought more foreign aid today to help thousands of survivors of Cyclone Sidr after the storm mauled the countrys coast and killed more than 3,150 people, according to an official tally that was expected to rise.																								Food, fresh water and temporary shelter had still not reached many of the hungry and exhausted survivors.																								At this time we will welcome support from the international community, said a statement from the Bangladesh foreign ministry. We are doing as best as we can do ourselves.																								In a televised speech today, the countrys interim leader, Fakhruddin Ahmed, described the cyclone as a national calamity and urged citizens to help the affected people.																								Ahmed said he has decided against attending a Commonwealth summit in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, beginning on Friday, because of the disaster.																								The government said international aid worth about $120 million has so far been promised. But relief items such as tents, rice and water have been slow to reach most survivors of the cyclone.																								The European Commission announced today an aid of $9.6 million. The American Red Cross said it would provide $1.2 million to help get clean water to the survivors and build emergency shelters.																								The problem is that aid workers need hours to reach these remote areas. Poor communications are also hampering our work, said Anwarul Huq, a spokesman for the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, the countrys largest non-profit development organisation.

				 Take lead out, urges Barbie
 MONICA HESSE				 	 A poisonous affair																								Washington, Nov. 24: Another reason to avoid sleeping with an ex: fear of contracting lead poisoning. Just ask Barbie, who got it from Ken.																								Thats according to Toxic Toys: A Poisonous Affair, a YouTube attack on the Consumer Product Safety Commission produced by the non-profit Campaign for Americas Future.																								The videos release last week came after Democratic lawmakers called for the ousting of CPSC acting chairman Nancy Nord and after the California attorney general sued 20 companies  including Barbie-maker Mattel  for producing toys with unlawful quantities of lead. But you want to hear how Barbie got that leaden STD, dont you?																								Toxic Toys begins with the Barbie chilling in a nightclub. Hey, Barbie. I havent seen you in ages. Its Ken, who, as everyone knows, split with Barbie back in 2004. Flash forward: the bedroom of Barbies Dream House the next morning. Kens shirt is open halfway down his chest. Thanks for last night, Ken, Barbie says sweetly. But a week later, Barbies phoning with an awkward question about his bill of health. Since their rendezvous, shes been having weird symptoms, she says.																								The revelation: Its... its lead poisoning. Heh heh heh.																								And then, a message lambasting the CPSC for employing only one person to test toys, plus a plea for Nords resignation.																								Originally, the Toxic Toys message came in the form of a written report discussing the fact that in a globalised economy we need to reinvent our government safeguards, says Roger Hickey, CAF co-director.																								When releasing that report didnt bring the masses to its web site, CAF decided to reach out to the YouTube generation with some Barbie bedroom action. In real life, the recalled Mattel toys were not the dolls themselves, but the Barbie Dream Kitty Condo, the Barbie Dream Puppy House and the Barbie Bathtub and Toilet Playset.

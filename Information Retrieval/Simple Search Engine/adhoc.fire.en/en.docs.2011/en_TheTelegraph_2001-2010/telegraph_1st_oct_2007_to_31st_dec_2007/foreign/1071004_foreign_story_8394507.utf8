				 3 months after raid, Lal Masjid reopens
				 	 People prepare for prayers at the Lal Masjid in Islamabad on Wednesday. (AFP)																								Islamabad, Oct. 3 (Reuters): Pakistani authorities reopened the Lal Masjid in Islamabad today, nearly three months after more than 100 people were killed when commandos stormed the compound to end a siege by Islamist gunmen.																								Hundreds of people turned up to offer prayers at the newly-painted and repaired Masjid. The mosque was reopened on the orders of the supreme court.																								An earlier attempt to re-open the mosque sparked violent clashes between Islamists and police and a suicide bomber killed 13 people near the mosque on the same day.																								But there was no trouble today as police removed barbed wire and security posts from around the mosque.																								We dont need any security, it was not us but the policemen here who created the problem, said Shah Abdul Aziz, an Opposition MP from an Islamist party.																								More than 100 people were killed during a week-long siege and army assault on the mosque and religious school complex in July after violence broke out between gunmen based at the mosque and security forces outside.																								Among those killed in the July 10 assault was Abdul Rashid Ghazi, a radical cleric who led the mosques Taliban-style movement with his brother, Abdul Aziz.																								Aziz was captured during the siege when he tried to slip out of the mosque and past security forces clad in a womans burqa. A nephew of the brothers, Amir Siddique, has been made a deputy cleric at the mosque.

				 Bullying not all that bad
 AISLINN SIMPSON																								London, Oct. 29: Levels of bullying among children have been inflated by parents and teachers who do the youngsters more harm than good by wrapping them in cotton wool, a leading child expert has warned.																								Tim Gill, a former government adviser who headed a major review into childrens play, said that the normal rough and tumble of childhood  often interpreted as bullying  is vital to ensure their proper development into confident and resilient adults.																								In an atmosphere of heightened media and public awareness, there is a real danger that adults will overreact and suppress behaviour that, unlike bullying, has a key role in helping children to learn for themselves how to deal with difficult social situations, he said.																								In his book No Fear: Growing up in a Risk Averse Society which was published today, he accepts a need to protect children from paedophiles, child snatchers, thuggish contemporaries and fatal accidents, without bubble-wrapping them.																								Children spend about four times as much time being looked after by their parents as children did in 1975 but this restricts their play, limits their freedom of movement, corrodes their relationships with adults and constrains their exploration of physical, social and virtual worlds, he said.																								My worry is that if we dont reverse the trend then children will find it much more difficult to cope with socially difficult situations, he said. We will see a rise in levels of anxiety, and either these children will be frightened of contact with other people or they will have conduct disorders, they will go off the rails.																								Gill focused on a number of key areas  including childrens play, bullying and anti-social behaviour, adult vetting and fear of strangers.																								Policymakers came in for criticism for their knee-jerk reactions to protecting the young that in reality do them more damage than good.																								The 83 million the British government spends vetting child abusers, he said, would be better spent on training and raising awareness since most children are abused by family members.

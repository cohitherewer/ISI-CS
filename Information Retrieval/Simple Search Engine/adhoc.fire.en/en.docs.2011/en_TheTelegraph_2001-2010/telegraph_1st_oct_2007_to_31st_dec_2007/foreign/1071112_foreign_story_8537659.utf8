				 Jemima stands by her ex
 AMIT ROY 			Jemima leading the protest in London. Telegraph pictureLondon, Nov. 11: Jemima Khan has led protests in London against President Pervez Musharrafs imposition of emergency in Pakistan with a poster of her former husband Imran Khan held aloft in the background, and handed in a petition at 10 Downing Street to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. 																								Although Imran has escaped arrest in Pakistan and is in hiding, the leader of the Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party has been in touch with Jemima who has come out in valiant support of the former Pakistani cricket captain. 																								With her ruffled hair and chic casualness, 33-year-old Jemima resembled a Hollywood activist as she stood on the picket line with a poster proclaiming: No puppet judges. 																								While most Pakistanis in Britain have chosen to maintain a low profile, worried no doubt about the consequences of any protest on their relatives back home, Jemima appears to be displaying much more courage, even though her two sons  Sulaiman, 11, and Kasim, 8  are frequently with their father in Pakistan. 																								Indeed, Imran, who allegedly divorced his wife partly as a career enhancing move  she was 21 when she married and, at 42, Imran was old enough to play Shah Rukh to her Deepika  may now rue the day he dumped Jemima. 																								Since her relationship with actor Hugh Grant seems to have fizzled out after three up-and-down years, Jemimas decision to back Imran in his hour of need may well encourage a new intimacy between them in the years to come. 																								Compared with the other photogenic woman in the Pakistani drama, Benazir Bhutto, whose moves are described as cynical in some British media reports, Jemima is emerging as clean, fresh and entirely sincere. Had this been India, no doubt some of her loyalists would have started a Jemima for PM movement. 																								Yesterday, she was calm and collected on the barricades as she addressed one television network after another. 																								She was not one for protest marches, she said, but theyre telling me that theyve never, ever seen brutality like this. They said its unprecedented in Pakistans history. Normal people, teachers, my childrens teachers, have been arrested. 																								She added: Its completely inconceivable whats happening in Pakistan. Its something that Im so horrified by that I felt it was necessary to come out and help to organise this demonstration. 																								Unlike my friends in Pakistan, many of whom are now in jail, we have the privilege in the UK  living in a democracy  of being allowed to protest, she commented. Thats why I am helping to organise the demonstration outside Downing Street to call on the British government to pressurise General Musharraf immediately to restore democracy. 																								She said: This is not about Musharrafs battle against extremists or about the War on Terror. This is about a desperately unpopular dictator clinging to power. 																								In an interview with a British newspaper, Jemima also revealed how Imran had got in touch. 																								After the declaration of martial law, a strange number flashed on her mobile phone. Puzzled, she took the call to hear a familiar voice on the other end saying urgently: Jem, its me. 																								It was Imran. The brief call  terminated abruptly so as not to be traceable  was to reassure her and their two sons that he was safe. 																								The police put Imran under house arrest, then went away to get an arrest warrant, said Jemima. He was tipped off that they were going to put him in jail and so he managed to escape over the back wall. Hes lucky that he has family bordering the property, so he was able to go straight into another friendly house. He said they were very brutal and much more belligerent than hed ever seen before. 																								She went on: Normally the police are very respectful towards Imran, because quite a lot of them are fans from his cricket days. But in this instance they were very aggressive with both him and with everyone in the house. And I think that was probably quite a shock to him.

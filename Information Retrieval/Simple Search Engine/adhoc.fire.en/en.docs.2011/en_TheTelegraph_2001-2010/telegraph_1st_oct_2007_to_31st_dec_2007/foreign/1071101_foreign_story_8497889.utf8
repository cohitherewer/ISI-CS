				 Sex in sky hopes crash

The carrier said it would ask passengers on the A380 to refrain from sex while ensconced in one of its 12 first-class suites, which boast the worlds first airborne double beds.																								All we ask of customers, wherever they are on our aircraft, is to observe standards that dont cause offence to other customers and crew, the company said. Nothing different applies for our Singapore Airlines Suites customers.																								While private, the double cabins are neither sound proofed nor completely sealed.																								Singapore Airlines, the worlds second-largest airline by market value, started commercial flights of the double-decker A380 last week with a Singapore-Sydney service.

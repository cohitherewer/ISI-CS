				 Kayani charge
 NASIR JAFFRY 																								Islamabad, Oct. 8: The process of change in the Pakistan army started today after General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani took over the office of the vice-chief of army staff. 																								Kayani, who has served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) since 2004, will take over as chief of army staff after President Pervez Musharraf vacates the post in the coming weeks. Musharraf assured the supreme court last month that he would relinquish the army chief post before taking oath as President. 																								 Musharraf won the presidential election on Saturday but an Opposition boycott and pending supreme court hearings on his eligibility left him with an incomplete victory. 																								He cannot be officially declared the winner till the court decides on petitions filed by presidential candidates, Wajihuddin Ahmad and Makhdoom Amin Fahim, who have challenged the legality of his bid for another term as President. The petitions will be heard on October 17. 																								After arriving at the General Headquarters in the garrison town of Rawalpindi, Kayani was presented with a guard of honour by an army contingent. Later, he was introduced to the principal staff officers. The newly-appointed chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, General Tariq Majeed, also took charge of his new assignment today.

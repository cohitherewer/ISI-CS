				 Brown to visit India on Jan 21
 AMIT ROY				 	 British Prime Minister Gordon Brown lights the Diwali lamp at the House of Commons																								London, Nov. 15: The exorbitant charge of Rs 17,000 demanded for each Indian artist by the home office for even a brief tour of Britain is likely to be one of the issues that will be taken up when Gordon Brown visits India on January 21.																								The British Prime Minister should have been in India this autumn for the fourth India-UK economic summit since Manmohan Singh was in London last year in an arrangement which sees the two heads of government alternating their trips.																								 However, since Brown was new at 10, Downing Street, after having waited 10 years to take over from Tony Blair, he decided to postpone his India visit. 																								That it is now taking place will be a relief to the business communities on both sides.																								One major problem that has cropped up is that Indian artists who come to the UK, even for a weeks tour, have to pay Rs17,000 for each members work permit plus visa charges. While Bollywood stars can afford to pay these punitive rates, most cultural troupes cannot. At present, India could not be further from Browns mind, preoccupied as he is with the crisis next door in Pakistan. For the time being, British policy is to stick with President Pervez Musharraf.																								Commenting on Browns India announcement at last nights Diwali function in the House of Commons, the Labour MP Keith Vaz told The Telegraph : I am delighted that the Prime Minister is going to India so early in his first year in office.																								 But Vaz, who has represented Leicester East, a city with a high Asian population for 20 years, suggested that British business could make more of the business opportunities in India.																								 We need to breathe new life into the relationship  we need to make sure that we put together a better set of arrangements between Indian and British business, he said. Brown was in India in January this year as Chancellor of the Exchequer along with captains of industry from Britain. But instead of holding forth on how well the British economy had done, he had to focus almost entirely on the Shilpa Shetty crisis caused by her treatment on Celebrity Big Brother.

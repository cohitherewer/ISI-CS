				 Texas town sold for 1.5 million on eBay
																								London, Nov. 24: Albert, a 13-acre historic town in Texas, has been sold for almost 1.5 million on auction website eBay.																								The town, which is 70 miles from the state capital, Austin, includes a house, dance hall, tavern and a schoolhouse reportedly attended by former President Lyndon Johnson in 1920.																								Bobby Cave, 47, of real estate company urbanspace Realtors, said he sold the property after three and a half years as he was ready to move on to his next project.																								I bought it with the intention of creating a little family camping venue where people could come out and drink and enjoy local live music, Cave said. He said it was supposed to be a 10-year project, but it had been completed in three and a half years. The towns population consisted of himself and a groundsman at weekends.																								A total of 58 different bidders placed more than 120 bids since Albert was put on eBay last month, its listing describing the town as known for its towering oaks, wildflowers, German heritage and laid-back attitude.																								The historic town, once a popular stagecoach stop, is a lot quieter now. Serene, even. No longer the Wild West, Albert is now a popular stop for weekend day-trippers in the middle of Texass burgeoning wine-making region. 																								The listing also said the sale included detailed plans for improvements.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

				 Slaughter-like-goat threat to Benazir
 NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES				 	 Benazir (AFP)																								Karachi, Oct. 23: A friend of Osama bin Laden has threatened to unleash female bombers on Benazir Bhutto.																								Benazir said her lawyer Farooq Naik received a letter that vowed to slaughter her like a goat. The threat comes four days after a suicide attack on her homecoming parade in Karachi killed 139 people.																								Written by someone who described himself as the chief of suicide attackers and a friend of Osama bin Laden, al Qaida and Pakistani jihadis, the letter said Bhutto could be stabbed, attacked in her car, or in her bedroom, Naik said.																								He said the threat should be taken seriously, even if the letter may have been written by a crank.																								Benazir said she would start campaigning soon but would avoid mass rallies.																								The former Prime Minister has accused the Pakistani government of a cover-up after officials rejected her call for international experts to investigate a suicide bomb attack on her supporters.																								The government looks like they have something to hide. Otherwise, they would be open and allow foreign experts so that the killers can be brought to justice without any doubts, she said.																								Benazir has taken a conciliatory tone in negotiations with Musharraf while adopting a more critical line in public so that she does not appear to floating voters to be giving the unpopular military ruler a blank cheque.																								She has been careful rather to pick on members of Musharrafs ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q), mainly defectors from the party of the exiled former Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif.																								Deputy information minister Tariq Azim Khan revealed that the chief minister of Punjab province, Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, was one of the people named by Benazir, but said such accusations hurt chances of a rapprochement.																								If this trend of implicating political rivals into false cases continues, what chances for national reconciliation will there be? Khan said.																								Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, a close relative of the Punjab chief minister, gave a caustic response to Benazirs allegations, telling Geo Television that his party would say the PPP leadership had orchestrated the attack to win sympathy.																								We will also say all this was a conspiracy, he said, claiming that Benazirs husba-nd, Asif Ali Zardari, had plotted the attack with party leaders to raise sympathy for her.																								US ambassador Anne Patterson, who came to Karachi from Islamabad late yesterday, held talks with Benazir today for around 30 minutes, the former Prime Ministers aides said.

				 Clooney bio peek puts staff in soup
				 	 No authorisation																								Newark (New Jersey), Oct. 10 (AP): More than two dozen hospital staffers have been suspended for four weeks after allegedly peeking at George Clooneys confidential medical information after he was hurt in a motorcycle accident last month.																								Clooney, 46, suffered a broken rib and scrapes in the September 21 crash, while his passenger, Sarah Larson, 28, injured her foot. Both were treated at Palisades Medical Center in North Bergen.																								No physicians employed by the hospital were among the 27 employees suspended, said Eurice Rojas, the hospitals vice-president of external affairs, today. The investigation was initiated after an audit revealed that employees had looked at the records without authorisation, Rojas said. 																								The suspensions began last week and continued this week, he said. We conduct audits on a regular basis to make sure our systems are protecting individuals rights, Rojas said.

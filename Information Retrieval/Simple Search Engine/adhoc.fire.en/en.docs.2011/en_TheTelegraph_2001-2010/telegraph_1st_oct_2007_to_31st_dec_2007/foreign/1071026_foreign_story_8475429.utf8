				 Suu Kyi steps out to meet junta emissary
																								Yangon, Oct. 25 (Reuters): Detained Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi held talks with a representative of the ruling junta for more than an hour today, state television said.																								It said nothing about what she discussed with Aung Kyi, a senior member of the junta-appointed go-between after the UN sent a special envoy to Myanmar to promote reconciliation and reform in the wake of the armys crackdown on pro-democracy protests in September.																								Suu Kyi was taken from her villa and de facto prison of the last four years to a state guesthouse to meet Aung Kyi, and state television said the talks had lasted 75 minutes.																								It gave no further details, but a security source said the 62-year-old Nobel laureate had been returned to her villa, where she has spent more than 11 of the past 18 years under house arrest.																								Suu Kyis National League for Democracy (NLD), which won a 1990 election by a landslide only to be denied power by the military, said it did not know what had happened at the guesthouse, where she had met UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari on October 2.																								The barbed wire barricades that have sealed off the road outside her home since protests started in August remained in place, clouding hopes Suu Kyi might be about to be released.																								Gambari held talks with Chinas communist rulers today. However, Beijing gave no indications it was willing to exert tougher pressure, stressing that words, not sanctions, were the way forward.

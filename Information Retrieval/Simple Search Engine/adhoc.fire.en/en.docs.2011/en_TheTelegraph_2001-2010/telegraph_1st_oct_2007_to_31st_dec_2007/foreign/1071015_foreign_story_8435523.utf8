				 How to break Nobel news
 MATT COWAN				 	 Lessing after she was told of the prize. (AP)																								London, Oct. 14 (Reuters): I didnt go to work expecting to tell someone they had won a Nobel Prize.																								Less than an hour after the Swedish Academy announced Doris Lessing was this years Nobel Literature prize winner, the novelist came home in a London taxi and looked astonished at the small media gaggle outside her house.																								It was clear she had not heard the news.																								Reuters was the only TV crew on the scene on Thursday morning and there were few other reporters on hand. 																								I sensed that if I played this right, I could be the one to inform her and the video would get worldwide play. But the 87-year-old author was struggling to open the taxi door.																								Tethered to the camera by a microphone, I was in an awkward position: if I helped her out of the cab Id have to drop the microphone and ruin the sound bite, so I looked at a colleague to my right who took my hint and moved to the door.																								The new Nobel laureate was helped out of the cab. I asked her if she had heard the news and when she said no, I shared it with her.																								Oh Christ! she said in an exasperated tone that I certainly was not expecting.																								Its been going on now for 30 years, one cant get more excited than one gets, she said, referring to the decades of speculation that she would win the prize.																								She shooed me away. I realised if I wanted the sound bite, Id have to work for it.																								Lessings son, his arm in a sling, walked past carrying an artichoke. He and his mother had been vegetable shopping and missed the phone call from Stockholm.																								Isnt this a recognition of your lifes work? I persisted.																								Yes, it is. See, youve said it all for me, the feisty and prolific author responded, turning to head indoors.																								A radio journalist asked her to appear on air. She snapped back that she would have to think of something suitable to say.																								Clearly she was not going to make it easy.																								I managed to get her to turn around when she was half-way up the garden path by asking her if prizes meant anything to her.																								 Look I have won all the prizes in Europe, every bloody one. Im delighted to win them all, okay? she responded testily.																								As an afterthought she turned around and mumbled: Its a royal flush  the most valuable hand in poker.

				 Musharraf again asks Benazir to delay return
				 	 Urgent plea																								Islamabad, Oct. 13 (PTI): President Pervez Musharraf has again urged former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to delay her return to Pakistan from self-imposed exile till the supreme court decides petitions challenging his re-election in last weeks presidential poll.																								I have sent messages that she should delay her return, the military ruler said in an interview to the BBC, reiterating a suggestion he had made two days ago that Bhutto should put off her homecoming scheduled for October 18.																								Asked if he would try to prevent her return if Bhutto ignored his advice, Musharraf said: No, that is not the case, but I would urge her not to.																								Asked if Bhutto had responded to his message, Musharraf said: I have not got a response from her so far.																								Bhuttos party, however, has said she intends to come back to Pakistan as scheduled.																								Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, too, has thrown his weight behind Musharrafs stance, saying she should not return to the country till the apex court decides whether the general was eligible to contest the presidential poll in uniform.

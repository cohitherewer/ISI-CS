				 Strike slows France to a crawl
																								Paris, Nov. 14 (AP): Striking transport workers slowed France to a crawl today, taking on President Nicolas Sarkozy in a pivotal standoff over his bid to strip away labour protections he says are dooming his nation to decline.																								As Paris commuters snaked through traffic on childrens scooters and university students blockaded classes to protest Sarkozys reforms, the key question was how long the strikers would hold out against the determined President.																								Labour leaders meeting labour minister Xavier Bertrand expressed guarded optimism that the government could launch negotiations to end the open-ended strikes. Unions are protesting plans to extend the retirement age for some 500,000 public sector workers.																								The strikes started last night when the SNCF rail authority halted service on most of its lines. Many railroads around the country stood empty today, with just 90 of 700 trains running. Paris transit workers joined in this morning, and paper signs reading No Service dangled at subway stations and bus and tram stops in the capital.

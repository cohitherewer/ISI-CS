				 Malaysia Indians get reprieve
				 	 (From left) Indian leaders P. Uthayakumar (giving a thumbs up sign), P. Waytha Moorthy and V. Ganapathy Rao after being discharged from a court in Klang, outside Kuala Lumpur. (AP)																								Klang (Malaysia), Nov. 26 (AP): Three ethnic Indian activists charged with sedition walked free today on a technicality, a day after their group rallied 10,000 people to protest Malaysian government policies that they say discriminate against minority Indians.																								 Sessions court Judge Zunaidah Idris granted the three men a discharge not amounting to acquittal, which means that the charges have not been formally withdrawn and they can be re-arrested later.																								The activists are founders of the Hindu Right Action Force, a non-government group that captured national attention yesterday by holding the biggest demonstration by ethnic Indians in more than a decade. The rally in downtown Kuala Lumpur ended in clashes with police.																								P. Uthayakumar, one of those charged, said they had been maliciously prosecuted. The other two charged are his brother, P. Waytha Moorthy, who is the chairman of the Hindu group, and V. Ganapathy Rao. All three are lawyers.																								They charged us for sedition when we spoke the truth, Uthayakumar told reporters outside the court after being freed. 																								Authorities had arrested the three on Friday and charged them with allegedly uttering seditious words to incite a crowd at a gathering in central Selangor state on November 16. However, Judge Zunaidah said she was ordering them to be freed because prosecutors could not immediately provide a copy of their speeches in Tamil, the language in which they had spoken the allegedly seditious words.																								Prosecutors declined to comment to reporters. The activists had pleaded innocent to the charge, but details of what specifically was seditious in their speeches have not been revealed. Sedition is punishable by three years in prison and a fine.																								Some 1,000 supporters clapped and cheered outside the court when they heard the news. They marched through Klang town near Kuala Lumpur to a Hindu temple, where the activists made brief speeches watched by riot police backed by trucks mounted with water cannons.																								Yesterdays rally, which was banned by authorities, raised ethnic and racial tensions after police used tear gas and chemical-laced water to disperse the protesters, who had hurled stones and water bottles in cat-and-mouse clashes with security forces for about eight hours.																								Government officials have denounced the demonstration as an attempt to create racial animosity and smear the governments image.																								 The rally  rooted in complaints that the ethnic Malay Muslim-dominated government discriminates against minorities  was the largest protest in at least a decade involving ethnic Indians, the countrys second-largest minority population after ethnic Chinese. Street rallies are rare in Malaysia, which prides itself on communal and political peace.

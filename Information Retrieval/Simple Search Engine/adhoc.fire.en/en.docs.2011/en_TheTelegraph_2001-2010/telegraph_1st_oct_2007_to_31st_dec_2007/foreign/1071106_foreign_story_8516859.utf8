				 Italy mafias new boss of bosses arrested
																								Palermo (Sicily), Nov. 5 (Reuters): Salvatore Lo Piccolo, who magistrates believe is the Sicilian Mafias new boss of bosses, was arrested today after nearly a quarter of a century on the run, police said.																								Lo Piccolo, 65, was arrested with his 32-year-old son, Sandro, and two other Mafia bosses. The four are among the top 30 most wanted Mafia suspects in Italy and were arrested in a raid on a country house outside the Sicilian capital Palermo where they were holding a summit.																								Police fired a few shots during the raid but no one was injured. As he was being arrested, the younger Lo Piccolo told his father: I love you, Dad, according to local media reports.																								Magistrates believe the elder Lo Piccolo, whose Mafia nickname is the Baron, took over the reins of the crime organisation after the arrest last year of former boss of bosses Bernardo Provenzano.																								We are really pleased with this operation because these people are not just fugitives but Mafia chiefs who were wielding their power, anti-Mafia magistrate Francesco Messineo told the Italian news agency Ansa.

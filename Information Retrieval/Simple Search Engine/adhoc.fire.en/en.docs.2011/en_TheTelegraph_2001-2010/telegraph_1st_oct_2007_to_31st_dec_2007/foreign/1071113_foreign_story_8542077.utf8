				 Court heat on Australia spy agency
																								Sydney, Nov. 12 (AP): A judge accused Australias main spy agency today of falsely imprisoning a Pakistani-born Australian citizen, who faced terrorism-related charges that were later dropped.																								Former Sydney medical student Izhar ul-Haque, 24, had been charged with intentionally receiving combat and weapons training from terrorist group Lashkar-e-Toiba in Pakistan in 2003.																								The charge, which carries a maximum 25-year prison sentence, was dropped after New South Wales state supreme court judge Michael Adams ruled that Haques interview with three agents of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, better known as ASIO, could not be used as evidence.																								Todays hearing was held to announce the reasons the charges were dropped earlier this month. Adams accused an ASIO agent of kidnapping and false imprisonment, both criminal offences, and said agents oppressive conduct had influenced alleged admissions made by Haque. It was a gross interference by the agents of the state.

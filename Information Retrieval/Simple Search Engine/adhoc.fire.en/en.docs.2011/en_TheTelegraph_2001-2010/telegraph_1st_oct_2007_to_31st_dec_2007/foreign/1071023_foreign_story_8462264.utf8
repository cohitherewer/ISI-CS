				 Pak begins work on caretaker govt
 NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES 				 	 Benazir in Karachi. (AP)																								Islamabad, Oct. 22: A 12-me-mber caretaker cabinet will be installed in Pakistan on November 16 to hold parliamentary elections in January 2008.																								The caretaker government will be in place on November 16 to organise parliamentary elections in the country, deputy information minister Tariq Azeem told The Tele- graph as the ruling party stepped up efforts to convene an all-party conference to finalise a code of conduct for the polls.																								Azeem said the federal cabinet would have a dozen ministers, mostly technocrats. Several names are being considered for the caretaker Prime Ministers post. 																								The government is in touch with all leading political parties to finalise the names of the caretaker Prime Minister and the ministers. 																								The National Assembly will complete its five-year term on November 15. This is the first Assembly since 1985. All the previous assemblies and governments, except the one ousted in a 1999 bloodless coup, faced dissolution under presidential powers. 																								Azeem said the all-party meeting would be convened before the dissolution of the Assembly. We are talking to all political parties to finalise a date, he said.																								His remarks came against the backdrop of the governments decision to ban processions by political parties during the election campaign and to limit public meetings at specified places.																								Interior minister Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao said the government could not impose an outright ban on election campaigns. Therefore, they will be allowed to hold public meetings at places to be specified by the provincial governments. 																								We want a peaceful, conducive atmosphere for the elections, Sherpao said.																								The decision was taken after more than 135 people were killed in what is being claimed as twin suicide attacks on the homecoming parade of former Prime MInister Benazir Bhutto in Karachi on Thursday night. 																								The investigators have found (two) heads of the suspected suicide bombers and there was no crater on the site of the blasts which usually resulted from explosions carried out by planted devices, Sherpao said. 																								He also said that there had been no arrest directly related to the investigation yet, but rejected Benazirs request for foreign assistance with the investigation.																								Benazirs Pakistan Peoples Party today demanded the removal of the chief investigating officer from the case, alleging that he had been present when her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, was tortured while in custody in 1999.																								The immediate decision for Benazir, the Pakistani politician most capable of mobilising support on the streets, is when and how to travel to Larkana, the town where her ancestral home is and where her father is buried.

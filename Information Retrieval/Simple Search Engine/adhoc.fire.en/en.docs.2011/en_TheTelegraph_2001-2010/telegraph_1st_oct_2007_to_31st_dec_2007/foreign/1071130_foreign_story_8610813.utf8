				 Nuclear law Hyde dead
				 	 Hyde 																								Washington, Nov. 29: Henry Hyde, the former Republican Congressman who lent his name to the law that brought the Manmohan Singh government to the brink over the US nuclear deal, died today in Chicago. He was 83.																								The cause of death was not announced but Hyde had undergone open-heart surgery in July.																								Hyde retired from Congress at the end of the last session in 2006. He was instrumental in steering the Henry J. Hyde US and India Nuclear Cooperation Promotion Act of 2006 through the second session of Congress in 2006.																								The Left had seized on the punitive provisions in the Hyde Act, which come into force if nuclear tests are carried out, to oppose the nuclear deal. Hydes death came in the middle of the continuing tug-of-war in India, where Parliament debated the deal yesterday. 																								 Hyde was also an ardent opponent of abortion who presided over the House of Representatives impeachment of former President Bill Clinton. 																								Henry was a student of American history, a constitutional scholar, a thoughtful legislator and a passionate orator, said House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio.																								Hyde was mostly known for his anti-abortion views and white shock of hair.																								That was until Hyde, a Republican from Chicagos western suburbs, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee led the bitter, partisan proceedings in 1998 to impeach Clinton for lying under oath about a sexual affair with a White House intern.																								Hydes reputation was tarnished when online magazine Salon reported he had had an extra-marital affair with a married woman 30 years earlier, which Hyde referred to as youthful indiscretions.

				 Love lies in the eyes
																								London, Nov. 7: If you want to appear more attractive to the opposite sex, smile and look them straight in the eye, says new research.																								In tests on hundreds of people, a direct smiling gaze from a possible mate was a look of love that made that person appear up to eight times more attractive.																								The finding has emerged from a survey using computer-manipulated faces, where a basic face had gaze and expression altered in a subtle way that was not immediately apparent to test subjects, conducted by a team at the Universities of Aberdeen and Stirling.																								The research marks one of the first studies to see the effects of the direction of gaze on attractiveness. When asked to think of examples of attractive facial characteristics, most people think of physical traits such as healthy-looking skin and symmetrical features, said Ben Jones, who runs the Face Research Laboratory. We show that gaze direction can also be important for attraction, he said.																								Faces with direct gaze (that is, faces that are looking at the viewer) were judged more attractive than faces with averted gaze (that is faces that were looking away from the viewer), particularly when faces were both smiling.

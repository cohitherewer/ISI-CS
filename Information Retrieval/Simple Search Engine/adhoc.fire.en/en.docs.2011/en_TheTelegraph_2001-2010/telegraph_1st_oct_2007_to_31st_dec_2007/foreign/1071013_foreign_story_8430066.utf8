 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI			Pachauris friends celebrate in New Delhi on Friday. Telegraph picture by Prem SinghNew Delhi. Oct. 12: Clicking the refresh icon on her computer screen every few seconds, Rashmi Pachauri anxiously scanned the website of the Nobel Foundation for the announcement of the Peace Prize. 																								Her brother Ash, driving a car, couldnt risk missing out on the announcement. He insisted that she keep speaking and updating him on the phone. At the office of The Energy Research Institute (Teri) in central Delhis India Habitat Centre, Akanksha Chaurey was jotting down instructions from her boss, Rajendra Pachauri, when the phone rang. It was 2:30 pm. 																								When Pachauri put down the phone, he was calm and composed, as though the call was routine. I left his office, and only some minutes later did I get to know, Chaurey recounted. 																								Pachauri had just received a call from the Nobel Foundation, informing him that The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that he heads had been selected, along with former US Vice-President Al Gore, for its Peace Prize. 																								Its still sinking in. It may take days before the true import of what has happened today stikes me, Pachauri smiled, an hour after the announcement. The IPCC has been tasked with evaluating the likelihood, the risks and the possible impact of climate change. 																								His Teri colleagues, who had rushed to his cabin on hearing the announcement, arranged for cartons of champagne with which they planned to drench Pachauri. 																								A mob of family, friends and media personnel around him ensured their plan had to be aborted. 																								Instead, the 67-year old Pachauri was treated to a warm hug from his 12-year-old granddaughter Krishna. I havent decided how I will treat my school friends, giggled the British School student, watching the media rush by her. 																								Minutes later, the phone rang again  this time, the caller was Bill Clintons former deputy himself. 																								Pachauri and Gore congratulated each other, and the IPCC chairman thanked Gore for calling him. The two, Rashmi remembered, had been friends for close to two decades, but had become particularly close to each other after Gore took on the green avatar a few years ago. 																								You are a leader, and I, a follower, Pachauri said, towards the end of their conversation. 																								That Pachauri himself likes leading from the front is evident  from his work at the IPCC, where he got around 130 countries to accept climate change as a major concern, and his passion for cricket. 																								An opening bowler, Pachauri took two wickets in a cricket match against a corporate eleven last weekend. I used to be medium fast at one time... now I just bowl medium pace, he smiled.

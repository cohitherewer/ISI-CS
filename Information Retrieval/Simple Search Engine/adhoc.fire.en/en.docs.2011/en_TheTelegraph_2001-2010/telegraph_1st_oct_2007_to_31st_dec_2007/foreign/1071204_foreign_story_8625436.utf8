				 No envoy visits for held lawyer
																								Lahore, Dec. 3 (Reuters): Police stopped US ambassador Anne Patterson today from meeting Aitzaz Ahsan, a leading Pakistani Opposition figure being held under house arrest, a US embassy spokeswoman said.																								Ahsan, a lawyer and former member of the National Assembly for Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party, was detained under emergency powers invoked by President Pervez Musharraf on November 3.																								The former cabinet minister was held at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for nearly three weeks before being transferred to house arrest in the eastern city of Lahore and allowed to file nomination papers for a parliamentary election set for January 8. 																								Patterson had requested permission to meet Ahsan, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association.																								When the envoy arrived at Ahsans home she was barred from seeing him, but was allowed to meet his wife, Bushra, along with several lawyers in another part of the house.																								The ambassador met Bushra Aitzaz to express concern and repeated US calls for all detainees to be released, including Ahsan, Elizabeth Colton, the embassy spokeswoman, said.

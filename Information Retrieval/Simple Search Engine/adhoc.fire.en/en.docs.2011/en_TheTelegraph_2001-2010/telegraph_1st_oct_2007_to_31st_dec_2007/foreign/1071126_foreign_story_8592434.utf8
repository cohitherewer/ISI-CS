				 God save nutter Blair this time
 JONATHAN WYNNE-JONES AND PATRICK HENNESSY				 	 Religion matters																								London, Nov. 25: Tony Blair has sparked controversy by claiming that people who speak about their religious faith can be viewed by society as nutters.																								The former UK Prime Ministers comments came as he admitted for the first time that his faith was hugely important in influencing his decisions during his decade in power at Number 10, including going to war with Iraq in 2003.																								Blair complained that he had been unable to follow the example of US politicians, such as President George W. Bush, in being open about his faith because people in Britain regarded religion with suspicion.																								Its difficult if you talk about religious faith in our political system, Blair said. If you are in the American political system or others then you can talk about religious faith and people say yes, thats fair enough and it is something they respond to quite naturally.																								You talk about it in our system and, frankly, people do think youre a nutter. I mean you may go off and sit in the corner and commune with the man upstairs and then come back and say right, Ive been told the answer and thats it.																								Even Alastair Campbell  his former communications director who once said: We dont do God  has conceded that Blairs Christian faith played a central role in shaping what he felt was important.

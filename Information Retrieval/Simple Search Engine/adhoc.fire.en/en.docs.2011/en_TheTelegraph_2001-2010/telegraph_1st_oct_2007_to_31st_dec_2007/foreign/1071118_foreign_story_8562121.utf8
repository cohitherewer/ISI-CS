				 Rush to send aid to survivors
																								Dhaka, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Military ships and helicopters were trying today to reach thousands of survivors of a super cyclone that killed more than 1,723 people and pummelled impoverished Bangladesh with mighty winds and waves.																								Cyclone Sidr smashed into the countrys southern coastline late on Thursday night with 250kmph winds that whipped up a five-metre tidal surge. It was the strongest cyclone since a 1991 storm that killed some 143,000 people in Bangladesh.																								Navy ships scoured coastal areas for hundreds of people reported missing and sought to clear river channels clogged with sunken vessels to restore normal navigation, officials said.																								Helicopters flew sorties to devastated areas, dropping food, drinking water and medicine for the survivors.																								We are here to help you. You help us by allowing a safe landing and keeping a safe distance, the pilot of a helicopter warned people in Mathbaria, Barisal district, as they thronged towards his craft, television pictures showed.																								The official death toll rose to 1,723 late today and disaster ministry officials said it was likely to rise further. Private television channels said the toll had already crossed 2,000.																								It will take several days to complete the search and know the actual casualty figure and extent of damage to property, said food and disaster ministry official Ayub Miah. Trees felled by the storm blocked roads, hampering relief efforts. Its an uphill task, said an official in Barisal.																								Fakhruddin Ahmed, head of Bangladeshs army-backed interim government, asked officials yesterday to ensure bodies are buried quickly to avoid the spread of disease.																								The US navy, which helped after a devastating storm in 1991, was reportedly ready to send two ships with helicopters to assist rescue efforts.

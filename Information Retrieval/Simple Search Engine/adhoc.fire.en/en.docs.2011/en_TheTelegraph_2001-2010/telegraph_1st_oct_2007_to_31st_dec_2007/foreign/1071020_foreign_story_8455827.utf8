				 Taliban leader denies hand
																								Miranshah, Oct. 19 (Reuters): A well-known Pakistani Taliban commander, said to have issued assassination threats against Benazir Bhutto earlier this month, denied any involvement in the Karachi blasts.																								I had nothing to do with it, Baitullah Mehsud said from an undisclosed location.																								Mehsud, who operates in Waziristan, a tribal region on the border with Afghanistan, had been widely reported as issuing threats against Benazir after she announced plans to return to Pakistan, ending eight years of self-imposed exile.																								His fighters are currently holding more than 200 Pakistani soldiers hostage, having captured them in late August.																								Another Waziristan Taliban commander named Haji Omar also spoke this week of the Talibans intention to kill both Bhutto and President Pervez Musharraf because of their support for the US-led war on terrorism and deployment of American troops in Afghanistan.

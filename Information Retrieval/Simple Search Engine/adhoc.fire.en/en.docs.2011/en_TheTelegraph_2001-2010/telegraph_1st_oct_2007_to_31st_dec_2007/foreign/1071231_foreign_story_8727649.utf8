				 Autopsy cloud on police

																								Islamabad, Dec. 30 (PTI): The decision not to conduct an autopsy on Benazir Bhuttos body was taken by the Rawalpindi police chief even though a medico-legal report based on a mandatory post-mortem is a must in a murder case under Pakistani law.
																								Even if the family of a murder victim refuses to allow the autopsy, no investigation can be completed if doctors do not perform the autopsy and conclusively find the cause of death, said Athar Minallah, a lawyer and member of the board of Rawalpindi General Hospital where Bhutto was taken.
																								He said doctors who treated Bhutto had told him they wanted to conduct the autopsy but the Rawalpindi police chief had not agreed to this.
																								The doctors were worried that their initial report, which did not determine the definite cause of death, is being politically twisted, he told The News.
																								Minallahs statement is contrary to interior ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheemas, who had said the autopsy was not done at the request of Bhuttos husband Asif Ali Zardari.

				 Jet Li nets $13 million for Chinese film
																								Beijing, Nov 25 (Reuters): Chinese action star Jet Li is set to rake in 100 million yuan ($13 million) for his latest movie, a record for an actor in a Chinese-language film, state media reported today.																								Nearly half of the $40 million budget for The Warlords went to the cast, among whom were Hong Kong heartthrob Andy Lau, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Beijing-based actress and director Xu Jinglei, in addition to Li.																								Without Jet Li, we would not dare to invest $40 million in a Chinese-language film, Xinhua news agency quoted director Peter Chan as saying. Li (in picture) was a guarantee for global sales, Chan said.																								Chinese-language movies have registered a string of hits in the past few years, from Ang Lees martial arts tale Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, to Zhang Yimous ancient history epic Hero.																								The earlier salary record was held by Li himself for his role in Hero, for which he earned 70 million yuan.																								Li, 44, a childhood martial arts champion, has also broken into English-language films, featuring in action pictures such as Romeo Must Die and Lethal Weapon 4.																								The Warlords, a war epic based on a Qing Dynasty story, is slated for release in Asia in mid-December and in North America from next March.

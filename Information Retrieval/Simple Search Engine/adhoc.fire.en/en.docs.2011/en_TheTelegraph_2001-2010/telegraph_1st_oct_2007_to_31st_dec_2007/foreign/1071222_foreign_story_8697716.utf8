				 Bail denied for Indian woman in slavery case

																								Central Islip (New York), Dec. 21 (AP): A federal judge revoked bail yesterday for a wealthy Long Island woman of Indian-origin, convicted earlier this week of imprisoning and torturing two Indonesian housekeepers, in what prosecutors called a case of modern-day slavery. 
																								The judge allowed the womans husband, who was also convicted, to remain free until both are sentenced. 
																								The woman, Varsha Sabhnani, who fainted and had to be hospitalised after a jury returned guilty verdicts on Monday, pleaded in vain to Judge Arthur D. Spatt at a court here as her four children sobbed in the gallery. 
																								The judge ruled that because the jury found she had been the one who inflicted physical punishment on the housekeepers, she was no longer eligible to remain free.
																								Her husband, Mahender Sabhnani, also pleaded with the judge to no avail. The couple were convicted of all charges in a 12-count indictment that included forced labour and conspiracy.

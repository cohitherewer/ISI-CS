				 Europe, US slam polls
				 	 Vladimir Putin speaks during a visit to the Lavochkin spacecraft design bureau near Moscow on Monday. (Reuters)																								Brussels, Dec. 3 (Reuters): Europe joined the US today in demanding Russia investigate alleged abuses in an election won overwhelmingly by President Vladimir Putins party, and Germany denounced the poll as undemocratic.																								European states expressed alarm over the outcome of yesterdays parliamentary poll after rights watchdogs said the campaign had been marred by biased media coverage and abuse of government resources in favour of Putins United Russia.																								But analysts said many European states now acknowleged that Moscow, whose cooperation the West wants over disputes from Iran to Kosovo, was increasingly impervious to outside criticism. With almost all votes counted in the State Duma (lower house) election, Putins United Russia had won 64.1 per cent of votes  nearly six times as many as his nearest rival.																								It is vital that the Russian Central Election Commission urgently investigates all allegations of electoral abuses, Britains foreign ministry said, echoing a similar call from Washington yesterday.																								Observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe said the Russian election was not fair.																								The State Duma election ... was not fair and failed to meet many OSCE and Council of Europe commitments and standards for democratic elections, the joint observer mission of the two European rights watchdogs said.																								The ODIHR, monitoring body of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, cancelled plans to field a team to the Duma elections last month after a row with Moscow over delays in issuing visas to observers.																								This left only small teams drawn from the parliamentary assemblies of both the Council of Europe and the OSCE.																								France expressed the hope that Moscow would shed light on the allegations of voting irregularities.																								Sharper reaction came from German Chancellor Angela Merkels government, seen as less close to Putin than that of her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder. Measured by our standards, it was neither a free, fair nor democratic election, said spokesman Thomas Steg. 																								Foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged Russia to probe abuses.

				 Ageing slowed by sunbathing
																								London, Nov. 8: Sunbathing can slow the ageing process by up to five years, according to new research.																								Scientists have found that people who avoid the sun, or have inadequate vitamin D in their diet, are subject to genetic damage associated with ageing and age-related illnesses.																								The effect of the damage is so great that those who lack vitamin D  often called the sunshine vitamin because 90 per cent of the bodys intake is created by exposure to the sun  were biologically five years older than those with the highest levels.																								Lead researcher Dr Brent Richards, from Kings College, London said: These results are exciting because they demonstrate for the first time that people with high levels of vitamin D may age more slowly than people with lower levels.																								This helps to explain how vitamin D has a protective effect on age-related illnesses such as heart disease.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

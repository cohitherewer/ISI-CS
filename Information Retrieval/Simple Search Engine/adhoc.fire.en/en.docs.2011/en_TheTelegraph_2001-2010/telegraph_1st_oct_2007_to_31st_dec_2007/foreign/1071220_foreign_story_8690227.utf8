				 Breather eludes Bikini Killer

																								Kathmandu, Dec. 19 (PTI): Bikini Killer Charles Sobhraj, convicted of murdering an American woman here in 1975, today failed to get any reprieve from Nepals supreme court, which ruled that status quo will be maintained in the matter.
																								The two-member apex court bench also ordered the reopening of a fake passport case against Sobhraj. It said both cases will be heard simultaneously.
																								Nicknamed the serpent for his ability to evade police, the 63-year-old had filed an appeal in the apex court against the life sentence given by the Kathmandu district court for the murder of American backpacker Connie Bronzich. 
																								He is suspected to have killed at least 12 travellers in India, Thailand and Nepal during the 1970s.
																								Sobhraj, a French national of Indian and Vietnamese origin, was arrested from Casino Royale in Kathmandu in August 2003.
																								Earlier, the serial killer had sent a written statement to the supreme court claiming that his conviction was based on false news reports and documents. 
																								He also said the prosecution had not produced any eyewitness account.

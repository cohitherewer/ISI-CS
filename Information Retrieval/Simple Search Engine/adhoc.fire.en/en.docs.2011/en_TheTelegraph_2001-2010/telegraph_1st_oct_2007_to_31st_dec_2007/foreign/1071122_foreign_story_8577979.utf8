				 Restrictive Facebook updates is no more
 CLAUDINE BEAUMONT																								London, Nov. 21: Facebook, the social-networking site beloved of twenty- and thirty-somethings, has caved into user pressure and announced it is removing the mandatory is from members status updates. 																								Status updates are one of the most popular features on the site, allowing users to inform other people in their social network what they are doing at that moment. 																								For instance: Claudine is: writing an article about Facebook. 																								However, because the word is is included as standard in all status updates, users are forced to either get creative with their status alerts or indulge in very grammatically incorrect sentences (Claudine is: likes to dance). 																								But according to the Facebook fansite allfacebook.com, Facebook has told developers of third-party applications for the site that new verbs can be added to Facebook status updates in future. 																								It is not yet clear when the change will take effect, but its sure to be massively popular with Facebook users. 																								Most members regularly update their status throughout the day, and a Facebook group set up on the site to campaign for the dropping of the mandatory is has more than 165,000 members. 																								It seems that Facebook fans will still have to write in the third-person for a while longer, though, as there currently appear to be no plans to change this element of the status updates. Overall  Claudine thinks: this is a wonderful idea.

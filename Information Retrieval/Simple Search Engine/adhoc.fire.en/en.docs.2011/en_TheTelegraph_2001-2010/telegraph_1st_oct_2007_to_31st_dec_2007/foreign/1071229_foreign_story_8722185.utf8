																								London, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Consumers are too scared to open post-Christmas bills, a survey has found.
																								Around a quarter of 16 to 44-year-olds are worried about bills arriving on their doormats in the New Year, according to the Financial Services Authority (FSA).
																								Its poll of 2,454 adults also found that 48 per cent of them are more likely to go on a diet or book a holiday than try to sort out their finances in January (13 per cent).
																								Almost 60 per cent of people admitted they either did not know what Christmas was going to cost them or spent more than they had budgeted, and 23 per cent used loans or credit cards to finance the festivities. Chris Pond, director of financial capability at the FSA, warned of the potentially devastating consequences.

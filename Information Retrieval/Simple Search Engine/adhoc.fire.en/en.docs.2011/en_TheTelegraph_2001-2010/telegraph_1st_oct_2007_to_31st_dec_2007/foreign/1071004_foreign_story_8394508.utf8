				 While Hillary chuckles, experts ponder
 															- THE LAUGH PUTS SCRIBES IN A TIZZY				 	 REAL OR FAKE?																								Forget the cleavage. Its now about the cackle. No joke: Hillary Clintons laugh is now being analysed, scrutinised and, yes, mocked as if it were a sound barrier on her glide path to the Democratic presidential nomination: Is it real? Is it fake? Is it a diabolically clever attempt to portray her as a human being?																								What a hoot.																								Comedian Jon Stewart, setting the pace for political journalism, kicked things off last week by assembling a grab bag of giggling and guffawing when the Senator appeared on all five Sunday talk shows, from a barn outside her Chappaqua, New York, home. As Clinton was seen bursting into belly laughs  sometimes oddly and abruptly  at queries by the likes of Bob Schieffer and Chris Wallace, the Daily Show host likened her to a robot switching into chuckle mode when aggressive interrogators needed to be neutralised.																								Suddenly, everyone wanted a piece of the punch line, examining whether The Laugh met some vaguely defined standard of acceptability. Depending on who you ask, ABCs Kate Snow said on Good Morning America, Hillary Clinton is either having a really good time out on the campaign trail, or shes the master of a shrewd political skill disarming her critics with the gleam in her eye and a roar straight from the belly. Foxs Sean Hannity said Clintons maniacal laughing fits on Fox News Sunday have sparked speculation that she is trying to get voters to believe that shes not the cold, calculating candidate that the press has often characterised her as.																								The Clinton campaign doesnt view this as a thigh-slapper. Shes got a great laugh, said spokesman Jay Carson, but given the serious issues facing this country  the mess this administration has got us into in Iraq, growing economic woes and millions without health care, to name a few  we dont think voters are going to decide on their next President based on who has the most melodious laugh.																								The subtext here is that the media have collectively decided that the wife of the 42nd President is the inevitable nominee and a good bet to become the 44th Oval Office occupant. Lacking much of a horse race,, journalists are resorting to a classic general-election question: Are Americans ready to have this woman in their living rooms every night for four years?

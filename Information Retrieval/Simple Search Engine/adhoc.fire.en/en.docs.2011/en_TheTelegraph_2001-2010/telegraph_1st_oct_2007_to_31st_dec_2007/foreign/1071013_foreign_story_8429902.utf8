				 Benazir pardon
																								Islamabad, Oct. 12 (Reuters): Pakistans supreme court took up challenges to an ordinance that erased graft charges against former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and underpins hopes for a power-sharing pact between her and President Pervez Musharraf.																								The court said today that those who benefitted from the ordinance might not do so any longer. We are inclined to observe in unambiguous term that any action or benefit drawn or intended to be drawn by any public office holder shall be subject to the decision on the listed petitions (challenges), said Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. Musharraf promulgated the ordinance on the the eve of last weeks presidential election by members of the federal parliament and provincial Assemblies, dropping graft charges filed against Bhutto between 1985 and 1999.

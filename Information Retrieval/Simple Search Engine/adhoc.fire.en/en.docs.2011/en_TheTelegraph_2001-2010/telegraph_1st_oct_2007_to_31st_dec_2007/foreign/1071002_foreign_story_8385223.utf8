				 Temple visit lands king in hot water
				 	 Ancient ritual																								Kathmandu, Oct. 1 (Reuters): Nepals increasingly isolated King Gyanendra has sparked criticism by seeking the blessings of a child some believe to be a living goddess in an ancient ritual considered crucial to preserve the monarchs power.																								Gyanendra visited the temple of the child goddess, known as Kumari, on the final day of a rain festival. His visit came a few hours after Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala had taken the kings place at the festival. 																								The king drove in his black limousine to the centuries-old temple in the capital, offered gold coins to the goddess and received auspicious red vermilion paste on his forehead and a marigold garland, witnesses said.																								Gyanendras move led to criticism from the interim government. Former Maoist rebels said the kings action had bolstered their demand for the monarchys abolition before the Constituent Assembly elections. This is a proof that he is still active, senior Maoist leader Dev Gurung said. There is no alternative to convening a special session of parliament to declare a republic, he said.

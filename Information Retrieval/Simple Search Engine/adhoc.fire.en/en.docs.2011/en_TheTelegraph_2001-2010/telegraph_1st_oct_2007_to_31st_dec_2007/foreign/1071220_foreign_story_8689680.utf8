				 Facebook fake

																								London, Dec. 19 (Reuters): A British MP had his Facebook account suspended this week after the popular social networking site decided he wasnt real.
																								Steve Webb, of the Liberal Democrats, tried to log on on Monday but received a message saying his account had been disabled following complaints he did not exist. The news was particularly disconcerting for the 42-year-old because not only has he been an MP for 10 years but he is also a keen promoter of online networking. I sent them an email asking what the problem was and got a response a day later saying they had concluded that my profile was a fake, that I wasnt really Steve Webb, Webb said.

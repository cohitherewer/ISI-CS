				 President dials with promise of a fight
				 	 Musharraf																								Islamabad, Oct. 19 (PTI): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today telephoned Benazir Bhutto to offer his condolences over the death of her party supporters in the Karachi blasts.																								The President and Ms Bhutto both expressed their unflinching resolve to fight the scourge of extremism and terrorism, Musharrafs spokesman Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi said.																								They (Benazir and Musharraf) also agreed that there is a need for the entire nation to unite in order to rid the country of this menace of suicide bombings, terrorism and extremism, he said.																								Musharraf said the attack was a conspiracy against democracy and asked the nation, especially the people of Karachi, to exercise patience and calm in this hour, the state-run APP news agency reported.																								Musharraf also directed the Sindh province government to hold an inquiry and submit a report within 48 hours, the Dawn News channel said.																								Asked about media reports that Benazir had blamed supporters of late dictator Zia-ul Haq for the attack, Qureshi said Musharraf had told Benazir on the phone that he hoped maturity and restraint would be displayed in this hour of tragedy by all and that they would refrain from unnecessary blame throwing.																								The President appealed to segments of society to facilitate the police and administration in the conduct of the investigation, Qureshi told Dawn News.																								Asked about the probe, Qureshi said it was continuing. Sometimes early indication as to what has been discovered becomes counter-productive. As things get confirmed, we will share it with you.																								During his conversation with Benazir, Musharraf expressed his firm resolve that all possible steps would be taken to carry out a thorough investigation to bring the perpetrators of the attack to justice.																								He said extensive security measures had been taken yesterday in consultation with Benazirs Pakistan Peoples Party leaders to ensure the safety of her convoy.																								The President prayed for the safety and security of Benazir, who returned home yesterday after eight years in self-imposed exile, during the call.

				 Tough Oxbridge tests
 VICTORIA NEUMARK AND GRAEME PATON																								London, Oct. 15: Pupils trying to get into Oxford and Cambridge will face a battery of entrance tests amid persistent fears that A-levels are failing to identify the brightest candidates.																								For the first time, students applying to study English and philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Oxford will sit an entrance exam. It recently introduced aptitude tests in physics, history, mathematics and computer science. At Cambridge, the number of prospective students taking the thinking skills test in a range of subjects including economics, engineering and natural sciences has risen to more than 3,000. 																								It comes as the Institute for Public Policy Research today launches a renewed attack on the institutions, saying admissions policies favour pupils from elite independent schools. However, with record numbers now leaving school with top grades, universities insist A-levels are no longer an accurate barometer of ability.																								In the mid-80s, fewer than half of students applying to Oxford and Cambridge gained straight As, but this year almost every candidate is expected to achieve the feat.																								Most students are preparing to sit aptitude tests at the end of October  often during half-term holidays  prompting claims from head teachers that students are overloaded.																								The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) wrote to both universities earlier this year to complain about the timing. Martin Ward, the deputy general secretary of the ASCL, said: If these tests take place in half-term, someone reasonably senior is going to have to turn out voluntarily to supervise them.																								Anthony Seldon, the master of Wellington College, the private boarding school in Berkshire, said: Admissions tests are necessary because A-levels insufficiently discriminate between the intellectually gifted and the merely well taught. Geoff Parks, the director of admissions at Cambridge, said: About a fifth of students doing A levels get three As. Cambridge is interested in the top five per cent. The A grade at A-level is no longer a good means of identifying a field of competitive applicants.

				 Musharraf hearings on fast track
																								Islamabad, Nov. 2 (Reuters): Pakistans supreme court to- day said it will quickly wrap up hearing challenges to President Pervez Musharrafs re-election, after an earlier plan for a 10-day adjournment raised fears emergency rule might be declared.																								The court will reconvene on Monday instead of November 12, which would have been just three days before Musharrafs current term ends, heightening a sense of suspense in a country trembling from a wave of suicide attacks by al Qaida-inspired militants.																								The courts dallying had fuelled rumours that Musha- rraf could invoke emergency powers and call off a vote due in January, which is supposed to transform Pakistan into a civilian-led democracy.																								The court will not take any blame for the controversy being created, said Justice Javed Iqbal, head of the 11-member bench hearing the objections to Musharraf contesting the presidency while still being army chief. 																								The talk of an emergency or martial law had prompted US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice to say any such move would be opposed.

The madarsa had been founded by Jalaluddin Haqqani  an old friend of Osama bin Laden.

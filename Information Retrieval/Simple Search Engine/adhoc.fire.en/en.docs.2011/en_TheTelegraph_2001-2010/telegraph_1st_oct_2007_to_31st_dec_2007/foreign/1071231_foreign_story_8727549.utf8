																								Paris, Dec. 30: Carla Bruni, the new love in Nicolas Sarkozys life, has been given a presidential hotline so she can reach him at any time of day or night, fuelling speculation about the intensity of their relationship.
																								The French leader has been spotted carrying a new mobile phone, apparently with a dedicated number to take calls and text messages from the Italian-born singer. 
																								The revelation comes amid frenzied discussion in France that the whirlwind romance may lead to marriage, just two months after the end of Sarkozys 11-year marriage to his wife Cecilia.
																								Brunis mother, Marisa Bruni-Tedeschi, claims that Sarkozy has already proposed and set a New Years Day deadline for an answer. 
																								The couple are currently creating a stir in Egypt. Such is the interest that security forces had to fire warning shots in the air to keep paparazzi from approaching their boat on Friday.
																								 For the second leg of their Christmas break, they are staying at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, behind the high walls of a vast seafront complex owned by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, the emir of Abu Dhabi.
																								Their use of a private jet, borrowed from Vincent Bollor, a billionaire businessman friend of the President, has caused political ructions in France.
																								But it is the spectacle of an unmarried couple courting in such public fashion that has scandalised conservative Islamic opinion in Egypt. One politician criticised Sarkozy for his libertine behaviour for sharing a hotel room with Bruni in Luxor. 
																								Bruni will have to avail herself of her new hotline to stay in touch with Sarkozy when he starts the official leg of his visit, meeting his Egyptian counterpart, Hosni Mubarak, in Cairo. 
																								Sarkozy enjoys a close relationship with his mobile  photographs frequently show him with the device glued to his ear  and he is know sometimes to interrupt official meetings to take calls. He kept one private phone especially for Cecilia, and after they were reconciled following a separation last year, he is said to have bombarded her with affectionate messages. Now Bruni appears to be enjoying the same degree of presidential attention. 
																								The French press noted with disdain that Sarkozy checked his mobile for text messages during his audience with Pope Benedict XVI in Rome on December 20. The President had hoped to take Bruni to the Vatican as First Girlfriend but papal advisers are understood to have objected to the presence of a woman with a man-eater reputation. 
																								The speed of the romance with the former model has led some of Sarkozys advisers to urge caution, but to no avail. Nothing will stop him, a source close to the president told the weekly magazine Gala. Hes too happy, too bling-bling. Carla, in the end, is a sort of feminine Rolex.
																								 Brunis track record has done nothing to cool Sarkozys ardour since they first met at a dinner in November. As for the whole bunch of lovers, that doesnt bother him, the source said. On the contrary, he has the impression he has entered into the world club of great seducers. 
																								Bruni sang the famous Marilyn Monroe refrain Happy Birthday, Mr President at the dinner, but she is in no rush to wed, according to its host, Jacques Sguela, an advertising executive. quot;

				 Imran on hunger strike
				 	 Khan																								Islamabad, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Detained Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan went on hunger strike today to protest against President Pervez Musharrafs dismissal of judges after he imposed emergency rule, a spokesman said.																								Khan planned to continue fasting until all judges sacked after the emergency was imposed on November 3 were reinstated, his spokesman Hafeezullah Khan Niazi said. I met him in jail today and he said he is going on hunger strike because there is no other way to protest, Niazi said. 																								He looked very committed and vowed that hell go on with the hunger strike until his demand is met.																								Khan, who heads his own small party, was arrested last week after emerged from hiding to lead a student protest against emergency rule.

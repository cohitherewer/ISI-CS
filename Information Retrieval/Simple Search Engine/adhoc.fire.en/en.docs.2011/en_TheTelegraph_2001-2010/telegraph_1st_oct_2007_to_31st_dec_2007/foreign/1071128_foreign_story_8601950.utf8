				 Chaos reigns at Oxford debate
 BEN FARMER				 	 Protesters in Oxford. (AP)																								Oxford, Nov. 27: Protesters broke through a security cordon and forced their way into the Oxford Union where Nick Griffin, leader of the far-Right BNP party, and David Irving, the controversial historian, were due to debate the limits of free speech. 																								 After pushing and shoving their way through the doors into the hall, around 20 demonstrators staged a sit down protest and began chanting at the debating table.																								The debate eventually began one-and-a-half hours late, with Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris and journalist Anne Atkins speaking against Irving in one room whilst two Oxford University post-graduate students took on Griffin in another. 																								The two controversial speakers had arrived early, accompanied by bodyguards, in a bid to avoid confrontation with the protesters. As he arrived, Irving, who had been invited seven times before and each time the invitation had been withdrawn, said: Im very glad to be here.																								Fearing bloody clashes between the protesters and far-Right groups Thames Valley police had drafted in large numbers of officers to control the demonstration.																								Yesterday Tory MP Julian Lewis resigned his lifetime membership of the society saying he was ashamed of the students decision. 																								Irving has been jailed in Austria for denying the holocaust but pleading guilty, he told the court: I made a mistake when I said there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz.																								In his speech last night the historian insisted his account of events is based on the evidence available. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

				 Benazir in talks for caretaker government
 NASIR JAFFRY				 	 Benazir (AFP) 																								Islamabad, Oct. 26: Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party has confirmed that it was in talks to finalise the caretaker government to be installed on November 16.																								Yes, we are in consultations with the government on the composition of the caretaker set-up, senior party leader and Benazirs close aide Raja Pervaiz Ashraf told The Telegraph yesterday. 																								He refused to disclose the names his party had sent to the government for inclusion in the caretaker regime, which will supervise the parliamentary polls in January 2008. Neither can I disclose those names nor can I divulge the names of the PPP leaders discussing the caretaker government and other issues, said Ashraf.																								However, it was learnt the PPP initially proposed its vice-chairman, Makhdoom Amin Fahim, as caretaker Prime Minister but the government didnt accept his candidature.																								Officials and ministers in the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Q) were tight-lipped on who would be Prime Minister but it was learnt that all sides are moving closer to forging a consensus on appointing a retired judge of the Supreme Court as caretaker chief executive.																								Ashraf denied reports the talks with the government had been stalled since last Thursdays suicide attack on Benazirs homecoming parade in Karachi, saying the process was on. The blasts had killed 139 people and injured 500.																								Ashraf demanded that the government bring in foreign experts to investigate the explosions. He denied that the PPP had received any threats from Islamic radicals.																								 We have no threats from the Taliban or any extremists, he said, adding that last weeks attack was carried out by those who dont want democracy in the country. 																								They are political dwarfs who have launched a character assassination campaign against Benazir, he said, alluding to leaders of the ruling party, including PML(Q) chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and his cousin, Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi.																								Ashrafs remarks coincided by an explosion in restive northwestern town of Swat that killed at least 22 people.

				 Laden roars but silent on Bhutto 

																								Cairo, Dec. 30 (AP): Osama bin Laden warned Iraqs Sunni Arabs against fighting al Qaida and vowed to expand the terror groups holy war to Israel in a new audiotape, threatening blood for blood, destruction for destruction.
																								Most of the 56-minute tape dealt with Iraq, apparently Ladens latest attempt to keep supporters in Iraq unified at a time when the US military claims to have al Qaidas Iraq branch on the run.
																								The tape did not mention Pakistan or the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, though the Pakistan government has blamed al Qaida and the Taliban for her death. That suggested the tape was made before the assassination.
																								The tapes authenticity could not be confirmed. But the voice resembled that of bin Laden.
																								Bin Ladens comments offered an unusually direct attack on Israel, stepping up al Qaidas attempts to use the Israeli-Arab conflict to rally supporters.
																								Israel has warned of growing al Qaida activity in Palestinian territory, though the terror network is not believed to have taken a strong role there so far.
																								We intend to liberate Palestine, the whole of Palestine from the (Jordan) river to the sea, he said. 
																								We will not recognise even one inch for Jews in the land of Palestine as other Muslim leaders have, bin Laden threatened.

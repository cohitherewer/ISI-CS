				 Radical cubs catch amp; hand Imran over 
				 	 Imran Khan at the rally in Lahore on Wednesday. (AFP)																								Lahore, Nov. 14 (Agencies): Fugitive Opposition leader Imran Khan surfaced at a student demonstration against emergency rule today, and was promptly detained by hard-line students and handed over to the police, authorities said.																								Some 200 student supporters cheered wildly and lifted Khan into the air when he got out of a car on a university campus in Lahore, but other students representing the hardline Jamaat-e-Islami party surged forward, grabbed Khan and hustled him into a nearby building, senior police official Aftab Cheema said.																								Cheema said the radical students placed Khan in a van and took him to a campus gate, where he was handed over to police. He is being held at an undisclosed location, Cheema said. 																								Late tonight, police said Khan is to be charged under the anti-terrorism legislation. He will be charged under the anti-terrorism act, Lahore police chief Malik Mohammad Iqbal said. Through his speeches, he (Imran) has been inciting people to pick up arms, he has been calling for civil disobedience, he was spreading hatred, Iqbal said.																								The Jamaat-e-Islami party is also opposed to President Pervez Musharrafs declaration of emergency rule, but were apparently angered that the relatively moderate Khan was allowed on campus.																								Khan, who led Pakistan to victory in 1992 cricket world cup and leads a small Opposition party, was the only one of Musharrafs most outspoken critics not in detention or exile. He went into hiding after Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3 and began rounding up Opposition activists. Khan gave a series of media interviews at secret locations in Lahore before deciding to join students at the University of Punjab protesting Musharrafs assumption of emergency powers.																								One student, Faisal Naim, said Khan was still being hoisted aloft by his supporters when the radical students pushed forward.																								Some people came and took him away. He was on my shoulders when they grabbed him, he said. In Islamabad, Opposition parties tried to forge a united front today to end Musharrafs rule. We are ready to set aside our differences with the Peoples Party, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said by telephone from Saudi Arabia, referring to the party of Opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto.																								Bhutto, who had been in power-sharing talks with Musharraf for months, said that her party might boycott a parliamentary election Musharraf has promised to hold by January 9.

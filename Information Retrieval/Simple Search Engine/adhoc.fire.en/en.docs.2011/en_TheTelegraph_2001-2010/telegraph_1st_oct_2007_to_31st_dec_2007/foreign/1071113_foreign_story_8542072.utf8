				 Presidents survival tied to elections: US
 ROBIN WRIGHT				 	 Focus on people																								Washington, Nov. 12: The Bush administration is betting that President Pervez Musharraf can survive the crisis in Pakistan if he moves decisively to lift emergency rule and hold elections over the next two months, despite new US intelligence concerns about the dangers of long-term instability or, worse, a political vacuum, US officials say. 																								Timing is the key, they add.																								Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice yesterday called on Musharraf to restore constitutional rule as soon as possible.																								 The administration is considering sending a senior official to Islamabad this week to tell the Pakistani leader that he must urgently rescind restrictions on the media, civil society and Opposition politicians, which could discredit any January elections  and endanger both Pakistans stability and his political future, the sources said.																								But the US is also hedging its bets, with the US embassy reaching out to civil society leaders, military officials, community leaders and political parties to build options  just in case, officials say.																								We dont want to be seen to be looking, but we want to make sure we talk to a wide array of people, said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.																								Over the past week, the administrations position has begun to evolve from a commitment to stand by Musharraf to an emphasis on the will of the Pakistani people, and of unnamed others.																								We encourage moderate political forces in Pakistan to work together. Now if that means Musharraf and former Prime Minister [Benazir] Bhutto or others, then that is a decision for those people to make. Its a decision for the Pakistani people to make, state department spokesman Sean McCormack said.																								On ABCs This Week yesterday, Rice again shifted the focus from Musharraf. This is not a personal matter about President Musharraf. This is about the Pakistani people, and the US has been dedicated to helping the Pakistani people come to a more democratic path, she said.																								Americas top diplomat also emphasised long-term US goals rather than loyalty to the top US ally in counterterrorism efforts since the September 11, 2001, attacks.

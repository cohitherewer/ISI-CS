				 Jemima fears for Imran
 AMIT ROY																								London, Nov. 15: Jemima Khan spoke yesterday in London of her fears for the well-being of her former husband after Imran Khan was reported to have been detained in Pakistan by the security forces. 																								 She implied Imran might face torture in a bid to get her to moderate her opposition to Musharraf.																								Jemima, who is emerging as the face of the protest movement in the UK aimed at trying to get the British government to persuade President Pervez Musharraf to end his state of emergency, free political prisoners and allow press freedom, said: I never usually talk to the press, but I am talking to the press just to keep the focus on what Musharraf is doing in Pakistan.																								Speaking of the possible whereabouts of Imran, she said: The latest information I have got is that they have charged him under the Anti-Terrorism Act, but this hasnt been confirmed.																								She added: He is being held in a police station at the moment and we have been told that he will be moved to the local prison.																								Jemima, who was married to Imran for 10 years and has two sons who live with her but visit their father periodically in Pakistan, said the latest development was indicative of Musharrafs regime.																								 She admitted: I am worried, we are all worried. This is just one more sign that Musharraf has become one of Pakistans most brutal and oppressive dictators ever. Musharraf seems to be so unpredictable and imperious to international pressure. I am worried what he will do next.																								Jemima, who led an anti-Musharraf demonstration at Downing Street last week, said she was currently in talks to stage another protest march as she was keen to keep public attention on the situation in Pakistan.																								 She explained: I want to keep up the pressure and highlight that the people affected by this are from all walks of life.

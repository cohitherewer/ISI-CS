				 Aides: Sharif set for return
			A Nawaz Sharif supporter in Peshawar on Friday. (Reuters)Islamabad, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the man President Pervez Musharraf deposed, is set to return to Pakistan within days, aides said today after a deal to end his exile in Saudi Arabia.																								It was not immediately clear whether Sharif, whom Musharraf deposed in a bloodless 1999 coup, would get back before November 26, the last date for filing election nominations and so be able to run for parliament.																								He was due to meet King Abdullah in Riyadh for a farewell meeting before flying to London, Sharifs political base for the latter part of his exile, a Saudi government source said.																								Musharraf, under intense criticism at home and abroad for imposing emergency rule three weeks ago, had agreed to Sharifs return during discussions with King Abdullah, a leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League said.																								Politically isolated, Musharraf paid a surprise visit to Riyadh on Tuesday, sparking speculation that he was reaching out to his old foe Sharif, who was deported after he tried to return from exile in September, ahead of a January 8 general election.																								God willing, he will return in a few days, said Raja Zafar-ul-Haq, chairman of the Nawaz League as Sharifs faction of the Pakistan Muslim League is known. The party will meet tomorrow to decide his return date. Diplomats say Saudi Arabia was embarrassed by its complicity in Sharifs exile and had wanted the situation resolved.

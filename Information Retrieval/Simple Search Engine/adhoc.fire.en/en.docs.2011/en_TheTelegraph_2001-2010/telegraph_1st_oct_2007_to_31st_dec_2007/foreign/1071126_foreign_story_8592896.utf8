				 Malibu flames lick celebrity homes
																								Malibu, Nov. 25 (Reuters): A wind-whipped wildfire that destroyed 49 homes in the exclusive beachside community of Malibu was partly under control today as firefighters took advantage of a break in the weather to gain the upper hand.																								Officials said the fire, the second in just over a month to strike the seaside enclave hugging the Pacific Ocean, was 40 per cent contained as of today morning and no other homes were in imminent danger.																								The blaze charred 4,720 acres and forced more than 10,000 people to evacuate the community, popular with many of Hollywoods biggest stars. Many evacuees were allowed to return home on today as fire crews determined that their homes were no longer in danger.																								As of today morning, 51 structures had been destroyed including the 49 homes, many of them multimillion-dollar, ranch-style mansions in the canyons of central Malibu.																								Flea, bass player for the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, told the Los Angeles Times that his home had been burned to a crisp.																								Dry, brush-covered mountains descend to the ocean in Malibu, creating a spectacular but precarious place to live. Mansions line the beaches and canyons that snake up into the famously fire-prone hills.																								The blaze started yesterday and spread rapidly, but a quick response by firefighters saved many homes, one fire inspector said. We could have lost a lot more homes than we did, an official said.

				 Guard blow to Gyanendra
																								Kathmandu, Oct. 2 (Reuters): The Nepali government is to withdraw half of the 2,000 soldiers guarding King Gyanendras sprawling palace after his controversial trip to a temple to seek blessings from a living goddess, a minister said today.																								The move came two days after the 60-year-old monarch sought the blessings of the Kumari, who some believe to be a living goddess.																								The government says the king had provoked a political confrontation by undertaking the unauthorised visit to the temple. Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala had already performed the ritual and replaced the monarch at the ceremony. 																								The number of remaining soldiers will also be reduced gradually, peace and reconstruction minister Ram Chandra Poudel said.

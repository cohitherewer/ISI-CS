				 Putin defends Iran
																								Tehran, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin made it clear to Washington today that Moscow would not accept military action against Iran and persuaded other Caspian Sea states to rule out any such strikes from the region.																								In comments aimed at the US during talks in Iran, Putin said: We should not even think of using force in this region. We need to agree that using the territory of one Caspian Sea (state) in the event of aggression against another is impossible, he told the presidents of Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan at a summit of Caspian Sea states.																								Iran is embroiled in a nuclear standoff with western nations which accuse Tehran of seeking atomic weapons, a charge Tehran denies. Washington has refused to rule out the use of force if diplomacy fails to resolve the row.																								His remarks about territory also appeared aimed at Azerbaijan, where the US military has inspected airfields. Russian media have suggested Washington might be trying to negotiate the right to use its military facilities. Baku denies this.

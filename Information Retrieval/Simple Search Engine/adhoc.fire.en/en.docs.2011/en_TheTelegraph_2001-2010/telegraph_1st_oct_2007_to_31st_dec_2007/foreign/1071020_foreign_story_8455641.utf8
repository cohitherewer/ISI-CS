				 Hatred of public life kills marriage 
				 	 A file picture of Sarkozy and his former wife Cecilia																								Paris, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Cecilia Sarkozy says her marriage to French President Nicolas Sarkozy failed just five months after his election triumph because she hated life in the limelight.																								For him its like a violinist, who has been given a Stradivarius, suddenly he has the chance to practise his art, she told LEst Republicain regional daily in a lengthy interview published today. Its not the same thing for me.																								Sarkozys office announced yesterday the couple had ended their 11-year marriage, making Cecilias stint as first lady the shortest in French history.																								We tried everything, I tried everything. But it just wasnt possible anymore... Public life doesnt suit me, she said in her first remarks on record on the split that were noticeably free from any trace of bitterness.																								I am someone who likes to be in the shadows, who likes serenity, tranquillity, she said, unlike her husband.																								Cecilia, who this week posed for a photo spread in the glossy Paris Match magazine, said the couple were just like any other facing difficulties in their marriage. What happened to me has happened to millions of people: one day you no longer have your place in the couple, she said.																								Its no longer the essential thing in your life. It no longer works. The reasons are inexplicable, it happens to lots of people. It happened to us.																								Isabelle Balkany, who lunched with her long-time friend Cecilia on Wednesday, two days after the divorce was signed, told Le Parisien daily that Cecilia had displayed a certain sadness, but also a form of serenity, a relief.																								The couples 10 year-old son will live with his mother under the terms of their amicable divorce, their lawyer told the Le Parisien daily, but Sarkozy will have access whenever he wants.																								The confirmation of their divorce, after months of marital strife grabbed the headlines and knocked a major transport strike off the nations front pages.																								The pair first separated in 2005 and Cecilia moved to New York to be with another man. In 2005, I met someone, I fell in love, I left, she said.																								She returned to her husband the following year in an attempt to heal a rift that had caused Sarkozy to lose weight, snap at staff and appear visibly shaken.																								Some political rivals questioned his ability to govern under strain, such was Cecilias reputation as a calming influence over her hyperactive husband, and analysts have speculated whether his divor-ce could affect presidential policymaking.																								But a CSA poll showed that 92 per cent of French had not changed their opinion of Sarkozy because of the divorce and 79 per cent said it was not an important event in politics.

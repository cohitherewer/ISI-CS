				 Windy veteran gets up club nose 

 MATTHEW MOORE 
																								London, Dec. 7: A retired bus driver who has drunk in the same social club for 20 years has been told to step outside when he breaks wind, because his flatulence is disgusting to other customers.
																								Maurice Fox, 77, was handed a formal letter of warning from his club committee after several complaints from patrons.
																								The widower has agreed to comply with the request but claims he received no verbal warning from staff at Kirkham Street Sports and Social Club in Paignton, Devon, where he is an honorary life member.
																								I do get a bit windy  I am an old ft now, he said.
																								They can be a bit loud at times. If Ive got time and know they are coming I pop into the porch inside the door, he told the South Devon Herald Express newspaper.
																								Fox said that he had tried to calm his flatulence by switching from cider to bitter, but admitted that the six pints of Bass he drinks a day still leave him feeling gassy. He added that his problem causes less of a fuss in the men-only environment of another local club, Palace Place. I can let go when I like at the Palace. Its more relaxed, and so am I, he told the newspaper.
																								The letter of warning, signed by club secretary George Shepherd for and behalf of the committee, read: After several complaints regarding your continual breaking of wind while in the club, would you please consider that your actions are considered disgusting to fellow members and visitors.
																								You sit close to the front door, so would you please go outside when required. So please take heed of this request.

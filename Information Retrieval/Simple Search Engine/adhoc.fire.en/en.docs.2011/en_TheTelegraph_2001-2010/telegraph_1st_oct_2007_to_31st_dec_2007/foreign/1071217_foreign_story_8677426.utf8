				 Celines titanic confession

																								Las Vegas, Dec. 16 (AP): Celine Dion called it a wrap at Caesars Palace, acknow- ledging in her final show that pregnancy and poor early reviews almost sank her titanic five-year engagement.
																								As adoring fans cheered, stood and clapped through yesterday nights performance, Dion interspersed her usual numbers with emotion-filled monologues.
																								At one point, it was like feeling like the Titanic was about to sink again, she said. But we believed and we went on with it. Even though the vibe was not that positive for us.
																								While the show was still in development in 2000, Dion, 39, became pregnant and told husband-manager Rene Angelil she did not want to continue.
																								 But Angelil told her that too much money and too many people were involved.
																								So she pushed on, fighting through initial bad reviews to make it five years of filling a 4,100-seat arena.
																								After her last number, Dion invited husband Angelil and her son, Rene-Charles on stage with her.

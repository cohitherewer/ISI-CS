				 Google lifts shroud on mobile phone plans
																								New York/San Francisco, Nov. 5 (Reuters): Google Inc today lifted the shroud cloaking its long-rumoured plans to enter the mobile phone market, saying it was building software to make the Internet run more easily on cellphones.																								The Internet giant confirmed it was working with 30 companies, including some of the worlds biggest handset makers and wireless service providers, such as US phone makers Motorola Inc and Qualcomm Inc, Taiwans High Tech Computer and German-based carrier T-Mobile.																								Google is looking to expand the range of Internet services it now offers through computer browsers to the far larger mobile phone market, where a range of conflicting handset designs and software standards have hobbled Internet use.																								It will open the mobile phone to do things that people now do on their PCs, said Todd Greenwald, a financial analyst with Nollenberger Capital Partners in San Francisco.																								This approach is going to be far less costly, Greenwald said, contrasting Googles open partnership to proprietary phone industry strategies. It should position Google to be an early leader in the mobile advertising market.																								Google said it would hold a conference laterto discuss the system with speakers from T-Mobile, owned by Deutsche Telekom, Motorola, and Qualcomm. The Mountain View, California-based company has set up an industry consortium it calls the Open Handset Alliance and signed up 30 member companies, it said.

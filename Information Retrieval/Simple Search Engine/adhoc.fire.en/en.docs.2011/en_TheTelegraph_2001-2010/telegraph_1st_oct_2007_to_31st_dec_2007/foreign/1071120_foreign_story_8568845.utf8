				 Huge yawn nearly kills man
																								London, Nov. 19: Trying to keep your mouth closed while yawning is not just good manners  it might save your life.																								Ben Shire, 34, was making a cup of tea to keep himself awake when a massive yawn took hold. Within seconds, the father of three had strained his jaw so much that he dislocated it. He collapsed on the floor, unable to breathe.																								His wife dialled 999 as he lay on the floor choking on his saliva. Paramedics rushed Shire to hospital, with his jaw still locked, where medics resuscitated him using a suction device. It then took doctors four hours to reset his jaw.																								We can laugh about it now, but it wasnt funny at the time, the store worker, from Horsham, Sussex, said.																								I couldnt breathe because I was choking  it felt like two fingers down my throat. The more I panicked, the more I struggled for breath. 																								 Cases of jaws locking open mid-yawn are very rare. Doctors advise people who do experience the problem to bend forward or lie on their side to let gravity ease the pressure.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

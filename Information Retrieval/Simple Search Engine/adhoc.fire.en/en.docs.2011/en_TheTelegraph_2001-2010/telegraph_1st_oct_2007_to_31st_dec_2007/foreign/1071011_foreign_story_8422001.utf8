				 Saran in Nepal to help defuse crisis
 J. HEMANTH 				 	 Saran: Tricky situation																								Kathmandu, Oct. 10: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs special envoy to Nepal Shyam Saran arrived here this afternoon to help resolve the political stalemate which threatens to derail the countrys fragile peace process. 																								The former Indian foreign secretary, who has also served as Indias envoy in Nepal, began his two-day tour by calling on Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, CPN(UML) leader Madhav Nepal and Maoist chief Prachanda. 																								Sources told The Telegraph here that Saran suggested a compromise formula which could help resolve the deadlock created by the Maoist withdrawal from the eight-party government. This eventually led to the postponement of the November 22 Constituent Assembly elections. 																								According to sources, Koirala told Saran that his party, the Nepali Congress, would thwart all Maoist attempts to adopt a resolution on the declaration of a republic at the special session of parliament that starts tomorrow. He also urged New Delhi to support his efforts to resolve the crisis through talks. 																								Madhav Nepal told Saran that his party still favoured the Constituent Assembly elections, which would have addressed all Maoist concerns, including their demand for the abolition of the monarchy. 																								He said both the Maoists and the Nepali Congress were wary of facing the polls after losing political influence in the rural areas. 																								The sources said the compromise formula suggested by Saran would only be considered by the other parties if the Maoists were willing to do the same. No formula can be implemented if the Maoists oppose it, the sources said. Saran will continue to interact with Nepals politicians tomorrow.																								Saran also met Prachanda and, till late this evening, was was hoping to persuade the militant leader to give up his hardline stand and return to mainstream politics. 																								The Maoists are scheduled to table their resolution on the republic in Parliament tomorrow. Their cadre plan to surround the parliament in a bid to increase pressure on lawmakers.

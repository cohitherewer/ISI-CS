 Fine Print				 				 				 																Rich are snobs: Mills																						 Dublin, Nov. 22 (AP): Heather Mills McCartney, who is seeking tens of millions to split from her Beatles legend husband, denounced the worlds rich as insufferable misers and snobs.																																	Mills McCartney made the comment during a speech yesterday to the Trinity College debating society, Dublin, her latest venue to vent myriad opinions since firing her law firm and press officer. I dont think anything can prepare you for being treated worse than a murderer or a paedophile, when all you have done in 17 years is charity work, she said, referring to her campaigns against land mines and in favour of animal rights and vegetarianism.																																	Mills McCartney said she was reluctantly obliged to befriend the worlds wealthy  despite their nasty qualities  because that was the only way to maximise her power as an agent for change. Sadly, you have to mix at a certain level of people to raise the level of funds you need to bring about the greater good, she said. Because people are very snobby. These people who have lots of money, theyre either snobby or theyre stingy.

				 Aid reaches survivors
																								Dhaka, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Nearly a week after a cyclone killed thousands along the Bangladesh coast, relief workers said today they had been able to get food, medicine and other provisions to most of the millions affected.																								A huge relief operation by civil authorities and the army, navy and air force was now running at full speed after roads blocked by trees has been cleared and electricity and communication lines restored, said a relief official.																								(But) there are some inaccessible places, where people were yet to get relief. But officials working in the field have assured that they will reach those places soon, UN resident coordinator Renata Lok Dessallien said after leading a team of donors to some of the worst-hit areas today.																								Cyclone Sidr struck a large area of southern Bangladesh last Thursday with winds of 250kmph and a 5-metre high sea surge, leaving a trail of devastation. Nearly 3,500 people were killed.																								It was the worst disaster in the low-lying country since 1991, when a cyclone and storm surge killed about 143,000 people.																								Army chief General Moeen U. Ahmed said troops were coordinating relief operations to ensure no further deaths in the cyclones aftermath.																								But almost a week after the storm, human and animal corpses were still being recovered from rivers, canals and trampled rice fields, reporters said. Officials said emergency aid was pouring in from all over the the world, with the latest being $250 million offered by the World Bank.

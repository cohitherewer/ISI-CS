				 Moneypenny dies at 80
 NICK SQUIRES																								Sydney, Sept. 30: The actress Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny in 14 James Bond films, has died in Australia aged 80.																								Canadian-born Maxwell (in picture), whose flirtatious but unconsummated relationship with James Bond was a hallmark of the movies, died in Fremantle Hospital in Western Australia late yesterday. 																								She starred alongside Sir Sean Connery in the first Bond film, Dr No, in 1962. 																								She continued playing the role until 1985s A View To A Kill, in which she appeared with Sir Roger Moore. 																								She moved to Australia in 2001 to be with her son and his family, and lived in the Western Australian capital of Perth.					 THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

				 All killed in Dubai mishap were Indians
																								Dubai, Nov. 9 (PTI): All the seven construction workers who were killed when a bridge collapsed in the Marina area of Dubai yesterday were Indians.																								Five of the men who were killed hailed from Tamil Nadu while one was from Bihar and another from Uttar Pradesh.																								Concrete and iron debris was strewn across a wide area near the site of the bridge collapse, the first of its kind in Dubai.																								The police cordoned off the area, blocked the approach roads and diverted traffic as a precautionary measure even as ambulances with wailing sirens rushed the injured to the Rashid Hospital Trauma Centre.																								Eight of the injured will remain in hospital for one or two days while the rest have been discharged, B.S. Mubarak, consul (labour) at the Indian consulate, said.																								The names of those who died are: R. Mohan Lakshmanan, A. Govindam, Mathai Laghan, K. Thangan (all from Tamil Nadu), Surendra Singh (Patna) and P. Jagdish (Lucknow).																								Indian officials, who visited the accident site and the hospital last night, said police have taken all the bodies.																								Dubai chief of police Lt Gen. Dhahi Khalfan Tamim blamed the bridge collapse on the crane driver and poor supervision.																								After inspecting the site, Tamim said: My tentative assumption is that the bridge collapsed because a crane driver had tried to lift a 1.5 tonne load of steel onto the bridge. 																								The load, however, hit against the bridge columns causing it to collapse.																								Mattar al Tayer, chairman of the roads and transport authority, also blamed the accident on the crane operator.																								A crane operator had placed too many steel bars on the bridges top layer, he said .																								A couple of survivors said most of the dead and injured labourers were working on and under the iron scaffolding which suddenly tilted and collapsed, trapping many of them under the rubble. 																								Muthu Raj, one of the survivors, said: I was working on the scaffolding along with several others when it shockingly collapsed, killing one of them instantly.

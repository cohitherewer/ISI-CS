 Senile shield
 Tokyo, Dec. 17 (Reuters): A 100-year-old Japanese man who was arrested after his car hit an umbrella held by a child said driving was his ticket to avoiding senility.
 Driving helps me from going senile because it keeps me alert, police in Sendai, northern Japan, quoted the driver, Masaru Hori, as saying.
 The incident marked the second time Hori had been caught driving without a licence since it was revoked after a hit-and-run accident in August, police said. 
 He was also involved in a similar accident last month, they said.

Bonham Carter, 41, received a Golden Globe nomination last week for her role as a ghoulish baker in Burtons musical adaptation Sweeney Todd. Burton, 49, was also nominated. She revealed in the latest issue of Playboy that she became pregnant midway during the production.

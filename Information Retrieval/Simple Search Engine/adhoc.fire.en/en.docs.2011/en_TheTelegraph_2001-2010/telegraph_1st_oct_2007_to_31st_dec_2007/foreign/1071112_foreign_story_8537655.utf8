				 BBC foxes viewers
 ROYA NIKKHAH																								London, Nov. 11: As the fox shakes water from its fur, the picture seems a stolen glimpse of a wild creature enjoying the elements.																								The reality of this captivating image from the BBCs acclaimed new wildlife series, however, is rather less romantic, the showers caused not by storm clouds but by a man holding a hose pipe over tame animals in a fenced enclosure at a wildlife reserve.																								The images appear in the opening credits of The Nature of Britain, the BBC1 primetime wildlife programme presented by Alan Titchmarsh.																								At the start of the programme, which was watched by 4.8 million viewers, Titchmarsh is filmed looking up to the sky, saying: Do you know what? I think it is going to rain. He then adds: Water  can you imagine anything more pure, more elemental?  there is not a plant or animal on earth that can live without it and when it falls as rain it brings the entire British Isles to life. 																								Titchmarshs voiceover is accompanied by shots of a fox shaking what appears to be rainwater out of its fur.																								But the reality of the images, which were filmed in an enclosure at the British Wildlife Centre in Lingfield, Surrey, is very different.																								Instead, the star turn was an 11-year-old vixen called Honey who had a cub last summer and lives in captivity with two males called Buster and Frodo.																								David Mills, the founder of the centre, last week described what really happened. They (the BBC team) wanted shots of animals in the rain to show what happens and how important water is to them, he said. Unfortunately, it wasnt raining that day and the sun was shining at the time they were filming, so they had to manufacture the rain.																								A BBC spokesperson said: The filming was within the editorial guidelines. This particular sequence is not about the fox but about the importance of rainwater to British wildlife, and the animal was not doing anything it wouldnt have done in the wild.

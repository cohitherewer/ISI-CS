				 Blow for Bush, sweet revenge for Gore
				 	 Remarkable																								Washington, Oct. 12 (Reuters): Call it Al Gores revenge.																								The Nobel Peace Prize he won today was a blow to President George W. Bush and his widely criticised environmental policy and will long be savoured by the man who lost the bitter 2000 presidential election by a whisker.																								The honour was bestowed jointly on the former Vice-President and The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for campaigning against the threat of global warming, in a not-so-subtle swipe at Bush, a latecomer to the battle against climate change. It may also be interpreted as a part of an international backlash not only against seven years of what many see as environmental backsliding under Bush but also against his Iraq war policy and perceived arrogance in world affairs.																								The Nobel Committees recognition of Vice-President Gore shines a bright light on the most inconvenient truth of all  the selection of George Bush as President has endangered the peace and prosperity of the entire planet, said fellow Democrat John Edwards, a 2008 White House contender.																								It was a double snub to the Republican President, marking the second prize to a leading Democratic critic during Bushs administration.																								The 2002 prize went to former President Jimmy Carter, which the Nobel committee head at the time said was a signal of disapproval over Bushs preparations for the invasion of Iraq.																								For Gore  who won the popular vote for President nationwide but lost a crucial Florida vote recount battle and thus the election to Bush  the Nobel Peace Prize brought a measure of vindication.																								After the 2000 election, he remade himself as a tireless environmental campaigner, winning an Oscar in 2007 for his documentary film An Inconvenient Truth. 																								Gore is now being treated like a rock star by Democratic supporters who want him to jump into the 2008 presidential race to claim the office they believe he was unfairly denied.																								The White House praised Gore and the UN panel for winning what many consider the worlds most prestigious honour, but was unaware of plans for Bush to make congratulatory phone calls.																								Asked if Bush saw the prize as a message against his own policies, White House spokesman Tony Fratto insisted: No, I dont see it that way at all. No. Nobel Committee chairman Ole Danbolt Mjoes said the award is never criticism of anyone.

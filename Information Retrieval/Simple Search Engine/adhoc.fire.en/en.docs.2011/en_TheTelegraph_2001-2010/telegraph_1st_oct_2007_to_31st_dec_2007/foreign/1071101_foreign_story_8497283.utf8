				 SC scanner on Benazir blasts 
																								Islamabad, Oct. 31 (PTI): Pakistans chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry today said he would probe the attack on former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos homecoming procession to restore the peoples confidence in the government.																								The move by Chaudhry comes at a time the apex court is hearing petitions against President Pervez Musharrafs candidature in the October 6 presidential poll and the deportation of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Jeddah within hours of his return.																								Chaudhry has been at the centre of a confrontation between the judiciary and Musharraf since the general unsuccessfully tried to sack him.																								More than a week has passed since these bloody explosions occurred. However, no clue has so far been found explaining the reasons and the persons involved, a statement issued by the court said.																								Chaudhry has taken suo motu action in the matter and scheduled the case for hearing tomorrow, the statement said.																								Two blasts hit Bhuttos motorcade in Karachi on October 18 hours after she returned to Pakistan from exile, killing nearly 140 people and injuring hundreds more.																								The attack has implications for political activities in Pakistan and its reverberations are being heard in international quarters, the statement said.																								The suo motu action has been taken to ensure that such a heinous crime does not remain unpunished and perpetrators of this barbaric act are brought to book, which will result in restoring the confidence of the nation in the system of governance, it said.																								Dubai visit																								Benazir will fly to Dubai on Wednesday to see her family, having left them behind when she returned home two weeks ago after eight years of self-imposed exile, Reuters reports from Karachi.

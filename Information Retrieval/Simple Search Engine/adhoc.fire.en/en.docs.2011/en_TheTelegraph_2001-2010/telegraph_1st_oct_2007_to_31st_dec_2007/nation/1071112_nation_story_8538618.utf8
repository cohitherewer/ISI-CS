 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Romance goes on, even at 84				 																																																										Hes charming, hes suave and hes 84. Dev Anand renewed his love affair with the city of Rekha and Hema Malini recently as he took the wraps off Romancing With Life.				 																																																										The ballroom of Taj Connemara, where the biographys city release programme was held, wasnt low on star power but Dev Anands gleam eclipsed them all. 				 																																																										Kamala Selvaraj, Gemini Ganesans daughter and Rekhas sister, and Kamal Hasan were part of the audience.				 																																																										After the actor spoke about his work and his early tough days in Bombay, coinciding with the political churning of the Quit India Movement of 1942, even otherwise bashful fans let out their private fantasies as they spoke animatedly about the darling of their times.				 																																																	I love you Dev Anand, right from my sixth year. But I could not tell you, one lady, her greying hair betraying her age, gushed. Guide Raju lost no time in delivering the repartee: The loss is all mine. The woman, speechless at the witty reciprocation, flushed red. 				 																Radio quiz for managers				 																																																										They might have had their ears cocked to the chartbusters while rushing to office in the morning. Now, the executives are testing their knowledge about music.				 																																																										Corporate executives in Delhi took time off from their work recently to participate in a rare quiz on music, specifically held for them by a prominent FM channel.				 																																																										The event was the first of its kind of national music-based quiz for corporate enthusiasts, according to the organisers. The winners at the Delhi regional final round will now compete with winners from other zones.				 																																																										The final round will be held in Mumbai. Collectors musical instruments, holiday packages to exotic Indian destinations, laptops and luxury fashion and lifestyle accessories are among the array of prizes that are up for grabs.				 																Lifes papers, lost and found				 																																																										Mayuresh Kamble had thrown up his hands in despair after having lost a bag that almost meant his life.				 																																																										But a call from a teenager next morning brought him back to life. The boy told Kamble hed found the bag, which had his passport, PAN card, SSC and HSC certificates, engineering degree and a job offer letter. The engineering graduate had scoured almost every train after having forgotten to pick up the bag when he got off at a station near Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (VT).				 																																																										Minutes after I got off, I realised Id forgotten the bag. We told the railway police about it, checked every possible train we could and then lodged a case, Kamble said.				 																																																										The teenager, Krishna Singh, claimed to have found the bag with all the important documents at a bus stop outside the VT station. Fortunately for Kamble, Singh noticed his mobile number scribbled on one of the papers. But a few books and his sunglasses were missing, possibly taken by the person who found the bag.				 																Colony plans				 																																																										The courts havent cleared Delhis unauthorised colonies but the government appears to have gone ahead with plans that should ideally be started after regularisation.				 																																																										Layout plans have been invited from residents of the 1,539 colonies that are waiting for the courts nod.				 																																																										Residents whod submitted applications for regularisation have been asked to furnish layout plans indicating their needs, an official of the Delhi government said. The plans would have to be approved either by a registered architect or a certified town planner.				 																																																	Delhi: Prawn tortillas, herbed yoghurt dip and guacamole with tortillas soup, sweet potato burrito, cinnamon and lemon chicken Fajita Sizzler and more. A Mexican food festival is on at the All-American Diner at the India Habitat Centre complex. Timings: 11am to midnight.

				 Bereaved brother in safety cry
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 File picture of a BPO employee 																								Mumbai, Nov. 13: A bereaved brother today appealed to employers to ensure that women working night shifts do not have to die like his young sister, who was raped before being bludgeoned with a stone by her company cabbie.																								We understand that no system is foolproof. But there is a need for a system that ensures safety and prevention of such acts, Sumanta Choudhary told reporters in Pune, where his sister Jyoti died on November 1 at the hands of someone she thought she could trust.																								The Wipro call centre employee made the mistake of taking the office pool car though a stranger sat next to the driver, and was raped and killed by the duo.																								The bitter and sad lesson learnt by our loss should open everyones eyes, Sumanta added.																								In Mumbai, women call centre workers, who account for about 40 per cent of the three-and-a-half-lakh-strong BPO work force, have become more alert, though not many think they can depend entirely on their companies for their safety.																								Theres no guarantee that a driver whose background has been checked wont indulge in something like this. I have decided to take matters into my own hands, said 23-year-old Nimisha Tiwari, an employee of a Malad call centre in suburban Mumbai.																								I keep my office numbers on speed dial, carry a can of pepper spray and, above all, dont doze off.																								Tiwari, like many others, did not care much about the security drills her company had introduced. But that was before Jyoti died.																								Now, she makes it a point to check the route chart and see where the cab is going.																								For 22-year-old Rajni Sahay, life as a call centre employee has become harder after Jyotis murder. Her family has asked her to quit her job and return to Gujarat but she has decided to stay put.																								I cannot leave my job. I have decided to be alert all the time and refuse to board the car without calling the operational planning guys at work. Through them, I check the number of the car and other details, said Sahay, who had once complained about a driver trying to be too friendly.																								She hasnt seen the driver since.																								Jennifer Gomes, 25, recalled that days before Jyotis murder, a guy sat next to the driver in the front seat.																								When I asked him if he was an employee of my company, he said he wasnt. I immediately called up the travel desk in office and they sent us another cab in 10 minutes. Thank God, I was careful.

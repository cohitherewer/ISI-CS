				 Bombers escape noose
 M.R. VENKATESH																								Coimbatore, Oct. 31: Weak evidence was one of the key reasons that dissuaded the Coimbatore blasts judge from handing out the death penalty to those convicted of conspiracy.																								Other charges like murder and of creating disharmony among communities were proved beyond reasonable doubt but the lack of substantial evidential links saved the 70 from the gallows.																								Copies of the 1,704-page verdict, compiled in five volumes by judge K. Uthirapathy, were handed last evening to each of those convicted.																								Uthirapathy said the exact nature, class, or nomenclature of the bombs, meant to kill L.K. Advani, hadnt been proved or established. Advani didnt come to the February 14, 1998, meeting but the serial explosions killed 58 people and wounded over 250.																								Even the evidence against al Umma founder S.A. Basha, the prime accused, didnt go beyond the fact that he attended conspiracy meetings. Worse, the evidence wasnt direct.																								The judge examined over 200 charges against the accused but was apparently convinced that capital punishment in this case was unlikely to have a deterrent effect. 																								Forty-three of the total 158 convicted, including Basha, were handed life terms. Eight, including Abdul Nasser Madhani, the leader of the Kerala-based Peoples Democratic Party, were let off. One of the 166 accused died during the trial. Another had turned approver.																								According to Uthirapathy, a variety of circumstances and factors outweighed the legal ingredients for the awarding of death penalty. He said certain sections of the Muslim community had not only lost faith in the state but also in the judicial system after communal clashes in Coimbatore in November-December 1997. 																								Convict dies																								One of the convicts sentenced to life in the case died of a heart attack today. Sabur Rahman, 30, complained of chest pain in jail and was rushed to hospital, where he died.

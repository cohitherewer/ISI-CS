																								Cuttack, Dec. 21: The winter chill could not deter Cuttack citizens from assembling at Killa Maidan to witness the Seventh Barabati Nrutya Utsav-2007, which began last evening. 
																								The seven-day festival, organised by the Odissi Nrutya Mandal, began with an inaugural Mangala Charan performance by Kaori Naka from Japan and Chandana Sekharam from Malaysia, under the directions of Guru Gajendra Panda. The energy-packed performance, with the Barabati Fort in the backdrop, inspired cheers from the packed audience. 
																								Orissa Governor M.C. Bhandare, who inaugurated the festival, hoped that one day, the festival would grow into one of the major shows in India. State tourism minister Debi Prasad Mishra said the festival, with a crafts fair along with it, had charted its own success course in the states map. 
																								The crafts fair was possible thanks to the joint efforts of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission and the state handicraft and cottage industries. The two associations have put up 50 and 10 stalls, respectively, said Guru Ashis Das, secretary of Odissi Nrutya Mandal.
																								In the next seven days dancers and groups from different parts of the world would be performing different forms such as Bharatnatyam, Kathak, Chhau, Bihu and ballet on a single stage, said the show spokesperson Brajkishore Nanda. 
																								Mogul Tamasa, a folk theatre from Bhadrak, has been included for the first time this year, he added.

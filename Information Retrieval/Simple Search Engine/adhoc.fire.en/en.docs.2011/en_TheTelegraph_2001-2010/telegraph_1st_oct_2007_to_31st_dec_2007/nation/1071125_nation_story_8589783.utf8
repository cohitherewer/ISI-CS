 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Clamour rises for childrens budget				 																																																										Three lakh children from across the country have signed a charter asking the Centre to abide by a promise made by the Planning Commission  to set aside 9 per cent of the gross domestic product (national income) for children from the next financial year (2008-09).				 																																																										The charter, which was signed as a part of the Wada na todo campaign launched by NGOs involved in the fields of childrens education and health, was presented to the Planning Commission on Childrens Day. 				 																																																										Abhijeet Sen, the member who oversees finance on the plan panel, accepted the charter from the group of children. 				 																																																										Both Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and finance minister P. Chidambaram have spoken of making provisions for spending 9 per cent of the countrys national income on children in the next budget, which will be presented in February next year.				 																																																										A report, titled Ensuring Universal Access to Health amp; Education in India, on health and education was also released by voluntary organisations on the occasion.				 																Home to clipped wings				 																																																										Migratory birds arent exactly a rarity south of the Vindhyas but feathered guests from Pakistan are quite uncommon.				 																																																										Avian aficionados near Tumkur, 70km from the Garden City, were astonished to spot a new species in the early days of this winter and hurriedly flipped through their books. They were pleasantly surprised that the Barn Swallow, found mostly in the mountainous regions of Pakistan, had winged its way here. 				 																																																										The joke doing the rounds in defence corridors is that since Pakistan does not have satellite launch capabilities, they must have launched the birds across the border. 				 																																																										Another take is that with the emergency imposed in the neighbouring country, the birds may have flown the coup (coop). Whatever the reason, the birds appear to prefer the warm winter here over the political heat back home.				 																Sting squad in lock-up				 																																																										A housing scheme for the poor in Andhra Pradesh appears to have created enough room for corruption  and controversy.				 																																																										Amid allegations that temples and churches were being built by leaders of the ruling Congress with the Indiramma plans resources, two reporters of a vernacular daily were arrested early this month for having carried out a sting to expose the shady dealings.				 																																																										The journalists were charged with forging official documents  a strategy used in the expose  to get cement and iron rods for dummy beneficiaries in a Kurnool village. 				 																																																										Additional director- general of police A.K. Khan said the arrests followed a complaint by a housing department official last month and prima facie evidence of fraud.				 																																																										The action against the reporters, who had mentioned chief minister Y.S.R Reddy, one of his cabinet colleagues and actor Nagarjuna as beneficiaries in the doctored documents, has sparked cries that the media was being muzzled.				 																																																										Khan said there were other ways like courts, rights commissions and other bodies to uncover the problems than resorting to forgery.				 																Dress circle				 																																																										After super scores, it is time for designer uniforms.				 																																																										The Delhi government, buoyed by the impressive board results in its schools, will wrap the students in uniforms designed by the National Institute of Fashion Technology.				 																																																										Education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely said the new dresses will be common to all such schools, helping create a distinct identity for the children. At present, each school has its own uniform.				 																																																	Delhi: This Sunday, Calcuttas Somali Panda takes you through a journey of the world of mysticism through the songs of Rabindranath Tagore. The event, titled Baul Kabi Rabindranath  Myriad Shades of Passion is at India Habitat Centre on Lodhi Road. Time: 7pm. Call 24682001 for details.

				 Bengal beefs up land team
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 1: The Bengal government is strengthening its land acquisition mechanism, realising that direct purchase of plots for industrial projects is not feasible in the state.																								On the radar are the districts of Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia, where the government needs vast tracts for several upcoming projects, including steel plants.																								Land reforms commissioner P.K. Agarwal said his department was trying to fill over 30 vacancies for land acquisition officers at the earliest. Today, we okayed the extension of four officers who were to retire in Bankura.																								The land reforms department is also opening offices in the districts. The Burdwan office will be set up in Asansol and the Purulia one in Raghunathpur, Agarwal said.																								Coal blocks appeal																								Bengal commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen today met Union coal minister Dasari Narayan Rao and requested him to grant 20 coal blocks to the state.																								Officials said Rao promised to look into the matter.																								The state government had earlier written to the Centre seeking 20 coal blocks to be allotted to steel plants coming up in Bengal. The steel investors need the coal to fire up captive power plants.

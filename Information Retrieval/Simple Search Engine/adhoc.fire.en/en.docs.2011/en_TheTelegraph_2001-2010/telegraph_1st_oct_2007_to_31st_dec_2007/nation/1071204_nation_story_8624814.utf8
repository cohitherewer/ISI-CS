				 Money motive in Mahajan murder
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Dec. 3: The prosecution in the Pramod Mahajan murder trial today said Praveen Mahajan shot his brother after being refused money for a transport business.																								In his final arguments, special public prosecutor Niteen Pradhan said the accused had been trying to persuade Pramod to lend him the money for nearly two years before he allegedly fired at him on April 22, 2006. 																								He (Praveen) had been making the demands (for cash) since 2004. The threatening SMS was the last blow.																								According to the prosecution, Praveen shot the BJP general secretary as he had refused him Rs 1 crore. The threat messages were sent on April 15, a week before the shooting.																								The defence has contended that Praveen never sent the message and that it was fabricated. Praveens wife Sarangi testified that she sent the message to Pramod asking to meet him, and claimed its content had been modified to make it sound like a veiled threat.

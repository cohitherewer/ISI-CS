				 Campaign ends in peace

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
																								Patna, Dec. 27: The campaign in Bihars Bikramganj constituency ended today as the government deployed some 50 companies of paramilitary forces to conduct the polls, due on December 29. 
																								Over 13 lakh voters exercised their right to franchise on this sprawling seat spread over in six Assembly segments on December 29. There will be tight security as and all polling stations would be manned by armed forces, said Bihar director-general of police (DGP), A.R. Sinha said.
																								For now the fate of 12 candidates hang in balance. 
																								Both the railway minister and Bihar chief minister used weapons at their command to woo voters in favour of their party candidate in the past weeks feverish campaign. The JD(U) promoted Meena Singh, the wife of former MP from the seat, Ajit Singh, who is pitted against RJDs Ashok Kushwaha. The battle has boiled down to a straight contest between the two nominees. Nitish Kunmar during the last leg of campaign addressed a series of meetings in the constituencys remote areas reminding all those who heard the roads, schools and hospitals and projects his government had built up during its two years. 
																								On the other hand, Lalu Prasad who has been camping in Bikramganj ever since December 18 addressed hundreds of meetings and road shows. The third peg of Bihars political triumvirate, Union chemical and fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan kept himself away from the war zone letting Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar battle it out among themselves.
																								Though leader and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati campaigned here in favour of her candidate Baliram Mishra, she failed to make much of an impact. While strong crowds greeted Lalu and Nitish, Mayavatis campaign was lacklustre. Seems when it comes to Bihar she has a long way to go.

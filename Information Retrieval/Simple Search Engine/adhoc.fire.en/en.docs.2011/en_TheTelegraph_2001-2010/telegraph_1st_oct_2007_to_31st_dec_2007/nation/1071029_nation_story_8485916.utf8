				 Hint of BJP support for nuclear deal
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Rajnath: Softening stand?																								New Delhi, Oct. 28: The BJP could be slowly softening in favour of the Indo-US nuclear deal, and possibly creating conditions for a coalition of the willing.																								In an interview with the Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar today, Rajnath Singh said the BJP could even support the government on the deal if his partys concerns were addressed.																								Rajnaths comments assume importance in the wake of David Mulfords meeting with L.K. Advani last week when the US ambassador to India is believed to have persuaded the former BJP chief to reconsider his partys open antagonism to the pact.																								Mulford also told Advani that it was the BJP which started work on the deal when it was in power and was now needlessly allowing the Left to sabotage the centrepiece of Indo-US relationship. It is your deal, too, Mulford had told Advani. 																								Now Rajnath has gone public with the partys slow shift in position. 																								On the face of it, the BJP is furious with both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi for insulting the BJP publicly time and again. How can we ever work together with the Congress, especially on such an important matter? a BJP source asked.																								However, Rajnaths admission that the BJP could be willing to change its position, albeit with some conditions, is more likely a result of several factors, including the more obvious one of US pressure. Both at home and abroad, the BJPs key constituency is pro-US, and this segment does not want to upset America.																								One BJP analyst even felt that the party could support the Congress in sending the deal to the International Atomic Energy Agency, bypassing the Left and keeping its core pro-US relationship intact.																								But, for that to happen, the BJP analyst said, the Congress would have to open serious negotiations with the BJP leadership, and it was still a moot question whether Sonia was willing to do that. 																								Rajnath also told Dainik Bhaskar that the BJP would allow a debate on the nuclear deal in the coming winter session of Parliament. 																								Asked if the party would insist that the debate be held under a rule that calls for a vote  as it had done in the monsoon session  Rajnath said: If the government addresses the partys concerns, we dont need to hold the debate under Rule 184. 																								The BJPs core concern about the deal is that it imposes a huge price on any future decision by India to conduct a nuclear test. 																								Advani, who was in Lucknow today, said the UPA government should protect the countrys sovereignty and, if need be, conduct a Pokhran III.

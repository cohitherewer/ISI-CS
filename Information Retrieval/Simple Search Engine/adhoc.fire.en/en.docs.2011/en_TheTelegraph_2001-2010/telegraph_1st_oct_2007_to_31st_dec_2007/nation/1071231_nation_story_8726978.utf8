				 Teens gift to farmers: multipurpose mobile

																								Pondicherry, Dec. 30: A Maharashtra farmer can now switch on the electric pump in his field while sipping tea in  say  a railway station in Bengal.
																								If you are thinking someones trying to pull a fast one, ask Shamika Vikas Surve.
																								Shamika and Ashish Lahim, her classmate in a school in Maharashtras Ratnagiri district, have come out with a Farmers Multipurpose Mobile, a device they say would help Indian farmers regulate farm activities from a distance.
																								All that a farmer has to do is keep a mobile phone and a sensor box close to the starter box of the water pump, Shamika said.
																								Once a call goes through to the mobile kept in the farm, electrical impulses generated in it are fed into the sensor box. The impulses activate a relay circuit and gives the caller options like switch on or switch off the pump or the light in the poultry unit by asking the farmer to press the corresponding number against each function.
																								If the farmer, say, presses 1 to switch on the heavy water pump to irrigate his field, the instruction is remotely carried out and the farmer can actually confirm by listening to the sound of the pump at his personal cellphone end, Shamika, who demonstrated how the device works, said.
																								This principle could be extended to other farm-related activities as well, like switching on an alarm or turning on a sound-generating device to scare away birds, she explained. That is why we call it a Farmers Multipurpose Mobile, she said of their invention, a huge draw at the just concluded 34th Jawaharlal Nehru National Science Exhibition here.
																								I hit upon this while doing experiments in our school lab, Shamika said and thanked her physics teacher Sanjay Patil for the encouragement. 
																								While a farmer near their village school has already started using this model, Shamika said Konkan Railway recently installed a unit at Vaibhawadi station for regulating water supply from a nearby highrise tank.
																								In all, 317 students from across India displayed 161 exhibits at this years show.

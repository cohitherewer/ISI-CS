				 Jaya faces intent roadblock in SC
 SAMANWAYA ROUTRAYNew Delhi, Oct. 1: The ADMK will have a difficult job making the contempt charge stick against the Karunanidhi government because it must prove the state administrations intent to bypass yesterdays Supreme Court order, legal experts say.																								The apex court had restrained the DMK-led ruling alliance from going ahead with todays Tamil Nadu bandh, but streets were deserted across most of the state and shops, schools and colleges were closed.																								DMK lawyers may, however, cite that the alliance had publicly called off the bandh last evening and argue that people had stayed indoors of their own will. Usually, when a powerful political group makes it clear it wants a bandh, citizens are wary of angering it by stepping out of home.																								Jayalalithaas party must prove there was intentional interference with the court order, Constitution expert Rajeev Dhavan said.																								Intent cannot be easily established. The mere fact of people keeping off the streets because of fear cant prove intent.																								Reports from Tamil Nadu, however, said the government didnt run its buses in the morning and brought out a token few in the afternoon despite a court order to ensure normal public transport.																								Dhavan accepted that the ADMK could get its workers to file affidavits in the court saying the shutdown was not voluntary, but added that the judges would have to look at such evidence sceptically.																								The apex court fumed at the Karunanidhi government this morning when told about the situation in the state by the Opposition ADMK.																								If the government did not obey its order, the two-judge bench said in an observation, the court would direct the Centre to impose Presidents rule.																								Legal experts said such observations, unlike judicial orders, lack legal teeth. I dont take cognisance of oral observations, former law minister and senior lawyer Shanti Bhushan said.																								Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi echoed him: Responsible parties need not react to oral observations. The matter is sub judice and we await final orders.																								He added: However, the Congress believes in all democratic forms of dissent provided they are not illegal and within the parameters of the Constitution.																								Dhavan said there is nothing wrong with voluntary protests. The fundamental right to free speech includes the right to protest on the streets and cannot be taken away.																								He, however, added that some constraint  limited to a place and period of time  can be placed on the right.																								The original, decade-old Kerala High Court ban on bandhs was dictated by Cochins layout, he said. Cochin had one arterial road and if someone blocked it, the whole town came to a halt.																								Bhushan said a contempt case would be made out if the ADMK can provide direct evidence that one or more of the DMK-led alliance leaders had persisted with their bandh plans. Wait till the ADMK files its application.

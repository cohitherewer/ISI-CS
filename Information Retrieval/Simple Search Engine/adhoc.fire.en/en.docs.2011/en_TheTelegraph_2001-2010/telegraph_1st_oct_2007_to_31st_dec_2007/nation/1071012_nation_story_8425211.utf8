				 Cambridge dons fight call girl fire 
 AMIT ROY 																								London, Oct. 11: Dons at Cambridge have expressed concern at a report in the student newspaper Varsity that some women undergraduates have been forced to moonlight as call girls to meet mounting financial debts. 																								The authorities have suggested that Varsity might have highlighted an isolated case and insist that prostitution is not a common occurrence. 																								Certainly, dons have been dismayed by the wide circulation given to the allegations made by Varsity in newspapers across the world (including The Telegraph). 																								They are also attempting to discourage students from writing essays for others for financial gain. 																								Speaking for Cambridge, which was named Britains top university recently, Dr Rob Wallach, secretary of the Senior Tutors Committee, has responded to the Varsity report on alleged prostitution and essay writing for money. 																								He said: There is no reason why students should find themselves in such severe financial difficulty that they would have to resort to prostitution. However the university and colleges are aware that students can find themselves in financial difficulty and give support where they can. 																								He emphasised: There is a range of support mechanisms, including hardship fund allowances and, as in all UK universities, a bursary scheme for students from lower income families, which has just been extended substantially by the university. 																								He added: We have no way of knowing whether various aspects of the article in Varsity are, in fact, true. The claim that hundreds of students are involved is highly unlikely and the result of pure speculation. 																								Rather this is an isolated and unfortunate case. We are most concerned by the report and college senior tutors would do everything they could to give support to students well before any found themselves in such a situation. 																								Commenting on allegations that Cambridge students are making money by acting almost as academic mercenaries, he said: Oxbridge Essays claim that students pay hundreds of pounds for model answers, which they then do not submit as their own work. We think that claim, along with similar claims made by other essay websites, is very surprising and would question its accuracy.

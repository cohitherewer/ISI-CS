				 Blast plot in place before J amp;K train
 MUZAFFAR RAINA 																								Beerwah (Budgam), Oct. 6: The train to Kashmir will not start until next year but plans to blow up the tracks it will travel on appear to be already in place. 																								The army has found diaries on nine militants killed in Baramulla this week containing detailed plans to destroy railway tracks and bridges. 																								One entry, written in chaste Urdu, says: The explosive should be planted 20 minutes before the train reaches the spot to ensure the blast takes place at an appropriate time.																								The track from Udhampur in Jammu to Qazigund in the Valley is part of a Rs 11,000-crore railway project that will link Kashmir with the rest of India by rail. Initially scheduled to start this year, the train service will now begin next year. The tracks will pass through difficult terrain in the Pir Panjal mountains. 																								Maps and diagrams of unspecified tracks and bridges to be blown up were found in the militants diaries, seized after the 38-hour encounter ended on Wednesday. Two majors were killed in the encounter at Tangmarg that the security forces describe as the fiercest this year.																								Defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel A.K. Mathur said the militants appear to have planned a long innings here as the snow in the coming winter would bring down the infiltration. Their design was to blast tracks as the train to Kashmir will chug soon, Mathur said.

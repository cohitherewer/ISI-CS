				 CPM decision this week
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 25: The CPM, caught between the compulsion to save the partys secular face and address minority concerns, has yet to make up its mind on Taslima Nasreen. 																								Shyamal Chakraborty, the CPM state secretariat member who now officiates as party spokesperson, today said: The party is yet to take a stand. We will decide at the state secretariat meeting on November 29. Till then, the corrected statement that Bimanda had issued would reflect the partys opinion.																								Chakraborty was referring to state party secretary Biman Boses statement that the Centre should decide whether the Bangladeshi authors visa would be extended. 																								Bose had said on Wednesday night that Taslima should leave if her presence caused disturbance in the city but backtracked later and lobbed the ball to the Centres court.																								Party leaders such as Benoy Konar and Shyamali Gupta had said they were not averse to Taslimas return and sports minister Subhas Chakraborty offered her shelter at his home. 																								But Shyamal Chakraborty said they did not air the partys view. Whatever our other leaders have said are their personal opinion.																								Mohammad Salim, a CPM Lok Sabha MP, denied the charge that the party had capitulated to fundamentalists but came close to conceding the police might have approached Taslima.																								Neither the party nor the government had bundled Taslima out of the city nor have we surrendered to anybody. If the police had told her to leave the city on Thursday, it was because of the threat perception after the violence, he said.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has not yet made any statement on the issue.																								But minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar said: We always stand for secularism and the right to expression. But does that mean you have the right to hurt the sentiments of millions of faithful in any community and abuse religious leaders? 																								In what looked like a balancing act, the police had yesterday arrested Idris Ali, the expelled Congress leader and one of the sponsors of Wednesdays protest that led to riots. The party is not ready to risk further violence that may erupt if she comes back, a CPM leader said. 																								Other party leaders said the party would not like the writer to come back at least till the situation normalises. 																								Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and Salim were among the CPM leaders who joined peace rallies today in Wednesdays trouble zones.

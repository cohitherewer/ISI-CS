 OUR BUREAU				 	 Mayavati: Trading blame																								Lucknow/New Delhi, Dec. 3: Mayavati and Rahul Gandhi have traded charges on Uttar Pradeshs power situation and the plight of Agra shoemakers in the past two days, taking the strained Congress-Bahujan Samaj Party ties several notches further down.																								In Amethi yesterday, Rahul had said that lack of electricity was hobbling growth in his constituency and asserted that it was the states responsibility to ensure power supply.																								The state cabinet, which discussed Rahuls remark, blamed the power mess on the Centres alleged reluctance to help.																								Cabinet secretary Shashank Shekhar Singh said that despite the Centres attitude, the state had been providing power round the clock to the Jagdishpur industrial area in Amethi and Rae Bareli town. The two constituencies rural areas receive electricity for 14 hours a day, he added.																								But Rahul had by then landed a second blow, suggesting the chief minister was being unfair to some of her own Dalit voters.																								He wrote a letter to Mayavati opposing the proposed value-added tax on hand-made Agra leather shoes. As you know, among the three lakh artisans most of them are from the Scheduled Castes, he said.																								There would be a difference of around 8.5 per cent in the cost of the shoes made in Agra and those in other states. In the neighbouring states, for hand-made shoes of this kind, the tax imposed is only four per cent.																								Rahul added that the proposed tax would lead to ruination of the Agra shoe industry.																								In Lucknow, cabinet secretary Singh accused the Centre of forcing the state to buy power from the central grid at a higher price.																								Although the NTPC (National Thermal Power Corporation) has fixed a quota of 4,200MW (for the state), only 3,000MW is available from the corporation, he said. Of the eight mega power projects being set up in various states, not even one has come to Uttar Pradesh.																								Mayavati seems to be losing patience over the pressure being mounted on her by the Congress. She attacked the Centre after the governor publicly criticised her governments failure to bust militant sleeper cells following the court blasts in three Uttar Pradesh cities.																								The chief minister blamed the Centres failure to check infiltration and to provide intelligence on possible militant strikes.

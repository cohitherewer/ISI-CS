				 Haj fatwa splits clerics
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, Nov. 4: The Dar-ul Uloom fatwa banning ostentatious ceremonies for Haj pilgrims has evoked mixed reactions from scholars and clerics.																								It is against the Shariat and unIslamic to organise big community dinners and lunches on the occasion of the departure and arrival of Haj pilgrims, the Islamic seminary in Deoband, near Muzaffarnagar, said in its Friday edict.																								Issued by the seminarys fatwa department comprising Habibur Rehman and Mehmood, the diktat said the events had remained unchallenged by ordinary Muslims but were unlawful and unIslamic. The fatwa urged Muslims to keep the pilgrimage, which begins this year on December 18, a simple and low-key affair.																								The objective behind clamping the curbs was to keep politics out of the pilgrimage, which often begins with lavish dinners and lunches organised by politicians. The pilgrims are generally put up at Haj houses, which are temporary lodging facilities set up near airports.																								Zafaryab Gilani, the convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee and a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said the fatwa didnt seek to impose a ban but only tried to remind ordinary Muslims that irritatingly grand shows should be discarded. 																								Simplicity is the hallmark of Islam. All programmes are meant to be free of extravagance. So should the farewell programme for Haj pilgrims, he said. Gilani echoed the seminarys view that politicians tried to exploit the pilgrims by hosting grand receptions. 																								Many clerics felt ministers and leaders took extraordinary care of the pilgrims to extract political mileage.																								A majority of Sunni scholars believed that the state of Ihram (ritual of sacredness and austerity) during Haj required pilgrims to stay away from any form of pomposity.																								Although ordinary Muslims saw nothing wrong in the custom, some social workers of the community wondered if the shows of generosity were just and proper in a religion that frowned on pomp and show.																								One of them, Mohammad Siddique, wrote to the seminary last week, sending a list of questions and seeking a fatwa. The curbs were clamped within days of his letter.																								A teacher at the Lucknow seminary backed the curbs, saying there was no room for the lavish ceremonies. Male pilgrims wear only two white sheets of cotton so that all, rich or poor, look alike. Women are advised to wear simple clothes and avoid cosmetics. Pilgrims are urged to abstain from sexual relations. In all this, there is no place for sumptuous food and grand programmes.																								But some questioned the curbs. Shia educationist and social reformer A.S. Asghar said the receptions couldnt be called unIslamic. Where in the Quran has it been written that Haj receptions are illegal? Instead, it is the order of Allah to honour those who undertake the journey to Mecca. 																								He pointed out that since all Muslims could not make the holy trip, those who organised the reception and farewell ceremonies could become part of the pilgrimage.

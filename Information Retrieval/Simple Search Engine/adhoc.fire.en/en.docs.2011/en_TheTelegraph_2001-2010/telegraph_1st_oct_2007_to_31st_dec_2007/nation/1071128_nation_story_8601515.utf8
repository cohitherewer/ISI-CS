				 Bye bye Yerwada, hello Mumbai
 Back with Rs 507 in kitty ANANYA SENGUPTA				 	 Sanjay Dutt: Promoted																								Mumbai, Nov. 27: Sanjay Dutt will go back home with a promotion.																								The actor is now a semi-skilled worker in Punes Yerwada jail, an upgrade some prison inmates take years to achieve.																								The status boost in jail, where Sanjay helped make cane chairs, has come with a pay hike, too. He is now paid Rs 17.50 for each day of work, an increase of Rs 4.75 over the Rs 12.75 that was credited to his account earlier.																								For his eight hours of work each day since October 22, when he walked into the prison the second time, the actor has six chairs to show. He made four chairs during his 24-day stay in August.																								The actor will leave Yerwada with Rs 507.50, more than twice the Rs 204.50 he pocketed during his previous stint. This time, he spent 35 days and worked on 29. Sundays and Diwali were off days. The final sum will be more depending on when he is released. 																								The promotion depends on the skill levels of inmates. If a convict is already trained in making cane chairs or in handling electrical appliances, he will be promoted quicker. Much depends on the jailor, too. One might be skilled, but he would get the pay of an unskilled worker if his behaviour isnt up to the mark. Sanjay would have just helped, but he must have got high ratings for his behaviour, said Asim Sarode, a lawyer and social worker who works with the Yerwada inmates.																								Outside the jail, too, the actor has quite a bit to wrap up. Among the first few things he will do is promote Dus Kahaniyan, a multi-starrer that releases on December 7. 																								Once he settles down, he will have to start shooting for EMI (Easy Monthly Instalments), a Suniel Shetty production. 																								Taking top priority will be Sanjay Dutt Productions Private Limited, a production house that girlfriend Maanyata is managing now. The first movie under the banner, probably starring Sanjay, will be announced soon. 																								At his Pali Hill (Bandra) residence today, fans gathered after news of his bail was flashed on television. 																								We havent planned anything for his arrival. We are just happy that he is back. He will return home, and return to the things that we usually take for granted. He will have a hot meal and sleep in his own bed after so long, said sister Priya, adding the actor would surely walk to Siddhivinayak temple to thank the lord for his release.

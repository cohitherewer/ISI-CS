 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Cop versus cop over street fury				 																																																										A commando recently realised what the anti-terrorist squad really stood for  terror on streets.				 																																																										Dnyaneshwar Pawar was abused, assaulted and hauled to a police station because he had stopped his bike to answer a call.				 																																																										The assailant was ATS officer Arun Khanvilkar, whose Sumo jerked to a halt behind a row of vehicles that also had to slam their brakes as Pawars bike stopped abruptly.				 																																																										Khanvilkar asked Pawar why he had stopped the way he did and demanded his licence and papers.				 																																																										The commando showed his identity card, too, but this only ended up provoking the officer into beating and abusing Pawar.				 																																																										As a scared Pawar tried to slip away, Khanvilkar gave him a chase, bundled him into his vehicle and took him to Bhoiwada police post where he was abused again before colleagues.				 																																																										Pawar later went to a hospital and, armed with the medical reports, lodged a case against Khanvilkar, who faces a probe and a possible sack order.				 																Balancing away to records				 																																																										Boys his age practise whacking balls with the willow when they smell a vacant slot in their college team, but Nischal Netranandan prefers to balance bats on his nose, instead.				 																																																										The 16-year-old has perfected the art of balancing bats on the tip of his nose. And he can persist with it for five to seven minutes. In fact, he is eyeing a slot in the Guinness World Records.				 																																																										Nischal balances the 1.25-kg bat with the agility of an acrobat. His mother Latha says fondly that her son has been balancing sticks and other long objects on his nose, hands, feet and head since he was a kid.				 																																																										He switched to bats after his teacher suggested he had a better chance of getting into the record books if he took to the willow. 				 																Flutter over temple visit				 																																																										Posters and banners about the inauguration of an all-gold Madurai temple chariot by M. Karunanidhi and M.K. Azhagiri created a flutter in a section of the DMK and its allies.				 																																																										The chief minister and his elder son attended the programme at the Muruga temple in Thiruparankundram recently. The event was inaugurated by Azhagiris wife Kanthi. 				 																																																										But what made some in their party uneasy was that the father-son duo posed next to a picture of Muruga in the posters and billboards that sprouted across the town.				 																																																										Leaders of Dravidian parties, such as the DMK, have long been known to swear by social reformer Periyars atheism.				 																																																										The temple visit left many wondering whether the DMK was in the throes of a glasnost. 				 																																																										The incident also revived memories of the controversy that broke out in the Bengal CPM when minister Subhas Chakraborty offered flowers at a Kali temple last year.				 																Lions for eyes				 																																																										Indias efforts to combat blindness is set to receive a major boost following a Lions meeting in the capital. 				 																																																										The board of directors of the Lions Club International recently approved Rs 8.4 crore for humanitarian projects, including Rs 7.8 crore earmarked for sight-related projects. 				 																																																										The funds will help expand eye hospitals and training centres, pay for up to two million cataract surgeries and expand control activities for trachoma, diabetic retinopathy and other sight-threatening illnesses. 				 																																																										There are about 45 million visually handicapped people in India. 				 																																																	mumbai: This Tuesday, watch Ekjutes Court Martial, a play that crosses the barriers of country and time to symbolise the war between justice, and injustice that is rampant all over the world.

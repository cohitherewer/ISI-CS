				 Buddha awaits ceiling report
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 29: Bengal urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya today said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would take the final decision on lifting the urban land ceiling after getting the report of a committee set up to look into the pros and cons of such a move.																								The committee hasnt yet submitted the report. We will make a detailed study of the report and place our views before the chief minister, Bhattacharya said.																								The panel was set up early this year.																								Almost a year ago, the chief minister had said at Writers Buildings that he was not in favour of scrapping the 7.5-cottah ceiling as it would prompt promoters to grab land at will. 																								Asked if there was any possibility of offering relaxations instead of total withdrawal of the ceiling, Bhattacharya said: We cant say that immediately. Lets see what the report says.																								According to the urban development minister, the Centre had said that the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission funds would not be given to the state government if it failed to lift the land ceiling. But we signed a memorandum of agreement with the Centre saying we would consider lifting the urban land ceiling in the seventh year of the first receipt of the funds. So we have time till 2012, he said.																								Asked if the Centre might ask the state to return the money given in these seven years, the minister said: Why should that question arise? We are going by the agreement, which doesnt have this provision. 																								Calcutta mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said a refusal to withdraw the ceiling could dry up the loans from international agencies to Calcutta Municipal Corporation as they all come through the Centre.

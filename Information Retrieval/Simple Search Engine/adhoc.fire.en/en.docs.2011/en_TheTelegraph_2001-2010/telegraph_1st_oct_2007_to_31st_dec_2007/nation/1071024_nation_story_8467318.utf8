				 BJP attacks sad Singh 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Oct. 23: The BJP today wondered whether a sad and helpless Prime Minister could lead India.																								The party, which had accused Manmohan Singh of a flip-flop on the nuclear deal, felt the words of anguish reportedly expressed during yesterdays meeting with UPA allies had created a grim situation for the country.																								BJP leaders have been cued in to signals from the Prime Ministers Office that they have read as indicating that Manmohan was feeling incapacitated. 																								The reality thrown up by the sad and helpless Prime Minister is a cause for national worry. Can a sad and helpless Prime Minister lead India? India is a growing, youthful and a resurgent nation. It needs an enthusiastic leader, who is decisive, who can take decisions and implement them, BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said in a statement.																								So far, the BJP had attacked Manmohan but stopped short of asking for his resignation. Asked a few days ago if he wanted the Prime Minister to quit, party chief Rajnath Singh had said: We wont commit such a mistake. 																								The statement suggested that Manmohans continuance would help the BJP. Now, with the Prime Minister himself showing signs of helplessness, the party has changed tack.																								The nation needs to reflect on the question: can a sad man lead a resurgent nation? Neither the Prime Minister nor his office is doing the nation a favour by projecting the Prime Minister as a helpless leader, Jaitley said.																								For the BJP, the Prime Ministers authority was always in doubt but now the party will try to project him as a man who does not enjoy the confidence of his party, the cabinet, his coalition (the UPA) and the nation. 																								Yesterday, the nation witnessed the pathetic spectacle of the Prime Ministers Office informing the media that the Prime Minister was embarrassed and pained about the fiasco over the nuclear deal. The Congress party later informed the nation that the Prime Minister wasnt resigning the UPA government is paralysed by its internal contradictions, Jaitley said.																								He added that the Prime Ministers words earlier this month that one has to live with disappointments sounded like a condolence message.

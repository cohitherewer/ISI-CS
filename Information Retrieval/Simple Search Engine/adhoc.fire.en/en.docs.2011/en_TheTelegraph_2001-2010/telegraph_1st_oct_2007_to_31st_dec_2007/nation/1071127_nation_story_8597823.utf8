				 Cop watch on wannabes
 							 - Moon kin killings turn glare on Mumbai strugglers ANANYA SENGUPTA 				 				 Moon Das and (right) with Avinash 																								Mumbai, Nov. 26: For every dream shattered, there is a gun.																								Mumbai police, worried about the ease with which frustrated glamour-world aspirants are pulling the trigger, have stepped up vigil on this group, referred to as strugglers.																								With an estimated six lakh of these young men and women trying to make it big in Mumbai, the failures are many  and so are the incidents of shooting.																								Last weeks murders of Moon Dass mother and uncle by her jilted boyfriend Avinash Bhupen Patnaik, who later killed himself, is not being seen as a one-off occurrence.																								The police in Andheris Oshiwara, where the Thursday night murders took place, are looking for arms in Lokhandwala, Adarsh Nagar and Millat Nagar, areas where many strugglers put up in small, one-room flats.																								We are stepping up our vigil. There are some aspirants that we suspect possess illegal arms and we are keeping a close watch on them, said Oshiwara police stations senior inspector Kiran Sonone.																								Before the attack on Moons family, TV actress Sanjana Srivastava was gunned down by her struggler boyfriend in March last year after an argument over a loan she had given him. 																								In May this year, Manish Thakur shot dead TCS engineer and Jharkhand girl Koushambi Layek after she apparently broke up with the married naval officer. That murder, though not linked with the glamour world, had also taken place in an Andheri hotel.																								The revolvers used in these kinds of shootings can be procured from Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. But they can be found here, too. Most of these weapons, which have a Made in China tag, are made locally. They are easily available for Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000, said Bharat Kamble, Sonones junior colleague at Oshiwara police station. 																								Police sources spoke of suppliers in Kandivilis Malvani, Sakinaka (Andheri east), and Nalasopara, Nagpada, Dongari, Mumbra and Taloja in nearby Thane. Some of the dealers cater to the underworld.																								In these places, a desi katta (countrymade one-round pistol) can be bought for Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,200. Those that fire five to seven rounds cost Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000.																								Investigators are probing how Avinash and Manish managed to get the guns into the city undetected. Avinash had driven all the way from Orissa to Mumbai with the loaded gun. 																								Manish, too, was believed to have brought the weapon from outside.																								Psychologists said the dash for guns was possibly fuelled by a lifestyle that the aspirants find hard to support in the absence of big success. Some of them share apartments with five to six mates to pay rent of up to Rs 10,000.																								The pressure to make ends meet showed up in the case of Shikeb Khan, another struggler who was arrested with counterfeit cash of Rs 91,000 and five choppers on November 20. 																								Earlier this year, Jahnavi Kapoor, another doomed wannabe, slashed her wrists during Abhishek Bachchans wedding claiming he had jilted her.

				 Naveen seeks Centre push

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 
																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 20: Chief minister Naveen Pattnaik today urged the Centre to evolve a holistic action plan and implement a composite socio-economic package for the Maoist-affected areas. 
																								Addressing the conference of chief ministers on internal security, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at New Delhi this afternoon, he suggested a two-pronged approach to put an end to the spread of Left-wing extremism. 
																								While there is a need to relax existing ongoing schemes, it is necessary to create a special fund for direct and immediate intervention to fill up the critical gaps, he said. 
																								Naveen further suggested a comprehensive dialogue on the developmental issues related to the Naxalite-hit areas so that its spread is checked. 
																								The chief minister demanded five more India Reserve Battalions for Orissa, a special grant of Rs 30 crore for the Training Resource Centre (TRC) of special operations group, coming up near Bhubaneswar. The TRC is being developed as a permanent centre to counter terrorism, jungle warfare and anti-extremist operations. 
																								Naveen urged the Centre to assist Orissa in terms of manpower and financial resources to strengthen its internal security system.
																								Specifically, he asked the Centre to enhance the size of Police Modernization Scheme for Orissa from Rs 26.5 crore to Rs 60 crore. Naveen also sought central assistance for upgrading the remaining 58 police stations located in the Maoist-affected areas and the sanction of another coastal police station for Puri and two more CRPF battalions in the state.
																								Naveen stressed on increasing the Centres support for the proposed Vijayawada-Ranchi highway to improve the communication in 14 extremism-hit districts in Orissa. He further asked for Rs 15 crore under the police modernisation scheme, to facilitate the police commissionerate system in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.

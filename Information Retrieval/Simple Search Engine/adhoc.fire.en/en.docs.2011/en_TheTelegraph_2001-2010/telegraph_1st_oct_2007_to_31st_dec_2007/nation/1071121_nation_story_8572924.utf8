				 Balancing act on dictators
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Musharraf, Sein				 																								Singapore, Nov. 20: In his first bilateral engagement on arriving in this city state this evening, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met his Myanmarese counterpart General Thein Sein and gently nudged him to carry forward the process of national reconciliation but refrained from saying anything that could be construed as criticism of the military junta.																								Indias relatively soft stance, arising out of strategic concerns, towards dictatorships on both sides of the border was evident from the Prime Ministers answers to reporters en route to Singapore earlier in the day.																								Asked about the developments in Pakistan following General Pervez Musharrafs emergency, the Prime Minister said: Well, I dont like to comment on the internal affairs of Pakistan. I have said on more than one occasion that the destinies of our two countries are interlinked. A prosperous, stable, peaceful and democratic Pakistan is in our interest. I sincerely hope the difficulties through which Pakistan is passing are resolved and they find pragmatic, practical and effective means of solving their problems.																								He was equally diplomatic on Myanmar, making it clear that India was not about to join the West in condemning the military junta but at the same time would quietly back efforts towards a peaceful settlement with Opposition forces, including Aung San Suu Kyi.																								Explaining Indias position , the Prime Minister said: Myanmar is our neighbour, what goes on there has an important bearing on our own country as a number of insurgent groups take advantage of the instability in Myanmar to indulge in unlawful activities in our Northeast. Therefore, we have a strong interest in a stable, prosperous and peaceful Myanmar. 																								In this context, he referred to Indias support for the role of the UN in bringing about national reconciliation between the Myanmarese government and Suu Kyi. 																								Much the same sentiment was conveyed in his one-on-one meeting with General Thein Sein this evening.																								According to a spokesperson for the external affairs ministry, the two leaders discussed bilateral relations and regional issues. The Prime Minister conveyed Indias position that the reform process should be broad-based (by) including Suu Kyi and various ethnic nationalities, and it should be carried forward expeditiously towards a satisfactory conclusion.																								He also appreciated the role of the UN envoy, on behalf of the international community, to facilitate the process of reconciliation, the spokesperson added.

				 Govt clears armed forces tribunal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 8: The Centre has cleared a redrafted bill for a separate tribunal for the armed forces that will deal with all cases of indiscipline in the ranks, service issues and court martial sentences.																								The nod for the amended Armed Forces Tribunal Bill came nearly two years after it was presented in the Rajya Sabha and the standing committee on defence recommended changes.																								The tribunal will lighten the governments burden as well as bring down the number of cases regarding military matters that are pending with the higher judiciary.																								Till May this year, there were more than 9,300 cases concerning the army  and a smaller number from the navy and the air force  that were pending in high courts and the Supreme Court. The bill is likely to be presented in Parliament during the winter session. Defence ministry sources said those who have been given death sentences or have been sentenced to life imprisonment by a court martial may also appeal in the tribunal.

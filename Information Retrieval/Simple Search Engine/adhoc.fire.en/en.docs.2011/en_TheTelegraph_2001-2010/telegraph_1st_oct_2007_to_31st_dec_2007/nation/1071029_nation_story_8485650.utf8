																								London, Oct. 28 (PTI): A Delhi supplier for clothing retailer GapKids, part of high-street giant GAP, has been found using child labour, The Sunday Observer said today.																								GAP withdrew the garments, thousands of embroidered blouses, and ordered a probe. According to the report, child workers, some as young as 10, have been found working in the factory in conditions close to slavery to produce clothes that appear destined for GapKids. 																								Clothing intended for the Christmas market had been improperly subcontracted to a sweatshop using child labour, GAP said in a statement from its San Francisco base. The company said it was investigating violations of the ethics code it had set for suppliers three years ago.

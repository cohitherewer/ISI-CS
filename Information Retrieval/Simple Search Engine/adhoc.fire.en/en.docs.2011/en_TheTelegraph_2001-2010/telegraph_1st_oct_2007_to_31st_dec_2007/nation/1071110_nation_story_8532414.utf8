				 Azad cites violence to put off local poll
 MUZAFFAR RAINA 				 	 Ghulam Nabi Azad																								Srinagar, Nov. 9: The Jammu and Kashmir government has put off panchayat elections citing militant violence in the state. 																								Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said the elections could be held either with the Assembly polls, scheduled for October next year, or after that. 																								Providing security for elections to 4,100 panchayats across the state will be a Herculean task and the government does not want to put the lives of the candidates at risk, Azad said earlier this week in Jammu while highlighting his achievements during his two years in office. 																								The ruling coalition completed five years last week. Azad had taken over from Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on November 2, 2005 under a power-sharing agreement between the Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party. 																								Azad has repeatedly claimed success in bringing the state back on the path to peace, but the government has so far failed to hold the panchayat polls, initially scheduled for 2004. 																								When we are confident that adequate security could be provided to the candidates whose number would be in the thousands, the elections to panchayats would be held, he said. 																								Panchayat polls were held in the state in January 2001 after 23 years. But the PDP-led government dissolved the village bodies in 2003, alleging fraud and rigging in the polls by the National Conference government, and promised free and fair polls in a years time. 																								But four years on, the government has failed to live up to its promise even after announcing dates on several occasions.																								Azad also expressed inability to constitute a delimita- tion commission and rede- fine the Assembly consti- tuencies. The government would need a two-thirds majority in the Assembly to undo the legislation enacted by the National Conference government placing a blanket ban on delimitation up to 2026, he said. 																								He is facing strong opposition on this not just from the National Conference but even from his coalition partners. 																								Although peace is gradually returning to the state, the situation does not warrant withdrawal of troops from the border, Azad said.																								However, the relocation and redeployment of troops is a continuous process. During the Kargil war, additional troops were inducted whose relocation has been taking place from time to time. 																								Azad said his government had fulfilled 90 per cent of its pledges in the common minimum programme and that the remaining 10 per cent would be implemented in the current year.

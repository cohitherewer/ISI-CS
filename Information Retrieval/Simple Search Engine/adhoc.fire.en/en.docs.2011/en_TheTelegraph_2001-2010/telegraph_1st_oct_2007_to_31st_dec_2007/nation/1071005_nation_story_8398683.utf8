				 Bond, to get back dumped baby
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Oct. 4: A tribal couple who left their newborn at an orphanage last month have got her back after giving it in writing that they would send her to school and not marry her off before 18.																								They also assured us they would see that no harm comes to the girl, said Swaroopa Rani, director of Shishu Vihar, the government-sponsored care centre for abandoned children.																								The baby was left with the centre in September, within weeks of her birth.																								Auto driver Amboth Sitaram and his wife Shantha, a farm worker, signed an agreement on stamp paper this week to take her back.																								The couple, residents of Ranga Reddy district, 80km from Hyderabad, had wanted a son. When they had a fourth daughter, they planned to abandon her. Female infanticide is common among Andhra Pradesh tribals, many of whom do not kill the child but leave her to die.																								Ambu Naik, the general secretary of an NGO working against infanticide in tribal hamlets, got wind of their plans and persuaded them to take their daughter to Shishu Vihar.																								The NGO, Lambda Hakkula Vedika, has an agreement with Shishu Vihar that the orphanage would accept all unwanted girls.																								After two sleepless weeks and the reprimands of our neighbours, we decided to get our child back, Shantha said. 																								But the NGO wanted to be certain that the couple really wanted the child and insisted on a written agreement that they would bring her up properly.																								Shishu Vihar authorities and the NGO stood witness to the agreement that both Amboth and Shantha signed.

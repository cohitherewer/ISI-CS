 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Patil																								New Delhi, Nov. 21: The Centre has stopped short of invoking Article 355 on Nandigram but issued a written directive asking the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to protect residents, their homes and their property.																								We have given them a written directive that no one should be forced to leave his or her home. Everybody should be brought back and given full protection, and the state must ensure proper compensation is paid, Union home minister Shivraj Patil told the Lok Sabha today.																								The directive was issued on the lines of what leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani had spoken of, he said.																								Advani, who initiated a discussion on Nandigram in Parliament after two days of disruption, had urged the Centre to issue directives to the state government under Article 355, and dismiss it under Article 356 if it failed to follow them.																								Article 355 mandates the Union government to protect states against external aggression and internal disturbance. The responsibility has to be discharged by exercising all powers at its command before resorting to the ultimate device of imposing Presidents rule under Article 356.																								At the end of the six-hour discussion, many questions remained unanswered, with Patil noncommittal about various contentious issues.																								Several members, especially from the CPM, had blamed Maoists for the Nandigram violence. Patil hedged, saying he had information that he could not divulge since it may do more harm than good.																								Some outsiders have tried to instigate people to resort to violence and also brought sophisticated weapons into the area, he said.																								Repeating the refrain that marked his reply  that he was not a judge and did not want to blame anybody  the minister conceded that some mistakes have happened.																								Some people do not use harsh words. We want to convey things gently, Patil said, condemning the fear psychosis created among the people in Nandigram. 																								Nobody should be made to leave their homes. Gangs on motorcycles should not be allowed to intimidate people and the affected populace should be given adequate compensation, he said. 																								The atmosphere in Nandigram, with the police and the administration not able to enter, had become unacceptable, the minister added.																								He refrained from commenting on the propriety of Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi making his views public. It is not proper to raise issues concerning the governor on the floor of the House, he said.																								But Patil rejected the CPM charge that he had delayed sending the CRPF. Bengal already had two battalions of the central force posted in border areas, he said. 																								The state, he added, was told to use the forces it had and was promised more if needed. We have withdrawn personnel from training and sent them there, Patil said. 																								Advani demanded that an all-party delegation visit Nandigram to find out the truth.																								Nandigram, he said, would prove to be a turning point in the history of the CPM, very much like Tiananmen Square in the history of China.																								The CPMs Mohammad Salim accused political opponents of fuelling the crisis and allowing the Maoists to take advantage. 																								Pranab visit																								Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee is cutting short his visit to Uganda by a day and returning tomorrow in view of the violence in Calcutta.

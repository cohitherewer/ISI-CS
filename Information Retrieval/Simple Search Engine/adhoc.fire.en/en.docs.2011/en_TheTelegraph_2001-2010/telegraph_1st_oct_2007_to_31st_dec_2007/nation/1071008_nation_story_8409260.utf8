 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Queen of tracks on new journey				 																																																										Many had already given up on the Fairy Queen. At 157 years, she was thought too old to be revved up for a new life.				 																																																										But technicians at a railway workshop in Perambur, not far from Chennai, got the 1855 steam locomotive up and running recently. 				 																																																										After the makeover, the 26-tonne mass of metal left for Delhi, where it will be used to haul a special tourist train to Alwar in Rajasthan.				 																																																										Nostalgia ruled the send-off ceremony as V. Carmelus, the southern railway chief mechanical engineer who supervised the revamp, flagged off the Queen.				 																																																										A small crowd, mostly employees and locals, thronged the workshop as the locomotive chugged out amid thick plumes of smoke - a rare sight since the railways now use only electric and diesel engines. The Darjeeling hill train, now a Unesco heritage, is an exception.				 																																																										The East India Railway brought the Queen to India in 1855. Its run ended in 1909 but it was shunted to various locations before being brought to Permbur in 1996.				 																JNU teacher in martyr call				 																																																										Bhagat Singhs 100th birth anniversary celebrations, though muted, were held on September 28. 				 																																																										But long before the events, a senior Jawaharlal Nehru University professor had urged the Centre to hold celebrations across the country this year as a mark of respect to the revolutionary.				 																																																										Chaman Lal, who teaches at the JNU school of languages, had pointed out that this year was special in the context of the Indian freedom struggle. 				 																																																										It marked 60 years since Independence and 150 years since the First War of Independence, besides being the birth centenary of Bhagat Singh. The freedom fighter was hanged in March 1931.				 																																																										Lal has authored several books on Bhagat Singh, and has also worked on transcripts of original letters the freedom fighter wrote and received prior to his hanging. 				 																																																										He said the government was yet to fully recognise or appreciate the role played by the revolutionary and his comrades in the struggle against the British.				 																Vote and win goodies				 																																																										The poll season is here and parties in Andhra Pradesh are matching each other sop for sop.				 																																																										The Congress has offered rice at Rs 2 a kg, which will leave the state exchequers pocket lighter by Rs 12 crore. 				 																																																										Not to the left behind, the Telugu Desam Party has offered nine hours of free power and a waiver of cooperative loans to farmers, free power to poor domestic consumers and also the right to sell plots allotted by the government.				 																																																										The Telengana Rashtra Samitis list reads the longest. It has promised 12 hours of free power to farmers, free crop loans, free housing, free education and free rice, but only to the people of Telengana if and when it is formed.				 																																																										The BJP and the Left are yet to make any announcements, but the buzz is they are working on some schemes.				 																																																										So, no matter which party manages to get the highest number of votes, the people are sure to win a whole lot of goodies. 				 																Teary eyed				 																																																										Kitchens in Delhi, like many across the country, are feeling the heat of escalating onion prices. 				 																																																										But the capital, where governments have lost when the vegetable turned too expensive for people to touch, the authorities appear to have woken up to the threat.				 																																																										The government has set up special stalls to sell onions at subsidised rates, which range from Rs 25 to Rs 30. Last week, the prices were lowered further to Rs 21. The open-market prices have shot past Rs 35 in several areas. The spurt has been blamed on a scarcity caused by crop wastage in heavy rain in onion-growing states.				 																																																	Delhi: From Gautam Buddha to Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammed Tabrez Alam follows the preachers of non-violence through his paintings. An exhibition of his works, at Poorva Sanskritik Kendra, 14, Laxmi Nagar District Centre, Vikas Marg, is on this week between 12pm and 10pm.

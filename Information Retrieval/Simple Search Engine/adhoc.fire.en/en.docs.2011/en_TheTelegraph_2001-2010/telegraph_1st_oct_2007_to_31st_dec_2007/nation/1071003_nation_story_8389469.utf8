				 IIMs urged to reveal score
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 2: The central information commission has advised the Indian institutes of management to reveal the marks of students in the combined aptitude test (CAT) from next year. 																								The countrys top B-schools only disclose a percentile score, not the marks scored in each of four individual tests  maths, English, logical reasoning and statistical analysis. 																								The order, based on a complaint from a student who had appeared for the CAT in 2005, comes after the information watchdog lamented the lack of transparency in the IIT entrance process. 																								As reported in The Telegraph, the IITs, after initially refusing to disclose the admission process followed in 2006, provided a formula which, parents showed, did not yield the cut-off marks used by the IITs that year. Hearings are on in Calcutta High Court.																								The IIMs, too, have refused to provide the appellant with the information he wanted  the number of questions answered correctly. 																								The commission agreed with the IIMs contention that since the CAT answer scripts are marked through an optical mark reader, in a process that has no manual involvement, there is no subjectivity in awarding marks. 																								The commission accepted that since the answer scripts are marked in pencil, providing them to an appellant would give them the chance to make alterations. 																								But why cant the marks under each category of tests, as well as groups of aspirants, such as general and others, be revealed? the commission asked.																								Amitabh explanation																								The Uttar Pradesh information commission has asked Amitabh Bachchan on what basis he had suggested that crime was less in the state in his election slogan on television, reports PTI from Lucknow.																								Bachchans slogan UP mein hai dum, jurm yahan pe hai kam (UP has strength, crime here is less) was aired by news channels during Assembly polls in April-May this year. 																								Chief information commissioner M.A. Khan asked for the explanation after Brijbhushan Dubey of Ghazipur, under the right to information act, filed a petition wanting to know the basis of Bachchans claim.																								The next hearing is on October 15. 																								The actor is exempt from appearing before the commission if he answers Dubeys queries before the day of hearing, it said.

				 Alert misses Rajasthan
 NISHIT DHOLABHAI																								New Delhi, Oct. 11: Rajasthan wasnt among the states warned by central intelligence agencies of terror strikes before the twin blasts in Hyderabad in August.																								Not really, home secretary Madhukar Gupta said today when asked if the state figured on the list of places warned. Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad were on the list.																								The home secretarys statement was another reminder of how weak intelligence networks have proved to avert recent strikes.																								Security at Ajmer Sharif, one of the holiest of Sufi shrines, was reviewed last year, along with that of temples in Ayodhya and Varanasi. But sources said there were no intelligence alerts pointing to todays attacks.																								Suspicion has fallen on outfits such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammad, opposed to Sufi Islam. Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, whose tomb lies in Ajmer, was a Sufi saint. In the Kashmir Valley, fundamentalist groups have razed holy places (ziarats) associated with such saints.																								In the blasts at Hyderabad and Varanasi (at Sankatmochan temple in March 2006), Harkat-ul Jihadi Islamis (Huji) Mohammed Shaheed alias Bilal is a suspect. Huji is ideologically close to the Jaish and Lashkar.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil have urged states to tone up their intelligence networks as part of the fight against terror. 																								Gupta said there were difficulties in frisking and taking other security measures in crowded shrines, like the one at Ajmer. 																								He added, without giving details, that a general alert had been sounded for many religious places. 																								This evening, the home ministry issued a fresh advisory to states in view of the forthcoming festive season.

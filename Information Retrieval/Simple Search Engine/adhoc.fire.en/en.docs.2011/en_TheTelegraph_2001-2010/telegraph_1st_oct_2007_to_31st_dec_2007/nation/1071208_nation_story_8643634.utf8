				 Dalai successor may be a woman

 RICHARD SPENCER 
																								Beijing, Dec. 7: The next Dalai Lama could be a woman, it emerged yesterday.
																								Although there are female lamas  or living Buddhas  men are predominant and it is rare for reincarnated lamas not to share the sex of their predecessors.
																								However, at the start of a 10-day visit to Italy, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th and current Dalai Lama, said: If a woman reveals herself as more useful, the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form.
																								The comment follows his surprising remarks last week that he might choose his successor before his death, or even hold a referendum on whether he should be reborn at all.
																								If people feel that the institution of the Dalai Lama is still necessary, it will continue, he had said.
																								Traditionally, the successor is chosen by a committee of monks which finds a young child born after his death, who is supposed to show a spark of the dead leaders spirit.
																								The question of his succession is of increasing importance to the Dalai, who is 72.
																								There is a growing determination among the Chinese authorities to exert their control over Tibetan Buddhism.
																								China will want to oversee the appointment of the current Dalais successor, aware that he is a figurehead for Tibetan aspirations for greater autonomy or even independence.
																								In the summer, Beijing demanded that all reincarnations of lamas win prior approval from the governments religious affairs bureau before being reborn. This is in line with the principle that all religions must operate within a framework controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.

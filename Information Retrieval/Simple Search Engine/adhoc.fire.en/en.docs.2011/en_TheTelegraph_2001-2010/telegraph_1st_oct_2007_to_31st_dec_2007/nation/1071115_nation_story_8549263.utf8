				 CM what-a-fall jab at Kshiti
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 14: Public works minister Kshiti Goswami today said he would stick to his decision to step down in protest against the CPMs recapture of Nandigram at gunpoint.																								But the rest of his RSP colleagues on the Left constituents state committee were undecided on whether other party ministers should also quit.																								The committee, which met today, decided to continue with the deliberations tomorrow.																								Discussions remained inconclusive and will continue tomorrow, senior leader Manoj Bhattacharjee told reporters.																								The CPM sent mixed signals.																								What a fall! chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee exclaimed, asked about Goswamis decision to resign. Goswami had compared Bhattacharjees path with Narendra Modis.																								CPM state secretary Biman Bose, however, wrote to his RSP counterpart Debabrata Banerjee, urging him to maintain the Left Fronts unity.																								Goswami said he would not go back to Writers Buildings. If others have problems now, they can wait for some time. Our leaders from the districts have strongly opposed the CPMs Stalinist politics. But there are different views on how we should react. I appreciate the need to take steps in phases, he said.																								RSP insiders said Goswami might be allowed to resign alone as he is likely to replace Banerjee as the partys state secretary in January.																								In any case, he is likely to leave the government within a few months to take charge of the party. So his anti-CPM belligerence would go down well with the party rank and file, an RSP leader said.																								Banerjee said most of his partys state committee members had condemned the CPMs role in Nandigram.																								But its difficult to decide about severing ties with the government and the front in a huff. We have to think of all aspects, he said, indicating the dilemma within the party.																								Forward Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh urged the RSP not to quit the government, while his message to the CPM was it should learn a lesson from the huge turnout at todays silent protest march.

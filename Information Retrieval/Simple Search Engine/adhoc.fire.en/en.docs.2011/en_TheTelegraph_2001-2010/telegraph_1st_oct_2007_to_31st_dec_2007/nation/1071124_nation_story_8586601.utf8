				 Raje passes buck to duty-bound Delhi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT			Mediapersons outside the Jaipur hotel where Taslima was lodged on Thursday night. Telegraph pictureNew Delhi, Nov. 23: The BJP today washed its hands of Taslima Nasreen, saying her security was the Centres responsibility.																								After the Bangladeshi author left Jaipur this morning  less than 24 hours after she had landed in the city  the BJP said chief minister Vasundhara Raje was not informed of her arrival by either the Bengal government or the Centre. 																								Last night at 11.30, Vasundhara called (L.K.) Advaniji and complained that she was not told anything. She said she had enough problems on hand, such as the Gujjar-Meena conflict, and could do without another, party spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said.																								Neither the West Bengal government nor the Centre said anything (to Vasundhara), she added. 																								In spite of that, Sushma said, the Rajasthan government had provided the author security as an honoured guest.																								Sushma said Taslima was sent to Delhi because Vasundhara felt that the Centre was responsible and duty-bound for her security. 																								The chief minister is even prepared to let Taslima stay in her house in Delhi, but she was clear her security was the Centres responsibility.																								Sources said Vasundhara spoke to Union home minister Shivraj Patil before Taslima left. 																								There was no instruction from the Centre to move her out of Jaipur, a home ministry spokesperson said.																								The Centre took a serious note of the developments at a meeting of the cabinet committee on security affairs this morning. 																								With the Prime Minister out of the country, the meeting was chaired by foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, who had returned late last night from Kampala. 																								It was decided that Taslimas whereabouts would be kept secret because the government didnt want to risk a backlash from Muslim fundamentalists.																								After Taslima moved to Jaipur last evening, BJP sources had spread the word that the party would call the Lefts bluff on secularism and show how liberal Muslims were safe only in BJP-ruled states. 																								Today, the same sources said Vasundharas detractors in the BJP could have used Taslimas presence to instigate trouble and it was just as well the writer was out of the chief ministers way.																								For the record, the BJP said it was not in favour of deporting Taslima. We want her visa to be extended, Sushma told a news briefing.

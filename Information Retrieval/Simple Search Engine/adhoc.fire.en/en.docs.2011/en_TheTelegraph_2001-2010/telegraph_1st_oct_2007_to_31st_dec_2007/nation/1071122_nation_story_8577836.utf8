				 N-deal positive signal from China Asia also on PMs radar
 MANINI CHATTERJEE 				 	 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in Singapore. (PTI)																								Singapore, Nov. 21: A day after Manmohan Singh told the media the Chinese have not said they will not support us at the IAEA and the NSG when the question of ending Indias nuclear isolation comes up, there appeared to be some forward movement on that front at a meeting with Wen Jiabao. 																								The two Prime Ministers, an MEA spokesperson said, discussed opportunities that exist for furthering cooperation in regional and multilateral forums on global issues such as climate change and energy security. Premier Wen was forthcoming and supportive of international civil nuclear energy cooperation with India. 																								With Delhi formally initiating talks on the India-specific safeguards agreement with the IAEA secretariat in Vienna today, Chinas qualified support came as a shot in the arm.																								Yet, knowing the inscrutable ways of the Chinese, MEA sources cautioned against reading too much into the Chinese Prime Ministers positive stance. His words in favour of civil nuclear energy cooperation were more in the nature of a general statement and need not necessarily indicate firm support for India at the IAEA just yet, the sources said. 																								Notwithstanding this caveat, the cordial meeting with the Chinese Premier  the second such meeting in less than a year  was the high point of Singhs packed schedule in Singapore today. 																								Since decisions at the IAEA and the NSG are taken by consensus, India is keen to ensure that China does not adopt a hostile stance even if it does not actively push  a la the US, Russia or France  Indias case. 																								Singh also had a bilateral meeting with Japans new Prime Minister, Yasuo Fukuda, addressed the sixth India-Asean summit and participated in the third East Asia Summit. The new grouping facilitates interaction between the 10-nation Asean and six countries of the Asia-Pacific region  Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. 																								Pilloried by the Left back home for snuggling up to the US-led West, Singhs efforts today centred on showcasing the great strides India has taken to push forward the decade-and-a-half-old Look East policy. 																								The message at the end of the day was Indias readiness to play a much bigger role in Asia commensurate with its growing economic clout and strategic importance. 																								With both Japan and China, for instance, Singh discussed strategic partnerships while he outlined a slew of new initiatives to cement enhanced ties with the Asean grouping. 																								According to the MEA spokesperson, at the Singh-Wen meeting, the two Premiers reiterated their readiness to take the India-China strategic and cooperative partnership for peace and prosperity to a new level. 																								The need for a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question was also addressed and both sides expressed satisfaction at the progress that is being made by special representatives in this regard.																								In his second bilateral meeting, Singh and Fukuda spoke of their common commitment to the strategic and global partnership between Japan and India and shared the view that the East Asian summit is an important building block for the creation of an Asian economic community. 																								With Singh slated to visit China early next year and accepting with pleasure an invitation to visit Japan sometime next year, Indias relations with the two biggest Asian economies are clearly set to strengthen, the MEA sources said.

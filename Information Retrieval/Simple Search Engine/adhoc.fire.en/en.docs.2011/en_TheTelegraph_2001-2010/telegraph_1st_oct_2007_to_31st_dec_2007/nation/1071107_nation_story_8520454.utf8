				 Nuke negotiators get BJP cold shoulder
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 6: The BJP appears to have rebuffed Americas efforts to persuade it to support the nuclear deal.																								The indication came today from leader of Opposition L.K. Advani himself, who dismissed speculation about a change of mind in the party.																								What soft? he retorted, when asked if American pressure had softened his party.																								Advani, who was informally talking to reporters at a pre-Diwali get-together, said distancing ourselves from the Lefts anti-Americanism doesnt mean we have softened our position.																								Our stand is that we want good relations with the US even if the deal doesnt materialise, he added.																								Asked if America had succeeded in addressing any of the partys concerns, Advani said: They tried to do that but we were not satisfied.																								Advanis assertion left little room for speculation, though other leaders had been hinting that the party would meet before Parliaments winter session to finalise the BJPs stand in view of the arguments put forward by the American envoys.																								The former BJP chief said Henry Kissinger also talked about the nuclear deal although he began by saying he was not here to lobby for it.																								He said US ambassador David Mulfords main argument was there was not much time left for the deal to go through.																								He said the government was required to take a decision immediately. He argued that laws had been changed in America this time and the candidates for (next years) election will be announced in February-March itself. But we told him how is the BJP concerned with that, Advani added.																								Asked why the Americans had tried to push the deal, Advani said: There are very few plus points in (George W.) Bushs foreign policy. Failures are much more. Hence they are trying to push this deal to show as an achievement. 																								They will tell the country that India has always maintained they will not sign the NPT but we brought them into the non-proliferation regime through this deal.

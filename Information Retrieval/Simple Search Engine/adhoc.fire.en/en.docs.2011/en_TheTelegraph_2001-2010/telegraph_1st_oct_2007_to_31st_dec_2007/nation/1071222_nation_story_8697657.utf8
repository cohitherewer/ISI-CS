				 Birthday comeback, with riddle for BJP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
				 	 Vajpayee: Poem poser
																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: Atal Bihari Vajpayee has again set off a buzz with a poem as he prepares to make a public appearance after a long time on December 25, his 83rd birthday.
																								It says todays Mahabharat will be fought without Krishna, and that whoever becomes king, the poor will suffer.
																								Vajpayee recently gave up his pre-eminent position in the party, which has declared L.K. Advani the candidate for Prime Minister and will fight the next election without him.
																								Vijay Goel, who was a minister in the Prime Ministers Office when Vajpayee held the top post, came to the regular news briefing to announce the birthday programmes.
																								He said Vajpayee would meet people who wished to greet him at 11am and both the print and electronic media were free to come.
																								The former Prime Minister has in the recent past avoided meeting people, and senior BJP leaders have been extremely secretive about his health. Although he has shown signs of improvement and has allowed his pictures to be taken, sources say he is no longer capable of active politics.
																								Vajpayee, however, will not attend a dance drama based on his poems to be held in the evening in Mandi House.
																								Mahabharat  Pashon Ka Khel (a game of dice) will make a musical presentation of many of Vajpayees poems. But it was the one printed on the invitation card, handed out by Vajpayee loyalist Goel, that evoked curiosity.
																								The stanza on the card goes like this: Kaurav kaun/Kaun Pandav/Tedha sawal hai/Dono ore/Shakuni ka faila kootjaal hai/Dharmaraj ne chhori nahi/Juye ki lat hai/Har panchayat me/Panchali apmanit hai/Bina Krishna ke/Aaj Mahabharat hona hai/Koi raja bane/Rank ko to rona hai.
																								It means: Who are the Kauravs/Who are the Pandavs/Its a difficult question/On both sides/Is spread Shakunis web of deceit/Dharmaraj (Yudhisthir) hasnt given up yet/The habit of gambling/Panchali (Draupadi) is insulted/In every panchayat/The Mahabharat will be fought today/Without Krishna/Whoever becomes king/The poor have to weep.
																								Advani, party president Rajnath Singh and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat are expected to attend the dance drama.
																								No BJP leader was willing to publicly interpret the message behind the poems circulation. They said the same thing: Dont read too much into it.

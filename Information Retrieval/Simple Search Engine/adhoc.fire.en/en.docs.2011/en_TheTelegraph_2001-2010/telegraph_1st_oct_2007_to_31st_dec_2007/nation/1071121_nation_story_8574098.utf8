				 Office help robs Sush
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Sushmita: Trust betrayed?																								Mumbai, Nov. 20: Two mobiles, diamond earrings and Rs 40,000 were stolen from Sushmita Sens office, allegedly by a 20-year-old attendant who is missing since the November 10 heist.																								Officers at the Khar police station, where the case has been registered, were looking for Gajanan Hari Pardeshi. Searches have been made in Pune and Jalgaon at two addresses given by the young man, who worked at the actresss office for just over a week.																								Pardeshi was employed in Sens office through a job recruiting agency on October 27 and had been working as an office boy, said an officer looking into the case.																								The robbery came to light when an employee found that the Nokia handsets, two earrings and the cash were missing from the office, Tantra Entertainment Private Ltd, in Bandra. 																								The theft has upset the actress but she is particularly distressed about the loss of the handsets, in which she had stored several personal photographs and video clips. 																								Police in Jalgaon and Pune have been alerted. 																								They will get in touch with us if Pardeshi arrives there, the officer said.																								The case against the 20-year-old has been registered under Section 381 (theft committed by a domestic help) of the Indian Penal Code. 																								In some ways, Sushmita has been lucky.																								In April, a 23-year-old television actress was allegedly murdered at her home by a servant whom she had employed without a police verification.																								Sunil Jagdish Singh, 20, killed Manisha Agarwal only for Rs 1,500 and a gold ring worth Rs 5,000, the police said.

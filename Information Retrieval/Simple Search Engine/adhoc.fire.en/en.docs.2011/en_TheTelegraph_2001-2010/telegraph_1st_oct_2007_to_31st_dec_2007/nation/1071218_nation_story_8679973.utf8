				 Cadre push for Patna passengers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Patna, Dec. 17: CPI-ML activists, on their way to the partys national convention at Calcutta, allegedly forced 500 passengers to get down from the Danapur-Howrah Express at Patna last night. 
																								Patna GRP said chaotic scenes were witnessed at the station when 2352 Danapur-Howrah entered Patna with almost all seats in the AC, sleeper and general compartment occupied by unauthorised passengers. 
																								The police said, passengers, who had to board from Patna, engaged in heated arguments with the unauthorised passengers. A senior police officer conceded: Despite our intervention, hundreds were pushed out and was manhandled by those who had already occupied the seats, reserved for the rightful passengers. He, however, refused to name any outfit or organisation responsible for the incident.
																								Danapur public relations officer R.K. Singh, however, was forthright in naming the offenders. Singh told The Telegraph: Hundreds of CPI-ML activists had boarded the train at Danapur, 9km from Patna. 
																								Singh added: Some 160 PNRs with 298 passengers were refunded. We bore a loss of Rs 47,961. Besides, a number of unreserved passengers also got their refund in the chaos. 
																								The train got delayed for one-and-a-half hours because of the chaos and it left Patna around 11pm. 
																								CPI-ML would be holding its national convention in Calcutta from December 10 to 17. The CPI-ML Bihar secretary Nandkishore Yadav was not available for comments. The party sources said no special trains were booked to take the party workers to Calcutta.
																								During rallies held by the RJD and the LJP, over 40 special trains were booked to take workers and supporters from several parts of Bihar to the state capital.

				 Delhi plays for nuclear fuel
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 				 Mukherjee, Advani 																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: The Centre today said the main task of the Indian negotiators at the International Atomic Energy Agency was to get an assurance on fuel supply.																								Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said this while replying to the Lok Sabha debate on the nuclear deal.																								Mukherjee picked on CPM member Rupchand Pals comment on uninterrupted supply of nuclear fuel. 																								The minister said: The negotiators will focus on three points: uninterrupted fuel supply, right to create a strategic reserve in case of a breakdown (interruption) and recognition of our strategic programme.																								Congress MPs thumped the desk in joy, and the communists looked unperturbed. 																								Pal then raised a few technology-specific questions to which Mukherjee said the details would come in the India-specific agreement.																								Pal had earlier iterated the CPMs position, alleging that most of the important assurances given to Parliament by the Prime Minister had been trampled by the Hyde Act, and that the concessions given to India were only notional.																								Articulating the Oppositions concerns, L.K. Advani said the deal was deeply detrimental to Indias vital and long-term interests and it placed India as a junior partner.																								He alleged that the US had managed to bring India under the non-proliferation regime as the Hyde Act practically prevented the country from conducting tests. I am sure if Mrs (Indira) Gandhi were there, if Vajpayee were there, they would not have signed the deal, Advani said. 																								Advani, contending that the government should have agreed to a debate under rule 184 to take a sense of House, asked the Prime Minister why he was rushing ahead when everybody knows there is no consensus. 																								Advani took a dig at the Left parties, saying that their guiding force was anti-Americanism and anti-BJPism but they had abandoned the opposition to the deal because their concern now was the timing of the next election.																								They want to save Bengal and the government wants to save the deal, he said.																								Samajwadi stand																								The Samajwadi Party appeared to have softened its stand, saying going back on the agreement would harm the countrys credibility.																								Samajwadi Party leader Ramgopal Yadav appealed to the Prime Minister to allay apprehensions on the agreement and take the support of his party and Parliament.																								Yadav said nobody could question the credibility of the Prime Minister, his patriotism, intellectual capabilities and dedication. 																								If the credibility of the Prime Minister is hurt, it is not just his credibility but the credibility of the country, Yadav, whose party has been sharply critical of the deal, said.																								Yadav is usually restrained in his comments and it is not clear whether his comments reflected a change in his partys stand.

				 Jodhaa jumbo trek
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jaipur, Oct. 6: You can call it a long-distance trunk call, except that its going to come by truck.																								At least 10 elephants from Jaipur are set to be put on trucks for a nearly 1,200km journey by road to Mumbai, where they will join fellow actors  mostly humans  for Ashutosh Gowarikars epic film Jodhaa Akbar.																								All that is needed now is the forest ministrys nod.																								Shyam Gupta, one of the owners of these jumbos, said the film crew that shot here earlier wanted to use these elephants for the war scenes for the sake of continuity. The shooting for these scenes is likely to start from October 20 and continue for about 25 days.																								The film, set for release early next year, centres on the romance between Akbar (Hrithik Roshan) and the Rajput princess Jodhaa, played by Aishwarya Rai. 																								While the owners are looking forward to the Rs 7,000 a day they hope to earn  Rs 5,000 more than what their wards bring home by ferrying tourists or wedding guests  animal activists are furious.																								Madhu Lal, a veterinary surgeon at the NGO Help in Suffering, said the road journey would be stressful.																								We are against the use of animals for film shoots as it is against the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, added Suraj Ziddi, secretary, People For Animals.																								The owners, however, say the elephants would travel in comfort  one on one truck with two mahouts, plenty of food and water, rests at night and a veterinary surgeon at their beck and call.																								Rashid Khan, secretary of the Elephant Owners Association, said some jumbos had travelled to Calcutta last year and faced no problems.																								Assistant conservator of forests R.K. Bhatti said physical examinations on the animals have found nothing wrong with them. Moreover, they wouldnt be allowed to travel more than 300km a day. Now the permission to allow them to travel to Mumbai rests with the chief wildlife warden, he said.																								Warden R.N. Mehrotra was not available for comment.

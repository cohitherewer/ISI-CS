				 Taslima finds perfect host
 SANJAY K. JHA				 	 A securityman outside Rajasthan House on Sunday. Picture by Prem Singh																								New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Rajasthan government has told Taslima Nasreen she is free to be its guest as long as she likes.																								We have no problem with (playing host to) her although we believe the Centre should not shirk its responsibility, a senior Rajasthan government official told The Telegraph today.																								He said chief minister Vasundhara Raje had spoken to the Bangladeshi author today and assured her she could continue living in Rajasthan House till the Centre took a decision.																								The chief minister assured her full protection and hospitality, the official said, adding that there were instructions that Taslima should be provided every possible comfort.																								We have not received any communication from the Centre so far. Officials from the external affairs ministry had met her yesterday but none came today. She met only three writers today and told us not to allow journalists in. She is careful not to trigger any fresh controversy.																								The firm political backing Raje received from her party today has emboldened her to extend the hospitality to Taslima without any fuss.																								BJP leaders say the party had nothing to do with the decision and that the Rajasthan government had acted on humanitarian grounds.																								She is in Delhi and hence even her security is not our concern. Delhi police and the (Union) home ministry have to take care of that. We are only providing her hospitality, a Rajasthan official said.																								The hospitality appeared to have been upgraded a notch today with Taslima being served rare Rajasthani delicacies for lunch. Apart from the fish, rice and begun bhaja she loves, she was offered ker sangri, a desert dish made of dry leaves and seeds, gatte ki sabzi (a besan preparation), missi ki roti and pachrangi daal.																								She was very happy and thanked the Rajasthan government for the excellent service, an official said.																								At other moments, of course, she was not happy. As Taslima spoke of the way the Bengal government had treated her, tears rolled down her cheeks, the officials taking care of her said.																								She desperately wants to return. She is feeling homesick. Yesterday, she cried while watching the children of her brother on TV. She said, I dont know why this is being done to me, a witness at Rajasthan House said.

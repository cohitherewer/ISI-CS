				 BJP in south home stretch
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI																								Bangalore/Delhi, Nov. 8: The Centre today decided to revoke Presidents rule in Karnataka, clearing the way for the first BJP chief minister in the south.																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram announced the decision after a cabinet meeting. Governor Rameshwar Thakur would be advised to invite the BJPs B.S. Yeddyurappa to form the government, he said.																								Yeddyurappa, expected to return to Bangalore tonight, said from Delhi he had been invited by the governor. 																								BJP spokesperson Suresh Kumar said Yeddyurappa would take oath on Monday. He received the long-awaited call when he was visiting the Vaishno Devi shrine this evening, he said.																								The Assembly had been kept in suspended animation for a month after the BJP-Janata Dal (Secular) alliance fell apart over transfer of power.																								The two parties had struck a deal under which each would get the chief ministers chair for 20 months. But when the BJPs turn came, the JD(S) refused to hand over the reins. 																								The estranged partners patched up on October 27, when the JD(S) offered to support a BJP-led government.																								H.D. Kumaraswamy, who was the JD(S) chief minister, said he was delighted. Dismissing reports that his father and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda had put a spoke in the wheel, he said: It is a creation of the media. It is not true. We are all happy to be part of the next government.

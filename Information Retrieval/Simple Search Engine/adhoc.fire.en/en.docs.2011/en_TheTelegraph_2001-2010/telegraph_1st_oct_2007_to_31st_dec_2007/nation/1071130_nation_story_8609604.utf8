				 Mumbai unlocks housing vault
 							 - Maharashtra lifts urban land leash, Bengal yet to take decision OUR BUREAUMumbai/Nagpur, Nov. 29: Affordable homes may be available in the heart of Mumbai a few years on.																								The Maharashtra Assembly today agreed to lift a 31-year-old urban land ceiling, freeing some 25,000 acres of vacant private land in Mumbai that analysts said would lead to a low and middle-income housing boom.																								Most development will be in the lower and middle-income residential segments, an industry analyst from Religare Securities said.																								This is the beginning of the housing revolution in Maharashtra, said Niranjan Hiranandani, MD, Hiranandani Constructions.																								Scarcity of land has now driven real estate prices through the roof in Mumbai. Most analysts said the sudden availability of so much land might not slash the price immediately, although one industry source predicted a 5 per cent fall.																								A lot of this land is embroiled in legal issues, so its not like hundreds of acres will be available tomorrow. It will take time, said Pranay Vakil, chairman of real estate consultancy Knight Frank.																								Most of the land is privately owned. So, only when the owners decide to develop their land shall we see supply hitting the market. It will take three to four years to see the effect of this, said Anuj Puri, chairman and country head, Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj, a real estate consultancy.																								Also, not all the freed-up land  whose market price would be around Rs 2,00,000 crore  can be developed. Analysts differed on how much land can be developed, their estimates ranging from 10,000 to 17,000 acres. The rest will fall under other restrictions, such as the ban on development within 500 metres of the coast.																								Most of the available land is in central and eastern Mumbai, with central suburbs such as Vikroli, Thane, Mulund and Bhandup up for development.																								The industry believes that government clearances for development will now come faster. Almost three to six months worth of clearance time has been reduced. It requires about 42 clearances to begin development, most of them related to the (land ceiling act), an analyst said.																								The Centre had refused to provide funds under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission unless the state scrapped the 1976 act.

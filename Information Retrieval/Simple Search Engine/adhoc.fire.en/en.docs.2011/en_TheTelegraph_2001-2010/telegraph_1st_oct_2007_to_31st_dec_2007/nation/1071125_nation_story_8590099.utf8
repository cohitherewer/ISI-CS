				 Politics in pickle hub 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 				 	 Naidu																								Vijayawada, Nov. 24: Vijayawada city, otherwise known for its hot pickles and dynamic politics, has once again become the centre of efforts to bring Opposition parties on a single platform.																								Way back in 1983, Telugu Desam founder N.T. Rama Rao brought the then non-Congress and non-BJP forces on a single platform, which emerged as the National Front and later formed a short-lived government at the Centre. 																								This time, the Desam, under NTRs son-in-law, is aimed at projecting the UNPA and Chandrababu Naidu as a farmer-friendly national leader. 																								Large hoardings of Naidu sporting the plough and tilling land have adorned the coastal city. A massive dais set up in a college ground 10km from the city displayed portraits of all UNPA leaders. 																								Hoardings of NTR in the roles of Krishna, Ram and Duryodhana in rich traditional costumes were also on display all over the city to attract admirers of the leader of Krishna district. 																								A dozen bullock carts with tall ongole bulls were also readied for a processional ride of the UNPA leaders and the Desam president along the streets. Naidu and the UNPA leaders travelled in the carts heading the rally for about 5km. 																								Addressing the rally, Mulayam Singh Yadav exhorted farmers to continue the fight for the minimum support price of Rs 1,000 per quintal of paddy. 																								The Congress government always cheated the farmers like now, he said, contending that it never implemented what it promised before the elections. 																								Convener Naidu said the UNPA wanted the Centre to implement the nine-point formula of the Professor Swaminathan Commission on farmers welfare and hike the paddy price to Rs 1,000 per quintal. 																								The UNPA also demanded the waiver of all crop loans of farmers, creation of crop insurance with a village as the unit, agricultural credit at 3 per cent and interest-free agricultural credit for small and marginal farmers. 																								It also said the government should not acquire agricultural land from farmers to hand over to real estate developers for setting up SEZs. 																								Instead, the developers should buy the land from the farmers themselves at market prices, the resolution said. Naidu said these demands would become part of the UNPAs political agenda and manifesto. 																								The Desam organised hundreds of buses from five coastal districts to gather the audience for the first rally for the farmers and also for Naidus image-building.

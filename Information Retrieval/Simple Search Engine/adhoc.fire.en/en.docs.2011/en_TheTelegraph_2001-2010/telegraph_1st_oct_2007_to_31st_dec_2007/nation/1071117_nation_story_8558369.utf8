																								New Delhi, Nov. 16 (PTI): The Lok Sabhas privileges committee has suggested letting off Indias ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen, with a word of caution for his controversial headless chickens remarks. 																								The draft report of the panel, before which the envoy apologised recently, said there was no breach of privilege or contempt and decided to treat the matter as closed. 																								The final report will be placed in the House next week. 																								The Rajya Sabhas privileges panel is expected to reach similar conclusions at its meeting on November 20.

																								December 20: Bihar government formally decides to appoint management guru V. Mukund Das as the director of the Patna-based business school on the likes of of IIM, Ahmedabad, to begin from the next academic year. 
																								December 29: Bikramganj Lok Sabha seat goes to by-polls. The results would be out on Januaryu 2, 2008, in New Year. 
																								Patna, Dec. 30: Nitish Kumar, locked in a political battle for 12 years, eventually received the mandate to tie the knot with Bihar ki gaddi (Bihars throne) just before 2006 dawned on the states horizon. 
																								Somehow, 2007 has been a continuation of the honeymoon with the throne with the Bihar chief minister completing two years in office and merrily consolidating on his strengths. The voters justified his ascendance to the power by backing the Nitish-led NDA to win all the five by-polls in Bihar in 2006. Despite Lalu Prasads mega chetavni rally on October 28, to warn an accidental government and Ram Vilas Paswans sankalp rally here, Nitish Kumar stayed safe and strong in 2007. 
																								It is not that Bihar, with its dubious sobriquet of being the bad land became free from its age-old vices. 
																								Bihars villagers made a mockery of law and lynched as many as 10 youths belonging to a semi-nomad group at Rajapakar in north Bihars Vaishali in September when they suspected them to be thieves. 
																								While some weeks later, a similar mob beat one Mohammad Aurangjeb black and blue again on theft charges. Afterwards a policeman dragged the suspected thief in a motorcycle in the heart of Bhagalpur town. Around the same time, another group gouged out the eyes of a motorcycle thief in Nawada. 
																								These back to back incidents of mob justice provided enough fodder to the Opposition to attack Nitishs most precious plank of sushashan (good governance). 
																								But acting fast, the government went on to dismiss and suspend police personnel manning the areas where the violence occurred. 
																								Nature, too, put the government on test this year with unprecedented floods marooning millions in 18 north Bihar districts. 
																								In fact, the rains caught the Bihar CM off guard, for the heavy monsoon brought swirling waters from hills of Nepal to flood the Bihar rivers which spilled in 18 state districts while Nitish Kumar was away in Mauritius in July and August. 
																								In his absence, the state machinery failed to take care of the people in Begusarai, Samastipur, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Sitamarhi and Muzaffapur. However, a month later the government had launched a massive relief operation by providing Rs 1.5 lakh to the kin of each flood victim along with sufficient ration and health care. Despite man-made or natural created hiccups, the Nitish Kumar government stuck to development programme with emphasis on roads, institutions, public health centres and power projects in a big way, which became visible in 2007.
																								The year also witnessed the inauguration of the national law school  the Chanakya Law School University in Patna. Patna got a business school on the pattern of IIM, Ahmedabad, which will start its first session from the next academic year. Work is afoot for an IIT in Patna. 
																								The government has repaired almost all the state and national highways across the state after some 15 years. 
																								Kumar began his journey on the note to revive sugar industries  the backbone of the states economy. His efforts became visible with Kumar inaugurating a sugar factory sponsored by cine-personality Prakash Jha at Gurwalia in West Champaran in April. 
																								Also, the government is in the process of providing all the eight sugar factories, which have been closed over the years, to private entrepreneurs. The final and significant development of the year was the Bikramganj by-polls in central Bihar. The results would be out on January 2. Kumar must be craving for his party to win this seat as well, so that he can extend his honeymoon in 2008.

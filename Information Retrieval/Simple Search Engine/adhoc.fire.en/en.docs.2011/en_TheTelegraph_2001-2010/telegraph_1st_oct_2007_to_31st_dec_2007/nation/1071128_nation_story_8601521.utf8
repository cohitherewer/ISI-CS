				 Nuke debate minus jitters
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 27: The Parliament debate on the nuclear deal, starting tomorrow, may deny the BJP the pleasure of watching the UPA-Left divide underlined.																								An issue that had threatened the governments survival three months ago is likely to be discussed in a cooler atmosphere in the Lok Sabha tomorrow and in the Rajya Sabha on December 3.																								The debate will take place under rule 193 in the Lok Sabha and rule 176 in the Rajya Sabha. Neither entails voting.																								During the monsoon session, the Lok Sabha Speaker had declared that the deal would be debated under a non-voting rule. The Constitution, he had said, did not make international agreements subject to parliamentary scrutiny or ratification.																								The CPMs Sitaram Yechury today insisted the discussion would reflect the sense of the House and reveal the Congresss isolation, but the government rejected the suggestion.																								(The) sense of the House cannot be interpreted in short-duration discussions under rule 193. In parliamentary parlance, it is called a talk-out motion, parliamentary affairs minister P.R. Das Munshi said.																								Sources backed the governments view that the debate was an academic exercise, saying the constitution of the UPA-Left panel and the Lefts conditional nod to the IAEA talks had released the tensions.																								The Left is expected to restate its concerns, such as uninterrupted fuel supply and the implications of the Hyde Act. The BJP will say the deal undermines Indias sovereignty and weakens its nuclear programme.																								The CPMs Rupchand Pal is expected to start the debate and the CPI may field C.K. Chandrappan. Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee will reply and the Prime Minister is likely to make interventions.																								L.K. Advani will lead the BJP offensive.

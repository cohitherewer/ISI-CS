 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Deception game, in letter amp; spirit				 																																																										A false note has followed actor-singer Sharon Prabhakar.				 																																																										She was shocked to discover that someone had used her letterhead to complain against the owner of a street-corner shop near her Bandra home. The November 18 letter, addressed to the municipal commissioner of the BMC, accused the paan shop owner of selling drugs and urged the civic authorities to remove his kiosk. 				 																																																										Prabhakar was livid that her name had been fraudulently used to target a small-time shopkeeper. I havent written any letter about any paan shop. Whosoever did has no guts and is using my name.				 																																																										The shopkeeper, Suraj Ram Singh Singh, suspected Vijay Bhalla, a builder, and his son Vikas, a singer and TV actor. I knew Sharondidi was never against me. The Bhallas are behind this since my shop is outside their compound. They have been threatening me for the past few months. I had lodged a police complaint against them. Vikas denied the allegations.				 																Take heart, help at hand				 																																																										Many in Chennai can take heart from this  trained professionals at hand who will help deal with cardiac arrests.				 																																																										The city-based Academy for Clinical Training has tied up with the American Heart Association to train doctors and paramedical staff in emergency care during such attacks.				 																																																										A two-member US team is running courses in basic and advanced life support for medical professionals at the institute. The courses aim to impart the skills needed to help patients in the shortest possible time, Michael Murrow and Sherrie Wilson, from the US institute, said.				 																																																										N. Ramakrishnan, who founded the academy in January this year, said his centre was possibly the first in India to offer simulation-based training as well as hands-on courses for life-saving skills during emergencies, such as cardiac arrests and lung problems. 				 																Judgment evenings				 																																																										If the day isnt proving enough, evenings would be just fine.				 																																																										The Delhi government is in the final stages of a process to approve the setting up of evening courts. 				 																																																										The aim is to ease the pressure on the trial courts, saddled with a pile of cases they would take years to clear.				 																																																										The concept was floated at a conference of chief ministers and high court chief justices in the capital last year. Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have already shown the way by setting up such courts.				 																																																										The proposal, drawn up by Delhi High Court, is under the governments consideration and could get the green signal soon.				 																																																										The plan was discussed last week at a meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Tejendra Khanna. He is understood to have promised the funds that would be required for these courts.				 																																																										These courts, to be established in consultation with the high court, will be modelled along the lines of those in Gujarat. They will stay open between 5.30pm and 7.30pm.				 																Pillar siblings				 																																																										The iron pillar at the Qutub Minar in the capital will now have a clone  to be installed in IIT, Kanpur.				 																																																										The replica is being built by Mumbais Nehru Science Centre, assistant registrar of the IIT, K. V. Satyamurthy, said. 				 																																																										The 7.5-metre tall model will be made with plastic and fibres over a steel frame. 				 																																																										The pillar, sponsored by the National Council of Science Museum, will be unveiled on December 8 during an international conference to be hosted by the IITs metallurgy department.				 																																																	Mumbai: If you have an evening to spare this week, you can watch Chhalia, a brilliant social satire with enough doses of entertainment, on Thursday and Friday (Dec. 6 and 7) at 9pm. The venue is Prtihvi Theatre, located on Juhu Church Road. You can call 022/26149546 for more information.

				 Split-set Gowda eyes Cong
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Gowda in New Delhi. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Oct. 5: The BJP and the Janata Dal (Secular) inched closer to a split today amid suggestions that H.D. Deve Gowdas party was expecting some help from the Congress.																								JD(S) chief and former Prime Minister Gowda met BJP president Rajnath Singh this evening and reportedly made it clear that power would not be transferred.																								Sources on both sides, however, attached little significance to future talks, if any, after chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy decided to call an Assembly session on October 18 to seek a trust vote.																								The BJP is convinced Gowda has bought time, possibly to seek outside support from the Congress. 																								In some ways, the ball is already in the Congress court. Governor Rameshwar Thakur, who earlier belonged to the Congress, has to decide if the cabinets recommendation to call the Assembly is constitutionally valid. 																								The BJP argues that with its ministers having resigned, the cabinet has no authority to make such a recommendation. 																								Sources said many JD(S) legislators did not want snap polls, though the partys impressive showing in the recent civic polls has emboldened Gowda to consider elections. 																								There is pressure on Gowda to explore options. One can say that it all depends on the Congress. The Congress must decide when it wants elections, a JD(S) leader said. 																								The BJP believes this evenings meeting of JD(S) leaders was a charade as Gowda had already made up his mind. 																								Even if the JD(S) had agreed to hand over the reins to the BJP, the father-son duo (Gowda and Kumaraswamy) would not have allowed the government to function. We should call their bluff right away and go for election, a BJP leader said. 																								The Congress cannot come into the picture as long as the JD(S) is an ally of the BJP but the situation is expected to change after tonights Gowda-Rajnath meeting. If the BJP decides to withdraw support to the JD(S), it will be easier for Gowda and the Congress to hobnob with each other.																								In Bangalore, BJP leaders declared they were ready for elections.

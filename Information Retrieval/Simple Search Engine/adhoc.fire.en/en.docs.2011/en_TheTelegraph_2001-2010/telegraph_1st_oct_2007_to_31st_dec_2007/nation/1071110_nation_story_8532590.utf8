				 Indian docs win UK battle
 AMIT ROY 																								London, Nov. 9: Between 7,000 and 10,000 doctors who had come to Britain from India will now have to be treated on an equal basis with their counterparts from the UK and the European Union, an appeal court ruled in London today. 																								It is the most wonderful Diwali gift for us, said a spokesperson for Bapio (British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin), the organisation which raised funds with individual Indian doctors all chipping in small amounts so that the department of health could be hauled before the courts for practising racial discrimination. 																								What counted against the ministry in the judgment handed down today by the appeal judges is that the health ministrys management had not taken into account the adverse consequences of their decision on race relations. 																								The Indian doctors  and some from Pakistan  had come to Britain by getting visas under the Highly Skilled Migrants Programme (HSMP) which meant they expected to be treated on an equal basis with candidates for NHS jobs from within the UK and from the EU. Many sold family property or took big loans in order to make the journey to Britain. 																								But without consulting the doctors from India, the NHS changed the rules overnight in April 2006 so that, henceforth, first preference would be given to the UK and EU candidates. If any jobs were not filled, the doctors from India would be considered but only if they had permission to stay in the country. The odds were deliberately stacked against them in order to force them to return home with loss of face plus ruined family finances. The department of health showed no embarrassment and claimed no promises had ever been made to the Indian doctors. 																								Since the new recruiting methods placed the Indian doctors in a hopeless situation, they sued the department of health in December, 2006. Since the high court ruling earlier this year was not satisfactory, Bapio went to appeal  and won today. 																								The appeal was heard by Lord Justice Sedley, Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Lord Justice Rimer who were unanimous in agreeing that the guidance issued by the department of health on treatment of doctors on HSMP was not lawful. 																								Dr Raman Lakshman, vice chairman of policy for Bapio, said: We are absolutely delighted. This is a truly happy Diwali for thousands of doctors who have been through 18 months of unimaginable stress. Doctors on the HSMP came to the UK on the understanding they are required here and will be treated fairly. This judgment means that these international medical graduates can expect to be treated on merit for the 2008 recruitment process and onwards. 																								In 2007, the NHS did suspend the introduction of the new rules favouring UK and EU candidates until the dispute could be resolved in the courts. 																								This is a landmark victory for international medical graduates as the courts have found not only that the Home Office did not carry out a Race Impact Assessment but also the department of health gave incorrect guidance to NHS employers on the way these doctors are to be treated, commented Dr Satheesh Mathew, vice chairman of Bapio (Operations). 																								Dr Buddhdev Pandya, corporate advisor to Bapio, said he was overjoyed by the ruling. He had been instrumental in setting up Bapio Action Limited, a limited company set up specifically to look into legal avenues for unfair treatment of doctors from the Indian subcontinent. 																								Bapio was set up in 1998 and represents the interests of about 25,000 doctors from the Indian subcontinent who work in the NHS. 																								At this time of joy, Bapio remembers with gratitude Dr Imran Yousaf who joined Bapio in this struggle for justice and whose life was lost as a result of rules brought forth with no concern for their effects on doctors like him, he said. 																								Yousaf, a young doctor who had come from Pakistan, hanged himself because he had bankrupted his family in getting to Britain but found he could not get a job without extending his visa and he could not apply for a visa extension, for which he also did not have the money, without getting a job.

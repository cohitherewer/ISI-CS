				 Jaywalkers fined in Delhi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								New Delhi, Dec. 8: Delhi police have been busy teaching pedestrians road manners, cracking down on nearly 600 jaywalkers in three days.
																								The drive  part of a plan to make roads safer  was launched at six crowded traffic intersections on Wednesday. About 240 jaywalkers were fined on the first day, 181 on the second and 175 on the third.
																								Offenders were fined Rs 20 on the spot and asked to appear before a magistrate who could fine them up to Rs 100.
																								There was a need to instil discipline in pedestrians, said joint commissioner of police Qamar Ahmed.
																								The drive will continue for another 20 days at the same points. We will change the locations then. The drive will be introduced whenever we feel the need to educate people. It is not a one-time effort.
																								Officials claimed Delhi roads saw about 2,000 fatal accidents every year. Of them, Blueline buses  known as killer buses on Delhi roads  accounted for only about 100 deaths.
																								According to police figures, buses accounted for only 16 per cent of the road accidents. Private cars and taxis caused another 10 per cent.
																								Pedestrians are the most vulnerable group on the roads. About 900 pedestrians die each year, a spokesperson said.

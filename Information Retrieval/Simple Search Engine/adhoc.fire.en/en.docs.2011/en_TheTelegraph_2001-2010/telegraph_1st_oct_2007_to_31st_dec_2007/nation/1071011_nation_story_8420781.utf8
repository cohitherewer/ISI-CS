				 Governors guide Bommai is dead
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Oct. 10: S.R. Bommai, the former Karnataka chief minister whose dismissal gifted a ready-reckoner to governors, died here today after prolonged illness. He was 85.																								Bommai died at a time his home state has come under Presidents rule  an issue that he helped redefine through a case in the Supreme Court in 1989.																								On April 21, 1989, some Janata Party MLAs withdrew support to Bommai who had taken over 12 months ago. The then governor, P. Venkatasubbaiah, recommended the imposition of central rule, which was ratified by the then President, K.R. Narayanan.																								Declaring the dismissal unconstitutional, the Supreme Court stipulated floor test as the sole yardstick for verifying majority in case of doubt.																								By the time the court passed the order in March 1994, there was a new government in place in Karnataka. But ever since, the verdict, popularly known as the Bommai case, has served as guiding light for governors.																								Bommai was instrumental in installing in 1983 the first non-Congress government in Karnataka.																								He is survived by two sons and two daughters.

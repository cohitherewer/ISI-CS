				 Cong cleaves third front
 DHIRENDRA K. JHA				 	 Mulayam: New friend?																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: Two key third front allies are pulling in different directions  and the reason is the Congress.																								While the Telugu Desam Partys politics in Andhra Pradesh is based on opposition to the Congress, its UNPA ally Samajwadi Party is veering round to the idea of a rapprochement.																								Samajwadi sources said even the section that till recently seemed determined to continue with its anti-Congress stand was ready to accept that an alliance with the party would benefit both in Uttar Pradesh.																								There is no clash of interests between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh. The warmth in the Congresss ties with the BSP cannot last long as their interests clash. We can come closer if we sort out the clash of personalities, said a leader who till recently was against closer ties with the Congress.																								The Samajwadi sources pointed to their partys softened stand on the nuclear deal in the Lok Sabha yesterday, saying the apparent shift arose from the desire to hold the Congresss hands to face the BSP in Uttar Pradesh.																								Ram Gopal Yadav, the partys leader in the House, had appealed to the Prime Minister to allay concerns over the deal. 																								I request you to clear the apprehensions regarding the deal and get the support of our party and Parliament, Yadav said as he extolled Manmohan Singhs credibility, patriotism and intellectual capabilities.																								PMO sources said the shift in stand was preceded by talks between Congress and Samajwadi leaders. 																								Yadavs speech has caused a flutter in the Desam, which has not taken a firm stand on the deal. The party failed to make any intervention during yesterdays debate. Today, its leaders spoke in different voices. 																								If the deal is good for the country, we will not have a problem with it. The government will have to convince the nation and Parliament, parliamentary party leader Yerran Naidu said. He claimed there was no change in the Samajwadi Partys stand.																								Desam Rajya Sabha member M. Reddy, however, said: We remain opposed to the deal as we consider it a sell-out to America.																								Sources said more than the flip-flop on the deal, it was the shift in the Samajwadi Partys attitude towards the Congress that had created a crisis within the UNPA.

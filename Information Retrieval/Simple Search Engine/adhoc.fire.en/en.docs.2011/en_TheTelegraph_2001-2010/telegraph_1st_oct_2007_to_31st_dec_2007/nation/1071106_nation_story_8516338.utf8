				 Quality check for quack institutes
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 				 	 Mondays report in The Telegraph																								New Delhi, Nov. 5: Institutions like the Pune-based MIT School of Government may soon have to undergo compulsory government evaluation of their academic standards, administrative efficiency and infrastructure.																								The University Grants Commission plans to make this mandatory for higher education institutions to expose those who dupe students with false claims and promises.																								Failure to get accredited might earn the institution the tag of an education quack, top UGC officials said.																								A new law, being considered by the UGC and the human resource development ministry, aims to terminate once and for all the option of remaining unevaluated by the government. 																								We are going to make accreditation mandatory. The law, we feel, may be necessary for the purpose of enforcement, a senior UGC official said.																								Colleges and universities currently have the option of seeking recognition from the government, which, if obtained, increases the credibility of the institute.																								A body under the UGC, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), independently accredits colleges and universities. But this is not equivalent to recognition. It merely tells the institute whether it meets the standards required for recognition and the government to assess the overall status of higher education in India.																								Neither recognition nor accreditation is mandatory for an institute to offer courses. 																								But with the demand for higher education far exceeding the supply, government officials say an increasing number of private institutions successfully sell education profitably without bothering about official evaluation.																								Even a fraud institute that markets itself well is likely to get students willing to shell out lakhs of rupees as fees. Duping students by a play of words is an often-used tactic, an HRD ministry source said. 																								As reported yesterday, the MIT-SOG claims to be commended by the ministry, while the government has clarified it does not commend any institute.																								Students from the institute, which is not recognised by any government authority, had complained that they had fallen prey to the MIT-SOG claim that the HRD ministry endorses it.																								Ironically, HRD minister Arjun Singh had written a congratulatory letter to the institute. Letters of support from several other top politicians were also used by the institute to woo students.																								According to the latest statistics available with the UGC, there are 398 universities and 18,064 colleges in India. Of these, only 140 universities and 3,492 colleges had been accredited at the last count in March this year. Most have remained beyond the scanner of the government. 																								Now, the onus will be on the institute to get accredited or face what some in the HRD ministry are calling negative recognition.																								A deadline will be issued, by when institutions have to send in applications for accreditation.																								The NAAC will first target institutes already recognised by the government.																								A one-time recognition is not enough. The NAAC will first evaluate all the recognised universities and institutes, an official said.																								Next, it will be the turn of unrecognised institutes  like the MIT-SOG  to be scanned by the NAAC.

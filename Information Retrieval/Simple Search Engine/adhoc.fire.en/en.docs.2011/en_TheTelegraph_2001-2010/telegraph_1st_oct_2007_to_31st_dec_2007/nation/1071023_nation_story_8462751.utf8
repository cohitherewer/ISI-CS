				 TN quota for backward minorities
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Karunanidhi																								Chennai, Oct. 22: Tamil Nadu today passed a bill providing 3.5 per cent reservation in jobs and educational institutions to minorities from the backward classes. 																								The quota will be part of the 30 per cent reservation already provided to the Backward Classes (BC) in the state.																								The new law replaces an ordinance promulgated on September 12 following recommendations of the Backward Classes commission.																								The overall quota in jobs and educational institutions provided by the state government is 69 per cent. It includes 20 per cent for the Most Backward Classes (MBC) and 19 per cent for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. 																								The main Opposition party, Jayalalithaas ADMK, was, however, absent from the House when the act was passed.																								Chief minister M. Karunanidhi hailed the golden day in the annals of our Assembly history and a revolutionary day in the history of social justice.																								He said the law was the blossoming of a long and tortuous struggle to ensure social justice to the backward and oppressed sections. 																								Cautioning the House against being lulled into complacency, the DMK patriarch reminded the members that the petition challenging the inclusion of the 69 per cent quota in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution was still pending before the Supreme Court. 																								Our efforts to secure social justice still remains incomplete, he said.																								The chief minister said that acting on the advice of legal experts, his government had opted for compartmental reservation. He expressed hope that the legislation will be a stepping stone to more successes in the future. 																								This is the time for thanksgiving, to pray at the tombs of the pioneers of this movement, including stalwarts like the late T.M. Nair and Natesanar, Karunanidhi said.																								So far, Backward Class Muslims and Christians had been competing with the Other Backward Classes and MBCs, respectively, for jobs and admissions to educational institutions, the chief minister pointed out.																								Both groups, alleging that they were being denied their legitimate share, had been pressing for separate reservations, he said.																								All the parties present in the Assembly today supported the bill.																								Congress MLA Peter Alphonse said the quota could not be dubbed appeasement or vote-bank politics, especially after the stark revelations made by the Rajinder Sachar Committee on the socio-economic status of minorities in the country. 																								The Left parties, too, joined in hailing Karunanidhi. But CPM legislator Bala Barathi came up with a rider, saying it was also time to urge the creamy layer among the backward classes to give up their entitlements voluntarily so that the benefits could reach the poorest of the poor. 																								This appeared to strike a jarring note, sparking angry reactions from some members. 																								A resolution urging the Centre for speedy implementation of the Sethusamudram ship channel project was to have been taken up today but was not included on the days agenda.

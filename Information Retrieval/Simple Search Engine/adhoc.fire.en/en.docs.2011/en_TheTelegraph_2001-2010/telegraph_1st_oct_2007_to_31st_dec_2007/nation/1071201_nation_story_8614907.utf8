				 Moon marriage application surfaces 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Nov. 30: Moon Das had applied for marriage registration 11 days before Avinash Patnaiks body was found in the Mumbai apartment of the Calcutta model, along with those of her mother and uncle.																								Advocate Babita Kar said today that the application in the local sub-registrars office was made on November 11. The bodies were found on the night of November 22.																								Avinash and Moon had come to her chamber and spent three hours on November 8, Kar said, showing a diary where Avinash had scrawled his address. 																								Avinash told me that they would come the next day. But they did not. He came to the court after two days with Moon. They filled in the marriage registration form and submitted it in the sub-registrars office.																								Avinashs father Bhupen Patnaik said he was not aware of the marriage application. He iterated his allegation of foul play in the deaths, saying his son could not have killed Moons mother and maternal uncle or committed suicide. 																								Bhupen alleged that Avinash was killed by Moons men for money and demanded a CBI probe. He accused Mumbai police, which have closed the case, of acting in a one-sided manner. 																								Avinashs elder brother Pritam also raised questions on the way Oshiwara police had gone about their job. 																								The revelation, coming days after disclosures that Avinash transferred money to Moons account on Valentines Day, deepens the mystery over their relationship. The Patnaiks have accused Moon of dumping him after he had spent a fortune on her.

				 SC shifts backlog onus
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Balakrishnan: Done enough																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: The judiciary has done all it can to keep the backlog of cases within manageable limits and now it was the governments turn to provide more funds, staff and infrastructure, Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan has said.																								In his first performance report presented on Law Day (November 26), the chief justice said the judiciary was in a no-win situation because more and more cases were being filed each day. This meant even if judges disposed of cases as fast as they could, more kept piling, he said. 																								He criticised the growing tendency to put the entire blame for the backlog and delays in cases on the countrys less than 14,000 judges. His report said there were a large number of unfilled vacancies for judges.																								The Centre and states, which have a greater role in the selection and appointment of judges, had to ensure there were no judges vacancies at any given time, he said. 																								The judiciary has no power to increase the strength of courts or appoint additional judges, Balakrishnan said.																								Giving examples, he pointed out that the countrys 21 high courts had disposed of 14.5 lakh cases in 2006, an increase of 47 per cent over 9.8 cases in 1999.																								But in 2006, 16 lakh fresh cases were filed in high courts compared with 11 lakh in 1999, pushing up the backlog from 27.5 lakh cases to 36.5 lakh. If only this fact is appreciated, no one can blame the judiciary for pendency and arrears.																								The chief justice said even in trial courts, the rate at which cases were filed was greater than the pace at which they were being disposed of. The average judge in a trial court is managing the disposal of over 1,350 cases every year, far above the average of his counterparts in many other countries. 																								The backlog would be cleared only if the number of high court judges was increased substantially and the strength of trial court judges raised by 10,000, he said.

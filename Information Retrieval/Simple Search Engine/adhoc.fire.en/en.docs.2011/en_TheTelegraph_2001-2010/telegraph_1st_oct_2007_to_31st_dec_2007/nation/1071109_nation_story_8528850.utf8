				 Advanis birthday gift: Tallest tag
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Advani greets well-wishers on his birthday																								New Delhi, Nov. 8: Senior BJP leaders today tried to use L.K. Advanis birthday celebrations to end speculation about the partys candidate for Prime Minister in the next general election.																								The statures of those who came to greet Advani on his 80th birthday and what they said all indicated the former deputy Prime Ministers supremacy in the party.																								Sushma Swaraj provided the clearest hint when she was asked if Advani would lead the party in the next general election. She replied that some things did not need to be formally announced.																								M. Venkaiah Naidu was more explicit, saying: Advaniji is our tallest leader after Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He has been guiding us all these years and we are sure we will move ahead under his leadership in the future, too.																								Party president Rajnath Singh confined himself to praising Advanis leadership qualities, but Sangh parivar sources said he would come up with a definite statement on the subject sometime soon.																								The sources said the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had reconciled itself to the reality that there was no alternative to Advani now and felt that it was time the confusion on the subject of leadership ended.																								There is a possibility that Vajpayee himself would declare Advani his successor. Some believe that the declaration will come before the Gujarat polls even though a general election doesnt seem imminent.																								The unnecessary debate on the issue, which is often presented by the media as a leadership crisis, is doing no good to the party. So it is better to say it firmly that Advani is the leader after Vajpayee even if Rajnath continues as party president, a senior leader said.																								Rajnath, too, understands he is not in a position to challenge his predecessor as party chief, and that the best scenario for him is to be recognised as the number two after Advani, the sources said.																								Most of the senior leaders today dropped in to greet Advani. Every BJP chief minister except Narendra Modi, who is tied down with the Gujarat polls, was present.																								The mood was joyous since the party was about to get its first government in south India.																								The Centres decision to revoke Presidents rule has come as an additional birthday gift to Advani. The main gift, of course, is the overwhelming support he received from the younger leaders who had almost deserted him during the Jinnah controversy.

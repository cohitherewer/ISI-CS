				 Facelift for Rahul
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rahul Gandhi																								Lucknow, Nov. 2: Rahul Gandhi will visit the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters for the first time this month since becoming the Amethi MP three years ago.																								The almost 100-year-old building on Mall avenue that houses the office is being given a hurried facelift  chairs are being replaced and walls painted  for the November 12 meeting of the coordination committee that Rahul will attend.																								Although Rahul has been regularly visiting his constituents since 2004, he has never made the time to visit the party hub. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi last visited the office in 1999 to vote in the AICC elections.																								The other Nehru-Gandhi who visited it before that was Rahuls grandmother Indira Gandhi who showed up for its inauguration in 1978, soon after the sprawling bungalow was purchased by the Congress.																								The coordination committee, of which Rahul, Digvijay Singh, Janardhan Dwivedi and Mohsina Kidwai are members, is expected to discuss ways to revive the Congress in Uttar Pradesh.																								Sources said the formation of the 22-member committee and its proposed meeting in Lucknow may be indicative of the Congress intention to make the city a decision-making centre. All such meetings are generally held in New Delhi.																								Uttar Pradesh party leaders will give Rahul Gandhi a rousing reception when he makes his maiden visit to the party office, state Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh said.																								Party insiders hoped Rahuls presence at the November 12 meeting would bring a semblance of unity to the faction-ridden unit.																								The partys faction feuds are well known. Rahul may act as a catalyst in forging unity in the party, a senior leader said.																								On the agenda of the coordination committee is the revival of the partys village units, which were at one time the root of the Congresss strength in the heartland.																								With an eye on the 2009 Assembly elections, UPCC president Rita Bahuguna Joshi has already given a return-to-village call in the state. She has also been attending district committee meetings for a first-hand feel of the situation.																								I want district committee members to concentrate on each block of the district in groups of five so that they are able to make a major difference, Joshi said.																								The veteran leader from Allahabad, who comes from a Brahmin family and is the daughter of H.N. Bahuguna, urged the party to carve out a distinct identity by distancing itself from the Bahujan Samaj Party.																								Party insiders said she was likely to court the youth and the Brahmins who had recently switched to the BSP. The Brahmin ballot is known to be crucial in influencing voting patterns and determining election results.

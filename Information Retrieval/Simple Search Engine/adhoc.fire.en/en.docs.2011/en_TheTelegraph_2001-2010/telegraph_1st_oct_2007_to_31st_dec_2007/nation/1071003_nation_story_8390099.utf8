				 Ballot cry for Nepal migrants
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 2: A rights group representing thousands of Nepalese settled in India today demanded that Kathmandu make sure the migrants can vote in their country of origin and threatened to enter it in lakhs if rebuffed.																								The demand came at a news conference in the Nepal embassy where the Nepalese Peoples Right Protection Committee also expressed solidarity with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).																								The committee, which has a presence in some 200 towns across India, submitted a 21-point memorandum for Nepal Prime Minister G.P. Koirala. 																								The government has deprived the emigrant Nepalese peoples of their right to vote in the Constituent Assembly election. We strongly demand that right be guaranteed, it said.																								One crore people of Nepalese origin are believed to reside in India.

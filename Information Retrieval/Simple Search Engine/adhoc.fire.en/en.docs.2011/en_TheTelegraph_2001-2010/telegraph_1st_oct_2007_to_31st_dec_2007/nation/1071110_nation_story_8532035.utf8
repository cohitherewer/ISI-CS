				 Defiant Pak judiciary on redemption route
 SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY				 	 Asma Jehangir																								New Delhi, Nov. 9: Pakistans judiciary seems to have come full circle from prostrating themselves when asked to bow by successive military rulers to absolute defiance of Pervez Musharrafs regime.																								Successive military regimes have been granted the fig leaf of political legitimacy by the countrys Supreme Court. But this time, it is the same court that is spearheading the tenuous peoples movement for democracy.																								For years, all rules, even the Constitution, were bent to accommodate military rulers, sometimes in the garb of the usurper theory  whoever usurps power is legitimised, as in Ayub Khans case in 1958  to the theory of necessity that suited Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1969. The theory meant the country couldnt do without the leader.																								Pakistans Supreme Court has always followed a pliable doctrine on military rulers, avid Pakistan watcher and Indian Supreme Court lawyer Rajiv Dhavan said.																								Last fortnight, it was the same courts veiled threat to reassess the theory of necessity that proved the proverbial last straw on Musharrafs back. Since he sacked judges, the movement against him has only intensified.																								So, what prompted the change? Dhavan feels it was the urge for redemption. The Supreme Court had to redeem Pakistans commitment to the rule of law. But whether the pro-democracy forces, spearheaded by sacked Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, the most unlikely of heroes, will prevail depends on Musharrafs next move.																								According to constitutional expert T.R. Andhyarujina, if Musharraf holds elections and stays on as President with Benazir Bhutto as Prime Minister  under a possible US-brokered deal  the judiciary will lose more ground to the executive. 																								But Pakistan Supreme Court lawyer and human rights activist Asma Jehangir, under house arrest now, says such an arrangement will send a wrong message to judges.																								Musharraf has promised elections but he is not talking about restoring the judiciary. Hes packed the judiciary with a bunch of incompetent judges. Lawyers have rejected these judges. They are refusing to appear before these judges and quite rightly sothey will keep fighting against this, she said over phone. 																								If any political settlement leaves judges out, they will always live in fear of being sacked unceremoniously when they show any sign of independence, Jehangir said. 																								On the other hand, if the judiciary is reinstated, it will send a good message. Judges will know that if they hold their ground, they dont have to worry. Everythings very uncertain here. Thousands of lawyers have been arrested and judges put under house arrest.																								A majority of the sacked judges has refused to swear by the provisional constitutional order that effectively clamps martial law.																								Even the few who have taken office havent been accepted by lawyers who have vowed not to appear in their courts.																								It is to their credit that most have refused to toe the government line. By defying the military regime, they are striking out on a new path, Dhavan said, adding the Musharraf regime has been one of the most difficult to deal with. 																								Though there were some comfortable moments for the military regime, like when the court didnt assert itself on Nawaz Sharif, the judiciary seems to be re-asserting itself, Andhyarujina said.																								The attack on the judiciary in Pakistan has been severely criticised by the international legal community.																								In India, judges, fettered by their strict code of conduct, have held their silence. But the bar has been quick to condemn Musharrafs move to sack judges. Such a blatant attack on the independence of the judiciary is unacceptable in any civilised country, the Bar Association of India said.

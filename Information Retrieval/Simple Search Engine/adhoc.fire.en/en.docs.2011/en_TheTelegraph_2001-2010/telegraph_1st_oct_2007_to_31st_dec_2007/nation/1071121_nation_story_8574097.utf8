				 Pawar breaks Nandigram logjam
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: The Nandigram violence will be debated in the Lok Sabha tomorrow after the BJP and the Left parties agreed on the scope and phraseology of the motion.																								The short-duration discussion under Rule 193 will be on the proposal to set up a special economic zone in Nandigram and the consequent large-scale violence. The rule does not entail voting and the discussion is likely to be wrapped up the same day. 																								The Rajya Sabha is expected to debate it on Thursday.																								Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar played referee after several meetings over the past two days ended inconclusively. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee asked him to work out a solution that would be acceptable to both the Left and the BJP.																								Pawar was expected to take a non-partisan view as his NCP has no direct stake in Bengal. He had to confer twice with the participants  V.K. Malhotra and Prabhunath Singh of the NDA and Gurudas Dasgupta, Basudeb Acharya and Rupchand Pal of the Left  to bring them around.																								Tomorrows discussion will be initiated by the leader of the Opposition, L.K. Advani, and conclude with a reply from home minister Shivraj Patil.																								In a departure from House practice, parliamentary affairs minister P.R. Das Munshi will either speak or actively intervene in the debate as other Congress MPs from Bengal are not too conversant with the issue.																								Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury, who was tipped to speak earlier, is abroad.																								The insertion of the SEZ proposal was a carrot to the Left, which initially insisted that the discussion should only focus on the Maoist-instigated violence. It sought to bolster its case by citing the Maoists move to call a 48-hour bandh in five states to protest the Nandigram bloodshed.																								We had a solid case to support our argument. The central forces (in Nandigram) have unearthed sophisticated weapons and landmines, which corroborate the involvement of the Maoists, claimed the CPMs chief whip in the Lok Sabha, Rupchand Pal.																								The CPMs contention was reportedly not entirely supported by the CPI.																								Its parliamentary party leader, Gurudas Dasgupta, said: We want Parliament to perform. We never believed that any issue should be prevented from being discussed. We believed that if Nandigram was discussed, it would clear a lot of misgivings and the Left would be the gainer and not the loser.																								Congress sources said Dasgupta played a role in breaking the stalemate.																								A CPM source said the SEZ peg would give the party a chance to clarify that there was never a formal SEZ proposal, there was no question of eviction or acquisition. It was a rumour. But once it gained currency, the anti-eviction forces built on it to gain political mileage.																								Janata Dal (United) MP Singh, who participated in the reconciliation talks, said the SEZ angle would help the NDA take on the Centre as well as the Bengal government in tandem. 																								SEZ is a central subject but in Bengal, the state government is using it to suppress the aam aadmi, he said.																								The NDA will also beat the Left with the communal versus secular stick. Over 50 per cent of the Nandigram population is Muslim. These so-called secularists have harassed and tortured the minorities, Singh claimed.

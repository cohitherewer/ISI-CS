				 Well wait for India, says IAEA
 OUR BUREAU				 	 ElBaradei (second from left) and Kakodkar (third from left) enjoy a boat ride. (AP)																								Oct. 9: Nuclear watchdog chief Mohammed ElBaradei played the good guest today, saying the IAEA will wait for Delhi to approach the agency for an India-specific safeguards agreement that would activate the nuclear deal with America.																								Whenever they are ready, they can approach us. We will wait for a formal request, he said on the sidelines of an official programme at a Tata Memorial Centre cancer research facility in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai.																								We have always had fruitful discussions with the Indian government, he added.																								In Delhi, sources said the UPA-Left panel on the deal had got precious breathing space as ElBaradeis comments seemed to assure India that the safeguards agreement will not need the usual 45-day notice for the IAEA boards clearance.																								They said the final political decision on whether to go ahead with the deal can now be taken much closer to the November 22 meeting of the agencys board of governors.																								Official sources said ElBaradei will meet foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee tomorrow, while foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon would host a dinner. The IAEA chief is expected to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday.																								In Mumbai, ElBaradei, who is on a four-day visit, said India was a valuable partner in both mandates of the IAEA  the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy and arms control.																								Atomic Energy Commission chief Anil Kakodkar, who presented a model of home-grown radiotherapy machine Bhabhatron-II to ElBaradei, emphasised Indias commitment to peaceful use of nuclear energy.																								Whats true of Bhabhatron-II is also true of our reactors, he said.																								India had entered into a tripartite agreement at the IAEA annual conference in Vienna last month to donate the Rs 2-crore radiotherapy unit to Vietnam as part of the agencys global anti-cancer drive.																								K.A. Dinshaw, the director of the Tata Memorial Centre, said Bhabhatron-II will go a long way in providing affordable radiotherapy treatment. 																								Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) director S. Banerjee said Bhabhatron-II, an advanced version of Bhabhatron-I developed in 2005, ensures that there is no accidental radiation.																								In the morning, ElBaradei stepped out of his hotel as if on a casual stroll and was met by Kakodkar near the Gateway of India.																								The two then took an unusual route to Barc  by boat. ElBaradei also visited the electron beam facility of the Department of Atomic Energy at Vashi before arriving at the Advanced Centre for Treatment Research amp; Education in Cancer in Kharghar.																								Both programmes were out of bounds for the media.																								The IAEA chief described India as a model for all developing countries.

				 Ramadoss closes in on rival
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ramadoss and Venugopal at an AIIMS convocation. File picture																								New Delhi, Nov. 22: Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss moved a step closer to easing out AIIMS director P. Venugopal after the Lok Sabha today passed a bill that sought to fix the retirement age of the institutes head at 65.																								Venugopal, locked in a turf war with Ramadoss, turned 65 in July.																								Besides fixing the retirement age, the bill also sought a maximum tenure of five years for the directors of the AIIMS and that of another medical institute, the Chandigarh-based PGIMER.																								Members of the Opposition, which saw the AIIMS and PGIMER (amendment) bill as an attempt by the government to undermine the autonomy of the countrys premier institutes, clashed with MPs of the ruling UPA before the legislation was passed.																								The Opposition said the bill was aimed at easing out Venugopal.																								The health minister is in a hurry. I had been watching the minister trying to make forays into the AIIMS through direct action or by bills in Parliament, the BJPs Maneka Gandhi said.																								Ramadoss denied the bill was aimed at any individual. 																								We want the AIIMS to be one of the best in the world. We want it to be like Johns Hopkins or Stanford University.																								Not satisfied, the Opposition, led by BJP leader V.K. Malhotra, criticised the government for introducing the bill without referring it to a House panel. 																								It is under pressure from the minister that this is being done. If this is a move to destroy the AIIMS, we condemn it, Malhotra said.																								Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who also handles the parliamentary affairs portfolio, said no rule had been violated.																								The bill was okayed by the (Houses) business advisory committee. However, the Speaker is authorised to take a view on the matter, Das Munshi said.																								Ramadoss said the bill became necessary after Delhi High Court directed the Centre to frame a policy on the service conditions for its employees, including the AIIMS director, and to apply the rules uniformly. 																								The court held that the AIIMS act laying down 62 as the retirement age for teaching faculty and 60 as that for non-teaching faculty did not apply to the director.																								Maneka, whose criticism of the legislation was among the more strident, pointed out that Ramadoss had been creating trouble for Venugopal for a long time. 																								His ministry, Maneka added, has withdrawn Rs 37 lakh from the exchequer to fund the turf war with the heart surgeon.																								The health minister had been trying to get the bill passed for a long time.																								He had tabled a draft ordinance before the cabinet in October and also earlier this week. But it could not be taken up for discussion as other ministers were said to be averse to the idea since the winter session was under way.																								Last month, the matter could not be discussed because of the absence of the law minister.

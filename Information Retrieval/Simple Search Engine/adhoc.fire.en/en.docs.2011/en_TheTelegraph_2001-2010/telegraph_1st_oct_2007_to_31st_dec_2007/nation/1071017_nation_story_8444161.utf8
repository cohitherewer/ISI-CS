				 TN bans cells in school
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Oct. 16: Tamil Nadu has banned mobile phones in all state-aided and private schools, saying the decision was prompted by public demand. 																								Karnataka had banned mobiles in schools a month ago.																								Tamil Nadu school education minister Thangam Thennarasu today said the ban would apply to students across all age groups to ensure a healthy and productive academic environment in schools.																								He said teachers, education experts and parents had been complaining against the cellphone culture among school-going students.																								The parents and teachers feel that mobiles have been a source of distraction at school, hobbling the teachers and standing in the way of students absorbing their lessons.																								The minister said the students obsession with text messages was the biggest problem.																								Such bans are not entirely new in the state. Anna University, Tamil Nadus largest university, has banned cellphones from its campuses and in 230 affiliated engineering colleges.																								In Karnataka, though, the ban was announced on health grounds. Primary and secondary education minister B. Horatti has claimed that mobiles harm the central nervous system and the ears. There is no conclusive scientific evidence for the claim, though.

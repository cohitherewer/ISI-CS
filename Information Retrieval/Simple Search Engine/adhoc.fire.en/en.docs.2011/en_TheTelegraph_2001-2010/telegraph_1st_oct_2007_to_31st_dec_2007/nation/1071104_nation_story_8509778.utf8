				 General wages war on judges
																								Excerpts from General Pervez Musharrafs proclamation of emergency.																								Reasons																								 There is visible ascendancy in the activities of extremists and incidents of terrorist attacks, including suicide bombings																								 Some members of the judiciary are working at cross-purposes with the executive and legislature in the fight against terrorism and extremism, weakening the government and the nations resolve																								 Increasing interference by some members of the judiciary in government policy, adversely affecting economic growth																								 Constant interference in executive functions, including but not limited to the control of terrorist activity, economic policy, price controls, downsizing of corporations and urban planning, has weakened the writ of the government																								 Some hard core militants, extremists, terrorists and suicide bombers, who were arrested and being investigated, were ordered to be released. The persons so released have subsequently been involved in heinous terrorist activities																								 Some judges, by overstepping the limits of judicial authority, have taken over the executive and legislative functions																								 It is of paramount importance that the Honourable Judges confine the scope of their activity to the judicial function and not assume charge of administration																								 The humiliating treatment meted to government officials by some members of the judiciary on a routine basis has demoralised the civil bureaucracy																								 A situation has thus arisen where the government of the country cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution and as the Constitution provides no solution for this situation, there is no way out except through emergent and extraordinary measures. 																								The order																								I, General Pervez Musharraf, chief of the army staff, proclaim emergency throughout Pakistan																								I hereby order and proclaim that the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan shall remain in abeyance 																								What it means																								 This proclamation shall come into force at once. 																								 The fundamental rights shall remain suspended 																								 The Supreme Court or a high court and any other court shall not have the power to make any order against the President or the Prime Minister or any person exercising powers or jurisdiction under their authority																								 All persons who immediately before the commencement of this order were in office as judges of the Supreme Court, the federal Shariat court or a high court, shall be governed by and be subject to such further orders as the President may pass																								 The Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) and the provincial assemblies shall continue to function																								 No court and any tribunal or other authority shall call or permit to be called in question this order, the proclamation of emergency or any order made in pursuance thereof 																								 No judgment, decree, writ, order or process whatsoever shall be made or issued by any court or tribunal against the President or the Prime Minister or any authority designated by the President.

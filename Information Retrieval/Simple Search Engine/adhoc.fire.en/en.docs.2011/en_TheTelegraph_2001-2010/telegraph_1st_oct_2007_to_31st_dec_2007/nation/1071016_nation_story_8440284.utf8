				 Buying a car? Ask your child 
 AARTI DUA																								Mumbai, Oct. 15: Pestering is pass, children in India have graduated to acting as consultants for their parents.																								More and more couples are now turning to their little ones for advice when they buy mobile phones or plan a holiday, according to KidSense 2007, the second edition of the Walt Disney Company India and GroupMs study on children in the country.																								Conducted by research organisation IMRB International, the study covered 2,240 children between 8 and 14 and 1,320 parents. The respondents were drawn from six metros (Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad) and four Tier-1 cities (Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Ludhiana and Jaipur). 																								The children were divided into two categories: tweens, between 8 and 12, and teenagers. 																								This study busts the myth that kids are not involved in adult categories, said Hemant Mehta, senior vice-president and country manager, IMRB International. 																								The study shows that 63 per cent of the children are involved in purchase decisions. Their involvement is the highest in clothes and bicycles. Parents also consult their children while buying cellphones and for big-ticket purchases like cars. 																								There isnt much difference between metro and Tier-1 kids, except for the computer category. For instance, if 69 per cent of metro kids are involved in holiday decisions, it is 66 per cent for Tier-1 kids. For buying computers, its 69 per cent for metro kids and 50 per cent for Tier-1 kids.																								So, how do these kids know so much? The television is the oracle for 93 per cent of them. Teens read more than tweens, as do Tier-1 kids over their metro counterparts.																								But parents who bank on their little consultants cannot afford to be tight-fisted. Most children (71 per cent) are driven by brands. Metro kids are more brand savvy (75 per cent) than Tier-1 kids (68 per cent). Tier-1 kids give more importance to style and looks than metro kids. 																								Thats not to say theyre short on substance, though. Rather, todays tech-savvy kids demand the best. So if its mobile phones, they want one with an MP3 player, and for cars and two-wheelers, mileage is the No. 1 factor.																								Its time players in categories like mobile phones and computers start targeting these consultant kids, said Vikram Sakhuja, GroupMs South Asia chief operations officer.																								As for Walt Disney Television, its in its DNA to get involved with its target group, says Antoine Villeneuve, who took over as the companys senior vice-president and managing director for India in June.																								To do that, it is important for us to know them and their expectations so that we can meet them. This study will help us do just that, Villeneuve adds.

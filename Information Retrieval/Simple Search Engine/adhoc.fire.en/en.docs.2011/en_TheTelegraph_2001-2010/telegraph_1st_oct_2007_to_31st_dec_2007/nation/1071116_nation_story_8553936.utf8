				 Iconic editor raises the bar
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Evans in Delhi. (AP)																								New Delhi, Nov. 15: Harold Evans believes the story of the Gujarat riots is far from dead.																								The victims of the communal carnage may no longer find their faces on front pages of newspapers, but justice has not yet been visited on the malefactors, the legendary editor said at a lecture in the capital.																								The story is not dead until we know the why as the what.																								The former editor of Sunday Times, who raised the bar for investigative journalism, said official commissions have the powers of subpoena, but may not always have the required discipline of detachment and the zeal to pursue a case.																								Like Moses, but in the much colder room of the posh Imperial Hotel, Evans read out his ten commandments for journalism in an age of violence.																								Evans, whose fight for Thalidomide children  which eventually ensured that families were compensated for the drug that caused deformity in their kids  won him a place in the journalism hall of fame, said it was no use printing the truth once.																								According to him, a running sore in a society requires more than a one-time Band-Aid.																								The seeds of violence that exploded in 30 years of urban warfare in Ireland and bombing in Britain were sown in the years when nobody bothered to follow the escalating grievances of the Catholic minority. It was seen as a boring story, he said.																								The snare of token patriotism is also to be avoided, he said, adding that when emotions run high, the press is all too often tempted to follow the official line out of a mistaken sense of patriotism.																								My predecessor in the thirties as the editor of The Times wrote in his diary: Night after night Im doing everything I can ensure to publish nothing that will offend the susceptibilities of Herr Hitler.																								He was proud of suppressing news of the violence being done by Hitler in Germany because the policy of the Chamberlain government was not to upset Hitler.

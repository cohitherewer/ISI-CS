				 Mamata, BJP sing Nandi-nuke tune
 							 - Trinamul chief smells Congress deal with CPM, sends aide along with Advani to Nandigram OUR BUREAU																								Nov. 13: Mamata Banerjee and the BJP have spoken in the same vein after a long interlude, Nandigram and the nuclear deal setting the backdrop for the seemingly coincidental chorus.																								Mamata, who had distanced herself from the NDA, and the BJP today separately accused the Congress of striking a deal with the CPM: silence on Nandigram for a softer stand on the nuclear deal.																								I wonder why the Centre remained silent for over 10 months despite my several requests to the Prime Minister and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to take note of the terror being unleashed by the CPM on villagers in Nandigram. I made frantic calls to them for 12 days from November 1, but none of them have done anything, the Trinamul Congress chief said this afternoon.																								I believe that the Centre has struck a deal with the CPM so that the party allows it to operationalise the Indo-US deal.																								The outburst virtually buries hopes of a rapprochement being nursed by sections in both Trinamul and the Congress. Fuelling speculation, Mamata also despatched a trusted aide to accompany L.K. Advani to Nandigram today.																								Mamata cold-shouldered PCC chief Somen Mitras appeal to float a secular democratic alliance in the wake of the Nandigram bloodshed. 																								I have already done my bit by inviting all political parties, including the state Congress, to share a platform of the Save Farmland Committee minus the BJP. Two of their leaders did participate in a meeting and went to Raj Bhavan with us. But the alliance did not materialise, she said.																								Asked why a Congress-Trinamul alliance did not work out in Bengal, Mamata shot back: Ask Pranabda. Will Pranab Mukherjee agree to such an alliance?																								On the presence of Trinamul MP Mukul Roy in Advanis delegation, she said: Mukul was sent so that he could meet the victims in Nandigram, nothing else.																								Mamata said she was not permitted to visit Nandigram but Advaniji was not untouchable to the CPM and he was allowed to go. Mukul could not reach Nandigram if he did not accompany the leader of the Opposition.																								Speaking almost identical language, the BJP accused the Centre and the Left of trading concessions on the Bengal flare-up and the nuclear deal.																								The BJP leadership has been taken aback by the sudden hint from the Left that it might allow the government to negotiate India-specific safeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency.																								The main Opposition party will allege in Parliament that the Left had softened its stand on the nuclear deal following the public outrage over Nandigram.																								The partys decision to send such stalwarts as L.K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj to Nandigram today reflects the importance it attaches to the issue.																								When the winter session of Parliament begins on Thursday, the nuclear deal will almost certainly be pushed to the second slot as the BJP steps up the heat on the Bengal violence.

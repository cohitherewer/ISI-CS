				 Minister on wrong track
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Pachauri (fourth from left) crosses the tracks. Picture by Pankaj Dwivedi																								Bhopal, Oct. 4: A Union minister caught on camera walking across railway tracks  a crime punishable with up to six months in jail  has claimed he was only inspecting them. 																								Suresh Pachauri got off the Tamil Nadu Express at platform No. 2 in Itarsi, a busy railway junction 60km from Bhopal, and crossed the tracks to reach platform No. 1 where he boarded the Mumbai-Howrah Express, witnesses said. A footbridge connects the two platforms, but perhaps the minister did not see it.																								Local railway officials declined to comment.																								Crossing the tracks is an offence under Section 147 of the Indian Railway Act and can attract a fine of Rs 1,000 and/or a jail term of six months. 																								The BJP state unit sat on dharna today, demanding that the railways register a case against Pachauri for the incident on Monday. The ministers conduct is neither sensible nor responsible. spokesperson Archana Chitnis said.																								Itarsi is one of the countrys busiest junctions, with 138 trains passing through it every day. 																								But the Congress  to which the junior minister for personnel and parliamentary affairs belongs  defended him. 																								Madhya Pradesh unit spokesperson Manak Aggarwal said the minister had authorised him to say he was on duty to inspect the tracks. 																								He has committed no wrong as he was on duty. The BJP is jealous of his growing popularity, Aggarwal said.																								A railway spokesperson said the minister cannot be accused of violating the law if he was inspecting the station in the company of railway officials. The trespassing law is not applicable to railway officials on duty, he said.																								However, local railway officials said they were not aware of any formal inspection. It would be unusual for anyone other than the railway minister or railway officials to inspect the tracks. 																								Pachauri is a four-time Rajya Sabha MP whose term ends early next year.

				 Dinner bribe plea gets boot
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT				 Sonia Gandhi																								New Delhi, Nov. 12: The Supreme Court today quashed a petition seeking penal action against Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Left leaders Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan for inducing MPs and MLAs to vote for their presidential candidate by throwing a poll-eve dinner.																								The petition, filed by Rashtriya Mukti Morcha (RMM) president Ravinder Kumar, had been dismissed earlier by a trial court on the ground that the Constitution barred criminal complaints in such matters. It also told Kumar that only the Supreme Court was mandated under Article 71 of the Constitution to deal with election-related cases.																								Kumar, also a Supreme Court advocate, had urged the court to summon the quartet and try them under Section 171E of the Indian Penal Code, which makes bribing a voter a punishable offence.																								A person who tries to bribe by treating  gratification through food, drink and entertainment  would, however, only have to pay a fine.																								Sonia and the others had hosted a party for hundreds of electors at Ashoka Hotel two days before the presidential polls to introduce and request their votes for Pratibha Patil, Kumar had alleged.																								Delhi High Court upheld the trial court order on September 17, 2007, and imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on Kumar. He then moved the Supreme Court.																								The RMM leaders counsel, P.N. Lekhi, today argued that a dinner days before polls should be construed as an electoral offence. 																								He said an invite had been issued for the Ashoka Hotel party, where Patil was introduced. All these fulfilled the criteria of illegal gratification under Section 171E of the IPC, the counsel added.																								The trial court, Lekhi said, instead of taking a prima facie view of the complaint had dismissed it at the outset.																								But a three-judge apex court bench, headed by the chief justice, questioned how holding a party and inviting people can be treated as an electoral offence and threw out the petition.																								Kumar had filed a separate complaint relating to another party thrown by Sonia to introduce vice-presidential nominee Hamid Ansari. That, too, was dismissed by the lower court.

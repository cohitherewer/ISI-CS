 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Off pedestal after gold blessing				 																																																										She was there for all to see and pray. Then, one day, she suddenly turned rich and disappeared.				 																																																										A 300-year-old statue of Kali, thought for generations to be made of ordinary metal, turned out to be of solid gold. Craftsmen giving it a makeover made the discovery. Some preferred to call it a blessing, disguised for centuries.				 																																																										The idol, from a village temple near the famous hill shrine of Palani, looked like any other statue because of its old and dusty surface and lack of sheen. It was believed that the statue was made of panchadhatu, an alloy of five metals.				 																																																										Realising that the gold was a potential security risk, the temples trustees have decided to keep it in a bank locker, robbing countless devotees of their darshan. It will be brought to the temple only on important occasions.				 																																																										The 1.5-foot tall statue, which weighs a little more than 8kg, is estimated to be worth Rs 7.5 crore. The temple authorities have also asked for police protection.				 																Cops brew caf checks				 																																																										Mumbais cyber cafs are bracing for stiffer safety checks after evidence showed that blast plots were brewed in such outlets.				 																																																										Mumbai police plan to compel the owners to install key-loggers, a tool to monitor users. 				 																																																										The recent explosions in Hyderabad, and the one in Mumbai last year, were among the attacks that were found to have been plotted in Internet chatrooms. 				 																																																										Licences and registration with the police might be made mandatory.				 																																																										The number of computers and the internet protocol address of each PC will be part of the details that will have to be furnished. 				 																																																										The police are in talks to buy the cyber activity remote monitoring system security software from Micro Technologies. Companies use the system to track workers activity and restrict access to websites.				 																																																										Caf owners who fail to comply with the scheme will be fined and could face tougher action from the police, a senior official of the anti-terrorist squad said.				 																Games nudge to slum goal				 																																																										With political parties sounding the poll bugle, this may just turn out to be another election promise but, if fulfilled, it could transform the landscape of Indias capital. 				 																																																										Sonia Gandhi has promised that the Congress government in Delhi will free the city of slums by the time the Commonwealth Games begins in October 2010. 				 																																																										She made the announcement recently while inaugurating a complex of 50,000 new homes under the Rajiv Gandhi Awas Yojana in west Delhis Bawana. The complex is a drop in the ocean compared with the larger problem of housing that Delhi faces. We will provide housing facilities to all slum dwellers by the 2010 Games.				 																																																										However, officials in the ministry of poverty alleviation and housing said the target will not be easy to meet with just over three years left to complete the task. 				 																Pay boost				 																																																										Bangalore has won an upgrade but the benefits might be limited to a small group of government employees.				 																																																										The Centre last week accorded the city A1 status, putting it on a par with Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Hyderabad in terms of the cost of accommodation.				 																																																										Under the notification issued by the finance ministry, the house rent allowance of these employees would double to 30 per cent of the basic salary. The central staff will enjoy the benefits from the day the decision was made effective, but the pay boost for state employees will have to be cleared by the Karnataka cabinet. Some private companies might also raise rent allowances. 				 																																																	Delhi: Savour lemon shell lobsters, charcoal roasted prawns, honey crusted duck, all in aromatic oriental spices, at a Chinese festival at Uppals Orchid till this weekend. Vegetarians can relish mushrooms. It is on NH-8, near the international airport. Time: 3pm to 11.30pm. Meal for two costs Rs 2,500.

				 Calcutta caper that crashed
 SATISH NANDGAONKAR				 	 An investor looks at the BSE screen on Thursday when the sensex suffered its second-biggest fall. (PTI) 																								Mumbai, Oct. 18: If Calcuttas Munnabhai had shown some lage raho spirit and held his patience for two more days, he wouldnt have needed to send the bomb hoax to Indias biggest bourses that has landed him behind bars.																								Dinesh Kumar Mahabir Prasad Gupta had signed himself as Munnabhai on the north Calcutta cyber cafs register on Monday as he despatched his email threat to blow up the Bombay and National Stock Exchanges. He wanted to bring the sensex down and make up his losses, he has explained to police.																								The sensex obliged since yesterday, crashing initially and then recovering some ground. Today, the index scripted its second-biggest fall after appearing to defy gravity for three months. But the plunge had nothing to do with Guptas threat, nor was he in a position to take advantage of it.																								The 34-year-old small-time travel agent, arrested from his Rabindra Sarani home by Mumbai police on Tuesday, said he had lost Rs 40,000 on the stock market in the past two weeks.																								He expected the sensex to crash after his email. He planned to purchase maximum shares when the markets were down, through a relative who is a sub- broker (and sell when the share prices rose again), said the Mumbai joint commissioner of police (crime), Rakesh Maria.																								The police said Gupta had not revealed which stocks he had invested in, or how he had lost his money at a time the sensex had kept rising.																								Its possible he was a day trader who bought and sold from the morning till the session-end for short margins, and netted his business at closing bell without rolling it to the next day. 																								Profit margins are small in this form of trading, and a trader who buys at Rs 100 a stock in the morning can end up with Rs 80 for the same stock at close.																								Guptas email was received by Suprabhat Lala, NSE assistant vice-president, just when he and his colleagues were celebrating. A single-session jump of 640 points had taken the sensex to a peak of 19,000 points and pushed up the Nifty, the NSE index.																								The mail  sent apparently by a Pakistani agent from the account Abdul.rashmanyahoo.co.in  threatened to bomb the stock exchanges in the next 48 hours. A day ago, a bomb had killed six in a Ludhiana theatre and the previous week, a terror strike had bloodied the Ajmer Sharif dargah.																								Since the BSE was bombed on March 12, 1993, the police have never taken chances. The cyber cell stepped up security.																								Internet service providers helped the police zero in on the Calcutta cyber caf, inspector Mukund Pawar said. His team flew to Calcutta on Tuesday.																								Gupta, a Class XII dropout, has been arrested under the Indian Penal Code for criminal intimidation, but may also be charged under the Information Technology Act, 2000. He could get up to seven years.

				 Isro tries an Air Deccan
 							 - Attempt to cut costs with rocket that sucks in oxygen T.V. JAYAN 																								Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 4: Indias first rocket that sucks in oxygen from the air to fire itself into space will be launched in three months, a senior Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) official said today.																								The test flight of the rocket using air-breathing propulsion will be conducted from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota by January next year, Byrana Nagappa Suresh, the director of Isros Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram, told the annual meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences.																								Terming it an attempt to do an Air Deccan in accessing space, Suresh said the test would be conducted on a Rohini-series sounding rocket weighing 125kg, which Isro uses for routine atmospheric studies.																								Using the oxygen available in the atmosphere to burn fuel will significantly reduce the payload on board as the rocket does not have to carry ultra-cooled liquid oxygen. 																								Nearly 85 per cent of the weight carried by a rocket like the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle is propellant  comprising both fuel and super-cooled oxygen. 																								Depending on the fuel used, oxygen constitutes one-third to 90 per cent of the propellant.																								A switchover to air-breathing propulsion is a big step towards cutting launch costs from $12,000 a kg to between $500 (Rs 20,000) and $1,000 a kg.																								There are several technological challenges, however, Suresh told the meeting. Its like lighting a matchstick in a hurricane, he said, referring to sustaining of combustion when air comes in at high speed. 																								But there is no reason why we cant do it, when most turbojet engine-fired commercial aircraft do it. 																								It is a good thing that Isro is finally adopting the air-breathing propulsion system, said H.S.A. Mukunda, an aerospace scientist at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. But they should have done it 20 years ago.																								Isro eventually plans to use air-breathing technology in reusable launch vehicles, which can be recovered after launching a satellite successfully into orbit. 																								The first reusable rocket is scheduled to hit the launchpad later next year. We will attach the air-breathing module to the second or third reusable launch vehicle, Suresh said.																								According to Isros road map, by 2020, its launch vehicles will use two stages to put satellites into orbit. The first stage will be recoverable while in the second, the vehicle will be blown up in space after completing its mission. 																								By 2030, Isro plans to graduate to single-stage launch vehicles that will come back to earth safely after a successful launch.

				 Graft CD threat to CM amp; wife
 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR																								Shimla, Nov. 14: Expelled Congressman Vijay Singh Mankotia has threatened to put out a video CD that will expose how Virbhadra Singh and his wife are allegedly using corrupt means to amass wealth.																								In May, Mankotia had put out an audio CD targeting the Himachal chief minister and his wife, Pratibha. He was then thrown out of the Congress and has since joined Mayavatis BSP. 																								With elections around the corner, a panicky Congress has petitioned the high court to ban the CD.																								We want a ban on the CD as it can misguide voters and spoil the Congresss image. Mankotia had misled people with a similar CD during the Hamirpur bypolls, state Congress general secretary Kuldeep Singh Pathania said.																								The Congress has also urged the court to bar the media from broadcasting or publishing the CDs contents. 																								The petition is likely to come up for hearing next week.																								Mankotia refused to disclose when he would put out the CD. But the petition filed yesterday could prompt him to speed things up.

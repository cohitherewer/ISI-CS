				 India lags in patent race 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 7: India may be seen as a global hub for innovation, but multinational corporations have filed more patents in India over the past decade than all of Indias public and private institutions, a new World Bank report has said.																								Among the top 50 applicants for patents in India, 44 were foreign firms. Only six were Indian  among these, three were public institutions, one was a public corporation, and just two were private Indian firms, both in the pharmaceutical industry.																								The report highlights the need for action to promote commercialisation and strengthen links among industries, universities and public research laboratories  a goal the Indian government has often articulated over the past two decades.																								Overall, India appears better at producing basic knowledge than commercialising knowledge, said the report, Unleashing Indias Innovation. But India has low research and development costs  primarily because of low pay to scientists and engineers, the main cost component of research spending, the report said. 																								The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the defence ministry were the two Indian public agencies with the highest number of patents in India, followed by the Steel Authority of India. The two private companies in the top 50 patent applicants are Ranbaxy and Dr Reddys Laboratories. 																								The report also calls for formal research efforts specially targeted at the poor. Existing pro-poor initiatives need to be scaled up, said Mark Dutz, a senior economist with the World Bank and editor of the report. 																								Inclusive innovation can play a critical role in lowering the costs of goods and servi- ces and in creating income-earning opportunities for poor people, he said. 																								While India is emerging as a top global innovator in information technology and biotechnology, less than 3 per cent of the Indian workforce is in the modern private sector while 90 per cent remains in the informal sector.																								The report said the average enterprise productivity in finance, insurance and real estate companies is nearly 23 times more than that in agriculture. But these industries account for only 1.3 per cent of national employment. 																								The disparities in productivity levels across firms within manufacturing sectors is wider in India than in China, Mexico or the Russian federation, said Dutz.

				 Lawsuit threat, Lara in crease
 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI				 	 Brian Lara																								Mumbai, Nov. 29: The threat of a lawsuit stopped Brian Lara from reneging on his contract with the breakaway Indian Cricket League, sources have told The Telegraph.																								The retired West Indian star was close to scripting a deal with the Indian Premier League, run by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. But senior officials of the Zee-owned ICL told him he could not walk out on them without legal hassles.																								Lara had met IPL boss Lalit Modi in London earlier this month to find out if he could join the boards official league, a top BCCI source said.																								But the board doesnt want to get into any legal hassles with Zee right now. So Lara was told that a decision could be taken only after a detailed study of his contract with the rebel league, the source said.																								It was then that the West Indian backed out.																								Like other national boards, the West Indies Cricket Board is against Caribbean players joining the ICL. But since boards dont have contracts with retired players, Lara and other former internationals are generally considered free to play for whoever they want.																								Still, even retired players do not want to offend their national boards. Lara has often said he would like to help the WICBs development programme once he is through playing cricket at all levels.																								Perhaps that (unwillingness to annoy the WICB) is what caused Lara to approach the IPL, the board source said.																								Unlike Mohammed Yousuf of Pakistan who has pulled out of the breakaway league and is being backed by the Pakistan Cricket Board in his legal battles with the Zee group, Lara lacks the support of the Caribbean cricket authorities.																								Lara sought indemnity against ICLs legal battles from the IPL, but we made it clear that it would not be possible, the board official said.																								Cricket circles had been buzzing over the past couple of weeks about Lara, the ICLs biggest star, walking out of the rebel league and joining the IPL. The board fanned the speculation by saying its doors would always stay open for Lara, prompting an alarmed ICL to accuse it of playing dirty.																								Earlier this week, however, Lara arrived in India and said he was committed to the rebel tournament.																								The BCCI source, however, said he would not rule out Lara joining the IPL at a later stage.																								It all depends on his bargaining power and negotiating skills with the ICL. We have left it to him. If he wants to play in the IPL, it will be his individual choice and he will bear the legal burden, if theres any. We are out of it, the official said.																								Till then, the master batsman will be batting for Mumbai Champs in his bright orange Manish Arora outfit. The ICL gets off the ground tomorrow with the Delhi Jets playing the Chandigarh Lions at Panchkula, Haryana.

				 Study hard, save your heart
 G.S. MUDUR New Delhi, Oct. 1: The link between education and heart disease has become sharper in India with a new study revealing that people with the highest education appear to be at the lowest risk of coronary heart disease.																								The study released today has also shown that people with the lowest education had the highest prevalence of risk factors for heart disease, including tobacco use, lack of physical activity and high blood pressure. 																								Doctors said the trends reflect an evolution of Indias epidemic of heart disease. The high prevalence of risk factors is shifting from the educated, affluent groups to the lower levels in the socio-economic hierarchy.																								This is a bad portent for public health in the country, said K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, and lead author of the study, published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 																								As the epidemic advances, more and more poor people will be affected by more and more of the risk factors for heart disease, he told The Telegraph. 																								The study covered 19,900 people engaged in diverse occupations across India  from postgraduate executives in Hyderabad to technicians in electronic industries, from staff in a cycle factory in Ludhiana to tea garden workers in Dibrugarh. 																								The study found that only two out of 10 men who are graduates used tobacco, but the figure was seven out of 10 among men educated up to primary school. 																								Over 40 per cent of graduates take time off for physical activity, three times higher than the proportion of men who dropped out before completing primary school. 																								The study revealed similar education-linked differences among women. 																								The findings are in line with earlier studies in the West that show heart disease epidemics evolve over time. Early during the epidemic, the affluent adopted unhealthy lifestyles  fat-laden food, sedentary lifestyles and tobacco use. However, over the years, while people in the lower socio-economic groups have begun to imitate such lifestyles, the educated affluent groups are using health information to change. 																								Health information is more likely to percolate among the educated. Theyre the first adapters. They take care of themselves by smoking less, or consuming better food, doing more exercise and accessing healthcare, said Dorairajan Prabhakaran, a research team member and professor of cardiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. 																								Public health experts said several other factors also contribute to making the poor and less educated the most vulnerable. Their choice is limited by economics. Edible oils with high transfats (bad fats) are among the cheapest oils, Reddy said. 																								While the government had earlier this year committed funds for a programme to prevent cardiovasdular diseases, researchers said the new findings suggest that preventive campaigns should be specially targeted to less educated groups. 																								While high levels of education will take time to seep across society, Reddy said, the government could fast-track health literacy with campaigns against tobacco, bad oils and high salt consumption aimed at such vulnerable groups.

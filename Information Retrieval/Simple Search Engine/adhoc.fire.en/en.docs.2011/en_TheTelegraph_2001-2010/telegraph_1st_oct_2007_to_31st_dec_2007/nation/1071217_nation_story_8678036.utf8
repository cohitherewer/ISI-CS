 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Hyderabad, Dec. 16: Doctors in Andhra Pradesh hospitals have sought gun licences to protect themselves from attacks by the public.
																								The junior doctors association applied for the licences for its members after the government did not respond to its demand for an ordinance making an attack on medics on duty a non-bailable offence, sources said. 
																								On Friday, the day after junior doctors returned to work after an 11-day strike demanding protection, house surgeon Vijayalakshmi was attacked by a woman whose relative had died in Government Maternity Hospital.
																								The 24-year-old was hit on the head with a metal stand and struck with chappals by the woman, who took away her stethoscope, saying: Why do you need this when you dont know how to take the pulse of the patient?
																								A senior doctor of an ESI hospital was roughed up by relatives of a patient in ICU, who complained of delay in treatment. The doctor had to flee as 10 persons were chasing him, a witness said. 
																								Doctors in all government and private hospitals here, led by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and the Indian Dental Association, will skip work tomorrow. 
																								Ravinder Reddy, head of the IMAs Andhra chapter, said: It is astonishing doctors are made scapegoats for lack of proper healthcare in government hospitals. 
																								Junior doctors in government hospitals have vacated hostel rooms and gone home in preparation for a long strike. Ramesh Kumar, of the junior doctors association, said they had resumed work after an assurance of protection from the high court. The strike had started after an MIM legislator allegedly beat up doctors on December 2.

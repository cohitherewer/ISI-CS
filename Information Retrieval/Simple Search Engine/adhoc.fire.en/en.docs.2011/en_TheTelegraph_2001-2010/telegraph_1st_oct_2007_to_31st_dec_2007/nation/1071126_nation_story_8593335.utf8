				 BJP salt in secular wound 
 							 - Govt welcomes Bangla illegal immigrants, not refugees, says resolution on writer OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  New Delhi, Nov. 25: Out of sight, Taslima Nasreen is becoming a symbol of the CPMs humiliation that refuses to fade away.					The BJP today adopted a resolution that cited the controversy to expose the hypocrisy of secular parties on immigrants.																								India is a country which has been a victim of illegal immigration of millions from Bangladesh. Mass scale illegal immigration from Bangladesh has served both the Congress and the CPM as a convenient vote bank even though it may have hurt Indias security concerns. The irony of the Taslima issue is that the Centre and the Bengal government feel that millions of illegal immigrants are welcome in India but a victim of political persecution is not.																								The resolution, adopted after a meeting of the BJPs office-bearers, demanded that Taslima be treated as a political refugee in India with the right to live with dignity and security.																								The BJP took care not to create the impression that it was playing politics on the Taslima controversy and included other issues, such as Nandigram and the Uttar Pradesh blasts, in the resolution. 																								The party also sought to project the controversy as an example of the breakdown of authority of the central government and the Prime Minister on matters of governance.																								Accusing the UPA government of perpetuating the politics of the vote bank even if it has an impact on national security and integrity, the BJP said: The harassment of the Bangladeshi author by the Bengal government has thrown up important questions on how a victim of persecution is treated by a civilised state.																								The BJP equated the treatment of Taslima to the Shah Bano issue in which the Congress government had brought legislation to override a Supreme Court judgment on maintenance.																								To eject a refugee under pressure from religious groups is to submit to Islamic fundamentalists. The political thought process which produced the legislation to nullify the effect of the Shah Bano judgment of the Supreme Court involved a surrender to fundamentalists. This is precisely what the Bengal government has done.																								The party realises that it runs the risk of being accused of doublespeak, considering the Sangh parivars record on tolerance. But it is going all out to highlight the Taslima row to show that secular parties, too, could be tarred with the same brush.

				 AIIMS strike greets Target-Venugopal bill
 																											- Resident doctors to boycott out-patient cell  OUR BUREAU 				 	 Ramadoss: Tussle continues																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: Doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences today decided to go on a strike minutes after the Rajya Sabha passed a bill that could end the tenure of director P. Venugopal.																								The AIIMS Resident Doctors Association, which received support from Venugopal during last years anti-reservation protests, announced this evening that its members would boycott the institutes out-patient department (OPD) services from tomorrow. 																								This (bill) is aimed only at removing the director to interfere in the institutes autonomy. We cannot allow that, said Kumar Harsh, the president of the association. 																								Others on campus, in particular the reserved-category students, fear the strike decision could worsen a caste conflict simmering for over a year now. 																								Some of these doctors want to go to work tomorrow, but said they were concerned they would not be allowed to. 																								Todays decision is the latest in a series of partial or complete strikes by the association each time Venugopals position as director has come under threat. The OPD is managed primarily by resident doctors, and their boycott makes it hard for the facility to function, AIIMS officials admitted. 																								Emergency and other services will be operational tomorrow, but the association held out the threat of a complete shutdown of all facilities if President Pratibha Patil signs the amended AIIMS bill. 																								If the President signs on the bill, we will have to take stronger measures, Harsh said. 																								Earlier this week, the Lok Sabha had passed the amendment to the AIIMS act, fixing the retirement age of the institutes director at 65. 																								Venugopals appointment letter gave him a tenure of five years or till he turned 65, whichever happens first. 																								He turned 65 in July this year, but managed to procure a stay from Delhi High Court against a decision by the health ministry to sack him.																								The ministry, headed by Anbumani Ramadoss, cited the AIIMS act, which lists 62 as the retirement age for a non-medical official and 60 for doctors. It argued that Venugopal who then headed the cardio-thoracic department must quit, whichever category he considered himself a part of. 																								But the high court held that since the AIIMS act did not mention a specific retirement age for the director, Venugopal could not be sacked without an amendment to the law. 																								In the Rajya Sabha today, the BJP and the ADMK opposed the passage of the bill, which was not originally listed in the days business. 																								Ramadoss was interrupted by the Opposition parties as he introduced the bill. 																								The BJP and the ADMK continued to shout slogans even after K. Rahman Khan, the deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha, said it had been cleared by the Business Advisory Committee.

				 First step to nuclear pact gets off ground
 JYOTI MALHOTRA 				 	 ElBaradei and Kakodkar in Vienna. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Nov. 21: The Centre has begun talks on concluding an India-specific safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, with atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkar meeting IAEA chairman Mohamed ElBaradei this evening.																								Kakodkar will be back home by the weekend, but talks on the safeguards agreement are likely to take at least another couple of weeks to conclude because of the additional assurances Delhi is seeking from the IAEA.																								According to the agreement, IAEA safeguards will be imposed on 14 civilian nuclear reactors but will not touch the eight reactors in the military programme. But India wants the agency to incorporate fuel supply guarantees for the 14 civilian reactors as well as put in place a strategic fuel reserve.																								It is beginning to seem that although the Left still has control over whether India should finalise the agreement with the IAEA or not, todays negotiations in Vienna could be the first step towards concluding the Indo-US nuclear deal.																								If ElBaradei takes a positive view of the two additional Indian demands, it could become difficult for the Left to pick holes in the IAEA text. 																								Once the Left clears the text, the Indo-US nuclear deal is virtually through. 																								Highly placed sources in the government confirmed that Indias responsibility on the nuclear deal ends with the IAEA. Once that text is frozen, it is Americas responsibility to go to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and clear the deal. 																								The US is believed to be looking at mid-December to call an extraordinary meeting of the NSG to push the deal through. After that, it would still have about a month to present the deal to its own Congress, which reconvenes on January 18. 																								The US Congress will undertake an up-down vote on the deal after examining it for 90 days. 																								In this scenario, there is enough time for the deal to still go through by the end of April 2008.																								The NSGs clearance means that the technology denial regime against India in place for the last many decades will go. India will be able to conduct nuclear commerce with all international players at this stage, including the four-reactor deal with Russia that did not come through during the Prime Ministers visit to Moscow 10 days ago.																								The big question now is whether India will succeed in its negotiations with the IAEA. If it does, the Indo-US deal is closer to being concluded.																								According to the sources, the fuel supply guarantees are aimed at making the 123 Agreement foolproof. That is, if India ever wants to conduct a nuclear test in the future, it can safely go ahead with the knowledge that its 14 civilian reactors will not be penalised. 																								The fuel guarantee clause in the IAEA safeguards agreement will ensure that the 14 civilian reactors continue to get nuclear fuel on a regular basis.																								This particular clause is key to the safeguards agreement because of the unhappy experience India has had with its Tarapur reactor in the past. Although safeguarded by the IAEA, the reactor has been subject to the whims and fancies of the international community for nuclear fuel. 																								Last year, when India and the US were in the midst of bilateral nuclear negotiations, the Tarapur fuel was managed only after Russia invoked a safety clause to provide the fuel. But even then, the NSG, of which Russia is a member, was not happy with the deal. 																								Similarly, the creation of a strategic fuel reserve is aimed at ensuring regular and continuous fuel supply for the 14 reactors in case India conducts another nuclear test and international penalties kick in.

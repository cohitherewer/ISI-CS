				 Indian in extortion net in US
																								Washington, Oct. 30 (PTI): An Indian has been sentenced to a year in prison after he admitted to blackmailing a former top aide to the governor of Hawaii.																								Forty-six-year-old Rajdatta Patkar has been in custody since December 2006 and will be deported to India after he finishes the remainder of his sentence and pays over $7,300 as restitution to federal authorities. He will get credit for the time already served in detention.																								In the plea bargain, the prosecution agreed to drop four related extortion charges if Patkar pleaded guilty to a single count of attempting to extort $35,000 from the governors former aide.																								We are satisfied and feel he (the judge) took into account all the relevant circumstances in the case, assistant US attorney Clare E. Connors, who prosecuted the case for the government, was quoted as saying in The Honolulu Advertiser.																								The report said Patkar attempted to extort money from Robert Awana, the former chief of staff to governor Linda Lingle, by threatening to expose some emails which would have subjected Awana to unfavourable scru-tiny.

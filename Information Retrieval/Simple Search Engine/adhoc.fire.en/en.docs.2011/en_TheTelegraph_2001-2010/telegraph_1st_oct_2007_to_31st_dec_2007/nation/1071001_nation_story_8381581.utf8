 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Mess overflows, so does politics				 																																																										Filth-weary residents in parts of Chennai recently raised a stink against a civic body not ready to clean up its act.				 																																																										Mounds of garbage, which got bigger each day, spilled over and narrowed many arterial roads as trash bins disappeared in several areas of Greater Chennai. With the stink came mosquitoes breeding in the mess.				 																																																										The problem, which at one point appeared to turn into a traffic hazard, worsened after the Chennai Municipal Corporations decision to hand the contract for waste disposal to American company Neel Metal Fanalca. The Singapore-based Onyx had the job earlier.				 																																																	robably upset at having lost the contract, Onyx decided that its bins had no business to be where they were. The result: the pile of mess that overran the streets.				 																																																										The filth feud took on political colours when allegations flew thick and fast at M.K. Stalin, M. Karunanidhis son and minister in charge of civic bodies, for doing little to solve the problem. Please wait for 10 days for the new bins to arrive, he told residents.				 																Desam turns media shy				 																																																										The Telugu Desam has suddenly turned media shy. 				 																																																										The party was apparently embarrassed at finding pictures of the marriage ceremony of Chandrababu Naidus son, Lokesh, float around in Hyderabad days after the twin blasts.				 																																																										The wedding, in which Lokesh tied the knot with Brahmini, the daughter of NTRs actor-son Balakrishna, was meant to be a private affair but news-hounds could not resist the temptation of capturing the colourful snapshots.				 																																																										Naidu, ever conscious of his image, was miffed that images of the celebration made their way into homes that were still struggling to recover from the ghastly explosions. 				 																																																										Orders were sent to keep the media at bay. But with the countdown for the 2009 polls having begun, many say it is only a matter of time before the free lunches, paid phones and unlimited Internet for journalists are back in place.				 																Cops ranks set to swell				 																																																										Delhi police, among the countrys elite forces, will have a stronger organisation muscle under a massive recruitment plan cleared by the Union home ministry last week.				 																																																										Five thousand personnel will join the 65,000-strong squad to keep pace with the requirements for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Of these, 1,000 are going to be women. They will, however, not be assigned any traffic duty.				 																																																										At senior levels, the number of deputy commissioners and additional deputy commissioners will rise by two each.				 																																																										The control room will get most of the new personnel. The number is likely to be 2,000. The traffic department will get 1,000 while the special security wing for VIPs will have 500. The rest will be assigned to other departments.				 																																																										The recruitment is already under way and the process will be completed soon, a Delhi police spokesperson said .				 																More airports				 																																																										Mumbai might lose its status as the only city in Maharashtra with an international airport if a state government plan takes off in a few years.				 																																																										The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation last week invited proposals to set up such an airport at Pune, the booming town whose fliers now have to travel to Mumbai on their way abroad.				 																																																										The state-run company, which builds infrastructure projects, has also asked companies to send in plans to set up seven regional airports. 				 																																																										The new locations will be Latur, Baramati, Yavatmal, Nanded, Osmanabad, Kolhapur and Amaravati. Some of these towns have small airstrips. 				 																																																	Delhi: Hungarian sculptor Pter Mrkus presents his works based on traditional Indian techniques this Monday. The sculptures are made of brass, stone and wood. The venue is the Hungarian Information and Cultural Centre on Janpath. Time: 11am to 7pm.

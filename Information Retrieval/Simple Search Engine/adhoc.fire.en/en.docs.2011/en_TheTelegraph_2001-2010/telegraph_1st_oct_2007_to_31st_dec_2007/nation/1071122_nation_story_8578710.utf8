 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Bangalores ode to the holy cow				 																																																										The holy cows have rarely been worshipped on such a scale.				 																																																										In the hope of attaining an elusive bovine bliss, Bangalore recently held a festival to pay respect to the cow. Pontiffs, politicians and scientists held forth on the virtues of the sacred animal and its role in nation-building.				 																																																										A ballet, titled Gou Vishwaroopa Darshana, by dancers Nirupama and Rajendra and their troupe, traced the history of cattle across four yugs (cycle of time)  Satya yug, Treta yug, Dwapara yug and Kali yug now.				 																																																										More than 50,000 women, each holding five lamps, worshipped Maha Nandi, the bull Shiva rides on. The organisers stressed that the event wasnt meant to kick off a row but a chance to remind people about the need to protect the vanishing breeds of desi cattle. 				 																																																										Indian farmers prefer hybrid cows because of their higher milk yields. This has led to extinction of some types of local cattle. A religious math in Hosanagar, near Shimoga, has started a programme to preserve the gene-pool of 30 Indian breeds.				 																Camera squad takes aim				 																																																										Closed-circuit TVs arent proving enough in terror-stalked Mumbai. Hidden cameras have now moved into the frame.				 																																																										Policemen with video cameras are now prowling five of the most crowded stations where explosions could prove devastating. These are also the points from which explosives could be smuggled in. 				 																																																										The camera squad, part of the government railway police (GRP), can be spotted at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Mumbai Central, Dadar, Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and Bandra Terminus.				 																																																										Officers said the men with the cameras help overcome the limitations of CCTV images, which often suffer from poor picture quality and limitations of mobility.				 																																																										The recordings are uploaded on the server twice daily. All police stations will share the data soon. We will give our counterparts in other states access to the videos, inspector Bharat Rane at Mumbai Central said. 				 																Prize call for HIV cell game				 																																																										After campaigns and workshops, awareness about HIV is being spread through mobile games with much success. And now, theres even a contest to pick the best.				 																																																										The winner is a Delhi software development company, whose games on HIV/AIDS are being played by mobile phone users in six African countries and India. 				 																																																										The Changemakers Collaborative Competition, organised recently by a US company and an Indian counterpart, declared ZMS Systems, a software and e-gaming company, as the winner of their health gaming contest for this year. 				 																																																										Fourteen games were shortlisted first, from which the list was trimmed to three before the final winner was announced. The judges decided that the ZMS game, which aims to help children understand the deadly virus and the ways in which it spreads, was best suited for the prize. 				 																																																										Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Namibia and Mozambique are the countries other than India where the game is available.				 																Sealing relief				 																																																										Shopkeepers in Delhi who havent paid the civic body its annual fee for mixed-land use have been given a breather.				 																																																										The Municipal Corporation of Delhi last week decided to allow the owners of such outlets to resume business provided they had registered and declared their desire to pay.				 																																																										We have decided to allow all such shopkeepers, who have registered themselves or made declarations but have not deposited the conversion charges, chairman of the civic bodys standing panel, Vijender Gupta, said. 				 																																																	Delhi: In the times of Nandigram and slum evictions, dont miss Bhoomi this Thursday. In the play, villagers struggle to hold off MNCs eyeing their land, while the urban poor are left homeless in a slum-demolition drive. Venue: Little Theatre Group on Copernicus Marg. Time: 5pm.

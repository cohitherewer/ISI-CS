				 Maharajas watch nets crores
																								Geneva, Nov. 14 (Reuters): A rare Patek Philippe wristwatch worn by an Indian maharaja and a gold and diamond-set Breguet crafted for French Empress Josephine Bonaparte fetched well above pre-sale estimates at a Geneva auction.																								Auction house Christies said yesterday the sale netted 31.1 million Swiss francs (more than Rs 100 crore) and was the most successful auction ever of watches from various owners, confirming the absolute strength of the market for fine collector watches.																								The 1944 Patek Philippe perpetual calendar wristwatch  believed to be one of only two made  was bought by an unnamed Swiss museum for 2.5 million Swiss francs, double Christies pre-sale estimate.																								According to Christies, the maharaja wore the watch when playing polo and gave it to the man who organised his wedding.																								A gold, enamel and diamond-set timepiece ordered by Napoleon Bonapartes first wife Josephine in 1799 was bought by the Breguet museum for 1.5 million Swiss francs.

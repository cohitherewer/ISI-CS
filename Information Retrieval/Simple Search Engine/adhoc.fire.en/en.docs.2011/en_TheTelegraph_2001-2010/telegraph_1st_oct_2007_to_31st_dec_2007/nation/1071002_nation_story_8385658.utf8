				 Gujjar jail march for ST status 
 RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR 				 	 Gujjars during a protest near Jaipur. File picture																								Jaipur, Oct. 1: About five lakh Gujjars are expected to court arrest in Rajasthan tomorrow, kicking off the second round of their agitation for Scheduled Tribe status three months after a week-long protest cost 26 lives.																								Community leaders have promised that the jail bharo, which coincides with the Mahatmas birth anniversary, would be non-violent. But they have refused to accept the state governments decision to take rallyists thumbprints and photographs when they are sent to prison.																								The government cannot treat us as criminals. This is a political agitation and should be treated like one, Roop Singh, spokesman for the Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, told The Telegraph.																								He said Gujjar leaders have taken oaths before district collectors that the protesters would not carry arms.																								The Gujjars want the state to immediately send the Centre a letter recommending ST status for them.																								The agitations public face, retired colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla, has urged the community across the country to join the jail bharo from October 6 if the government fails to send the letter by then.																								The government has deployed police, the Central Reserve Police Force and 65 companies of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary across the state and clamped prohibitory orders on the districts of Jaipur, Tonk, Sawai Madhopur, Dholpur and Jhunjhunu.																								At least 30 to 50 government schools in each division have been turned into temporary jails. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje has sent ministers and senior bureaucrats to the districts.																								Between May 29 and June 4, the Gujjars had blocked several highways in Rajasthan and neighbouring states, cutting off Jaipur from almost all state capitals and Delhi, and rampaged on Delhis streets.																								Police firing had killed 21 protesters, and clashes with caste rival Meenas had claimed five. The agitation was called off after the state government promised a committee to weigh the Gujjars demand.																								Bainsla today said from Rajsamand: I am open to talks but the question of withdrawing the agitation does not arise till the letter recommending ST status is sent to Delhi.																								Raje said she had discussed the situation with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sometime ago.																								At a marathon meeting on Saturday, state BJP chief Mahesh Sharma had urged Bainsla to call off the agitation and offered to ask the government to provide jobs to the families of those killed during the May-June protests.																								Sharma argued that a letter to the Centre would not itself bring ST status  it would merely set off a long-drawn constitutional process. So, talks were a better option than agitation.

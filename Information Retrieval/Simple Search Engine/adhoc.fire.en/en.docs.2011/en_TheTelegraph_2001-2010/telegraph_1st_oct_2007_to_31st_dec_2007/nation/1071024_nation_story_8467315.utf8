				 Karat taps third front
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 Bobby Jindal and wife Supriya greet supporters at a rally in Covington, Louisiana, after he was elected governor. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Oct. 23: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today held a series of meetings, ostensibly to garner support for the Lefts strategy, amid reports that the government would convene a special Parliament session to push through the nuclear deal.																								Karat first held a three-hour meeting with Samajwadi Party leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh and Telugu Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu before going into a huddle with his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan. 																								None of the leaders would say what transpired at the two meetings, but sources said Karat discussed a joint strategy with the UNPA  also called the third front  to oppose the US deal if the government decides to convene the special session. 																								Amar Singh tried to downplay the meeting with Karat, saying the Left parties were their natural allies. 																								The Samajwadi leader did not forget to take a dig at the growing disquiet in the Congress-led UPA on the nuclear deal. This coalition is suffering from a functional chaos, there is nothing much to comment, Amar said, reacting to reports that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh felt let down on the nuclear issue.																								Mulayam at helm 																								At a meeting in the evening, the UNPA named Mulayam Singh Yadav as its chairman, Chandrababu Naidu as convener and Amar Singh as spokesperson and decided to focus on farmer issues. The front said it would hold a series of farmer rallies, the first in Vijayawada on November 24.																								ADMK chief Jayalalithaa was invited but did not turn up.

 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Home in for the Games				 																																																										Delhi will have 5,000 bed and breakfast (B amp;B) rooms for tourists, other than conventional hotels, for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, state tourism minister Arvinder Singh Lovely has said. 				 																																																										Speaking at a recent hospitality fair, Lovely said his ministry was doing all that is needed to prepare for the Games. 				 																																																										The Sheila Dikshit government, stumbling from one crisis to another  the sealing drive, safety of women, and now the Blueline menace  sees bagging the Games as a big achievement. 				 																																																										Lovelys department is encouraging low-end hoteliers in the capital, which has a reputation for high boarding costs.				 																																																										Along with tax cuts, the government is planning more lenient laws on alcohol distribution. But it has been particularly enthusiastic about the B amp;B model, which originates in western Europe.				 																																																										A typical B amp;B outlet is run from a villa or bungalow, where residents rent out a room or two for a few days. A lavish breakfast is a part of the deal as well. 				 																																																										Over 100 aspiring B amp;B entrepreneurs have received the mandatory quality clearance from the government. 				 																Fools Day success story				 																																																										If there was ever an economic superstition that a project launched on All Fools Day will become a white elephant, it might just be time to get rid of the notion.				 																																																										The home truth was driven home by a top-rung manager of the Anil Ambani groups communications company.				 																																																										Rajesh Tiwari, director of Reliance Communications, reminded a business seminar, Wiring Chennai, that the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited was set up on April 1, 1986, and has beaten the fools jinx.				 																																																										The public-sector company went on to transform the countrys telephone scenario, said Tiwari. Giving examples, he said the company ushered in the push-button telephones that almost eliminated wrong numbers. MTNL also pioneered the concept of the public call office, or the PCO, changing the way India called, he said. 				 																CM stuns with Hindi U-turn				 																																																										M. Karunanidhis literary prowess is no secret but his fluency in Hindi isnt as famous as his other abilities.				 																																																										That hidden fact spilled out at recent rally where the Kalaignar (litterateur) recited lines from an old patriotic song.				 																																																										Many in the audience appeared stunned by the 84-year-old leaders seemingly effortless rendition of the song, Hindustan hai desh hamara, jaanse apne humko pyaara.				 																																																										Few at the rally, called to press the Centre to go ahead with the Sethusamudram canal project, would have known that the man delivering the lines had sprawled himself on a railway track in the 1950s to protest against the renaming of a station with a Hindi (north Indian) name.				 																																																										Such was Karunanidhis anti-Hindi zeal then that he wanted the name, Dalmiyapuram, changed to Kallakudi in Tamil. The protest is as famous as Kallakudi Porattam in the DMKs history. 				 																																																										Now, his objectives appear to have changed. By reciting these lines, he was trying to urge his audience not to fall a prey to the campaign of communal forces on the setu row.				 																Maiden offer				 																																																										Parents of girl children in Delhi will now get a fatter incentive.				 																																																										The government, concerned over the declining sex ratio in the capital, has hiked the amount to be paid to such families.				 																																																										An amount of Rs 1 lakh, instead of Rs 18,000 now, will be redeemed after a girl child attains the age of 18, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said after a recent cabinet meeting where the move was cleared. A commission will also be formed for the protection of child rights.				 																																																	Delhi: See Delhi through the eyes of the man who last planned it. Sir Edwin Lutyens, who designed New Delhis palatial monuments and broad boulevards, captured Delhi, before and after his work, on camera. The exhibition is on at the British Council, Kasturba Gandhi Marg. Time: 10am to 6pm.

																								Chennai, Oct. 14 (PTI): DMK chief M. Karunanidhi today said his party had played a major role in ensuring that the UPA and the Left did not part ways over the Indo-US nuclear deal.																								The DMK was one of the parties responsible for the good decision, the Tamil Nadu chief minister said in a statement a day after congratulating Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi for their comments on the deal and coalition dharma. 																								Karunanidhi, whose DMK is part of the UPA, also told a television channel: Frankly, the deal is not important. The government is important.																								I had doubts about the deal. So I spoke for the Left. I shared communist parties ideas with the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi.																								The DMK chief said the UPA and the Left should serve the nation for the remaining two years.																								The UPA and the Left should stay alert to protect the country from communal forces, the statement added, and thanked everyone who had worked to avert mid-term elections.

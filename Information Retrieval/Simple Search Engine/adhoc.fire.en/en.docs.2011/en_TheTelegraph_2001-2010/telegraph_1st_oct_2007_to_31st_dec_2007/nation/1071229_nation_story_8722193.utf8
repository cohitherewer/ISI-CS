				 Kashmir ignores strike call 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Srinagar, Dec. 28: Kashmir today reacted mostly with indifference to the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, a few youths pelting police with stones but the majority ignoring a strike call.
																								This was in stark contrast to the response after the 1979 hanging of her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto when several people had been killed in clashes, hundreds of houses had been set on fire and a series of strikes had crippled the Valley.
																								Although mainstream political leaders and separatists condemned yesterdays killing of the Pakistan Peoples Party leader, life for the people carried on as usual. There was full attendance at government offices and traffic was normal.
																								The only reaction came from a few dozen youths who targeted the police at Nowhatta and Alamgiri Bazar. They were dispersed by a mild lathicharge and tear gas. A few shops kept their shutters down.
																								The people paid scant heed to the strike call by Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani, proceeding to work as usual. Youngsters were seen playing cricket with abandon.

				 HC calls for SRK papers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 12: Bombay High Court has asked for details of sanctions granted to Shah Rukh Khan to build an eight-storey building within the premises of his sprawling Bandra residence, Mannat.																								The order to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has come on a 2006 PIL alleging the actor used money power to bend development control rules and secure the go-ahead for the building that is now complete and apparently encroaches on the road.																								The court has given BMC 14 days to respond. We are not here to target any celebrity specifically. Our PIL was against three constructions in Mumbai, one of which is Shah Rukhs, said Manav Joshi of the NGO Bhrashtachar Nirmoolan Sanghatana.																								Mannat is a sea-facing palatial bungalow adjacent to the Taj Lands End hotel in the posh Bandra-Bandstand area. It is a heritage building that Khan bought for Rs 13.32 crore.																								The area where the construction took place lies in the Coastal Regulatory Zone. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is prohibited from sanctioning plans for construction of multi-storeyed buildings in the CRZ region, a Mumbai lawyer, Y.P. Singh, said.																								Last July, the Supreme Court had dismissed as frivolous a petition challenging the sanction given to Khan for the building.																								That petition filed by Cyril Thomas Mecwan, too, had alleged the star used his influence and wealth to get the proposal cleared by the municipality. The case went to the apex court after the high court gave Khan a clean chit.																								The actor bought the bungalow in 2001 from Nariman K. Dubash, trustee of the Bai Khorshed Bhanu Sanjana Trust. It is yet to be transferred in Khans name.

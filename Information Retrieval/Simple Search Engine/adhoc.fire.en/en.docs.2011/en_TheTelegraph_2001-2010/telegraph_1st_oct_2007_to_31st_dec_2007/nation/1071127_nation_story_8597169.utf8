				 Cong lines up little nicks
 							 - Eye on tribals, Patel split and BJP rebels in Gujarat RADHIKA RAMASESHAN			Sonia Gandhi		New Delhi, Nov. 26: The Congresss Gujarat campaign has been cautious but it is doing its homework against Narendra Modi.																								The partys initial list of 135 candidates has been a safe one with almost no new faces  though major changes are expected in the remaining 47 seats  in contrast with Modis removal of over 35 per cent of his sitting MLAs. 																								Nor is the Congress making tall claims about defeating Modi. Yet, unlike 2002 when it was on the defensive on the Hindu-Muslim question, it has quietly identified chinks in the chief ministers armour and has begun chipping away.																								To the Congress, Modis vulnerable points include the estranged BJP workers, Sangh parivar affiliates and tribals (16 per cent votes), as well as the divisions among Patel, Koli and women voters.																								This is not a presidential election. We will fight the BJP and not just Modi, Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki said.																								The Congress, therefore, has skirted the communal minefield and focused on objective circumstances, such as the disgruntled government employees. The government has outsourced Class III and IV jobs, hired professors, doctors and engineers on contract at fixed wages and paid no Diwali bonus for five years.																								Congress campaigners other targets include the state governments over-the-top claims in the social sector and the relaxation of the liquor ban at designated economic zones.																								The Congress has tried to end the infighting at the top by telling its would-be chief ministers that nobody would be projected as one.																								First let us defeat the BJP. If we are not in the reckoning, whats the point in fighting over the top post? asked B.K. Hari Prasad, the party general secretary in charge of Gujarat.																								Solanki, Shankersinh Vaghela and Dinsha J. Patel  all MPs and the last two central ministers  have been told that rather than search out safe seats for themselves, they should ensure the election of the maximum possible candidates from their Lok Sabha constituencies.																								The Congress has organised Sonia Gandhis first rally in a tribal area and conducted workshops to convince the tribals that they must not let the Sangh parivar use them as cannon fodder against the minorities.																								It has also projected leaders such as Lok Sabha chief whip Madhusudan Mistry and deputy railway minister Naranbhai. J. Rathwa as the partys tribal faces.																								The party is also trying to exploit the resentment of the Darbaris, a powerful intermediate caste, at the way the land reforms have benefited the Patels. The Darbaris feel their economic, social and political power has been undermined.

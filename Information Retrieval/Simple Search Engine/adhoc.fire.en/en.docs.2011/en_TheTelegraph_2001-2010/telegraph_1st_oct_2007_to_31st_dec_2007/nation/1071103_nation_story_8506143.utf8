				 Trilogy hint in defence of Elizabeth 
				 	 Shekhar Kapur																								Sydney, Nov. 2 (AFP): Shekhar Kapur today denied claims his latest film Elizabeth: The Golden Age was anti-Catholic and hinted he would make a third feature on the Virgin Queen.																								A Vatican-backed historian this week described the period drama as a distorted anti-papal travesty which could prove divisive among Christians. 																								But Kapur, who in 1998 brought a relatively unknown Cate Blanchett to the lead role in his first Elizabeth film for which she got an Oscar nomination, dismissed the allegations.																								Its actually very, very deeply not anti-Catholic, he told a news conference in Sydney with Blanchett and her Australian co-stars Geoffrey Rush and Abbie Cornish by his side. It is anti extreme forms of religion. 																								Franco Cardini, the chair of medieval history at Florence University, said the film profoundly and perversely falsifies history, The Times of London reported.																								Kapur, who has previously suggested he might create a third film on the long-reigning monarch, said there was plenty of material to produce the final instalment on the life of Elizabeth I. Theres an assumption theres a trilogy. I think I started that, he said.

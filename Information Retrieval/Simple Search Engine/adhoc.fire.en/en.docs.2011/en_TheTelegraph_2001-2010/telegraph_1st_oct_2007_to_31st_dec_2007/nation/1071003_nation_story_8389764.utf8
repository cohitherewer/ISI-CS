				 Offensive bedspreads to be pulled
																								New Delhi, Oct. 2 (Reuters): A home furnishing manufacturer has agreed to withdraw its new bedspread collection called NAZI after Jews protested on Sunday.																								They said the name smacked of Adolf Hitlers anti-Semitic regime.																								The furnishing maker sent a written apology to the Jewish community, Jonathan Solomon, the head of the Indian Jewish Federation, said yesterday.																								We... hope that this crude attempt at cheap publicity is not repeated, Solomon said.																								The home furnishing maker was not available for comment.																								The countrys small Jewish community had protested against the NAZI bedspreads being sold at stores in Mumbai.																								However, dealer Kapil Kumar Todi said the word NAZI had nothing to do with Hitler. 																								It stood for New Arrival Zone of India, he said, denying it had been done for publicity.																								Jews number only about 5,000 in India after most migrated to Israel and the West.

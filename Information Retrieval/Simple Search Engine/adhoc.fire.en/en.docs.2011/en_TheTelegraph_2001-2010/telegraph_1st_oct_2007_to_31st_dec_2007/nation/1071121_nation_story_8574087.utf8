				 Karnataka central rule, again
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: Karnataka went back to central rule for the second time in over a month with President Pratibha Patil signing the proclamation this evening.																								The move followed a cabinet meeting earlier in the day where governor Rameshwar Thakurs recommendation to impose central rule was accepted.																								The first BJP government in the south collapsed yesterday after chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa was ditched by wavering ally Janata Dal (Secular) ahead of the trust vote.																								Dal(S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda welcomed the Centres move, saying the presidential proclamation was likely to be placed before Parliament on Wednesday for approval.																								Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said after the cabinet meeting that the Centre would seek House approval for the decree and the Assemblys dissolution at the earliest opportunity. 																								We will come back to Parliament both for the approval of Presidents rule and dissolution of the House, Das Munshi said. 																								 Karnataka had been under central rule from October 9 to November 12 after the fall of the Dal(S)-led H.D. Kumaraswamy government.

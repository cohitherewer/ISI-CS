				 BJP looks at ifs amp; buts
 SANJAY K. JHA				 	 LK Advani with former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger in Delhi on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Oct. 29: The BJP today denied having softened its stand on the nuclear deal with party sources privately explaining there were too many ifs and buts for a change of heart to be announced at this stage.																								Officially, the party ruled out backing the agreement in its current form. Senior leader M. Venkaiah Naidu held a news conference to dispel media confusion and propaganda about possible BJP support for the deal.																								Such a possibility was being conjectured after recent comments by party president Rajnath Singh and former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra. 																								A Hindi daily had quoted Rajnath as saying the BJP could even support the government on the deal if its concerns were addressed.																								This deal as signed by the government with the US is not acceptable, Naidu said. There is no confusion among BJP leaders about this.																								Last week, Mishra, who had dealt with the issue when the NDA was in power, said the agreement could be supported if the Centre gave certain assurances.																								Then came Rajnaths comments which, coinciding with meetings between US officials and senior BJP leaders, seemed to signal a churning within the party.																								The BJP, however, sees no reason to announce a shift in stance at this point, the sources said.																								There are so many imponderables we dont know the outcome of Congress-Left talks, we dont know what the communists are planning with the third front and we dont know if the government is willing to take our support to save the deal. How can we decide our next move at this stage? a BJP leader said.																								The Prime Ministers recent attack on L.K. Advani  saying Kargil happened during his tenure  and the BJPs weakest Prime Minister tag on Manmohan Singh have done nothing to help matters.																								So, how can we go out of our way to extend support? a BJP leader asked.																								Naidu said the BJP would vote against the deal in Parliament. They married without asking anybody and now want to discuss it. The marriage cannot be re-negotiated, there can only be a divorce.

				 Match gives respite from Musharraf fist
 OUR CORRESPONDENT			Pakistani cricket fans at the Attari border. (PTI)		Chandigarh, Nov. 7: In 2005, Pakistani cricket fans had come in droves. Today, they trickled across.																								Please do not talk about the emergency in Pakistan. We are here to watch the cricket match, said Hamina Nasim from Lahore. Talk about Shahid Afridi.																								The second one-dayer will be played in Mohali tomorrow.																								Mahol vigilant hai, Faisal Yusuf said, before he was nudged by another fan. We lost the first match because of poor fielding and dropped catches, Yusuf switched track.																								One fan, however, whispered that people were turning to the Internet for information. Democracy has taken a big beating. Let us see what happens. This is only the beginning, he said.																								Most of the 100-odd visitors who crossed the border today were rich businessmen or cricket officials and their families. The Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) had asked for 5,000 visas. 																								But after the blasts in Hyderabad, Ajmer and Ludhiana, the Centre granted permission for only 250. Of the 250 tickets sent to the Pakistan Cricket Board by the PCA, 106 were returned yesterday. 																								The visitors who arrived today did not find bhangra troupes, rose garlands and laddoos awaiting them at the Attari border check post unlike fans who came for the Friendship Series in 2005 and for the Champions Trophy in 2006.																								Instead, they were greeted by security personnel and a few rickety buses to take them to their hotels in Chandigarh and Mohali. The policemen escorted them to the stadium in Chandigarhs Sector 16 where a makeshift foreigners registration office has been set up.																								We have been asked to keep close watch on the visitors. They have arrived with police reporting visas, a cop at Attari said.They will not be permitted to visit even Panchkula as visas have been granted for only Chandigarh and Mohali, a Chandigarh police officer added.

				 Revealed: US nuke deal time cushion
 K.P. NAYAR				 	 Nicholas Burns																								Washington, Oct. 17: The Bush administration had made allowances for hiccups such as the opposition from Left parties and had internally envisaged operationalisation of the nuclear deal only by the end of 2008.																								This came through at a briefing yesterday by Tom Casey, the deputy spokesperson for the US state department.																								We would hope that... India would be able to move forward with this agreement and that we would be able to complete it in 2008, which was in general keeping with the original time frame we had outlined for it, Casey said, asked if New Delhi had indicated that it may not be able to complete the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).																								It is an issue that we have talked about with the Indians, Casey revealed.																								The deputy spokesperson was asked a pointed question whether the state department still maintains that the deal can be completed by 2008 or if it was mere wishful thinking.																								He confidently asserted that we believe it is still possible for that to happen. Obviously, a number of things would have to occur for that to be ultimately implemented. But it is a long time between now and the end of 2008 and we will see where we are.																								Casey said the telephone conversation between President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was preceded by talks between the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, and officials in South Block during the weekend.																								He said those conversations continued yesterday. So this is something I expect is going to continue to be the subject of discussion.																								Simultaneously, Burns met a group of Indian MPs who are here representing the India-US Forum of Parliamentarians (IUFP).																								He told the MPs that the US ambassador to India, David Mulford  who is viewed here by some as having a penchant for putting his foot in his mouth  had been instructed not to say anything in public that would add fuel to the domestic political fire over the deal.																								We will not say anything here that further complicates the situation, an MP quoted Burns as saying on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was not to be discussed with the media.																								Casey then said something that will not be music to the ears of the Left parties. He asserted that the Bush administration was committed to a much broader shift in the relations between India and the US, never mind the pace or the fate of the nuclear deal.																								We are really developing a broader strategic partnership with India. And that is something that is unique and I think is very positive in the development of relations between the worlds two largest democracies.																								He added that it is really something that we are going to continue to work on and going to do so regardless of the timetable that gets followed for the implementation of this particular agreement.

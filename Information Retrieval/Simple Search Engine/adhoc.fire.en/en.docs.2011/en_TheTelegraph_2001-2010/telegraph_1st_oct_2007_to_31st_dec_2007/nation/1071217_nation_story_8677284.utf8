 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Imphal, Dec. 16: Seven passengers were killed this evening after a powerful improvised explosive device ripped through a private bus in Imphal East district. 
																								Police said the IED, planted on the Imphal-Pukhao Road, exploded at Pourabai under Lamalai police station area at 5.50pm. The bus was on its way to Pukhao from Imphal. 
																								The blast killed three passengers on the spot. Three died on the way to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences and another at Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital in Imphal East district. Over 25 injured people have been admitted to hospital. 
																								Doctors said the casualty figure could go up as many of the injured were in critical condition. 
																								I was at the back of the bus. Immediately after we passed a school at Pourabai, I heard a loud explosion. I lost consciousness, T. Kiran Singh from Keibi village said. 
																								The impact of the blast blew off the legs of some of the victims, who are yet to be identified. It is believed that most belong to Pukhao and its neighbouring villages. 
																								The police suspect the militants may have mistaken the bus for a security vehicle.
																								Security convoys frequent the route as the area is known to be the stronghold of various militant groups, the police said. It was not clear if the IED had been triggered by remote control. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the blast. 
																								A red alert has been sounded throughout the valley.

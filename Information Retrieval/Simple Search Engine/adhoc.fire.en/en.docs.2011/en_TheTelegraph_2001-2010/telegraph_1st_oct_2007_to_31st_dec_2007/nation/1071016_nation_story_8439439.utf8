				 EC shunts Gujarat top cops linked to riots
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Narendra Modi																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 15: The Election Commission has transferred eight riot-tainted officers in Gujarat, including state police chief P.C. Pande and Ahmedabad police commissioner J. Mahapatra.																								Pande faced severe criticism during the 2002 riots, when he was Ahmedabad police chief, and was shifted to obscure posts till chief minister Narendra Modi handpicked him as state police chief in April 2006. He is now battling cancer in a Mumbai hospital.																								The poll panel will announce the new director-general of police and city commissioner tomorrow, and has asked the state government to suggest names for each post by evening.																								Human rights activists and the Opposition Congress welcomed the transfers but senior BJP leader Yamal Vyas, a Modi loyalist, claimed the chief minister was expecting the move and had a contingency plan.																								Congress leaders and rights activists had urged the commission to remove riot-tainted officers during the poll panels recent visit to Gujarat to oversee preparations.																								The state had just then transferred 41 IPS officers, bringing them back to places where they were posted during the riots. An annoyed commission had asked the chief secretary for details of the transfers and promised prompt action.																								We are happy that the Election Commission has started reviewing the transfers and postings of Modis favourite officers whom he wanted to use to win the elections, Congress legislature party leader Arjun Modhwadia said.																								He alleged that Modi was using these officers to draw crowds to his campaign venues.																								Pande, who is from the 1970 IPS batch, has been accused of doing nothing to curb the 2002 violence. Nearly 500 people were killed at Naroda Patiya and Gulbarg Society, which fell in his territory.																								The officer was moved out of Ahmedabad in May 2002 and made additional DGP (armed units) and then additional DGP (administration). In February 2004, he was deputed to the CBI as additional director (special crimes).																								Mahapatra, another of Modis favourites, replaced R.B. Sreekumar as state intelligence chief after the riots.

 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																After the song, the shake-up				 																																																										It was all about a song when the film crew suddenly feared they would have to face the music  from a quake.				 																																																										The group, which included actors Prakash Raj and Gopika, had just finished canning the sequence for Velli Thirai in Indonesias Bali in September and were on their way to their hotels. 				 																																																										The tremors were the result of the quake that hit Sumatra, another Indonesian island not far away. Luckily for the team of 24, they were out of harms way. 				 																																																										The technicians and the stars had packed up and were in their cars when they felt everything around them quiver. 				 																																																										Our cars rattled for a moment and swerved briefly before coming to a grinding halt in the middle of the road. Luckily, the authorities moved quickly and cleared the traffic. We are extremely thankful to god that we came home safe, Gopika, a popular actress who has wowed audiences of Tamil and Malayalam cinema, recalled.				 																Power backup for Games				 																																																										A solution to Delhis power problems is not in sight but the capitals government appears to have its eyes transfixed on the Commonwealth Games the city will host in 2010. 				 																																																										The Delhi government, yet to reach a permanent settlement with neighbouring states on the recurring problem of power shortage, has decided that the Games must pass without a hitch. 				 																																																										Delhi Transco Limited, one of the companies providing electricity to the city, will ensure a power backup system for the nine stadiums staging the Games. 				 																																																										The Games are a matter of pride for Delhi. Ensuring that they dont suffer from power failure is our responsibility, said a Delhi power department official. A Transco official said the company is investing in at least two to three power backup systems for each stadium. 				 																Schools to bridge gulf				 																																																										Y.S.R. Reddy has his own way of bridging the digital divide in Andhra Pradesh  open cutting-edge schools that churn out rural students good for high- paying technology jobs.				 																																																										The chief minister has invited corporate groups to set up the institutions, to be called Rural Public Schools, in the states 250 rural Assembly segments.				 																																																										As bait, he has offered the companies 50 acres of land free and told them the government was ready to bear 50 per cent of the schools maintenance charges. A sum of Rs 12 crore has been kept aside to set up the schools.				 																																																										To make sure the benefits reach the right people, Reddy wants the management of the schools to earmark 75 per cent of the seats for local students  who will not pay any fee.				 																																																										The promoters will be free to admit whoever they want and charge what they deem fit for the remaining 25 per cent of the seats.				 																																																										Reddy has promised promoters there would be no government interference in running the schools. But corporate groups and NGOs say finding so many teachers wont be easy.				 																Stage sop				 																																																										The Delhi government has blessed Ramlilas, popular in the city during Dussehra and Navratri, in its own way.				 																																																										All such plays will not have to pay any entertainment tax till the end of the Dussehra celebrations. 				 																																																										The announcement, made by finance minister A.K. Walia last week, will include bhajans and soirees.				 																																																										In view of the interest in Ramlila, the excise department has decided to grant the exemption, Walia said.

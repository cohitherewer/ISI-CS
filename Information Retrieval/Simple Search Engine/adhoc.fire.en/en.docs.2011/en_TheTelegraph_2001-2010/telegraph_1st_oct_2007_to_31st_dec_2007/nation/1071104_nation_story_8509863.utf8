				 Adieu, with Rizwan vow 
 KINSUK BASU																								Calcutta, Nov. 3: The CBI has assured Rukbanur Rahman that his family would certainly get justice in the mysterious death of his brother Rizwanur.																								Aap ko zaroor insaaf milega. Aap hum par vishwas rakhiye, an agency officer told Rukbanur before wrapping up the case yesterday in time for a Diwali break.																								Rukbanur today told The Telegraph the assurance had come after he broke down during an interaction with the officials.																								I suddenly got very emotional and broke down, saying my brother had been terribly wronged and that he should at least get justice. After a brief pause, one of the senior officers held my hand and assured me personally that we would surely get justice and asked me to trust him, he said.																								Rukbanurs mother Kishwar Jahan said she was keeping her fingers crossed. What else can we do but have faith in them? Hum aur kisse insaaf maangey?																								Most senior CBI officials today left for New Delhi in keeping with the claim of an officer that the agency had cracked the case. Sources said the few that remained would leave on Tuesday after tying up a few loose ends.																								The statements of some remaining persons will be recorded by then, the sources added. The team would then meet after Diwali to scan the statements and the post-mortem findings and take a call on whether Rizwanurs body needed to be exhumed.																								We had split into several teams to work at a fast pace and the progress we have made in less than a fortnight is tremendous. We will return after Diwali to consolidate our findings, a CBI officer said.																								 Abduction witness																								A garment dealer today claimed to have seen a man resembling Rizwanur being bundled into a car at Khanna in north Calcutta by three persons on the day the computer graphics teacher died.																								Indranil Ghosh, who lives in Santoshpur, told a television channel that another car followed the vehicle into which the man was forcibly taken.																								After Ghosh made the claim, he was taken to Nizam Palace where a CBI officer questioned him late into the night. Ghosh apparently approached the channel first because he didnt trust police.

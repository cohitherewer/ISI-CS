				 Abuse charges on Valley VIPs
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Srinagar, Oct. 8: The high court here has charged a minister, two MLAs and three senior police officers with sexually exploiting minor girls in a case that led to an outcry and street violence last year.																								Transport minister Hakeem Mohammad Yaseen, Peoples Democratic Party MLA Ghulam Hassan Khan, Congress legislator Yogesh Sahani, deputy inspector-general of police Niaz Mehmood and two senior superintendents of police, Ashkoor Wani and Sheikh Mehmood, have been named as accused in the case.																								Jammu and Kashmir High Court also directed the CBI to speed up its investigations into the possible involvement of former Jammu and Kashmir Bank chairman M.Y. Khan and former vigilance commissioner Raj Tickoo, who is now additional director-general (prisons).																								Within hours of the court order, the PDP suspended Khan from the partys primary membership. We have suspended the MLA. Now the law will take its own course, said party president Mehbooba Mufti.																								Pressure is mounting on Congress chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad to act against his party legislator and the minister, who is considered close to him.																								The scandal broke in February 2006 when the police seized a compact disc showing a 15-year-old girl in lewd scenes.																								The girl later told the CBI that 11 men had raped her while 20 others used to visit the house where she was kept.																								Investigations suggested that powerful people  politicians, bureaucrats, top officers and rich businessmen  were sexually exploiting teenage girls.																								Among the suspects were former ministers G.A. Mir and Raman Mattoo, then BSF deputy inspector-general K.C. Padhi and senior IAS official Iqbal Khanday.																								The issue became sensitive in the Valley, where protesters called a general strike against immorality. A mob braved tear gas to march to the house of the main accused, a woman named Sabina, and tore it down with crowbars.																								The outcry forced the state government to call for a CBI probe. Almost all the accused have since been released on bail.																								Justice Bashir Ahmad Kirmani today ordered the chief judicial magistrate of Srinagar to start proceedings against the accused named in the fresh list.																								The CBI shall place all records/evidence/materials available (regarding the accused) before (the) CJM, Srinagar, within six weeks from now, along with a detailed report... the judge said in his 200-page order.																								There are 4,000 pages of documents relating to the case which the court has ordered the CBI to place before the magistrate for further action, said assistant solicitor-general Shabir Ahmad Naik.

				 Surprise guest for Sanjay
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sanjay Dutt																								Mumbai, Nov. 17: Jailed star Sanjay Dutt finally had a visitor today  Shri Shri Ravi Shankar.																								The spiritual guru, on a four-day visit to Pune to meet prisoners, spoke to Sanjay for 10 minutes in Yerawada jail, becoming the first person to call on him after 25 days.																								He was very happy to meet me. He is using this time for tapasya, he is also reading and writing a lot, the guru said.																								I told him that once Gandhiji was here, and he, a follower of Gandhiji, is here as well. I advised him to move on with his positive attitude. He is very brave and wonderful. This isnt the first time I am meeting him, I have met him a couple of times earlier. Sanjay is a nice person.																								The guru also addressed a gathering of 3,000 prisoners who have been practising his Art of Living programme.																								The jail authorities, however, did not block the guru from talking to Sanjay as they had done with his family on Diwali-eve.																								If any special provision is made for Sanjay in jail, there will be a ruckus which nobody wants to face at this time, a prison source said.																								Even his companion, Maanyata, has visited him only once since he went back to jail on October 22 after getting a copy of the judgment in the Bombay blasts case.

 							 - Lapierre finds producer for bestseller JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 				 	 Lapierre																								New Delhi, Nov. 30: Freedom at Midnight, the bestseller on Partition, is to be made into a film. 																								Dominique Lapierre, who co-authored the book with Larry Collins, told The Telegraph: I have, just before coming to India, agreed to give the movie rights to a British production house well-known for having made the box-office hit Four Weddings and a Funeral. 																								The British romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant, which grossed $244 million, was co-produced by Working Title Films.																								They (the producers) will have it scripted under my supervision and then turn it into a feature film, said Lapierre, here to promote a film based on another work of contemporary history  Jerusalem  which traces the history of Arab-Israeli conflict and the partition of Palestine. 																								I hope they (the producers) call upon an Indian director to make the movie... there are many subtle sides to the story, the author added. 																								Shekhar Kapur, who won critical acclaim with Elizabeth, and M. Night Shyamalan, who made Sixth Sense, are well-known names in the West. 																								Lapierre feels the film should be ready in about two years. 																								City of Joy, his book about life in Calcuttas slums, and Is Paris Burning? that he co-authored with Collins have been made into successful films in the past.																								We based much of the book Freedom at Midnight on the records which Lord Louis Mountbatten kept for he was a meticulous person, but the principal character who comes through the book was Gandhiji. For me, he has to be the character number one. 																								The book published in 1975 is a racy account of the last year of British India, the princely states reaction to Independence, the Partition and the bloodshed that followed. 																								Collins and Lapierre wrote another book titled Mountbatten and the Partition of India. Collins died in 2005.																								Lapierre said he now intends to write about the people living in isolated island settlements in the Sunderbans and the danger of the mangrove forests  famous as the habitat of the Royal Bengal Tiger disappearing under water because of climate change. 																								A charity he has founded plies four medical boats in the Sunderbans that serve the isolated settlements. There are some extremely dedicated Bengali people who run the medical service... and that is why it works so well, Lapierre said. 																								The book on Sunderbans will be based partly on his experiences among the one million people who live on 54 isolated islands. Climate change threatens this exquisitely beautiful region and already, I believe, two islands have disappeared. 																								The disappearance of Lohachara has been well documented by environmental scientists. Refugees from there and from the disappearing Ghoramara island have fled to Sagar, but this island too has already lost 7,500 acres of land to the sea. 																								Environmentalists say a dozen islands, which are home to 70,000 people, are in danger of being submerged.																								The former journalist has also written a book on the Bhopal gas tragedy with Javier Moro  Five Past Midnight in Bhopal --- part of whose royalties were ploughed into social work among the gas affected.

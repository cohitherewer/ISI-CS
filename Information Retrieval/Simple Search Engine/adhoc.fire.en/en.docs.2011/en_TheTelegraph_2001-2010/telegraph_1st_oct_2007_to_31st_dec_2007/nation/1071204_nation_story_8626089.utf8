				 Jurys out: House split over courts
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Gurudas Dasgupta																								New Delhi, Dec. 3: For a change, the court was on trial  but the jury was out.																								Parliament appeared a divided house today as members clashed on the question of judicial activism, with most saying the judiciary had encroached on the domain of the legislature and the executive and others justifying the need for such intervention.																								CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta, who initiated the debate in the Lok Sabha, rued that harmony among the three organs of democracy was in jeopardy and pointed out that courts were monitoring issues like stray cattle, monkey menace and allotment of bungalows.																								He said courts had no authority to question Parliament but added that MPs needed to introspect on how they functioned, implying that one organs failure was an invitation to another.																								Congress MP K.C. Deo said the Constitution had clearly defined the roles of the three organs and the failures of one wing could not be a licence for another to interfere.																								He recalled how the court had issued notices to the Speaker to hand over a committees report in a sealed envelope and asked how the judiciary would react if the Speaker asked for a judgment in a sealed envelope before the verdict had been announced. Is it the job of courts to direct how the legislature (should) be run? he asked.																								While sting operations could be conducted freely against MPs, judges would issue contempt notices if somebody wrote against corruption in the judiciary, Deo said. He added that there was a thin line between judicial activism and despotism.																								BJP member Kharabela Swain justified judicial intervention, saying the legislature and the executive sometimes created situations that made life difficult for people and cited the example of Emergency.																								Biju Janata Dal leader Prasanna Acharya said political opportunism of parties allowed courts to intervene while DMK member Krishnaswamy blasted the judiciary for staying OBC reservation.																								Samajwadi Party leader Mohan Singh said electoral reforms and cleansing the political system of thugs, criminals and moneybags were the only way out to correct the legislatures failures.																								The law minister will tomorrow reply to the debate, which was held under a rule that does not require voting.

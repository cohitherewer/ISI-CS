				 Foreign travel bar on swami

																								New Delhi, Dec 17 (PTI): Delhi High Court today grounded controversial sadhu Chandraswamis plans to go abroad, staying a lower courts order allowing him to visit disciples overseas.
																								Justice V.B. Gupta passed the order on a petition by the Centre challenging the lower courts December 13 order in which it had allowed Chandraswami, who is facing trial in 10 Foreign Exchange Regulation Act violation cases, to go abroad.
																								The higher court refused to hear the matter further even after apprehensions expressed by Chandraswamis counsel P.N. Lekhi that his client would not get justice from the present bench. It then transferred the matter to another bench.
																								Earlier, additional solicitor-general P.P. Malhotra opposed Chandraswamis foreign travel plans stressing he was facing trial in 10 cases.
																								Our apprehension is that once he goes abroad he will not return to face the trial, Malhotra said.
																								While allowing Chandraswami to go abroad, the lower court had said he would have to return within 30 days and attend proceedings in the Fera violation cases.

				 Aam aadmi lines up wake-up call
 SATISH NANDGAONKAR				 	 Vendors protest against Reliance and WalMart retail stores in Bhubaneswar. File picture																								Mumbai, Oct. 6: Beware the anger of the aam aadmi.																								Thousands of traders and farmers in Maharashtra will march next week in back-to-back protests against the governments economic policies in what observers said was a worrying development for the ruling Congress and its allies ahead of imminent mid-term elections.																								On October 10, about one lakh people, including grain traders, vegetable vendors, chemists, wholesalers, retailers, daily-wage earners, and even cooperative store employees will strike work and congregate at Azad Maidan in what promises to be the largest protest in Mumbai against foreign direct investment in retail.																								A day later, hundreds of cotton farmers are scheduled to block the national highway that connects Nagpur and Hyderabad to highlight the plight of farmers trapped in an agrarian crisis triggered by a failed rural credit mechanism.																								Over 1,700 cotton farmers have committed suicides in six districts of Vidarbha since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited the region last July.																								The anti-retail lobby had launched the Indian FDI Watch campaign two years ago to protest the entry of multinationals. The campaign has now spread to various states, and the Committee to Protect Retail Trade (CPRT) has organised the October 10 protest. 																								The rally  titled Corporations  Quit Retail  would be a precursor to a bigger national-level protest planned in January.																								Sources in the committee, which has representatives from trade bodies and unions like Citu and Aituc, said at least 40 of the 200 Agriculture Produce and Marketing Committee markets in the state would remain closed on October 10.																								We have conducted meetings in Pune, Panvel, Khopoli, Bhiwandi, Ulhasnagar, Jalgaon and Nagpur. A Rozgar Abhiyan Yatra vehicle has been moving in Mumbais traditional commodity markets, said Vinod Shetty, an advocate who has been coordinating the Mumbai chapter of the CPRT.																								A key demand will be a ban on FDI in retail and on the entry of Indian companies like Reliance, ITC Birla and Godrej. The participants at the rally will also take a pledge to vote only for parties that support the anti-retail campaign. 																								In Vidarbha, the farmers want a minimum cotton procurement price of Rs 2,700 a quintal  about a thousand rupees higher than what they get now  and a waiver on all agricultural loans.

																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: Buoyed by the landslide victory in Himachal Pradesh less than a week after its stunning performance in Gujarat, the BJP believes the wave of change that started in 2007 will climax with the ouster of the Congress-led government at the Centre in 2008. 
																								The next general elections are due in 2009, but BJP leaders have often been quoted as saying they will be held earlier. The leaders are already describing the trend as NDAs comeback trail and the beginning of the countdown for UPAs exit. 
																								The BJP leadership is explaining these victories in terms of peoples disenchantment with the Congress primarily on two counts: failure to combat terrorism and failure to provide good governance. Leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani today attempted to link both the state elections to the Centre, arguing that the issues that influenced the outcome were largely national. 
																								Soon after the Himachal results were out, Advani said: The results of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh should be seen in the context of the rapidly growing unpopularity of the UPA government at the Centre, which has failed on all fronts. The people of India are eagerly looking for liberation from this non-performing government, which is not a coalition but a bundle of contradictions. 
																								Advani claimed that apart from the main planks of Narendra Modis good governance in Gujarat and the Congress governments corruption in Himachal Pradesh, what affected the voters were the robust anti-terror approach of the Gujarat government and the rising prices of essential commodities in Himachal. 
																								He said both terror and inflation fell in the Centres domain and hence the results reflected the peoples rejection of the central governments policies. 
																								Advani said pro-incumbency in Gujarat and anti-incumbency in Himachal clearly showed the people had turned against the Congress. He recalled that of the six elections held in 2007, the BJP won four states  Punjab, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal. 
																								While Uttar Pradesh went to the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Congress had to be content with only Goa. He hoped the BJP would do well in the next election in Karnataka, where the party had become victim to the betrayal of a venal of political opportunism despite becoming the single largest party in the last election. 
																								BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said: It is very significant. The countdown for the UPA and the Congress in particular has started. 
																								The Himachal victory is also significant as the party showed its capability of uniting warring factions led by Prem Kumar Dhumal and Shanta Kumar. It is rare to find such understanding among Congress leaders, who work at cross-purposes even for elections.

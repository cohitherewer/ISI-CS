				 Junk food warning
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 				 	 Fast food frown 																								New Delhi, Oct. 3: McDonalds and Pepsi will have to include health warnings in TV ads sponsoring childrens programmes under a new law the Centre is drafting.																								The women and child development ministry has decided to target chips, burgers and pizzas after finding nutritional levels declining even among children from well-to-do families in cities. 																								The law would amount to a commitment from fast food companies that they will assist us in enriching the nutritional needs of children, minister Renuka Chowdhury said on the sidelines of a convention on nutrition today. 																								Chowdhury said she was speaking to fast food companies to convince them of the need for regulations. 																								I am not saying that fast food should be done away with. Not at all. But I see no reason why a burger patty cant be baked instead of being fried, she said. Instead of one lettuce leaf, the burger or sandwich can be handed out with three lettuce leaves. 																								The minister said the law would not seek a ban on fast food ads, but would enforce responsibility on them. 																								Pepsi executive director Abhiram Seth said the industry was already preparing its own guidelines for regulating nutritional content. We believe self-regulation is the best way, he said. 																								Officials of Pepsi and Coca-Cola said they have a policy of not advertising on channels where children form the prime viewership.																								A senior ministry official, however, said: Even general channels air shows that primarily attract children.																								Chowdhury said the health ministry was helping draft the bill but the women and child ministry would be the nodal agency for its enforcement.																								Under one standard being looked at, all TV shows more than half of whose viewers are under 12 will be considered childrens programmes.

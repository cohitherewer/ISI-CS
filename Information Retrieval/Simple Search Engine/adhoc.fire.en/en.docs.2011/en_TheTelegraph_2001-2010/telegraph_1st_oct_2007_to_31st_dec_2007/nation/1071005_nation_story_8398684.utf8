				 EC glare on transfers 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Modi																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 4: The Election Commission has asked for a list of IPS officers in Gujarat brought back bylast weeks transfers to places where they were posted before the 2002 elections.																								Many tainted officers have got key postings in the transfers, prompting political parties to complain to the commission. Assembly elections are due in the state this year.																								Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami, in Gujarat today for a final visit before announcing the poll dates, said many parties have complained about the transfers and said they want police to be kept out of election duty.																								In view of the lack of faith expressed by Opposition parties, central forces could be deployed for poll duty, he suggested. We have done it in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab. We can do the same in Gujarat.																								Asked what action the commission could take against the tainted officers who have got key postings, election commissioner Syed Yaqoob Quereshi said after getting the information that we have asked for, we can suspend such officers or transfer them back.																								Forty-one IPS officers were transferred on Saturday. Fifteen were superintendents of police, an important post for elections.																								The commission has asked for detailed information on officers with a questionable track record and those who played a covert political role in the 2002 elections. It has also sought a list of vacancies for the posts of collectors and deputy superintendents of police.																								The commissioners met representatives of parties, chief secretary Manjula Subramaniam and principal secretary (home) Balwant Singh. They refused to disclose the poll dates but said the Assembly had to be in place by December 25. 																								Some parties have urged the commission to hold the elections in phases while others want them to be over in a day. The commission expressed satisfaction on the issue of photo-identity cards being handed to 81 per cent of voters, including those displaced by the communal riots. 																								By October 15, we expect the photo-identity cards to be provided to 90 per cent of the electorate, it added.																								No religious places can be used for political propaganda, the commission said and added that speeches of political leaders will be monitored and cases filed against anyone inciting communal passions.

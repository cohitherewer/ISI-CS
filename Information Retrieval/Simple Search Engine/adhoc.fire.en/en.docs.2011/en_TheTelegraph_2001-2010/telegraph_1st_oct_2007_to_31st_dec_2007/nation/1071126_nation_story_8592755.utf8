				 Hunt for clear N-waivers 
																								Pune, Nov. 25 (PTI): India has been firm on securing clear and unconditional exemptions from Nuclear Suppliers Group countries during discussions on a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, Atomic Energy Commission chief Anil Kakodkar said today.																								For us, protection of Indias interest is paramount. If this is achieved, the prospects of the Indo-US civil nuclear cooperation deal getting through would certainly brighten, he told reporters here after his return from Vienna.																								On the response from the NSG members, Kakodkar said: It is generally positive from the 45-member group.																								Noting that the negotiations with the IAEA on India-specific safeguards had no fixed time frame, Kakodkar said: It is a complex exercise we wish to complete as fast as we can.																								He said any agreement we sign in this regard should meet all requirements of national interest.

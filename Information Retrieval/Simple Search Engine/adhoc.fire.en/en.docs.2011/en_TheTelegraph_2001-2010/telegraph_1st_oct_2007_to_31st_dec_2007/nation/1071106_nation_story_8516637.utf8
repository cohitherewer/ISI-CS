				 Mulford in deal push
																								New Delhi, Nov. 5: US ambassador David Mulford today met Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh, who had served as foreign ministers during the BJP-led NDA regime, to assuage the partys concerns on the nuke deal.																								The ambassador, who has already met L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh, focused on the BJPs concerns, particularly the clauses in the deal that the party believed would affect Indias strategic policies. 																								He told the two leaders that the Hyde Act was not the overriding factor and that Indias interests would not be hurt in any manner.																								Sources said a meeting of the partys core committee to discuss the 123 Agreement could be called before the winter session, starting November 15. The talks could open a window of opportunity for a possible reconciliation.																								But most party leaders felt nothing substantial had emerged from the talks with Mulford to prompt a change of stance. There are no indications of a rethink, a senior leader said.

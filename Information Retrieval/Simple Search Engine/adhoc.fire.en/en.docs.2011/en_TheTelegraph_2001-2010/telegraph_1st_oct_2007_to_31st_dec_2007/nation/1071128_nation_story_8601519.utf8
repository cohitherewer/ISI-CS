				 Pranab lines up statement
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 27: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee will make a statement on Taslima Nasreen in Parliament tomorrow.																								The statement is expected to refer to the threat from fundamentalist groups and iterate that the Centre will do everything to ensure her safety, but is unlikely to disclose where the author is now.																								As with Nandigram, the Congress does not seem interested in provoking the Left on this issue. 																								We are privy to a lot of what has been happening inside the Left Front government, but right now silence is golden. If we have to speak, we will do it in Bengal at a time of our choosing and certainly after the ministers statement, a source said. 																								Given the uncertainty over Taslimas return to Calcutta, Mukherjee may not commit himself to a definite position on her visa, which expires in February 2008, sources said.																								The BJP attacked the government for its silence and its deputy leader V.K. Malhotra said in the Lok Sabha that the way the author was moved after midnight from Rajasthan House to an undisclosed destination had added to the prevailing confusion.																								Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi objected to members raising an issue any time without giving notice. But he assured the House that Mukherjee would make a statement. 																								The BJP, however, continued to protest outside Parliament. Malhotra said it was shameful a visa-holder was treated shabbily by the protectors of illegal immigrants. 																								The RSS, not to be left behind, demanded political asylum for her. People deserted by others are welcome at my place, RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan said.

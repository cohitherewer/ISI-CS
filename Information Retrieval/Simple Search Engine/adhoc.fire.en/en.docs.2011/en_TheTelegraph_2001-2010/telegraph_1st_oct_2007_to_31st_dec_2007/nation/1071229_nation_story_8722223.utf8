				 Future of Pak worries Akram

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
				 	 Wasim Akram
																								Melbourne, Dec. 28: Owing to the time difference, Wasim Akram had gone off to sleep when news broke that Benazir Bhutto had been assassinated. So, he only got the terrible news when someone called early today.
																								Akram is in Australia doing TV commentary in the ongoing series.
																								I just couldnt react for a couple of minutes. I was numbed and deeply saddened by what had happened. I also began to worry about the future of my country, the former Pakistan captain, who hails from Lahore, told The Telegraph.
																								Akram, whod met Bhutto a couple of times in the late 1990s, said hed been absolutely wowed by her charisma.
																								I cant straightaway recall the first time that I met her, but remember being struck by her charisma. She had a presence. Its difficult imagining she met such an end.
																								Akram added: She was a politician, yes, but also a mother and I hope God gives her children and the family strength to tide over this tragedy.
																								Clearly, its not an easy time being a politician in Pakistan and Akram is concerned about his first captain and mentor, Imran Khan, who took to politics in 1996.
																								Im worried about Imran and worried about the rest of the country.... Imrans not the type to leave the field.... As you know, hes stubborn and doesnt give up.... I do hope things settle down quickly.
																								Thats a sentiment shared by millions.

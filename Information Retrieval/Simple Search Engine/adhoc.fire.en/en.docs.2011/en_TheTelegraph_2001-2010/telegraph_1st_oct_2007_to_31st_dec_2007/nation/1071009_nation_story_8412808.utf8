				 BJP rushes with balm for Gujjars
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jaipur, Oct. 8: BJP ministers today worked overtime to placate Gujjar leaders as news of road blockades poured in from across Rajasthan today.																								Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla, spearheading the movement for Scheduled Tribe status for the Gujjars, was taken from Ajmer Central Jail to Bayana, Hindon and Mahua under police escort to ask the protesters to lift the blockades and stop uprooting rail tracks. 																								Manpur in Dausa district witnessed Gujjar women squatting on the road.																								Sources said Bainsla was taken to Bayana district this morning, where he asked about 1,200 protesters to stage a peaceful demonstration. 																								Gumaan Singh, an aide of Bainsla, said the colonel had urged the Gujjars to give him two days to persuade the government to send a letter to the Centre recommending ST status for the community. 																								But sources said the communitys patience was wearing thin and many were doubting Bainslas credentials as their leader. 																								Gujjars want the government to hold talks with leaders of their core committee before taking any decision. Several leaders are being taken to Ajmer for a possible meeting with government representatives. 																								Kamlesh Bhadana, the wife of suspended BJP MLA Atar Singh Bhadana, said at least two lakh Gujjar women across the state would court arrest along with their children on Thursday.

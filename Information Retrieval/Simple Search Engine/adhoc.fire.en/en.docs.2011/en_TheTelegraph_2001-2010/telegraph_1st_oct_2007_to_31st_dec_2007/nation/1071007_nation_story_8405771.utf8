				 IAF chief admits rank rift
 SUJAN DUTTA 				 	 Major: Force worry																								New Delhi, Oct. 6: The head of the air force, Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major, has said there were differences with the army on promotions of senior officers and hoped they would soon be sorted out. 																								This was the first time a service chief has disclosed that the army, navy and the air force were quibbling over ranks for their generals. 																								Each service suspects that a larger share of general-rank posts for one will whittle down the career prospects of officers in the other because the government will limit the number. 																								We have asked for seven air marshals (equivalent to lieutenant general) and we are aware that this is not going to happen immediately, Air Chief Marshal Major said.																								It will take up to five years. As the chief of the air force, I am concerned about the career prospects of my officers in the middle rung  the wing commanders, group captains and air commodores. We have placed our views with the government, he said yesterday. 																								The spat had spilled into the open after General Joginder Jaswant Singh, who retired as army chief on September 30, wrote to defence minister A.K. Antony saying that the army deserved a larger share of general rank posts because it was the biggest armed force. 																								He also said if the navy and the air force were to corner more general-rank posts, defence strategy planning would be skewed. 																								The army was involved in more operations than the navy and the air force, Singh said.																								The navy and the air force, however, insist that promotion prospects of their officers cannot be held to ransom by the tardy upward mobility of army officers. 																								A committee led by former defence secretary Ajai Vikram Singh had made recommendations on promotions of service officers. Part I of the recommendations covering officers up to the rank of colonel and equivalent was implemented in 2005. 																								Part II, covering senior ranks, is pending because of the differences among the services.																								The objective of the committees recommendations is to blacken the greying ranks of the services and put younger and fitter officers in charge of operations to lead from the front. 																								The defence ministry has asked the Chiefs of Staff Committee, comprising the service chiefs, to come up with a common proposal after a meeting on August 29 in which the chiefs bickered.

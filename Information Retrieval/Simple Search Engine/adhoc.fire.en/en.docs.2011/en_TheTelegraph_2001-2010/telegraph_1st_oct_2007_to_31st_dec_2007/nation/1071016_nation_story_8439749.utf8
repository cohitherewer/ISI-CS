				 Bomb scare for markets
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Stockbrokers watch as the BSE touches 19000 on Monday. (AP)																								Mumbai,																							 Oct. 15: A person claiming to be an ISI agent had sent an email threatening to blow up the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange on Saturday.																								The threat, which came close on the heels of the Ajmer dargah attack, prompted police to step up security at key buildings in the city.																								Identifying himself as Abdullah, the person sent an email to a National Stock Exchange official threatening to blow up the NSE building as well as the Bombay Stock Exchange building, joint commissioner of police (law and order) K.L. Prasad told reporters.																								We do not wish to take chances and have increased security in and around the stock exchanges, Prasad said.																								The police searched the BSE building in south Mumbai and the NSE headquarters in the Bandra-Kurla complex. Members of the bomb detection and disposal squad have been posted at the two buildings.																								The BSE headquarters was one of the targets of the serial explosions on March 12, 1993. Since then, both the stock exchanges have received several bomb threats, but all of them turned out to be pranks. The latest scare came two days ahead of a bull run that saw the BSE sensex breach 19000.																								Two days after the email, Mumbai polices anti-terrorist squad arrested an alleged ISI agent in the city.																								Mohammed Qamar Afghani, 29, was booked under the official secrets act after his arrest from Govandi, the slum where last years train bombs had been assembled. He was produced before a local court and remanded in police custody till October 26.																								Additional director-general of police K.P. Raghuvanshi, who heads the anti-terror squad, said a CD, some documents and five credit cards were seized from Afghani.																								He is computer-savvy and has visited Pakistan twice. He has also visited Jammu and Kashmir once.

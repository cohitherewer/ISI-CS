				 Long-rope hint in Karat chuckle 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Karat																								Calcutta, Nov. 2: Prakash Karat today suggested he would give the joint mechanism on the nuclear deal time beyond its next meeting scheduled for November 16.																								The CPM general secretary appeared optimistic about the resolution of the impasse and avoidance of mid-term polls. But he did not reveal the reason behind the hope, parrying questions on feelers from the Congress for a compromise formula.																								We are trying to resolve differences. The joint committee has met five times. We hope it will arrive at some conclusion at its next meeting. But I am not sure, he said after briefing the partys state committee on the deliberations of the joint mechanism. 																								Karat said it would not be the end of the road even if the November 16 meeting failed to yield results. 																								Who said it would be the last meeting? The committee has been set up to resolve the conflict (on the deal) and we are in it for making serious efforts to that end. We are ready for meetings as many times as necessary since the issues are vital and important.																								He appeared to suggest that the CPM and the other Left parties would prefer to buy time. It took over two years of negotiations to conclude the deal with the Americans. We (the joint committee) have spent only two months, Karat said with a chuckle.																								He suggested that the CPM was also pinning hopes on opinion within the Congress to dissuade the government from going ahead with the deal as well as calling early polls.																								I am not talking about withdrawal of support. The AICC (All India Congress Committee) will meet this month while the CPM and CPI congresses will take place in March. Nobody is talking about (mid-term) election, Karat said. 																								Earlier in the day, CPM patriarch Jyoti Basu iterated he wants the government to run its full term.

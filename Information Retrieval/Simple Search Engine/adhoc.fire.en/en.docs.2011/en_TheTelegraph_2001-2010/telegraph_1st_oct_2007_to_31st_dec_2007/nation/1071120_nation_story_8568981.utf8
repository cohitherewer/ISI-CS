				 Sharma hope after Shashi loss
 JYOTI MALHOTRA 
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: India is believed to have run such a tightly knit campaign for its candidate for Commonwealth secretary-general that even Islamabad is committed to supporting Kamalesh Sharmas bid. Delhi expects at least 30 countries out of 49 to vote for Sharma, Indias high commissioner to the UK, and Pakistan is said to be one of them. Except for a hitch: on November 22, the Commonwealth ministerial action group debates whether Pakistan should be suspended because of the emergency back home.																								Come November 23, when the election is held in Uganda, and Sharma will likely be home and dry, said highly placed government sources.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will reach the Ugandan capital the previous evening for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (CHOGM).																								If Sharma wins, it will mark a departure from the unsuccessful and confused campaign run by Delhi for Shashi Tharoors candidature for UN secretary-general last year. Tharoors campaign was doomed from the start when India failed to stitch up all the votes of the Permanent Five.																								In the end, it was the US which voted against India and in favour of its treaty ally South Korea, allowing Ban Ki-Moon to become UN secretary-general.																								In contrast, Sharmas campaign has been run like a well-oiled military machine since the time six months ago when he used his proximity to the Gandhi family to persuade the government to back his candidature. 																								Sharmas own experience as a top foreign ministry diplomat, after which he worked as the UN secretary-generals East Timor envoy and then returned to land the coveted high commissioners job in London, has also stood him in good stead.																								He is believed to have travelled to more than 30 Commonwealth nations in recent weeks, logging frequent-flyer miles to countries like Gambia and Cameroon that are not usually on the radar of top diplomats.																								In Delhi, Manmohan Singh wrote to all the heads of government seeking their vote; foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee spoke to as many counterparts as he could; and all Commonwealth ambassadors were demarched to speak to the countries they were accredited to.																								On Friday, it will all end in a room in Kampala where heads of government will assemble and cast their secret vote.																								Sharmas chief opponent is the foreign minister of Malta, Michael Frendo, who was said to have more or less conceded defeat when he told a newspaper on the eve of his departure for Kampala that he may win, or (he) may lose.																								The Commonwealth consists of 53 countries but two of them, Nauru and Fiji, are suspended. If the Commonwealth ministerial action group suspends Pakistan, the list is down to 50. Subtracting the Malta vote brings it down to 49.

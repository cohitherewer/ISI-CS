																								New Delhi, Dec. 19 (PTI): Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who has shared screen space with Madhuri Dixit, says she does not fear competition from the actress who recently staged a comeback with her film Aaja Nachle.
																								Aishwarya had acted with Madhuri in Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Devdas, which featured Shah Rukh Khan in the title role.
																								I dont have any kind of fear from her and want to wish her all success, the former Miss World said here today.
																								Aishwarya said she would like to work with Madhuri if the opportunity came along.
																								She (Madhuri) is a very talented actress and a good dancer. In future, if an offer comes and the script is good, I would definitely work with her. If you have watched Devdas, then all answers lie in it. We had shared a very good rapport at the time of working in that movie and were very comfortable with each other, she said.
																								Denying any hand in promoting her husband Abhishek Bachchan in getting a role in a Hollywood film, she said: I am not promoting him anywhere in Hollywood and this is just a rumour. He is a very good actor and is capable of getting roles by himself.
																								Aishwarya, whose Hollywood film The Last Legion is all set to hit the theatres early next year, also denied any plans of moving to Hollywood.
																								I am not shifting my base anywhere and am very much in Bollywood. I have done a lot of Tamil movies and am doing a Hollywood movie but that does not mean that I am going anywhere. I am here to stay, said Aishwarya.

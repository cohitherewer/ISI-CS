				 Star amp; friends granted bail
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 27: Sanjay Dutt could be home tomorrow evening after the Supreme Court granted him bail in the Bombay blasts case.																								Sixteen persons convicted by a special anti-terror court for their role in the 1993 blasts, including the actor and his friends Samir Hingora and Yusuf Nulwallah, received bail today after the CBI said it would not oppose the petitions of those who were not part of the main conspiracy.																								The court directed that the bail order be emailed immediately to the Mumbai special court, to allow early release of the convicts. Senior counsel Fali S. Nariman had pointed out that last time, Sanjays release was delayed by three or four days because a copy of the bail order took time to reach the trial court. 																								At Punes Yerwada jail, Sanjay appeared surprised when he was given the news by the guard on duty but flashed a smile, a source said. He seemed very calm and relaxed. He wasnt expecting it, but now he cant wait to get home, the source added.																								The actor has been in Yerwada since October 22 and his lawyers said in Mumbai that if all goes well, he should be out by tomorrow evening.																								Arguing for Sanjay, Nariman said the actor, who had been charged under various sections of the anti-terror law, had been honourably acquitted of the charges and had been convicted only under the Arms Act. 																								He also argued that in convicting him, the trial court had erred in relying on his retracted confession as well as the confessions of his co-accused. The law making the confession of a co-accused admissible came after their confessions had already been recorded, Nariman said. 																								Earlier, appearing for the CBI, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanian said the investigating agency would not oppose bail for anyone not part of the main conspiracy to trigger the blasts. 																								Neither would it oppose bail for those convicted on lesser counts under Tada if they had undergone half of their sentence, he said.																								Sanjay was acquitted of all charges under Tada but sentenced to six years in jail for illegal possession of weapons under the Arms Act.																								The three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, said it was not inclined to grant bail to those who have been sentenced to life. Those denied bail include Rubina Memon, Essa, Yusuf Razzak, Shahab Ali, Zamil Zayed, Khalil and Muzamil.

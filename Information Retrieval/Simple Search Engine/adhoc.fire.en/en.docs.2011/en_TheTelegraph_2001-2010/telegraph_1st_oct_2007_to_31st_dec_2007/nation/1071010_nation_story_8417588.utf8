				 Quiet burial for Kafeel
 AMIT ROY				 	 Khafeel																								London, Oct. 9: Khafeel Ahmed, the 27-year-old engineer from Bangalore who succumbed to burns sustained when he drove a jeep into the terminal building in Glasgow, has been buried, it was disclosed today. 																								The location of his grave was not disclosed or even if it was back in India or in the UK as there are concerns that the site of burial may become a target for vandalism. 																								But the assumption is that Khafeels body has not been repatriated to India and he has been buried somewhere in Britain. 																								All that a spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in Edinburgh would tell The Telegraph was: On the 30th of June 2007, a man was seriously injured during the course of the attack on Glasgow airport. He subsequently died on 2 August at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary from the injuries he sustained and the death was reported to the Procurator Fiscal at Paisley who instructed a post-mortem. 																								The spokesperson added: The deceased has now been identified as Khafeel Ahmed. The body has been released to the next of kin and has been buried in accordance with their wishes. 																								Initially, there was speculation that however painful the task, Khafeels mother, Dr Zakia Ahmed, would fly from India to return home with the body of one son, while her younger son, Sabeel, 26, a doctor from Liverpool, continued to face terrorism-related charges. 																								His trial is not expected to take place until autumn next year though he did make an appearance at the Old Bailey in London earlier this month. 																								The charge against Sabeel is that he knew something that could have prevented an act of terrorism but did not get in touch with the police.

				 Delhi duo booked for ragging 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 24: Delhi police have registered FIRs against two students of a Delhi University physiotherapy college for allegedly ragging a first-year student. 																								Santosh, an intern at Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute for the Physically Handicapped, and Anshul, a first-year student, allegedly ragged another first-year student on the night of November 17. 																								The boy complained that Santosh and Anshul asked him to drink alcohol and strip. They then took an MMS clip of the naked boy, Dharmendar Kumar, the director of the institute, said. 																								Santosh has been suspended from the hostel, and his internship cancelled immediately after the victim complained to college authorities on November 19, Kumar said. 																								Anshul has also been asked to vacate the hostel. 																								The victim filed an FIR against Santosh and Anshul the day after the incident. Kumar said the institute also registered a complaint with the police the day the victim informed them about the incident. 																								On November 21, however, Santosh entered the campus and threatened the victim. 																								The victim was told to withdraw his complaint, or he would be beaten up, Kumar said. The victim complained about the threat to the authorities, who then registered another FIR against Santosh for threatening the victim. 																								The institute has set up its own disciplinary committee to enquire into the allegations.

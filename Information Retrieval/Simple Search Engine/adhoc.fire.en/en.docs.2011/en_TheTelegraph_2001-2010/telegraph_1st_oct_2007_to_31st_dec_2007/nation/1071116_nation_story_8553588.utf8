				 No AC, so it is cool to smoke: SRK reply
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Shah Rukh with son Aryan at the T20 match																								Mumbai, Nov. 15: Actor Shah Rukh Khan has cited the definition of public places and absence of air-conditioning to reject charges that he flouted the anti-smoking act during a Twenty20 cricket match and a conference in Delhi.																								But a Goa-based NGO that raised the issue has brushed aside the rebuttal and vowed to file a suit against Shah Rukh. The NGO also drew attention to the differences in approach of Shah Rukh and Amitabh Bachchan who had apologised over a poster though a case is in court.																								Replying to a notice from the NGO  the National Organisation for Tobacco Eradication (NOTE)  the actor said that at no point of time during the match was he in an air-conditioned enclosure. He watched the match from an open private gallery.																								A space where the general public does not have any access is excluded from the definition of a public place, the reply drafted by a lawyer said. 																								The same argument was used to rebut the second charge of smoking at a conference in Delhi, saying the venue was a private hotel.																								Promotion of smoking in public places carries a fine of Rs 200. 																								I never expected him to accept his fault legally, but as a human being and a star, he should have at least accepted his fault morally, NOTE official Shekhar Salkar said.

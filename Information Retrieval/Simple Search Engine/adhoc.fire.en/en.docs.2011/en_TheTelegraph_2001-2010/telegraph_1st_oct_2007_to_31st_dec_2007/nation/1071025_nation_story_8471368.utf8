				 3 to 138 years for TN blasts 
 M.R. VENKATESH																								Coimbatore, Oct. 24: Thirty-one of the 70 convicted of plotting the Coimbatore blasts, including al Umma founder S.A. Basha and his associates, were handed life terms today.																								Judge K. Uthirapathy also gave sentences ranging from a minimum of three years to 138 years (in one instance) to the convicts on charges other than conspiracy but since these will run concurrently, it would mean only a life term  having to spend life in jail. The detention period during the trial of over nine years will be set off against the sentences, the judge said. 																								Many had expected capital punishment for the February 14, 1998 blasts that had targeted BJP leader L.K. Advani. The attack had killed 58 people and left over 250 injured. The judge is expected to detail his reasons not to hand the death penalty on Thursday, when he pronounces the terms for the rest of the 35 accused convicted of conspiracy. 																								Prime accused Basha was awarded another three years for promoting enmity among different sections of society on grounds of religion but this, along with a life term he had already been given by a fast-track court earlier, will overlap with sentence he was handed out today.																								Mohammed Ansari, Bashas deputy and the man who organised the suicide squad targeting Advani, was given two life terms. Effectively, he will be in jail for life.																								Abdul Ozir, the propaganda secretary, was awarded four life terms for causing the explosions. He was also handed another 138 years on other charges. 																								Bashas son, Siddique Ali, got two life terms while Nawab Khan, the younger brother of the prime accused, got one.																								Defence lawyer Thirumalairajan, however, claimed that states can constitute a board to review whether a certain number of years could qualify as a life sentence. 																								Three suicide squad members were awarded only 10 years each. Amanullah, an expert in making containers for the bombs, also got 10 years. The four, who have spent over nine years in detention, could be freed any time. Many feel they got away lightly.																								The sentences drew angry reactions. Only Muslims are being punished, while the Sangh parivar outfits arent even condemned, Basha said.

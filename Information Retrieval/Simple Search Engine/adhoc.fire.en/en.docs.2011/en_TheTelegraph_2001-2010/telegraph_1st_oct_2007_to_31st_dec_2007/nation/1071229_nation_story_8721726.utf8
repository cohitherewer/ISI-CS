				 Friendship trips take a blow

 OUR BUREAU
																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: Humra Khaliq is just thankful to be alive.
																								Her 22-year wait to meet her Indian cousin will be prolonged a bit after her train to Lahore was stopped midway, but the Karachi resident is not complaining. 
																								We were planning to come to India from Lahore. The train stopped in a small suburb in Karachi (soon after it started from Karachi station), she said. 
																								If we had gone further, we would have passed through Sindh, which was burning after yesterdays tragedy.
																								Humra was part of a 40-member Pakistani delegation on its way to Delhi for the 20th-year celebrations of the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat). The visit is now off.
																								The impact of the assassination was felt this side of the border, too, with all trains and friendship buses connecting the two countries suspended.
																								Stuck in his house in Karachi  with the army patrolling the streets  writer Rahat Saeed rued another cancelled trip. I had especially got together a group of people who had never gone to India. The idea was to get them to see India, meet people and understand the peace process.
																								Humra said she had last gone to India in 1961 and her cousin had never come to Pakistan after 1985. 
																								My husband, who died recently, was an information officer in the government and wasnt ever given permission to travel, she said.

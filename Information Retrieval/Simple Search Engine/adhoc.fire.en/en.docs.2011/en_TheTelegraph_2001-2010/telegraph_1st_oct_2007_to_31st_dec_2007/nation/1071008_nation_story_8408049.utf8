				 Maya pushes for Dalit poor
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mayavati																								Lucknow, Oct. 7: Mayavati has ordered a new survey to correct the Uttar Pradesh poor list, which is now expected to include many more Dalit families.																								The Mulayam Singh Yadav government had left out many eligible families while ineligible families enjoyed the benefits of the below poverty line (BPL) list, the chief minister said today.																								Bahujan Samaj Party sources alleged that the previous government had packed the list with the Other Backward Classes at the expense of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the mainstay of Mayavatis vote bank.																								The survey could help Mayavati in her efforts to focus politically on 16 districts in Bundelkhand and central Uttar Pradesh, where the poor make up more than half the population. Her party has a shaky presence in these districts.																								Between 40 and 50 per cent of the people are poor in another 21 districts, most of them in eastern Uttar Pradesh.																								The government has also learnt that nearly 60 per cent of Dalit households live below the poverty line in the state, where the poor are estimated to make up 31.2 per cent of the population. Among the BPL families, four out of five live in the villages.																								Mayavatis new list could bring some comfort to tens of thousands of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe households, such as the family of Chirauji Devi, 55, who allegedly died of starvation on July 10.																								Her husband Kedar and sons Ramvilas and Vijay Kumar said their demand for inclusion in the poverty list was repeatedly ignored during Mulayams tenure.																								They said no food had been cooked at their home for 14 days before the death of Chirauji, who had worked as a pond digger for a month under the rural job scheme but was not paid.																								Panchayat leaders in her village  Bichpai in Sonbhadra districts Robertsganj block  agreed that the family should have been given the red ration card under the BPL scheme.																								Inclusion on the poor list can bring the benefits of free or subsidised electricity, subsidised ration, and preference under central and state housing and job schemes. The methodology for determining the poor in Uttar Pradesh, however, has never been free from controversy. 																								The Union ministry of rural development conducts a BPL census  jointly with every state government  at the beginning of each plan period. 																								A new methodology was introduced in 2002, which considered 13 socio-economic indicators to decide who was poor and who was not. 																								Anti-poverty activists, however, argued that the new parameters would leave out many poor families.																								The fresh survey will be conducted by a joint team from the states rural development, food and civil supplies, and revenue departments.

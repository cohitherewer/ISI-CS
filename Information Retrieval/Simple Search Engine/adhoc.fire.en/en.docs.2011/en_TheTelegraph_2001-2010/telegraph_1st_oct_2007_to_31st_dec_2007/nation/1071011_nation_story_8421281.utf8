				 Tougher dowry term but no death
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 10: The law commission favours a minimum term of 10 years for dowry deaths, up from seven now, but does not believe the offence deserves the death sentence.																								The suggestion has been made in a report that panel chairman Justice A.R. Lakshmanan presented to law minister H.R. Bhardwaj today. 																								Its findings show that the number of dowry deaths has not come down since 1986, when the maximum punishment was extended to a life term.																								However, the Report on Dowry Death has clarified that where a case of dowry death falls within the ambit of the offence of murder, awarding death sentence may be legally permissible. The proposals, advisory in nature, are not binding on the government.																								The Supreme Courts guidelines for awarding the death sentence, especially the dictum of rarest of rare cases, will have to be adhered to in such cases, the panel said.																								The commission had been asked to examine whether Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code should be amended to allow more stringent punishment for dowry deaths. 																								Murder is not the same thing as dowry death, the report said, adding that though the brides death may be a common element in both offences, the absence of a direct connection between the husband and the wifes death could distinguish the two.																								Besides, the presumptive character of the offence of dowry death and the principle of proportionality (in handing out punishment) go against prescribing the death sentence in the case of dowry deaths, the report said.																								The report mentions that dowry deaths are confused with murder, though the two may overlap sometimes. It explains the nuances of such deaths to provide clarity to authorities dealing with such cases.

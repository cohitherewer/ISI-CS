 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Cross-country Merc parade				 																																																										Seven Mercedes Benz luxury cars of different models took the ultimate test-drive recently, driving across India through the dust and grime of rural roads, over 24 days. Starting from Pune, the seven DaimlerChrysler cars covered over 40,000km between them, reaching Delhi on October 12. 				 																																																										We see a lot of parallels between the country and the Mercedes-Benz brand, both have a distinguished history, a strong lineage and epitomise diversity. This pan-India drive was a celebration of this connection, Wilfred Albur, MD and chief executive of DaimlerChrysler India, said. 				 																																																										The cars went through Goa and past the Western Ghats to reach Bangalore, before moving on to Chennai. 				 																																																										The journey northwards started with a trip to Hyderabad. Then, it was westwards to Mumbai. Ahmedabad was next on the agenda, before the cars moved on to Rajasthan. 				 																																																										The high-end S-class, the in-between E-class, the entry-level C-class  the cheapest Mercedes at Rs 20 lakh  and the others from the manufacturers stable were part of the entourage. All the vehicles were running on diesel. 				 																Setu cold feet for minister				 																																																										The fire over Ram Setu might have almost burnt a key Union ministers bridge to Chennai. At least some in the city, where the waves of the controversy were felt directly, think so.				 																																																										Culture minister Ambika Sonia turned down an invitation to attend a conference of the countrys premier travel association. That is the kind of an event she normally attends since the professionals are closely involved in promoting tourism, another portfolio she is in charge of.				 																																																										She was requested to deliver the valedictory address at the 56th Indian Travel Congress but Soni, whose ministry filed the Supreme Court affidavit questioning Rams existence, turned down the plea. Oh, Chennai. No please, not for now, she is reported to have told organisers of the travel conference, being held in Chennai after a gap of 18 years.				 																Stressed cops look for relief				 																																																										Hyderabad police have had a tough year. The blasts, followed by the security drill during the festivals, have hardly given them an opportunity to breathe easy for months.				 																																																										The recent world military games tested them further. But now, many in the city have begun to realise the stress the police have had to face on duty. 				 																																																										Some mosque committees in Mehdipatnam and in the old city have been entertaining policemen and treating them to biryani and gifts, said an officer who was among the few of his tribe to have tasted such generosity.				 																																																										Similar gestures have been made in other areas. Corporate groups and community organisations have led the efforts. 				 																																																										It has been a testing time for us but we have succeeded in foiling the designs of terrorists so far, said city police chief Balwinder Singh. Some spells of street duty have lasted 40 days.				 																Simian squad				 																																																										Authorities in Delhi are getting serious about their monkey business.				 																																																										The Municipal Corporation of Delhi will increase the number of monkey catchers and rush mobile squads to places from where there are complaints of simian excesses.				 																																																										The crackdown on the animals has acquired greater urgency after the death of deputy mayor S.S. Bajwa, who fell off his balcony while trying to shoo away monkeys.				 																																																										We will increase the amount paid to the monkey catchers from Rs 450 per animal, Vijendra Gupta, who heads the civic bodys standing committee, said. The funds set aside to fight the menace will be raised from Rs 1 crore.

				 Foreign pilots for Air India
																								Kochi, Nov. 20 (PTI): Air India today said it was recruiting from abroad to meet the shortage of pilots.																								It is not as if the airline did not take necessary action. But the growth of the aviation sector has been so explosive that the airline was facing shortage and was taking in expatriate pilots, chairman and managing director V. Thulasidas told reporters here.																								Many youngsters have received pilot training from abroad, but can only be inducted as co-pilots because they need five to six years of flying experience to be appointed as commanders, Thulasidas said, when asked about the drawbacks the national carrier faced.																								There are strict security regulations in place due to which flight duty time limits of pilots have to be strictly adhered to. If a pilot appears on duty, whether he flies or not, after a particular number of hours he has to be given rest before flying. We cannot go against the rules, he said.																								On the recent delays at various airports, which triggered protests, he said the airline was analysing the reasons for the delays and will take corrective steps.																								Civil aviation minister Praful Patel had yesterday warned that action would be taken against Air India officials responsible for the delay.																								Some airline officials were injured in scuffles with irate passengers in Delhi yesterday while passengers in Kozhikode protested after Air India postponed the departure of its Dubai-bound flight by a day. 																								Being a national carrier, any disruption would attract attention, Thulasidas said, adding that this was true of any large airline.																								We do get criticised when our flights get disrupted and cancelled and quite a few of this criticism is well-deserved. We are a good target of criticisms, he said. But due to extreme factors like climatic conditions, inadequate infrastructure facilities at airports, duty time limits of pilots and airport congestion, a flight could get disrupted, he added.

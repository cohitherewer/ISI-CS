				 Cash curb clouds talks
 K.P. NAYAR 				 	 Paulson requests for silence at an aborted news conference in Calcutta. (Reuters)																								Washington, Oct. 28: Henry M. Paulson begins wide-ranging parleys in Mumbai tomorrow with Indias market regulators, but watchdog Sebis decision to end the flow of anonymous foreign investment has cast a shadow on the US treasury secretarys talks.																								David McCormick, Paulsons chief aide on global affairs, responded to Sebis decision on the eve of the treasury secretarys departure for Calcutta, arguing that India should not introduce rules that restrict the flow of capital.																								We will encourage the Indian government to work closely with the private sector to ensure that any regulations they put in place are streamlined and really do not inhibit the flow of capital.																								The reaction by McCormick, under secretary for international affairs in the treasury department, was an understatement clearly calibrated not to appear negative or confrontational as Paulson begins his high-profile visit.																								But in reality, Sebis decision runs counter to the central theme of the treasury secretarys talks in India  namely, urging New Delhi to move ahead with reforms and liberalisation of the financial sector. 																								The decision will end the practice by which foreign institutional investors put money into Indian stock exchanges through participatory notes.																								The restriction will mean that American and other foreign investors can no longer use derivative instruments to buy Indian shares without disclosing their identity.																								The Sebi decision further requires foreign institutional investors to wind up their investments in all current offshore derivative instruments within a year and a half.																								The issue is expected to figure in talks between Paulson and Sebi chairman M. Damodaran tomorrow and later in discussions with finance minister P. Chidambaram in New Delhi on Tuesday.																								It is typical of the tensions likely to emerge in Indo-US financial engagement as the American economy enters a dangerous phase with the steady erosion in the value of the dollar and the growing crisis in the financial market here as a result of indiscriminate lending to the housing sector.																								Adding to this is New Delhis resentment over the recent reduction in its role and voting power in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 																								Chidambaram gave vent to Indias frustration in this regard a few days ago in Washington when he told an IMF meeting: Unless we are able to break this impasse by the Spring Meetings of 2008, the credibility of the IMF as a relevant multilateral institution will get further eroded, perhaps irreversibly so. 																								He called upon the handful of countries that are holding out on the reform process to move forward in a constructive manner.																								McCormick acknowledged then that we are disappointed we havent moved forward more quickly. It is one of those things where we have made some progress but not enough.																								Chidambaram is unlikely to sugar-coat his views on the emerging crisis in the US financial market as a result of flawed mortgage loans. He told the media in Washington that regulators in America have fallen behind new and complex financial market instruments at the heart of the crisis.																								Sebi sweetened its latest restrictions, however, by raising the limit on individual investors in foreign funds owned by a minimum of 20 individual investors and wanting to invest in India. The limit, which was hitherto 10 per cent, has been raised to 49 per cent, but it remains to be seen whether it will immediately satisfy American demands for reforms. 																								Paulsons talks in New Delhi on the stalled Doha round of trade negotiations are likely to concentrate on access to services and other non-agricultural sectors in India in view of New Delhis absolute unwillingness to make any compromise on farm issues.

				 Opium communion, long before Jaswant
 RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR																								Jaipur, Nov. 4: A whiff of opium at Jaswant Singhs family feast had many raising a stink, but serving the drug has been a long-standing custom for Rajasthanis.																								The opium ceremony, where the drug is taken in small doses, is a necessary ingredient of any social occasion  be it a birth, a wedding or a funeral  in this part of the country.																								Tripti Pandey, who has authored several books on Rajasthan, said: The exact origins of the opium ceremony are difficult to ascertain as it has been in practice for years. But it is mainly conducted to forge a bond between two people. One can call it opium communion or friendship, where the host asks the guest to lick a small dose of opium dissolved in water from his palm, thus cementing their bond.																								However, possessing, serving and having opium is illegal, which prompted a complaint against Jaswant for allegedly serving the drug to his guests  mostly BJP dissidents  in his native village in Barmer on Wednesday.																								The ritual is mostly followed by the Bishnoi and the Rajput communities in the Jodhpur belt and by royals, especially during weddings, according to Pandey.																								Small doses of opium are also administered to babies, from the time they are born till they are two to three years old. It is said to keep them in good health. 																								Roop Kanwar, the 18-year-old sati from Rajasthans Deorala village, is believed to been drugged with opium while she walked to her husbands pyre in 1987.																								The opium ceremony, or riyan, is an elaborate one, with a large number of people preparing the concoction. The drug is dissolved in water and then strained, ground and mixed with jaggery, sugar, saffron and milk in a wooden pot.																								The ceremony is also referred to as Amal Ka Dastoor, where amal means opium.																								Not partaking of the opium at a social function is considered an insult to the host. Opium tika is also offered sometimes, Pandey said.																								During elections, candidates host opium ceremonies, where attendance means ensuring his or her vote. 																								Tour groups advertise the ceremony as an important part of the Rajasthan experience, especially in the western part of the state. According to sources in Jaisalmer, opium is found in almost every house in the region but women usually refrain from taking it.																								The drug, however, is not a symbol of celebration for all. Rajya Sabha MP Narayan Singh Manak Lao, who runs an opium de-addiction centre near Jodhpur, calls it a big problem.																								Opium addiction is a big problem in western Rajasthan as it is easily available in the region. Although the price of the opium milk is as high as Rs 50,000 per kg, those who are addicted buy it. 																								Jaisalmer and Barmer districts in Rajasthan are easy transit points for drug traffickers from Pakistan.																								Laos centre, which gets about 60 addicts a month, has had patients ranging from six to 60-year-olds.

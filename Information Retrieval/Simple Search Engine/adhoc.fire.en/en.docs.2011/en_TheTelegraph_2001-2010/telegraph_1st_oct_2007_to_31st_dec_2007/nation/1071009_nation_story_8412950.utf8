				 Speed means another govt can save deal
 OUR BUREAU				 	 ElBaradei																								New Delhi/Mumbai, Oct. 8: Ministers and officials in favour of the nuclear deal feel that the UPA could end up losing both the government and the deal if it does not start negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sometime later this month.																								The timeline is crucial because the IAEA board of governors is scheduled to meet in the third week of November and Delhi will have to give five weeks notice if it wants the agency to finalise India-specific safeguards at the meeting, sources said.																								The agreement is the crux of the nuclear deal because it alone can lead to the next two steps  the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) waiver and the vote in the US Congress. 																								Once that agreement is ready, the 123 pact can be pursued by any future regime even if the Manmohan Singh government were to fall in the interim, the sources said.																								Karat and his group, however, are equally clear about the importance of the IAEA agreement. It would entail India placing its civilian nuclear facilities under India-specific safeguards in perpetuity in the words of the 123 Agreement.																								A senior CPM leader told The Telegraph: Once the safeguards agreement is finalised, the bird has flown. It would be a fait accompli and withdrawing support after that would be meaningless.																								If the government decides to ignore the Lefts threat, another set of problems is likely to arise, sources said. Once the Left formally withdraws support, the UPA would be automatically reduced to a minority government.																								It may be able to survive for some time before facing a trust vote in Parliament, but whether it can conduct negotiations on the deal remains a moot question.																								It may be constitutionally possible, but it would be politically and morally untenable, a CPI leader said, underlining Congress fears that it might end up losing the government as well as the deal despite fervent efforts to save one or the other or both.																								IAEA boss arrives																								Just when the Congress and the Left are locked in brinkmanship over whether India should go to the IAEA, the agencys chief has landed in India.																								IAEA director-general Mohammed ElBaradei arrived in Mumbai late tonight to begin a visit that will take him to Delhi on Wednesday. He will find himself in the limelight throughout the four-day trip.																								Sources said one point of interest would be whether Delhi informally brings up the safeguards agreement with him.																								The IAEA chief was reportedly very positive about the nuclear deal during conversations with Indian officials in March as well as last year. He is believed to have said that Delhi should go ahead with the deal.																								In Delhi on Wednesday, he will meet the Prime Minister, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and national security adviser M. K. Narayanan.

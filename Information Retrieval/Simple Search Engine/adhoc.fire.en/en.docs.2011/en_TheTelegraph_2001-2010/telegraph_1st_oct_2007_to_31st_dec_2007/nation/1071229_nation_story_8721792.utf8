				 Rebels ready for Modi bow

 BASANT RAWAT
																								Ahmedabad, Dec. 28: Many of Narendra Modis staunchest critics are ready to swallow their pride and throw themselves at his mercy.
																								Former chief minister Keshubhai Patel and former textiles minister Kashiram Rana will be replying to the showcause notices served on them for alleged anti-party activities.
																								They will both declare their loyalty to the BJP and claim they had actually tried to contain the anti-Modi rebellion in the party, sources close to the leaders said.
																								Rana, when contacted, confirmed he was going to Delhi tomorrow to reply to the notice. His aides said he was ready to endure any punishment to be able to stay in the BJP.
																								Keshubhai, too, will reply in the next 24 hours, his son Bharat said. He added that his father would explain how he had stopped many rebels from going over to the Congress.
																								Somabhai Patel, the Surendranagar MP who lambasted Modi in public and accused him of hiding a long-suffering wife, too, is rethinking his options to save his political career.
																								Suspended along with Rajkot MP Vallabhbhai Kathiria, Somabhai had on the eve of counting announced he would fight the next Lok Sabha election as a Congress candidate.
																								Asked if he would try to save his BJP membership, he said: We will collectively decide. Right now Im waiting for my two leaders, Keshubhai Patel and Kashiram Rana, to take a decision. If they reply to the showcause notice, I will also explain my position.
																								Somabhai has some doubts, though. Modi is talking about forgiveness. But I know he cannot change. He is such a hot-headed person, he said.
																								Bharat said Keshubhai would travel to the US next month where his eldest son lives. Many speculated that the veteran might not take part in active politics any more.
																								Former home minister Gordhan Zadaphia and Surat diamond baron Jeevraj Dharukawala  a rebel leader suspended from the party  are determined not to surrender to the chief minister, though.
																								Loyalists said both would try to strengthen the Sardar Patel Uktarsh Samiti, an outfit floated by the Patels to fight Modi, since they believe the chief minister can only have followers, not friends.
																								Party spokesperson Vijay Rupani said the dissidents could come back to the party fold but it might not happen immediately.

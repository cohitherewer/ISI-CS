				 Wanted: A breathalyser 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, Nov. 7: Long before the promised land heaves into view, the young messiah could lead the Congress congregation out of bondage on at least two counts but make life tougher elsewhere.																								Rahul Gandhi today formally stepped into the party pulpit called CWC, raising questions on the enforcement of the 10 commandments every Congress member is expected to follow.																								Among the dos and donts enshrined in the party constitution are conditions that insist the faithful must wear certified khadi, renew teetotaller vows, brace for long-forgotten manual labour, summon courage to read prescribed periodicals and know when to shut up. (See chart) 																								Today, Rahul read out the commandments and asked searching questions.																								According to sources, he said some conditions  such as minimum age requirement and ban on public criticism of the party  could be verified and acted upon in case they were flouted. 																								But he wondered: How was one to decide whether the khadi a Congress member donned was certified or not, or whether a member abstained from alcohol and drugs?																								The sources said Rahul did not offer answers but gently suggested that there should be a way of checking if these criteria were being adhered to.																								The suggestion put paid to hopes of some Congress leaders who initially interpreted his loud thinking as a signal that the unrealistic conditions should be junked.																								But in at least two areas  manual labour and the more arduous task of plodding through the reading material suggested by the party  Rahul is apparently sympathetic towards the flock.																								Rahul suggested that the rules on members being called to do manual labour and subscribing to party periodicals (like the monthly Sandesh) should get a fresh look.																								The concept of manual labour, advocated and practised by Mahatma Gandhi, is out of sync with the Congress of 2007. The sources said it could at best mean serving food and water to delegates at party conventions and putting up the stage and other props. The latter task is outsourced to contractors anyway.																								As for Sandesh, some members of its editorial board were panned for enlisting questionable subscribers who were either not bona fide members or didnt exist at all.																								The sources said Rahuls suggestions would be discussed at the next Congress plenary. 																								On khadi, Rahul himself treads on a grey area. He was spotted in a white linen shirt and trousers when he came for the publicity committee meeting at the Congress headquarters on November 6. But the linen could be of khadi.																								Unlike the rules of 1899, the humble khadi has not remained frozen in time. In its latest avatar of bright colours and gossamer chic, linen khadi has been snapped up by retail ethnic labels.																								The trouble is the customs and excise notifications definition of certified khadi  which made the Congress constitution in 1974 through an amendment  doesnt recognise its chic variations in linen and polyester.

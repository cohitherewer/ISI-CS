				 Thousands at funeral
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Swami Gahananandajis funeral procession. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								Calcutta, Nov. 5: The mortal remains of Swami Gahananandaji, the 14th president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, were consigned to the flames at Samadhighat in Belur Math today.																								The last rites were observed in the presence of thousands of devotees who had started gathering at the mission headquarters since last night. The devotees came from far-off places in the districts as well as from Calcutta and its neighbourhood.																								Swami Gahananandaji passed away last evening.																								In a huge procession, mission monks took his body to Kathaltala in the Math around 10.30am. His body was kept at Sanskriti Bhavan in the Math last night to allow devotees to pay their last respects. 																								After leaving Kathaltala, the procession stopped for a while in front of the main temple and then proceeded towards Sarada Mayer Ghat, where the preliminary rites were performed. The body was bathed in the holy Ganges water and the head was shaved. A new gerua (saffron) robe was wrapped around the body before the procession moved towards Samadhighat for the funeral.																								Swami Vivekananda had preached that a sanyasi should sacrifice his life for the welfare of humanity. After mahasamadhi (passing away), the body of a sanyasi is offered to the flames, said a senior monk at the funeral. A group of junior and senior monks lit the funeral pyre.																								Vedic chants filled the air as the devotees watched the flames in tears. The cremation was over around 3.45pm.																								I had received diksha from Swami Gahananandaji in 1995. I was fortunate to have come close to the great religious figure several times over these past 12 years. I was spiritually enlightened after receiving diksha from him. His passing away is a great loss for me and my entire family, said Chhabi Adhikari, who came from Tamluk with her family, including an 18-month-old grandson. The Adhikaris started from Tamluk at 3am and queued up at the Math from 4.30am to pay their last respects. 																								As many as 199 policemen struggled to manage devotees desperate to catch a glimpse of the swami.  The cremation 																								Supriti Chatterjee and four of her family from Ranaghat in Nadia sat in a field away from the cremation site, eyes closed and hands folded. They had arrived at 9.30am and were unable to get a closer view. 																								Policemen manning the Math said that nearly 25,000 devotees had flocked to the Math last night, of whom about 20,000 stayed back for the cremation. Nearly 70,000 people visited the Math throughout the day till the rites were over, a policeman said.																								Math sources said a picture of Swami Gahananandaji would be kept in his room till November 16. The soul will merge with the infinite on the 13th day when the bhandara will be observed, a monk said. Till the bhandara is over, devotees have been advised to be on vegetarian diet and meditate as much as possible.

				 Modi counsel in for riot panel music
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Narendra Modi																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 29: The Godhra riot probe commission will take action against the government counsel shown in the Tehelka expos casting aspersions on the panel.																								The Nanavati-Shah commission said it was verifying facts about the comments that Arvind Pandya was apparently caught making during the sting operation. The action may be more serious than defamation. We may ask the high court to take appropriate action against him, Justice G.T. Nanavati said today.																								But before proceeding against Pandya, who quit last Friday, the panel will examine the footage. We cannot act without examining the facts properly, Nanavati said. 																								The government has submitted a CD of the expos to the commission and requested it to take action it deems appropriate. This is being seen as a sign that the Narendra Modi administration wants to disown Pandya, who defended the government before the commission. 																								Nanavati and Justice K.G. Shah, the other judge on the panel, held a meeting today after which they said they would order action only after scanning the unedited footage and other material related to Pandyas purported interview.																								Pandya has claimed he was reading out from a script given to him by the Tehelka reporters who told him they were making a reality programme  Mad Show  on the riots and wanted him to play a negative role.																								Rights group Jan Sangharsh Manch, which has been representing the riot victims, has written to the commission seeking action against Pandya and an inquiry into the allegations made by him. After submitting the application, Manch lawyer S.H. Iyer said Pandyas words had put a serious question mark on the credibility and impartiality of the commission.																								In the expos, Pandya is shown saying Nanavati is a clever man he wants money and that Shah is our man sympathetic to us (the administration). 																								The commission promised the Manch that it would look into the matter and take necessary action.																								The two judges were believed to be sceptical of the sting operations credibility but were upset that Pandyas remarks had lowered their dignity in the eyes of the public.																								How far you people are reliable, that itself is questionable. You people are known for twisting the facts, Nanavati told Iyer, who handed two copies of the Tehelka magazine to the judges.																								Shah echoed the doubts, pointing out that the print media had carried several malicious reports about him in the past. However, the two judges agreed that if Pandya had, indeed, made such wild allegations, he would have to face action.																								Nanavati did not say how he felt after the expos was aired, saying he could not watch it because cable operators had blacked out channels beaming the sting operation, apparently on the orders of authorities who did not want the images to reach the people.

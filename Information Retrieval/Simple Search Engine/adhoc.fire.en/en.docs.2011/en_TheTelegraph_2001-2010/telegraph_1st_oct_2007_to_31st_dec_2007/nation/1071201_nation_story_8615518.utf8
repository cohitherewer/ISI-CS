				 Little cheer over recovery rules 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 30: Customers arent too hopeful about the RBI guidelines issued to banks today, banning verbal or physical harassment of loan defaulters through recovery agents.																								Anand Surendranath, 25, cited the rule that the defaulter must be given details about the designated recovery agent and his phone number.																								How will this help? Yes, well know which numbers they can call from, but they will call nevertheless. How can the RBI regulate what they say to us or what language they use?																								Surendranath, who said he was receiving agents calls on his landline and mobile at all hours, had taken a Rs 3-lakh loan and defaulted on one payment.																								Vinod Chand, general secretary of the Credit Consumers Association of India, said the RBI guidelines do not treat the disease but only touch the symptoms.																								One must understand why people default on payments. Its because the banks are being dishonest. Customers fail to detect many hidden costs while taking a loan. Only when they are faced with a swelling amount do they default  because they cannot pay, he said.																								The only part of the guidelines that shows any promise is the advice to banks to approach Lok Adalats for recovery of loans below Rs 10 lakh. If the advice is followed, this will solve the problem of 90 per cent of the defaulters.																								But Chand went on to say: The reason the banks dont go to the court is that their means are not legal. They know the court would sympathise with the customer. The RBI needs to regulate that first.																								The agents, however, say they have been feeling the heat from Mumbai police since a defaulter, Prakash Sarwankar, killed himself in September after recovery agents told him to get the money by selling his wife and children. 																								The police arrested the three agents who had harassed the 38-year-old and investigated several recovery agencies.																								The recovery ratio fell so sharply in the last few months that several of the smaller agencies are planning to shut shop, said an agent who did not wish to be named.																								We used to recover around 90 per cent of our monthly targets. It has come down to 40 per cent this month. Chances are it will reduce further because of these RBI guidelines, he said.																								Rajnath Desai, 34, who has missed two EMI payments, was not so sure. Will the banks hire educated people as recovery agents? The banks want their money, and criminals get it for them.

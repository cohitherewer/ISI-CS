				 Rs 50-lakh rogue recovery lash for bank
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 5: A consumer court has fined ICICI Bank Rs 50 lakh for hiring goons to recover loans and asked it to pay another Rs 5 lakh to the victim whom the gang mercilessly thrashed.																								The fine is among the highest by an Indian consumer court on a bank. But banks usually get hefty damages stayed by apellate courts after which the matter can drag for years.																								Recovery agents hired by the bank beat up the client, Vinod, and forcibly took away his car after his failure to pay a few instalments. Vinod was hit with iron rods and left bleeding on the road with serious skull wounds.																								No civilised society governed by the rule of law can brook such kind of conduct, the Delhi state consumer commission president, Justice J.D. Kapoor, said.																								He directed the bank to pay Vinod Rs 5 lakh for his mental agony, severe physical injuries, public humiliation and medical expenses. The Rs 50 lakh punitive damages will be deposited with the consumer commission welfare fund.																								Last week, the Reserve Bank had said it might impose a temporary or even a permanent ban on banks rapped by the high courts or the Supreme Court over abusive practices followed by their recovery agents. In February, the Supreme Court had told banks not to hire goons to recover loans.																								Kapoor slammed the audacity and impunity with which some banks have been flouting the apex courts orders and compared them and their recovery agents to yahoos, a boorish, brutal race in Jonathan Swifts Gullivers Travels.																								The commission rejected the banks plea that the sole responsibility for any illegal action lay with the recovery agents themselves. The Reserve Bank has said that banks are responsible for their loan recovery agents actions.																								Kapoor found ICICI Bank guilty of unfair trade practices and issued notices to its collection manager and the CEO of the recovery agency, asking them to explain the violation of apex court orders.																								The bank must also explain why further action should not be initiated against it under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which can involve jail terms.																								A spokesperson said ICICI Bank had not received a copy of the judgment and therefore could not comment.																								Several private, nationalised and multinational banks and financial institutions have been fined in forcible recovery cases. Some of the fines ICICI Bank had earlier faced were smaller, ranging from Rs 85,000 to Rs 1 lakh.																								But when the Delhi state consumer commission asked ICICI Bank and American Bank to jointly cough up Rs 25 lakh as fine for unsolicited calls sometime ago, they moved the high court and got it stayed.																								The commission had also fined all the major telecom companies a combined sum of Rs 50 lakh in the case. The total fine of Rs 75 lakh was the highest imposed in a single case by the commission, which can award fines of up to Rs 1 crore.

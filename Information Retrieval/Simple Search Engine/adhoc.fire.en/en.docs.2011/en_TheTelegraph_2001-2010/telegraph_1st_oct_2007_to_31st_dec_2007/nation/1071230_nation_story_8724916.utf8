				 Indians shot in California

																								New York, Dec. 29 (PTI): Two brothers of Indian origin have been shot dead in a restaurant where they worked in South Richmond, California, but the motive was not clear.
																								Ravinder Kalsi, 30, and Paramjit Kalsi, 42, were killed on Thursday by two gunmen in the Indian restaurant, police said. 
																								There were no customers at the time of the shooting, they added.
																								The police said two men walked into the restaurant around 9pm local time and opened fire on the duo.
																								A report from Patiala said Paramjit and Ravinder were brothers who had gone to the US about 11 years ago. Both were Green Card holders, the report quoted a third brother, Harinder Singh Kalsi, as saying.
																								Woman alive 
																								Anu Solanki, who was feared drowned while immersing a Ganesh statue in a Chicago river, is alive and with a man whom she has known for over a year, authorities believe.
																								The newly wed Anu, 24, had told her husband she was going to a forest preserve in the Chicago suburb of Wheeling to dispose of the broken statue.
																								But, according to the authorities, she actually went there to meet 23-year-old Karan Jani. Phone records show they had been in touch for a year.

				 Left clamour rises for action against cops
 BISWAJIT ROY AND OUR BUREAU				 	 Hashim Abdul Halim																								Calcutta, Oct. 4: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is not willing to act against police officers accused of pressuring Rizwanur Rahman to end his marriage with Priyanka Todi till the judicial inquiry is over, CPM leaders say.																								But the demand for action in the CPM and the Left Front is growing louder. Those police officers against whom charges have been brought should be transferred for the sake of impartial inquiry, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said today. 																								CPM minister Anisur Rahaman and CPI minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya also came out strongly against the police.																								However, several party leaders who have been asking for some interim action against the police officers so that it appears that the government is not ignoring the public opinion have got the impression that the chief minister is not in a mood to oblige.																								We have decided that no action will be taken (against the police) before the judicial probe is over. If we are to accept the logic that no independent investigation is possible with the accused holding the posts, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has to resign and invite Mamata Banerjee to occupy his seat till the probe is over, party state secretariat veteran Benoy Konar said.																								Asked about the demand for action from within the CPM, Konar said: I dont know who said what. Bimanbabus stand is the partys stand. 																								State secretary Biman Bose had yesterday ducked the question of the officers removal but strongly disapproved of police interference in the constitutional rights of two young adults and promised that all the guilty would be punished. It doesnt matter whether the officers are in their posts or not. 																								But CPM sources say Bose, unlike predecessor Anil Biswas, is not likely to prevail upon Bhattacharjee though he is unhappy with the embarrassment caused by the police effort to break up an inter-religion marriage in Left-ruled Bengal. That, too, at a time the party is trying to woo back the minorities after the setbacks in Nandigram.																								Some party leaders will try to raise the issue tomorrow on the sidelines of the state committee meeting.																								Other than Bose, Mohammad Salim, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, Subhas Chakraborty, Shyamal Chakraborty, Rabin Deb and politburo member Brinda Karat have criticised the police for meddling in the personal life of two adults. 																								They have also rapped commissioner Prasun Mukherjee for defending the police interference and for his evident bias in favour of the Todis. Mukherjee had said it was natural for Priyankas family to oppose the marriage because of the differences in the social and economic status of the Todis and the Rahmans.																								The CPMs Anisur Rahaman today demanded an impartial probe into Rizwanurs death and said the police continue to act as agents of the rich. 																								Ally Nandagopal Bhattacharya said the CID probe could not be impartial if the accused police officers remain in their posts. The role of the police has caused much embarrassment to the government. No doubt we feel ashamed about it. The chief minister should have asked the policemen in question to go on leave or they should have themselves stepped down, the CPI leader said.																								CPM sources said some leaders, including Brinda, had advised steps against the police to clear the air over the governments attitude. 																								We asked the chief minister for suspension of detective department ACP Sukanti Chakraborty and SI Krishnendu Das since their role in the coercion had been prima facie established. Two deputy commissioners, Ajoy Kumar and Gyanwant Singh, could have been transferred to other posts since they admitted that they had summoned Rizwanur to Lalbazar, a senior CPM leader said. Finally, the commissioner should have been asked to go on leave for making such irresponsible and insensitive statements.																								But the case filed by Rizwanurs family in the high court seeking a CBI probe seems to have finally shaped the chief ministers attitude. He is now in favour of deciding on the basis of legal advice and not political advice.																								Former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray today said the state government should initiate criminal proceedings against the police commissioner and the four other officers in the light of a Supreme Court judgment calling for such action if a legally wedded couple were threatened.

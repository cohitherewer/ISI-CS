				 Presidents rule in Karnataka
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Oct. 9: Karnataka came under Presidents rule after the Union cabinet approved the governors recommendation and President Pratibha Patil signed on the dotted line late tonight.																								Chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had resigned last night following a failed attempt at reconciliation with estranged partner BJP and some plainspeak by governor Rameshwar Thakur who told him he did not have the numbers to pass a floor test.																								The governor later recommended dissolution of the Assembly and sent a report to the President.																								In Delhi, finance minister P. Chidambaram said the state legislature would be kept under suspended animation now. It will be dissolved only after Parliament ratifies the presidential proclamation.

				 TN bandh contempt plea filed
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 4: The ADMK today filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court accusing the ruling DMK alliance of deliberately, wilfully and wantonly enforcing the October 1 bandh in violation of the courts orders.																								The petition, which follows the courts threat on Monday to have the government dismissed for the alleged defiance, said there was complete breakdown of the constitutional machinery in the state. 																								It said chief minister M. Karunanidhi and his colleagues, who have taken an oath of allegiance to the Constitution, were duty-bound to prevent any unconstitutional act, particularly when there was a directive not to enforce it.																								The plea, filed by ADMK counsel Subramanium Prasad, named state transport minister K.N. Nehru and Union minister for shipping and surface transport T.R. Baalu as those against whom the court should take action. 																								The petition said the shutdown took place despite the apex courts Sunday order asking all parties to desist from enforcing a bandh on October 1 or any other day.																								Unfortunately no steps, much less reasonable steps/measures/precautions, were taken to ensure compliance of the court orders, the petition said.																								Video footage and photographs suggested a complete shutdown, though the DMK claimed it was only a strike.

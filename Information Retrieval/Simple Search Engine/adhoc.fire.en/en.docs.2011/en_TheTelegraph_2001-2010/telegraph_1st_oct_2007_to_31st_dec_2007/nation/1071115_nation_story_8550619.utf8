				 IAEA first of four nuclear hurdles 
 JYOTI MALHOTRA 																								New Delhi, Nov. 14: Even if the Left parties agree that India can go to the International Atomic Energy Agency after the November 16 meeting with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, an IAEA additional protocol by itself will not allow Delhi to start nuclear commerce with the rest of the world.																								The US has a veto on all the steps needed to lift the technology denial regime that has kept India from accessing high technologies so far.																								Before clearing the deal at the IAEA, India must complete three steps. It has to get a clearance from the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and US Congress, as well as the final signature with the IAEA before fuel and equipment supplies can begin.																								Sources said it would take a minimum of three weeks for negotiations on the India-specific safeguards agreement to be completed.																								The IAEA may be the first obstacle in the four-part course, the sources said, but it is key to starting the process. 																								At the IAEA, India will sign an additional protocol that will define the terms and conditions for the 14 civilian nuclear reactors. 																								The IAEA protocol will go into the kind of access its inspectors will have at these 14 civil nuclear sites and the future transfer of all material and equipment that will be put under the purview of the UN nuclear watchdog. The government has also agreed that it will not sign the IAEA protocol right now, but only freeze its text. 																								Armed with this piece of paper, India will request countries like the US, Russia, France and the UK to move the NSG to lift the technology denial regime against India. 																								Ostensibly, this could allow India to begin nuclear commerce. But since the US is a key member of the NSG, it can prevent international commerce unless its Congress clears the 123 Agreement in an up-down vote.																								Moreover, as India has assured the Left that it will not sign the IAEA protocol at this stage, it will at least have to sign it before fuel supplies and equipment can start flowing in after the up-down vote.

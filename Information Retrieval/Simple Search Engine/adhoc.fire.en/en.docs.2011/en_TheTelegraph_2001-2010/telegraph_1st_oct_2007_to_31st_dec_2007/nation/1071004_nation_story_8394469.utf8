				 Student pushed off fourth-floor balcony
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 An anti-ragging campaign at Delhi University. File picture																								Lucknow, Oct. 3: An engineering student who refused to pay Rs 2,000 for his seniors drinks was allegedly thrown from the fourth floor of his hostel in Agra.																								Abdul Wahab, the victim of the one of the most serious cases of ragging to have rocked campuses in Uttar Pradesh in recent years, has multiple fractures in his legs and injuries in his spinal cord have left him unable to speak.																								The incident occurred on Monday night but was reported to police today. Abduls father, Inam Ali, said the second year BTech student of Anand Engineering College was beaten when he refused to pay and then thrown off the verandah. The 21-year-old was rushed to hospital by his hostel mates who later called up his Meerut home.																								Ali said his son had told him about the frequent incidents of ragging but since these did not appear serious, he had persuaded him to stay on.																								College dean J.S. Yadav tried to downplay the incident, saying personal enmity could be the reason for the attack. But he promised to identify and punish the culprits if at all it was found to be a case of ragging. Ragging does not take place on our campus and we had not received any complaint from Abdul earlier. 																								Agra police superintendent Prem Narain said a case had been registered and investigations were on, though the officers were waiting to record Abduls statement. 																								We are waiting for the boy to give his statement and we will arrest the accused. We have spoken to other students and are close to identifying the culprits.																								Doctors at Kamayani Nursing Home, where the boy is being treated, said the full extent of injuries would be known after a few days. Right now, we are trying to ensure that he gets the best possible treatment, said a doctor.																								Incidents of ragging in the states engineering colleges are not uncommon. Last month, Sanjay Singh, a student of a private engineering college in Lucknow, had to be rushed to a psychiatric centre after ragging left him traumatised. Doctors found symptoms of psychosis. 																								Last year, Sushil Kumar Pandey committed suicide in Gorakhpurs Madan Mohan Malviya Engineering College after allegedly being hounded by seniors.																								The Lucknow incident last month prompted the state government to bring in a comprehensive anti-ragging law. Since the Assembly is not in session now, the legislation might be given effect through an ordinance.																								The blueprint is being drawn up on the basis of recommendations by a central panel, headed by former CBI director R.K. Raghavan, that has suggested ways to fight ragging, a government spokesperson said today. 																								At present, anti-ragging measures are limited to provisions in the Indian Penal Code, the code of criminal procedure and government orders. 																								This is the first time a comprehensive law to fight ragging is being framed, the spokesperson said. 																								The law will debar those found guilty of taking admission anywhere in the state for five years. Institution heads will face action for negligence in dealing with cases of ragging.

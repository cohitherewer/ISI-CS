				 Montek lesson for Left 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Ahluwalia 																								New Delhi, Oct. 10: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, often targeted by Left leaders for alleged proximity to the US, today asked education officials to take lessons from communist China.																								Ahluwalia asked the University Grants Commission to circulate a fact sheet on Chinas successes in education to all university vice-chancellors in India.																								We must all learn from Chinas successes in education. I was in China recently and saw some of their achievements myself, Ahluwalia said at a conference of vice-chancellors in the capital. 																								He did not mention the Left, but the recommendation that the human resource development ministry study Chinas successes might blunt possible opposition from the Marxists to major education reforms.																								Ahluwalia, however, said its not state-controlled education but structural changes  a euphemism for reforms  that have resulted in these successes.																								Asked about the commissions plans to curb the exodus of good teachers to the private sector, Ahluwalia said liberalising the governments control over institutions was the key. 																								It isnt only about money. We need to give teachers a good life. We need to free them from the licence permit raj, he added.																								The complicated layers of bureaucracy that senior faculty need to go through before a single trip is sanctioned needs to be changed. 																								He said a national policy on appointment of vice-chancellors was under consideration. Several VCs have called the process of selecting university heads ad hoc and politically motivated.																								Ahluwalia said that like Chinese institutes of higher learning, the UGC should introduce performance-related assessment for teachers.																								There is too much of in-breeding within institutes. A lecturer becomes a reader, and reader a professor. Once a teacher becomes a professor, he does not need to do anything. He can stay put at the institute till retirement, without needing to show any new research, he said. 																								He suggested that professors  the highest teaching grade in Indias higher education system  be evaluated every five years, with the possibility of further salary increment and a post of eminent professorship.																								China, Ahluwalia said, had introduced a system of allowing teachers the opportunity to offer consultancy privately, enabling them to earn additional money. 																								It had introduced a system where researchers could work on research for private companies, and receive funds for their work, as long as it was published in a peer reviewed journal.

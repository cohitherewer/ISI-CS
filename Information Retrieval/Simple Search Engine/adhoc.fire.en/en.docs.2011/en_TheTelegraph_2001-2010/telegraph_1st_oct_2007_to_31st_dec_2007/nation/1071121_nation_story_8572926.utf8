				 Pressure kills PhD student
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Nov. 20: A career-oriented research student at the Indian Institute of Science killed herself last night, apparently because her parents were pressing her to marry.																								R. Chaithra, 32, got on a bus to her hometown Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, and minutes later drank a bottle of pesticide. She died just past midnight at a Bangalore hospital.																								Police said she probably did not want to marry because she was focusing on her career. She committed suicide because she could not take the pressure, an officer said.																								Chaithra, who was doing her PhD at the IIScs non-equilibrium processing and nano-materials laboratory, had left for home without informing her hostel mates or her parents.																								Officers said she took an auto-rickshaw to the central bus station and boarded a state-run bus for Cuddalore at 9pm.																								Minutes after the bus started, she began vomiting. When the conductor gave her water, Chaithra confessed she had drunk poison.																								She was taken to a nearby nursing home where doctors said she should be shifted to the government-run Victoria Hospital. She died there at 12.15am.																								One of her fellow IISc scholars wondered if she might have lived had she been treated at the nursing home instead of being shifted to another hospital.																								Atul Choksi, one of her teachers, said Chaithra was a bright student and was looking forward to completing her thesis. She was a career-oriented girl. We have no idea if she was under any pressure, he said.																								This was the second suicide by an IISc student this year. On August 27, second-year PhD student V. Ajay Srichandra hanged himself in his hostel room after slashing his wrists. The Hyderabad youth was doing an integrated PhD programme in the biology department.

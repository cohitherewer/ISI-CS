				 Johri amp; gem in MP truce
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Digvijay and Jyotiraditya in Guna. (PTI)																								Bhopal, Oct. 18: Digvijay Singh today buried his rivalry with Jyotiraditya Scindia, calling the young MP a polished diamond and himself an astute judge of gems.																								The Congress general secretary and Jyotiraditya shared a public platform in Guna last evening after several months that saw supporters of the two trade charges, come to blows and send written complaints to party president Sonia Gandhi.																								Jyotiraditya greeted Digvijay with open arms in his Guna parliamentary seat, signalling that he was seeking the former chief ministers support to head the Madhya Pradesh Congress. Subhash Yadav is now the president but the state unit has been defunct because of the running battle between the two leaders.																								Digvijays recent appointment as general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh is being seen by Jyotiraditya as a sign that he will not lead the party in next years Assembly polls. 																								At the meeting in Guna to lay the foundation stone for the Congress office, Jyotiraditya described the two-time chief minister as an elder whom he respects a lot. 																								Digvijay was more effusive, calling him a polished diamond. With years of experience, I can call myself a johri (judge) of politics. I have attained good knowledge of diamonds and the maharaj is a polished diamond, he said.																								A beaming Jyotiraditya responded: He has the right to scold me.... Some people created misunderstanding but now the Congress is united.																								Digvijays ancestral home Raghogarh is located in Guna. 																								With elections due next year, local Congress workers feel the good news is that things cannot get worse.

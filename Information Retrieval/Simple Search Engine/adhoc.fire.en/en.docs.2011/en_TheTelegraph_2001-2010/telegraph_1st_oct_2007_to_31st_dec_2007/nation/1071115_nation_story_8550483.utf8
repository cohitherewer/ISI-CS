				 Ambedkar plate arrest 
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 BR Ambedkar																								Lucknow, Nov. 14: A fast-food vendor was arrested for using paper plates bearing B.R. Ambedkars pictures days after Mayavatis police ignored a case of insult to the Mahatma.																								Bahujan Samaj Party workers today forced the police in Jaunpur, 170km from the state capital, to take action against the owner of the pavement eatery and his two employees. 																								The party workers were fuming at the incident, saying pedestrians stomped on the plates discarded by the customers. We found it unacceptable. Ambedkars picture might have been pasted on the plates deliberately. We filed an FIR at Jaunpurs Line Bazaar police station, said Pankaj Jatav, a BSP leader from the district. A hunt is on for the maker of the paper plates. 																								The incident comes days after the chairman of the state khadi board had a picture of Mahatma Gandhi removed from the dais of a programme in Shikohabad, provoking an outcry from Congress leaders. The police have so far not explained why they took no action in the case.																								In the plate row, though, the law-enforcers were convinced about the need for a crackdown. The issue is serious and there was some unrest over this. No one has the right to show disrespect to the persons who have made great contributions to the nation, Jaunpur senior superintendent of police Lalji Shukla told The Telegraph.																								State Congress chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi said it was a shame that the khadi board official, a BSP leader, got away with the insult. We are ashamed at the way Mayavatis police didnt take any action against him for refusing to step on the podium till the Mahatmas picture was removed.																								She claimed that the officers sat on the case even after an FIR was lodged against the khadi board official. The party has lined up protests on the issue from Thursday. 																								The BJPs Om Prakash Singh, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, said his party would also hit the streets against the state government on this issue and several others. The insult to Gandhi was a shame.

				 British doctor cries reverse bias
 AMIT ROY 				 	 David Rosin																								London, Nov. 18: A consultant surgeon who was repeatedly passed over for a medal he much desired has now complained that he was overlooked because the National Health Service is now practising reverse discrimination favouring women and ethnic minorities over white doctors. 																								Brahmins and other upper castes in India who feel their boys and girls are being discriminated against in favour of less meritorious medical students from the lower and scheduled castes will probably have much sympathy for David Rosin, a former vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons as well as a former president of the Association for Cancer Surgery. 																								For 10 years in a row, he failed to get the top platinum award and now believes that government policy aimed at promoting women and ethnic minorities is to blame. 																								Rosin said: When I asked a previous president (of the Royal College of Surgeons) why I had been unsuccessful, the answer came back immediately, What do you expect? You are not black, you are not female and you have all four limbs. 																								Rosin, who retired from his NHS post as a senior consultant surgeon at St Marys NHS Trust hospital, London, in June, believes government policy has now tipped into positive discrimination. 																								It is time that someone spoke up concerning the reverse discrimination with respect to merit awards, Rosin complained in a letter to the magazine Hospital Doctor. 																								Rosin, who is quoted in todays Sunday Times, appears a media savvy man. Not so long ago he told the papers that surgeons found it useful to have music playing in the background while they were operating. He personally favoured Vivaldi. 																								It is useful to have soothing music, he said at the time. It is some sort of background to nice fluid movements. 																								Today, he expressed incredulity that someone as obviously deserving as him had failed to win the platinum award, despite being editor of an international medical journal, editing 16 textbooks and publishing more than 100 peer-reviewed medical papers. 																								Merit awards can add up to 73,000 to a consultants annual salary of about 112,000 and, in the past, the vast majority of the extra payments went to an old boys network of sometimes mediocre white male consultants, said the Sunday Times. 																								The paper quoted Aneez Esmail, professor of general practice at Manchester University, whose research in 1998 showed how few women and ethnic minority consultants got the awards. 																								More women and ethnic minorities are (now) successful but the actual standards are not compromised, he said. Previously, mediocre white candidates were getting awards and you really had to be quite exceptional as a woman or ethnic minority to get an award. With more transparency and clear criteria there is greater competition and more women and ethnic minorities are successful. People like Mr Rosin may lose out. 																								His 1998 research, published in the British Medical Journal, showed that white consultants were given 95 per cent of bonuses despite making up just 74 per cent of the eligible consultant workforce. Non-white consultants earned just 5 per cent of bonuses despite making up 14 per cent of the eligible consultant workforce. 																								There have already been a large number of for and against responses to Rosins complaint received by the Sunday Times. 																								Jack Edward Sharpe Higginson, writing from Thiruvananthapuram in India, said: This just seems to be sour grapes by one guy who didnt get an award. 																								But a white doctor, writing from Australia, backed Rosin: Im a UK-trained surgeon  in my speciality field I knew of five other white males in the whole country  only one remains in the UK. Four of us have left for the Antipodes. Im not bitter  its the way of things  the white male is the enemy now in the UK. 																								In the past, who was promoted and who was not was in the hands of someone like Rosin. He was heavily involved in the teaching and examination of doctors of all grades and held appointments as the chairman of the examinations board of the Royal College of Surgeons, chairman of the Intercollegiate Surgical Examinations and of the Cancer Committee, and was the North West Thames regional adviser for the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He also examined for the Royal College of Surgeons of England for the intercollegiate FRCS and for the MS amp; MBBS examinations of the University of London and the University of the West Indies. 																								No has suggested that Rosin himself was not fair. But significantly, Rosin has not been backed by the British Medical Association, which said in a report that doctors working in the NHS faced discrimination because of their race, gender and sexual orientation. 																								Twice I was discriminated against white candidates, one unnamed doctor told the BMA. First was for a registrar job in a teaching hospital and then for senior registrar job in the 1990s. 																								Dr George Rae, chairman of the BMAs equal opportunities committee, commented: The report makes uncomfortable reading  doctors are facing barriers to their career progression every day of their lives because of their gender, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation.

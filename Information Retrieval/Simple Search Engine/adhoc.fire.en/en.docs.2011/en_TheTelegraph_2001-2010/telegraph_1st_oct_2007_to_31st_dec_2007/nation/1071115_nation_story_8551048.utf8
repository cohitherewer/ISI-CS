				 Councillor shot on road
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Srinagar, Nov. 14: A National Conference councillor was killed in Srinagar this morning, renewing fears of targeted political killings ahead of elections next summer. 																								Two pistol-wielding youths shot down Ghulam Nabi Wani outside his home in the Sheshgari locality of the old city.																								This is the second killing of a prominent politician by militants this year. In March, Congress leader Jan Mohammad Kakroo was gunned down in Baramulla amid calls of troop cuts by the Peoples Democratic Party. 																								Wani was shot at from point blank range as he was feeding street dogs. He received bullet injuries in his head and succumbed to them on way to hospital, Srinagar police chief Ahfad-ul Mujtaba said. Wanis security officer retaliated by opening fire at the duo, causing one of them to stumble on the road, Mujtaba said.																								But he managed to escape and we dont know whether he was injured. We have directed all hospitals to inform us if anyone goes to them with bullet injuries. 																								Senior party leaders visited Wanis house to express their condolences to the bereaved family. Security forces cordoned off the area and started search operations.																								Wani is the third councillor in the 68-member Srinagar Municipal Corporation to have fallen to militants bullets in the past three years. Elections to the civic body were held in 2005 after 25 years amid separatists calls for a boycott. Wani had won in a low-turnout contest. 																								Immediately after the elections, militants had gunned down Mohammad Maqbool Khaksar, who was a frontrunner for the post of mayor. Another member, Mohammad Ashraf Bhalla, was shot dead the same year.																								Todays killing comes at a time when parties have begun preparations for the polls. Mayor Abdul Rasheed Pandit blamed the government for not providing enough security, saying the lack of protection will make campaigning difficult. The government does not care for our lives and we are the soft targets. How can our men walk around freely if such killings take place? he asked.

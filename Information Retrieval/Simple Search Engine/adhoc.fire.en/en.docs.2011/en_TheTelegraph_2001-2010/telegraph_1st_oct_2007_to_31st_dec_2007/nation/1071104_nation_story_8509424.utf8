				 Sonia dares Modi in den
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Sonia in Anand on Saturday (PTI)																								Anand, Nov. 3: Sonia Gandhi today signalled that the Congress was ready to take Narendra Modi and the BJP head on in Gujarat and would not mince words about the 2002 post-Godhra riots.																								The Congress chief made it clear that the pride and prestige of Gujarat were not inextricably linked to Modis persona and BJP politics as they have sought to project.																								Rather, it was the Congress that could stake a more legitimate claim to both by virtue of Gujarats contribution to the Independence struggle and its humane political convictions.																								That Sonia chose Anand  the birthplace of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and the seat of the milk cooperative movement  to launch her campaign was telling.																								Anand is in central Gujarat, which was a Congress stronghold till the last Assembly elections. As Godhra is a part of this region, the Congress was wiped out. But it recovered partially in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, winning five out of eight seats.																								Addressing a huge rally of women, Sonia said: Gujarat has always enhanced the nations prestige. But the question is who should head this state? Those who are (heading it now) have no responsibility towards the state and its people, nor do they have a commitment to humane politics.																								She turned Modis vibrant Gujarat slogan on its head by declaring that the BJPs politics of hatred, corruption and injustice should be thrown out.																								We want a humane Gujarat where every human being, every caste and community will be able to breathe freely. A vibrant Gujarat is one which is truly humane.																								Alluding to the attacks on Muslims, especially women, in the post-Godhra period, she said those misdeeds could not be tolerated and made us hang our heads in shame.																								Can anyone tolerate the physical violence and heinous crimes that were committed against women? We are all mothers, daughters and sisters and we, therefore, feel their pain all the more acutely, Sonia said.																								Let us create a political order which has a place for women, the poor, Dalits and Adivasis, she added.																								Congress sources said the strategy to target women was influenced by the perception that they had rooted for Modi in the 2002 elections because they saw him as a symbol of single-minded determination.																								By choosing Anand, the Congress also answered Modis charge that it denied Sardar Patel his rightful place in history. Sonia visited Sardar Patels birthplace Karamsad, 15km away, just before the meeting.

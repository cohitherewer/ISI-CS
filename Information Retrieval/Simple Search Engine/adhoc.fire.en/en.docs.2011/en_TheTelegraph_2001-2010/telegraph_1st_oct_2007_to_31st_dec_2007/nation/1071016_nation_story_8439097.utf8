				 Colleagues in doctor attack net
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 15: Police have charged a senior doctor and the nursing warden of a government hospital with destroying evidence of the rape and attempted murder of a young doctor who was their colleague.																								Sunil Kumar Ravi, the chief medical officer of the employees state insurance (ESI) hospital in west Delhi, and Hari Kishan Meena were arrested late last night, the police said. They got bail today.																								The 26-year-old victim was found unconscious on the floor of her hostel room at the hospital by her sister and brother-in-law on the night of September 21. She had strangulation marks around her neck and injuries suggesting rape. 																								The woman was shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment and is still in a coma.																								We believe the two hospital officials destroyed some crucial evidence in the initial hours after the victim was br-ought in by her family, inspector Ramesh Khanna said.																								The senior doctor and the warden allegedly tried to cover up the scratch marks on the victims body before the police reached the hospital.																								They have told us they were trying to treat the victim, but in all police cases  and this was clearly going to be one  medical staff are authorised to administer only critical care to save the person till the police arrive, an officer said.																								The victims sister had told the police the hospital was callous during the initial treatment  an allegation corroborated by officers who were the first to reach the hospital.																								The callous attitude and the prompt action of trying to heal the scratches dont go together. Theres something fishy, an officer said.

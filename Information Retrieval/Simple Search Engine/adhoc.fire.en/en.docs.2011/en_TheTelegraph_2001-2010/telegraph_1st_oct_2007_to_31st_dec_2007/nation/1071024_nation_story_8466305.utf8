				 Flag warrant on Aamir 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Aamir Khan																								Indore, Oct. 23: A local court today issued a non-bailable warrant against Aamir Khan for allegedly disrespecting the national flag, adding to the problems of the actor who is in the thick of an ugly family battle involving his brother Faisal.																								The warrant followed a complaint filed under the Prevention of Insult to the National Honour Act of 1971 and relevant sections of the penal code. If found guilty, Aamir could be jailed for three years and/or fined.																								Advocate S. Sharma, who filed the complaint, said the actor was the chief guest at a function in August where the organisers, car dealers Ashok Rajpal and Rakesh Rajpal, violated the law by not taking down the flag before sunset.																								When the lapse was pointed out, Sharma added, the flags were taken down in a derogatory manner and placed on the ground.																								Rakesh Rajpal denied the charge. We have the highest respect for our national flag, he said.																								Sharma said the court of the judicial magistrate first class issued a bailable warrant against Aamir and three others on October 12, but they failed to turn up, resulting in todays non-bailable warrant.																								The court has fixed November 7 as the next date of hearing.																								In Mumbai, a court is probing if Aamirs younger brother Faisal is mentally stable or not.																								Faisal, who according to his family suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, recently alleged that Aamir has kept him captive at home and was forcing him to take medicines to make him mad.																								Aamir says that Faisal needs to take the medicines.																								Salman court date																								Salman Khan will appear before the principal bench of Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur tomorrow in connection with the chinkara poaching case, says a PTI report.																								The actor, who spent six nights in Central Jail here before being released on bail on August 31, was expected to reach Jodhpur tonight, sources close to him said.

				 Long way to literacy goal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 30: India is unlikely to meet its deadline to provide education for all by 2015, a Unesco report released in New York today suggested, pinpointing adult literacy as the biggest problem area.																								Despite initiatives like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which seeks to universalise primary education, and the National Literacy Mission, which targets adults, India ranks 105th out of 164 countries that committed themselves to eradicating illiteracy seven years ago. 																								Sandwiched between Nicaragua and war-torn Iraq on the list, India still has strong gender disparities in access to education, the report said. In terms of gender parity, India ranks 112.																								The Unesco report also highlighted that though India has a high enrolment rate in schools  its gross enrolment ratio (GER) is 0.946  it had failed to retain children up to Class V. Indias rate of retention is 0.789.																								Addressing an international conference on literacy in the capital today, Unesco director-general Koichiro Matsuura began by complimenting India on the initiatives in education it has taken since the turn of the century.																								However, quality is a concern. Rates of grade repetition and dropout are high, Matsuura told an audience that included UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and human resource development minister Arjun Singh. 																								Singh accepted that governments, including India, needed to focus on the large number of people who have not been able to ride the crest of the wave and ran the risk of being swept away. 																								But he steered clear of any comments on the report. Both Singh and Sonia reiterated the Centres target of achieving 85 per cent literacy by 2012, which was declared on Wednesday.																								The Unesco study aimed at evaluating how far each of the 164 countries that in 2000 signed its Education for All by 2015 campaign had reached at the half-way point. 																								Five parameters, including GER, adult literacy rate and gender parity in education, were calculated and used to compile an Education Development Index (EDI). India has an EDI of 0.797.

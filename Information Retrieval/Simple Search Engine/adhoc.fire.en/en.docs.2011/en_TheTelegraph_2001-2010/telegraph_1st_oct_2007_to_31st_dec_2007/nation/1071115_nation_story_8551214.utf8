 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Footloose after condolence meet				 																																																										He went to offer condolences but nearly came back without a sole.				 																																																										Pondicherry chief minister K. Rangaswamy was left on shaky ground recently when his sandals were stolen at a condolence meeting for the wife of thespian Shivaji Ganesan.				 																																																										Rangaswamy, an ardent Shivaji admirer, had travelled to Chennai to pay his respects to Kamala Ammal, who had passed away days before. But as he stepped out, he didnt find his chappals in the pile of foootwear outside the hall where the prayer meeting was held.				 																																																										Rangaswamy quietly sent his aides on a hunt. As they went about their job, a constable spotted a man he thought was walking away with the sandals but gave up the chase after the suspect hopped onto a cycle and rode away.				 																																																										An embarrassed Prabhu, Shivajis actor-son, arranged for a new pair of sandals and promised to send a pair of unused chappals left behind by his father to Pondicherry. Delighted, Rangasway took the loss in his stride. 				 																Luxury amp; royalty on course				 																																																										A confluence of royalty, fashion, polo and the finest Scotch whisky brought forth an afternoon of indulgent experiences in the capital recently. Riders and thoroughbreds competed for the Johnnie Walker Gold Label Polo Cup.				 																																																										While the national teams of India and New Zealand competed, designer Tarun Tahiliani unveiled a special clothing line in a fashion extravaganza to complement the game. Matching the occasion was a blend created in 1920 to mark the centenary celebrations of Johnnie Walker. 				 																																																										Events like these popularise the sport, said Jodhpur royal Gaj Singh, vice-president of the Indian Polo Association. 				 																																																										India is among the few countries where the royal sport has endured. This isnt just a sporting event, its about aristocracy and prestige, said Asif Adil, managing director of Diageo India, which organised the event.				 																Chip pirates face music				 																																																										Music piracy is fast moving from CDs to mobile chips, and Delhi police has begun a crackdown on what has emerged as the latest fad to avoid buying songs. On a tip-off from the Indian Music Industry (IMI), the police seized pirated mobile chips and equipment to make copies of loaded chips from a mobile phone shop in Connaught Place. 				 																																																										The chips were loaded with movies such as No Entry, Raja Hindustani, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and others. Piracy through mobile chips is a new and growing phenomenon, said IMI president Vijay Lazarus. 				 																																																										Earlier, a pirate needed a computer and CD burner to copy and sell counterfeit goods. Now, all they need is a mobile phone and a chip to exchange music, he said. Songs can be transferred from a mobile phone chip to a computer. 				 																																																										India has over 100 million mobile users. Even if one out of 10 users indulged in illegal chip-based transfers, the revenue losses would be huge. The raids followed IMI workshops to sensitise the police to chip-based piracy.				 																Dog duel				 																																																										Delhi has a monkey problem. Mumbai is caught up in a dog duel. 				 																																																										The Greater Mumbai civic body, asked by the high court to create shelters for stray dogs, has told judges it had set aside two plots for the purpose in neighbouring Thane.				 																																																										But it has asked the court if it was wise to spend crores, including food expenses for the caged dogs, at a time when many in Mumbai dont even have enough to eat.				 																																																	Delhi: Painter Seema Ghurayya presents Form and the Formless, an exhibition of her abstract art works this Thursday. The event will be held at Gallery Espace. The venue is located at 16 Community Centre, New Friends Colony. Time: 11am to 7pm.

				 Bait for NRI scientists
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 18: A new biotechnology development strategy announced last week will introduce a special package to lure back scientists of Indian origin and, for the first time, allow a science department to fund industry for high-risk projects. 																								In a departure from traditional funding styles, the department of biotechnology will also invest 30 per cent of its budget in public-private partnerships, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said, providing details of the new strategy. 																								These are big decisions designed to promote innovation and provide a boost to industry, Sibal said. 																								Under the novel partnership programme, the biotechnology department will provide 30 to 50 per cent of funding for high-risk technology projects.																								The department will also enhance the quality of biotechnology education at the masters level and expand doctoral programmes. It is working on an attractive re-entry package to bring back mid to senior-level scientists of Indian origin to work in India, Sibal said.

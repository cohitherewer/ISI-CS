				 Bands take brunt of bar girl exodus
 SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY				 	 No-show in Bangalore? A Delhi band performs in Calcutta																								Oct. 2: If you are at a Bangalore bar or restaurant, dont expect any music. The reason is, Carnatic classical and Indian folk is about all that the government will allow at the joints.																								To stop an invasion by Mumbais dance girls, Karnataka has virtually banished live bands from its eateries and watering holes, apart from those in five-star hotels.																								The state government introduced a stringent licensing regime two years ago, just after Maharashtra had banned its women bar dancers.																								The new rules say restaurants and bars do not need a licence for vocal and instrumental music recitals but would need one for live or pre-recorded music, whether or not accompanied by dancing.																								The implication is, Indian classical renditions are fine but popular music is not.																								Once a restaurant is forced to apply for licence, it is doomed. So far, none of the 150 applicants has got permission, the Karnataka Live Bands Restaurants Association claimed. Nor have old licences been renewed.																								The conditions are so oppressive and prohibitive that it amounts to a total ban on live bands, the association said.																								On dancing, the rules say licences are a must for cabarets and discotheques, but not for Bharatnatyam, Yakshagana Bayalata or folk art.																								The association, having lost a case in Karnataka High Court, has moved the Supreme Court where the state government yesterday linked popular music to bar dancers.																								Such pre-recorded songs are usually accompanied by live dancers. Theres a bar and there are girls like the Mumbai bar dancers, state counsel Sanjay Hegde said. They are like cabarets and discotheques.																								Cabarets? Discotheques? .with psychedelic lights? the bench asked and threw out the associations plea for immediate relief. It, however, admitted the appeal against the high court order.																								Live bands had staged a comeback in Karnatakas eateries in 2002 after restaurant owners won a long Supreme Court battle against an earlier set of tough licensing norms.																								The court allowed the bands to operate till the state came up with new licensing rules, which have proved equally strict. Association counsel Mukul Rohatgi told the apex court the bands were suffering. The state cited public order and decency.

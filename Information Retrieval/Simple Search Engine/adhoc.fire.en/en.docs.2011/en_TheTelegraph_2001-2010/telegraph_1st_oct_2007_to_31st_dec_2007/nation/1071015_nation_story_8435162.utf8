				 CPM, church in rites row
 JOHN MARY 																								Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 14: Relations between the Catholic Church and the CPM have hit a new low in Kerala, with the two locking horns over a bishops claim that a Marxist legislator had received the last rites before his death last year.																								CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, while marking the first death anniversary of Mathai Chacko in Kozhikode yesterday, condemned Bishop Mar Paul Chittilapallys statement that the MLA had received the Christian sacrament in his hospital bed in Kochi before succumbing to cancer.																								Last rites are administered to the sick in the Catholic Church for divine intercession to absolve them of sins. 																								Marxists are atheists and shun religious rituals.																								Vijayan said the bishops claim was an attempt to denigrate a true communist even in death. He accused Chittilapally of doing the dirty work for the Opposition United Democratic Front.																								Referring to the bishops reported disclosure that Chacko had received the sacrament from a priest when he was fully conscious, Vijayan said: A person slips out of his senses when he takes a few sips (of alcohol). I dont know whether this guy (Chittilapally) has that habit. 																								The bishop has, however, denied saying the MLA was conscious when he received the sacrament. He clarified that when he visited Chacko in hospital, he had sought his blessings and accepted a rosary. Later, Chackos relatives requested the bishop to administer the last rites. 																								Father Jose Kottayil, the secretary of the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council, confirmed in Kochi today that on Chittilapallys instructions, he had administered the last rites to Chacko in the presence of doctors, but the patient was unconscious. 																								Chackos brother M. Thomas said the MLA had not sought the sacrament either knowingly or unknowingly.																								None of the family members, including his wife, Mercy Chacko, had requested it. Its painful that anyone should try to raise such issues even before we have got over the tragedy, Thomas said. 																								Various church organisations have come out against Vijayans statement. Several dioceses took out rallies after the Sunday Mass.																								Opposition leader Oommen Chandy condemned Vijayans statement, saying it was not expected of a leader of a political party.																								The last communist to have allegedly received the last sacrament was Joseph Mundassery, who was a minister in the Namboodiripad cabinet. His relatives had, however, said it was an act of mischief by some nuns and priests after the minister had slipped into a coma.

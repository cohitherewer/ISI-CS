				 Kin cloud on Aamir
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 13: Aamir Khans brother Faisal wants independence from his older sibling who, he says, has been keeping him confined at home for the past ten months.																								Faisal  under treatment for the past two-and-a-half years for paranoia and schizophrenia  wrote to Mumbai police chief D.N. Jadhav saying the actor has been torturing him mentally and trying to control every move he makes.																								He is the backbone of the family. He is the sole provider, so my sister and mother are supporting him. I was admitted to a clinic without my consent and medicines were mixed with my every meal. Mr Aamir Khans bodyguards, too, forcibly made me have the medicines, Faisal said. I want my independence, he added.																								Faisals father Tahir Hussain, who has produced films like Caravan and Anamika, supports his younger son and claims he is healthy and able to make his own decisions.																								Aamir, who in 2000 acted in the box-office flop Mela with Faisal, has said in a statement that his brother was unstable because he had stopped taking the prescribed medicines.

				 Monica free to act, not Sanjay
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Monica Bedi, Sanjay Dutt																								New Delhi, Nov. 2: Bollywood has got back Monica Bedi but will have to wait beyond Diwali for Sanjay Dutt.																								The Supreme Court today allowed the actress, out on bail in a passport forgery case in Hyderabad for the past five months, to travel unhindered across the country for film shoots.																								Todays directive modifies its May 17 order that had required Monica, extradited from Lisbon along with gangster Abu Salem in November 2005, to stay put in Chabbewal, her ancestral village in Hoshiarpur district of Punjab.																								In his arguments asking for the curbs on her movement to be lifted, Monicas lawyer K.T.S. Tulsi said: She does not want to depend on her parents for support.																								In her petition, the actress claimed the restrictions on her movement were coming in the way of her career. Monica said she had offers from producers, especially those from Hyderabad, but couldnt take them up because she was barred from stepping out of Chabbewal. 																								It is not possible for the petitioner (Monica Bedi) to practise her profession while remaining in her village and awaiting police permission every time she had to undertake a visit outside, she said in her petition. 																								Todays order, passed by a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, lifts the movement curbs but requires Monica to keep police informed about her trips.																								Prosecuting agency CBI opposed the move to grant her relief on the ground that she could easily slip out of the country. 																								What one passport? She can procure many more, additional solicitor-general Amarendra Sharan said.																								In her petition, Monica cited Article 19 of the Constitution, which mentions the freedom to practise any trade, occupation or profession as a fundamental right.																								Diwali in jail																								The judges who allowed Monica to move freely were not convinced about the urgency of Sanjays bail plea.																								The chief justices bench said the actors petition will be heard on November 20, rejecting his lawyers requests for an earlier date.																								This means Sanjay will have to spend Diwali, on November 9, in Punes Yerwada jail, where he was taken on October 22 after being given copies of the 1993 Bombay blasts verdict. He had been out on interim bail till then.																								Sanjays lawyer, V.R. Manohar, told the court that the actors case stood on a different legal footing from those convicted under anti-terror law Tada. 																								Hes been convicted under the arms act. So, he is in a different category. Hes already undergone one-third of his punishment and faced the torture of a 15-year trial, he said. 																								The actor, convicted of illegal possession of arms, has been sentenced to six years in jail by the anti-terror court. 																								The Supreme Court had given him interim bail on August 20 on the condition that he would surrender once he was given a copy of the Tada courts judgment.

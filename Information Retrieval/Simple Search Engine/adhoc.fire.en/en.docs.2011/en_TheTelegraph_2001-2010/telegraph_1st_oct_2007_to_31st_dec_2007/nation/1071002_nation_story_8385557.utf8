				 Bonus salute to working class
 NISHIT DHOLABHAI				 	 Boom bonanza																								New Delhi, Oct. 1: Those with salaries up to Rs 10,000 will be eligible for bonus, as will countless construction workers who do not have the right to such payouts.																								The cabinet today cleared amendments to the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, to bring more workers into the bonus fold, extending the law to a part of the unorganised sector by including those involved in construction.																								The twin changes, part of the Centres aam aadmi initiatives with an eye on early polls, will have far-reaching implications for the private sector since it will raise wage bills. We salute the working class, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the minister who briefed reporters after the cabinet meeting, said.																								Labour minister Oscar Fernandes, also present at the announcement, said the decision to increase the salary ceiling will benefit workers in the organised sector  government and private companies. They make up around 7 per cent of the countrys total labour force.																								However, government employees cannot be assured of the pay bonanza. Officials in the labour and employment ministry said the measures only meant a moral obligation and were not mandatory in any way. 																								Their argument was that the government was not deemed an entity involved in production, a premise that underpins the bonus act. However, workers of public sector units and state undertakings stand to benefit.																								The industry was consulted on the increase in the salary cap, Fernandes said, but the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) said it had only agreed to an upper limit of Rs 7,500, not Rs 10,000. 																								On construction workers, the problem lies in lack of data. Government estimates put the number at 1.8 crore but it is difficult to put a number on the beneficiaries.																								We do not have data on private contractors in construction, said Harcharan Singh, the deputy director-general in the labour and employment ministry. If the amendments are passed by Parliament, even those who have put in 30 days of work can demand a bonus from contractors. 																								Health cover																								The cabinet has also cleared a health insurance scheme for unorganised sector workers below the poverty line. 																								The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna will cover medical expenses up to Rs 30,000 annually. The Centre will contribute 75 per cent of the premium and the states the remaining 25 per cent. The beneficiaries will only be required to pay a renewal and registration fee of Rs 30 each year.

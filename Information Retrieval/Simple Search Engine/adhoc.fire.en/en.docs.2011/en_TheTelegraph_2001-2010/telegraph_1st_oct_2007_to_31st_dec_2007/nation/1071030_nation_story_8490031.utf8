				 Did you shoot Pramod? No
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 29: Praveen Mahajan, accused of killing elder brother Pramod, today denied having fired at the BJP leader.																								False, Praveen said, without showing any emotion, when asked by additional sessions judge Shrihari Daware if the prosecution charge that he shot his brother was true.																								Praveen said he came to know about his brothers hospitalisation and death through newspaper reports.																								He had pleaded not guilty to the charge at earlier hearings, too.																								Dressed in a purple kurta and white pyjama, the 46-year-old was asked to reply to some questions from a list of 519 prepared by the judge. He could only reply true, false or I dont know. The rest of the questions will be put to him tomorrow. The court will hear the final arguments in the case next week and might hand out the verdict next month.																								Praveen denied the allegation, made by Pramods widow Rekha and his brother-in-law Gopinath Munde, that he had demanded Rs 1 crore from the BJP leader and shot him because he refused to give him the money. 																								He also dubbed false the charge that he had sent a text message warning Pramod of dire consequences days before the shooting. 																								Neither Rekha nor Munde had mentioned the allegation in their initial statements but had done so during trials held earlier this year.																								Praveen also said Rekhas statement that she saw him firing at her husband was false. He gave the same reply when asked if the shooting took place on April 22, 2006, and whether Pramod had offered him a cup of tea.

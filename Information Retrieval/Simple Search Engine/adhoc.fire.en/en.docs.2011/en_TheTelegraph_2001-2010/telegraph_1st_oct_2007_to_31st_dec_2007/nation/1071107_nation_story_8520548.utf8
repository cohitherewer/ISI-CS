				 Death in bed, not at gallows
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Nov. 6: Mohammad Iqbal Shaikh, sentenced to death for his role in the 1993 Bombay blasts, died of tuberculosis in a Pune hospital today.																								Shaikh had parked an RDX-packed scooter  one of nine vehicles used as bombs in the serial explosions that killed 257 people  outside a doctors clinic on March 12, 1993. 																								Special anti-terror court judge Pramod Kode convicted the 35-year-old on July 20 this year. He was then moved from Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai to Punes Yerwada Jail, where actor Sanjay Dutt is now lodged. Shaikh was taken to the state-run Sassoon Hospital on October 26. He died at 7.30am today.																								Part of the group that received arms training at Sandheri and Bhorghat villages in Raigad, he had also attended conspiracy meetings and assembled bombs in the garage of the Al-Husseini building in Mahim where prime accused Tiger Memons family lived.																								Shaikh was assigned the task of parking a Bajaj Chetak scooter filled with RDX in a busy market at Dadar in central Mumbai. But the bomb failed to explode and gave the police the first clues about the use of cavities in vehicles to pack RDX and timer devices. 																								Finding the scooter parked in front of his clinic for more than 48 hours, the doctor alerted the police. A bomb detection and disposal squad defused the bomb on March 14, two days after the blasts. 																								Shaikh also rode a motorcycle belonging to Tiger Memons absconding brother Ayub to Sahar airport on March 12, 1993. Co-accused Nasim Barmare, who was riding pillion, lobbed a grenade inside the airports parking bay. 																								Referring to the two incidents, Kode observed: In both the acts, there were no deaths. But these were repeated acts of terror. Hence, this case qualifies as rarest of the rare and I am sentencing Shaikh to death.																								At the time, Shaikh was already suffering from tuberculosis. On the day of the verdict, he complained to the judge that he was not being given proper medical treatment in jail. 																								Shaikh is the second convict among the 100 sentenced in the case to have died. Dawood Ibrahim associate Ejaz Pathan, who was suffering from several ailments, died at JJ Hospital in Mumbai on June 15, barely a week after he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.

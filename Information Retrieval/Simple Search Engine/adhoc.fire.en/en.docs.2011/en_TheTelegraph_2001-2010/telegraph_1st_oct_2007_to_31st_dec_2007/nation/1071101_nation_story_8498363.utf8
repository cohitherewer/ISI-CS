				 Aamir denied custody, brother thanks God
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Aamir																								Mumbai, Oct. 31: A court today denied Aamir Khan the custody of his younger brother Faisal, who has been undergoing treatment for an alleged psychological disorder.																								The Bandra metropolitan court ordered that Faisals custody be given to their father, Tahir Hussain.																								Faisal, who has already spent about a fortnight in JJ Hospitals psychiatric ward, had been produced before the court on October 16 after his mother, who stays with Aamir, filed a missing persons complaint with police. 																								Today, however, Faisal accused the doctors of confusing the court and being biased against him but much of his resentment was directed at Aamir. I am happy with the courts decision. This shows that God has taken the side of truth. Who is Aamir to take care of me? Faisal told reporters after stepping out of the court. 																								Aamir also attended the hearing but drove off after the proceedings were over. Later, he issued a statement saying he had been looking after Faisal for the past two-and-a-half years to the best of his ability and on doctors advice.																								I have always wanted the best for my brother and care for him deeply. The head of the department of psychiatry at JJ Hospital has concluded that Faisal is ill and needs to be in the custodial care of a responsible family member. I expressed to the court that I would like to take on that responsibility along with the support of my mother and sisters. The court has granted custody to my father and I respect the order, he said.																								The order said Tahir has been given custody for a month, during which Faisal will have to report to Khar police station every alternate day. If his behaviour is found to be abnormal, he would be taken into police custody. The court will take a decision on the final custody after reviewing his condition during this period.																								In his affidavit filed to secure Faisals custody, Aamir alleged that his father had lied to the court about his age  possibly to suggest he was capable of taking care of his son  and also that he was on the verge of bankruptcy.																								In the court, Aamir spoke of his fathers debts and claimed he had put in a public notice in film journals a few years back warning people not to offer Tahir financial help on the basis of his (the actors) goodwill. The house Tahir was living in was mortgaged to a private company, Aamir said in his affidavit.																								Tahir denied the allegations today. I am capable of providing for my son. Aamir need not worry on this count.

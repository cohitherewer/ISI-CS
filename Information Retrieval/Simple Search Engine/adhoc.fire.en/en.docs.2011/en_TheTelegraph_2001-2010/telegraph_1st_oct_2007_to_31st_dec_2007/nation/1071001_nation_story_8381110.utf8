				 Covers off sex-for-job scandal in UP police
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Sept. 30: Women applicants were sexually exploited by political leaders in exchange for jobs in Uttar Pradesh police, an inquiry committee has found.																								Shailajakant Mishra, the additional director-general of state police and chairman of the committee, revealed this at a news conference in Lucknow this evening. 																								The politicians names or their party affiliation has not been revealed. All the recruitments were made during Mulayam Singh Yadavs rule.																								The Mayavati government, which set up the committee, today suspended seven more senior IPS officers and annulled the recruitment of 7,400 policemen. According to the probe report, the officers had colluded with politicians in violating recruitment norms. 																								Mishra said the probe committee received complaints from some successful women candidates that they were sexually exploited by political leaders before being hired. 																								These charges are serious and need to be investigated by a specialised agency. We would recommend a special probe into these allegations, the head of the inquiry panel said, adding criminal cases would be filed against those involved in the recruitment violations. 																								The complaints came from women who had applied and got jobs in the radio communication department of state police. Refusing to give the names or the number of women who had complained, Mishra would only say there was more than one. 																								With todays action, the number of IPS officers suspended stands at 25 and the number of policemen sacked at 17,000.																								Mishra is still probing the recruitment of policemen by eight boards. Fifty-five boards had recruited over 22,000 constables in 2005-06 during Mulayams rule. 																								J.N. Chambers, the principal secretary, home, told reporters this evening that departmental proceedings have been started against all the 25 IPS officers involved in the recruitment process.

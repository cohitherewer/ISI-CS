				 Grandma treks for Bengal kids
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 				 	 The trekkers before they left for Dharamshala																								New Delhi, Oct. 7. Beverly Wilen has left the bundle of joy that has just entered her life for the happiness she hopes to bring to the lives of children from Bengal  a place she has never visited.																								The 55-year-old Canadian human resource executive, who became a grandmother last Tuesday, will be trekking up the Himalayas along with company executives from over 20 countries, the latest friends of child domestic workers in Bengal.																								Fifty executives at various stages of their corporate lives have signed up with an international NGO  Save the Children  to together collect 1 million (Rs 8 crore) for underprivileged children by the end of 2008. 																								Half of that money will be distributed by the NGO to local self-help groups working with child domestic workers in Bengal.																								In my country, children have the birthright to free education and health. When I see and hear about the plight of young children in India and other developing countries, I feel the urge to do something. Theyre children, after all, said Wilen. 																								The executives  used to a life of luxury, they admit  will be trekking up to a height of 3,700 metres the coming week, blogging details of their journey daily and pursuing all their friends, relatives and professional contacts to donate.																								Im not used to living in tents, I admit. We will have no electricity, no telephones for the duration of the trek (five days), laughed Carl Pickering, a manager working out of the UK, who turned 50 yesterday.																								The trekkers will walk a distance of some 80km from Dharamshala to Triund and back before returning to Delhi on October 12.																								The executives  all from Reckit Benckiser, a company best known for its antiseptic Dettol  will then go to Calcutta.																								The trekkers will be taken to the most endemic source areas for child labour  Murshidabad and North and South 24-Parganas  for first-hand experience, Shireen Miller of the NGO said.																								Wilen said she has already collected nearly 22,000 (Rs 17.6 lakh), half of which she has contributed herself.																								Ive told all my friends and contacts that Ill contribute a matching amount for any donation they make. Thats the only way I can convince them to give, she said.

				 																Mercury out of Delhi hospitals				 																																																										Hospitals and clinics in Delhi may soon have to do away with equipment and apparatus containing mercury, if the government agrees to a proposal made by a committee under its health department.

Exposure to mercury for prolonged periods is known to damage the nervous system and can harm the kidneys. In a few research studies, mercury has been shown to affect pregnancy. 				 																																																										The committee found mercury from broken apparatus spilt in several hospitals. No priority was being given to cleaning the mercury spill, the committee observed. The metal is found in its liquid form at room temperature. 				 																																																										It has asked the government to start getting rid of mercury from hospitals in a phased manner so that patients dont suffer because of the lack of medical equipment. The committee has recommended that hospital staff be made more aware of the mercury hazards.

But the All India Egalitarian Peoples Party  a breezy translation of the partys name in Tamil  declared that it will not oppose those who want to learn other Indian languages apart from their mother tongue. Language has long been a touchy issue in the state and Kumar is expected be assailed by critics and political adversaries alike for his apparent show of linguistic ecleticism.

BEST will use the profit from the sale of tickets to maintain the buses. 				 																																																										The first batch of 11 buses will roll out of BEST depots in two months. 				 																																																										Friendship Visions Ashok Shah confirmed the agreement with BEST but refused to divulge details. In other countries, people prefer to travel by government buses because they are comfortable.

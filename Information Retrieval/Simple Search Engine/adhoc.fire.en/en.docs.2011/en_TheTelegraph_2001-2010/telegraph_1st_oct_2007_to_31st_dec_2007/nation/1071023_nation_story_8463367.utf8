				 Modi stokes poll fire
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 22: The fire near Narendra Modis rally in Surat last night seems to have come as a godsend for the chief minister to hit out at his rivals ahead of the coming state polls.																								This seems to be the work of either the Opposition party (Congress) or BJP rebels. If they really want to do something, then I challenge them to set me on fire, Modi told reporters today on the way to Amreli district for a public meeting.																								The rebels have dismissed the charge as humbug, dubbing the incident a stunt by Modis supporters to gain sympathy. 																								The rally had been organised to felicitate the chief minister. Just after he left the venue around 10pm, more than three dozen two-wheelers and a truck went up in flames in the parking area. No one was injured. 																								Police said prima facie it appears that it was a deliberate attempt with one motorcycle being first set on fire, which spread to the other two-wheelers. 																								The police have not identified the culprits yet. A case of rioting has been registered and some suspects are being interrogated, deputy police commissioner Subhash Trivedi said. 																								Toeing Modis line, the BJP pointed fingers at the rebels. Party spokesperson Vijay Rupani called the incident a handiwork of desperate dissidents.

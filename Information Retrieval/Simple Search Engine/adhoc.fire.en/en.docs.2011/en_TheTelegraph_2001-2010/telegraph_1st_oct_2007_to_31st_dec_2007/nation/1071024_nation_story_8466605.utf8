				 T20 too hot for moral minister
 							 - Pawar colleague finds cheerleaders obscene, threatens action SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI				 	 Cheerleaders perform during the India-Australia T20 match at Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai on Saturday. (PTI) 																								Mumbai, Oct. 23: The minister who banned bar dancers now threatens action to stop twenty20 games being spiced up with scantily clad cheerleaders.																								Maharashtra deputy chief minister R.R. Patil claims to have received complaints from eminent spectators against the cheerleaders obscene dancing and clothes at Saturdays India-Australia game  the first T20 international in India.																								Patil, who also holds charge of home affairs, has brought the matter under the polices scanner and will now be treating himself to videotapes of the dancing to decide if it fits his notions of morality.																								I was not present at the match but we will go through the tapes before taking any action. I am told their performance was vulgar and their movements left nothing to the imagination, the Nationalist Congress Party leader said.																								The ministers party chief Sharad Pawar, who also happens to be cricket board president, had watched the game from the clubhouse stands with chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. Neither was available for comment.																								Patil had made nation-wide headlines after pushing the decision to ban dance bars in the state two years ago. His latest move is being seen as a Pawar salvo at board official Lalit Modi, a one-time friend.																								Modi had expected to be nominated the next board chief but had to make way for Shashank Manohar after gradually falling out with Pawar over a host of issues.																								Now chairman of the Indian Premier League, Modi plans to popularise the shortest version of the game in the domestic circuit. He brushed aside Patils announcement today.																								I am not concerned about R.R. Patils comments. As far as T20 matches in India are concerned, the cheerleaders will be very much part of the game  both in the international and the domestic circuits.																								Saturdays match was a super success with the tickets sold out days in advance. The board made Rs 35 crore, the highest revenue it has ever earned from a single match.																								The Brabourne Stadium, steeped in tradition and memories of a time when cricket was played only in whites, resounded to groovy tracks under the floodlights and hosted disc jockeys and cheerleaders, many of them foreigners.																								The razzmatazz, with firecrackers going off, seemed to be an instant hit with all sections of spectators and set up a carnival atmosphere.																								Everyone loved the cheerleaders and the party spirit at the match. Who cares for R.R. Patil or his archaic views? Its time he resigned as home minister and took charge as the minister for morality, said adman Prahlad Kakkar.

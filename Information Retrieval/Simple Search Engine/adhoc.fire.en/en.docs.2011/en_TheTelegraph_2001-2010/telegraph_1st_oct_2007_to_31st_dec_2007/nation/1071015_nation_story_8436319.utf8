				 Priest protest singes Mass
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Oct. 14: A Thanjavur church was forced to shut the doors on its Sunday Mass after parishioners demanding the removal of a priest laid siege to the complex.																								The group of worshippers, led by local panchayat chairperson Madhimalar, gathered outside Lourda Sahaya Annai Peraalayam, the church on the outskirts of the town, and shouted slogans against Father Vincent Sebastian. He is accused of harassing a woman laity, though there has been no police complaint.																								The protesters also surrounded the guesthouse within the complex where the priest was staying, local authorities said. Sebastian had allegedly gone out with the woman, angering worshippers who argued that the priest, expected to be a role model, could not take such liberties.																								The siege sparked tension in the area and the protesters dispersed only after assurances from police that they would investigate the matter if the lady in question filed a formal complaint. Till evening, though, she hadnt approached the police.																								Police have not received any complaint, collector C. Vijayaraj Kumar said. 																								Sources said Sebastian had earlier drawn fire for refusing to sign cheques for women self-help groups functioning under the auspices of a trust controlled by the church.

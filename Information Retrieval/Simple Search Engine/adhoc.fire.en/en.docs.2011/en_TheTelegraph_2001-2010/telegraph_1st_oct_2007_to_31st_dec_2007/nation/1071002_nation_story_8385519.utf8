				 Army backs Burma
 JYOTI MALHOTRA				 	 Monks protest at the Myanmar embassy in Delhi on Monday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Oct. 1: The protests in Myanmar may be led by monks carrying placards of the Buddha, but India is keeping a watchful eye on the tense situation in its eastern neighbourhood.																								On his first day at work, army chief Deepak Kapoor used Myanmars old name, Burma, to refer to the protests in that country, but his message was clear: the Indian Army was in favour of maintaining close relationships with the military regime, while the recent unrest was its internal affair.																								Kapoor went much further than foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee who, in New York last week, had said India was concerned over the situation in Myanmar. Myanmars process of national reconciliation initiated by the authorities should be expedited, Mukherjee said.																								Kapoors blunt comments sum up Indias policy on Myanmar more clearly than Mukherjee, who seemed to have been attempting a delicate balancing act while sitting in America.																								Indias dilemma is plain to see. On the one hand, the US and the European Union are putting pressure on democratic India to take a hard line on the monks protests. On the other, Myanmars other neighbour, China, is pushing the State Peace and Development Council, the military regime, for restraint.																								In Delhis view, a hundred thousand monks are hardly going to be able to overthrow the military regime. 																								Delhi believes that even if some top generals are replaced, the army will retain control. That is why the foreign ministry has so far refused to summon Myanmars ambassador U Kyi Thein to explain events at home, knowing that if this were to happen, it would signal a shift in policy.

				 Politics not as bad as I thought
																								Excerpts from Sonia Gandhis interaction at the HT Leadership Summit in New Delhi:																								Q: Is there any tension between you and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?																								A: Those who have doubts about the Prime Minister and I working together obviously do not know either the Prime Minister or me.																								We have worked closely together for a long time and have an excellent working rapport. If he feels he has to bring something to my notice, he does it in all frankness and the same applies to me, too.																								Q: Did you think of any leader other than Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister?																								A: There was never a doubt. No, never, absolutely not.																								Q: Did you ever think of having a deputy Prime Minister?																								A: That was never considered.																								Q: What is the role of the Congress president in the coalition?																								A: As chairperson of UPA, I interact with leaders of the coalition parties and the Left. I head meetings of concerned coordination committees.																								Involvement in government policies is not much. At times, when my views are not quite matching with that of the government, I discuss with the Prime Minister.																								Q: How will you grade the governments performance after its completion of three-and-a-half years?																								A: I am absolutely satisfied with the working of the UPA government. I applaud the Prime Minister for the manner in which he has run the government and the coalition.																								Q: Are you embarrassed by the economic success?																								A: I am not embarrassed. In fact, we are proud of it... but we cannot brag about our economic growth. We cannot forget that there are still areas where people live in extreme poverty.																								Q: The Indian economy is growing but people say it is not because of politicians...																								A: I think there is a great deal of cynicism in certain sections of society about politicians. I think it is a bit unfair. There are also very serious and committed politicians. Manmohan Singh is one. There are many across party lines.																								Q: Was not there disdain about politics in you when you entered politics?																								A: Because of seeing the worst of politics, I did have some reservations. My husband was assassinated.																								Q: Do you think now in retrospect that it was not that bad?																								A: It has not been as bad as I had thought... you make a difference for the better.																								Q: What are the areas where work has not been done?																								A: We have not been able to persuade all of them (coalition partners) for 33 per cent reservation for women.																								Q: Do you have close advisers like R.K. Dhawan or Brajesh Mishra?																								A: I do consult my colleagues, CWC members and some senior and younger colleagues. It depends upon situation and issues. There is no single individual like that.																								Q: What about your attack on those opposing the nuclear deal at a rally in Haryana?																								A: Everyone would want me to say that it was an attack on the Left. But it was not. I was in Haryana and talking about the opposition to our government there. We are working in a coalition. If I want to say about something that I dont agree with them, the last thing I would do is to go out and shout and scream and say I dont approve of it. I dont agree. I would call that person and tell him directly.																								Q: Are elections on the horizon?																								A: No, we are not in favour of early elections. As the Prime Minister has said, the deadline is 2009. We are going to do all that we can to see that we implement our programmes till 2009.

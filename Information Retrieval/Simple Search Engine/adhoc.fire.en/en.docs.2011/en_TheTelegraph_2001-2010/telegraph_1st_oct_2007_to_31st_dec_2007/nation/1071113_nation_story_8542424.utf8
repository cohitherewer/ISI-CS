				 Haj flights late, Patil sees red
 BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA AND MUZAFFAR RAINA				 	 Pilgrims wave to relatives as they leave for Haj in Srinagar. (PTI)																								New Delhi/Srinagar, Nov. 12: The governments attempts to ensure a hassle-free Haj for Srinagar pilgrims this year have crashed.																								The first batch of pilgrims, who left yesterday for Saudi Arabia via Sharjah, were stuck at the airport for 12 hours following a tyre-burst. 																								Today, the aircrafts tyres caught fire when it landed to pick up the second group of Haj pilgrims. The 10am flight took off at 6.35pm.																								Upset, Union home minister Shivraj Patil summoned civil aviation secretary Ashok Chawla and asked him to ensure Haj flights ran on time.																								Today, 213 pilgrims were stuck at the airport  they were not allowed to go out because of security concerns.																								Half of them were women and there were many elderly pilgrims, too. They had all cleared security and immigration checks and could not leave the airport, a home ministry official said.																								Abdul Rasheed Mir, the Haj officer in the Jammu and Kashmir government, said they were reciting the Quran and some people were delivering sermons throughout the day. 																								Ghulam Mohammad Dar, the Srinagar senior superintendent of police, anti-hijacking, said the fire could have turned dangerous had the plane crashed into a nearby depot containing highly inflammable material. Luckily, the plane did not skid off the runway.																								Special arrangements had been made for the Haj pilgrims this time by the state government and the Union home ministry.																								 A Haj House was built at a cost of Rs 13.5 crore. The first in the state, the house was inaugurated three days before the pilgrimage started. Special buses ferried pilgrims from the Haj House to the airport. Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad had come from Jammu to see the pilgrims off.																								Arrangements had also been made for a single window for passport, visa and security clearances and also for customs and immigration checks.																								All went well. The Haj house was a hit with the pilgrims. They did not have to run from pillar to post, like they generally have to do for Haj arrangements. Everything was provided under one roof. But our planes proved as unreliable as ever, the home ministry official said.																								More than 8,000 pilgrims from the Valley have been cleared for the pilgrimage this year. 																								Patil, sources said, told the civil aviation secretary that despite their efforts, the impression of a lackadaisical attitude had been created. The home minister asked him to explain why the aircraft had not been checked before being sent to Srinagar. 																								He also told Chawla that if need be, two flights could be operated from Srinagar instead of one, but at no cost should pilgrims be caused any hardship.																								The aviation secretary assured him that he would personally monitor the flights and said it was just a coincidence that the Srinagar flights had been delayed. Six other Haj flights operate in the country and all were on time, he added.																								Direct flights for Haj have been operating from Srinagar for the past few years, although flights to other international destinations are yet to start. The airport remains heavily guarded to prevent any militant strike, with a large contingent of security forces deployed inside.

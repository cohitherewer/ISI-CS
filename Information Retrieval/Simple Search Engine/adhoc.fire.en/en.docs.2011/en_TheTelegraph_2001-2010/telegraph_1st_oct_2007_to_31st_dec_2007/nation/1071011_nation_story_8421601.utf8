				 BJP braces for test run
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Oct. 10: The Gujarat election means more to the BJP than just another battle against the Congress.																								The outcome will not only affect the fortunes of chief minister Narendra Modi and leader of Opposition L.K. Advani but will also tell on the BJPs prospects in the general elections.																								Under normal circumstances, a party that has ruled the state for 15 years would not have lost sleep worrying about the outcome. But Gujarat, seen as the Hindutva laboratory, votes at a time when a parliamentary election looms. The BJP will be demoralised if its most powerful general (Modi) is disarmed before the big battle. 																								A possible defeat of Modi, projected as party chief and even a prime ministerial candidate, will alter equations within the BJP and could affect the partys position nationally.																								What worries the BJP is that Gujarat now is different from what it was in 2002, when Modi swept the polls by polarising voters on communal lines in the aftermath of the Godhra riots.																								The political dynamics have undergone a sea change. Although Advani remains Modis biggest mentor, the Sangh Parivar has changed its opinion about the chief minister. 																								The VHP, the main force behind Modi in the last election, is hostile towards him; the RSS appears indifferent.																								To make matters more difficult, the BJP itself is a divided house in the state with senior leaders, including two former chief ministers, joining the rebels against Modi.																								The animosity hasnt gone away. After the election schedule was announced today, rebel leader Sidharth Parmar told The Telegraph from Ahmedabad that there would be no compromise. We are waiting for directives from Keshubhai Patel and Suresh Mehta to decide whether to fight Modi separately or with the Congress. 																								Some signs of Modis problems emerged in the 2004 parliamentary elections, when the Congress made deep inroads into BJP pockets by winning 12 of the 26 seats in the state. The rebels believe they have created an anti-Modi atmosphere that the Congress only has to exploit. 																								Sources said both the Congress and the BJP rebels have turned the campaign into a Modi-centric exercise. 																								BJP leaders said the personal attacks on the chief minister have forced him to play the Hindutva card, a strategy that has only been helped by the Ram setu controversy.

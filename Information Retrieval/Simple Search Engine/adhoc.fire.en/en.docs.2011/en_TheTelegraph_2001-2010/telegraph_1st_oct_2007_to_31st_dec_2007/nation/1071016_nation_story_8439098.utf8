				 Himachal war over poll date
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Oct. 15: A tug of war has broken out over the dates of the two-phase elections in Himachal Pradesh.																								The Congress wants the polls, slated for November 14 and December 19, pushed to a later date because of harsh winter conditions. The BJP has opposed the demand, saying the ruling party is trying to delay possible defeat.																								Both sides put their points before the Election Commission today. Chief minister Veerbhadra Singh and party leader R.K. Dhawan led the Congress team. Not long after their meeting, the BJP team led by party vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi trooped in.																								The Congress leaders also argued that holding the elections on schedule would lead to a situation where there would be two Houses.																								The term of the present Assembly is till March. This would lead to two Assemblies at a time. We have brought this to the notice of the commission, Dhawan said. 																								The BJP leaders rejected the argument and told the panel that any rescheduling of dates would affect its credibility. 																								Any change will be seen as a sign of the panel buckling under Congress pressure. That impression shouldnt be created, Naqvi said. The Congress was only trying to delay inevitable defeat, he added.																								Former chief minister P.K. Dhumal, part of Naqvis delegation, said his party was prepared for the polls whenever they were held. If the Election Commission wants to postpone it, we are ready. We are confident we will win a two-thirds majority. 																								Dhawan denied the BJP allegation that fear of defeat was behind the Congresss request for a postponement. We are always prepared to face elections. We are only raising the problems of the people.																								Under the schedule announced last week, three constituencies where the winter is the harshest will vote on November 14. The rest will go to the polls on December 19.

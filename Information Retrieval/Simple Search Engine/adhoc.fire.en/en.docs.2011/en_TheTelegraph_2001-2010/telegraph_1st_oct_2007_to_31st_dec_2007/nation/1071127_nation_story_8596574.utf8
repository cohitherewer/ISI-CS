				 Minorities lose nursery waiver
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: Delhi High Court today stayed its earlier order granting exemption to schools run by minority educational institutions from guidelines for nursery admissions prescribed by a court-appointed committee.																								The ruling comes two days after the court allowed all private schools to prepare their own criteria, to be cleared by the Delhi government, for such admissions. 																								The government has the task of ensuring that the criteria set by schools are in conformity with the guidelines of the committee headed by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) chairman Ashok Ganguly. 																								Todays stay places minority institutions on a par with other schools. 																								The committee had recommended that schools abort nursery entrance interviews, both for children and their parents. It had also suggested that the children be admitted after they turn four.																								The panel suggested a 100-point entrance criteria that would favour those children who live near the school and have siblings studying there. 																								Girls and differently abled children were to be given an advantage, as were kids whose parents were the alumni of a school. 																								The court had accepted all the recommendations of the Ganguly committee but schools protested, saying they wanted to be allowed to frame their own guidelines. 																								The court has now decided that while children below four must not be admitted, and interviews must not be held, schools can prepare their own entry rules in conformity with the recommendations of the committee.

				 Patel village rues our defeat

 															- Why Congress lost in chief strategists area

																								Piraman (Bharuch), Dec. 30: This villages most well-known son was the Congresss chief strategist for the Gujarat polls. And Piraman, Ahmed Patels ancestral home near the industrial town of Ankleshwar, has a few ideas why its own party lost.
																								Dawoodbhai Vohra, the wrinkles on his face betraying his 70-odd years, said the Congress, to Gujarati caste Hindus, had become a party of the Muslims, Scheduled Castes and tribals.
																								But the problem is, say residents of this minority-dominated village, large sections of the Muslims do not see the Congress as their party.
																								Happy with development in their region, Kutch, which the Sardar Sarovar Dam now supplies with the Narmadas waters, many from the community voted for Narendra Modi.
																								So, even with a 47 per cent Muslim population, the neighbouring Bharuch constituency stayed loyal to the BJP.
																								All 65 households in Piraman  where Patel, Sonia Gandhis political secretary, spent a few days during the election  voted for the Congress. But the BJP won from the constituency, Ankleshwar-Hansot, for the third consecutive time.
																								If Praveen Togadia had been a Congress candidate, even he would have lost, said Sulaimanbhai Vohra. Khatijabanu and several other younger women agreed.
																								Another reason for the Congresss defeat, Dawoodbhai said, was nobody in the region bought the partys defence of reservation. Dawoodbhai himself didnt. 
																								If someone from the non-reserved category scores 80 per cent in an exam, he still sits at home while someone with 40 per cent gets a job, he alleged. 
																								Tumhara naam kya hai (whats your name)? Sunil Shetty. Rehta kahan hai (where do you live)? Jhopadpatti (in a shanty). Karta kya hai (what do you do)? Rakhadpatti (wasting time). This is what the Congress is doing to capable young people, he said.
																								Also, the Bahujan Samaj Party cut into the votes from pro-reservation voters and nosed ahead of the Congress in almost a dozen seats in the state.
																								Sulaimanbhai added that Congress factionalism had reached the mohalla (neighbourhood) level, and Patel had failed to unite the state unit. Even party leaders in Ahmedabad admit the charge.
																								No big leader campaigned with any other senior because they saw one another as a threat, a Congress leader said.
																								One of those accused is Narhari Amin, the state election campaign chief, who lost from Matar to a young engineer whom the Congress had refused a ticket.
																								Bharatsinh Solanki, state party chief and son of former chief minister Madhavsinh Solanki, campaigned with central leaders but not his state colleagues.
																								Shankersinh Vaghela campaigned in only seven of the 182 constituencies, and is accused of concentrating more on securing nominations for his loyalists than on winning the polls.

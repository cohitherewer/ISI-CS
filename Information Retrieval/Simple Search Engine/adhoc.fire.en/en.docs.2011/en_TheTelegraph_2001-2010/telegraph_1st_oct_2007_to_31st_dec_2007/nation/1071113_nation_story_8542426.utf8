 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Salman Khan																								Mumbai, Nov. 12: Trouble-prone Salman Khan nearly landed in another spot  but this time for being a Good Samaritan.																								The actor, out on bail in a September 2002 hit-and-run case, stopped to help a lady friend who had rammed into a motorbike and was immediately taken to be the culprit by a night constable and people at the spot.																								Things could have got worse had police not arrived on time because the crowd began swelling with news of the stars presence.																								At first, the police thought Salman was in the Maruti Swift that Canadian model Brook Lindsay Clark was driving early yesterday. But they later confirmed that Salman was just passing by and had nothing to do with the accident at Worli junction in south Mumbai that left a constable injured.																								Sanjay Suryavanshi, who was admitted to hospital with a broken limb, was later discharged.																								This case has nothing to do with Salman Khan. He wasnt even in the car. He arrived in another car and had stopped when he saw his friend surrounded by a crowd, said an officer at Worli police station.																								The actor, the officer added, was asked to leave the spot fast as the crowd was swelling.																								Its, however, not clear if Clark, who had another friend with her, had called Salman for help.																								The 26-year-old model, who has an international driving licence, was charged with rash and negligent driving and later granted bail.																								Salmans lawyer Dipesh Mehta said neither the actor nor his car was involved in the accident. These are just rumours. He must have been travelling by the same road and stopped to help. Salman is known to always help whenever he sees an accident.																								In 2002, Salmans Toyota Land Cruiser ran over a pavement dweller in Bandra and injured four. The actors bodyguard, who died of tuberculosis last month, had told a court in March 2006 that Salman was behind the wheel and was under the influence of alcohol.																								The hit-and-run isnt the actors only brush with the law.																								The 41-year-old faces jail terms in two cases of poaching  one a black buck and the other a chinkara.

																								Mumbai, Nov. 25: Mayavati today promised reservation in private sector jobs if voted to power at the Centre, reports our special correspondent.																								The Uttar Pradesh chief minister made the announcement at a gathering of 1.5 lakh people that showcased her Bahujan Samaj Partys steadily rising star in Maharashtra.																								When we come to power at the Centre, you will not have to demand reservation. You will get it without asking for it, she said amid cheers at Shivaji Park in central Mumbais Shiv Sena stronghold.																								Mayavati stressed that the reservation would benefit not only the socially deprived but also the economically backward, pushing the Dalit-Brahmin unity line that has lifted her to power in her home state.

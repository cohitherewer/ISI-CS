				 Dad kills drunk son in shame
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Nov. 30: A business management student who frequently got into drunken brawls was beaten to death by his ashamed father who then killed himself.																								His drunken brawls seemed to be never-ending. Therefore, I have decided to kill him, and self, before he becomes a menace to society, said a seven-page suicide note by J. Ananthkrishna.																								The grocery store owner wrote the note minutes after killing Abhishek, 21, at their home with an iron rod on Wednesday night, police said. He then slashed his wrists and hanged himself.																								The note said Ananthkrishna had to face humiliation for having failed to properly bring up his son, who was studying for his Bachelor of Business Management degree at a city college.																								The police said that when Abhishek stumbled through the front door late on November 28 night, Ananthkrishna, who was awake, noticed that his son had cuts and bruises on his body and face. He realised that the young man had got into another drunken street brawl.																								Abhishek had got into a fight with a group of youths near his home. The night patrol had separated them and sent them on their way home.																								A furious Ananthkrishna asked Abhishek to follow him to the first floor while telling wife Parvathi to stay on the ground floor of the two-storey house.																								He plied an already drunk Abhishek with more liquor till he could drink no more. Ananthkrishna then beat the young man with an iron rod on his hands, face, chest and head.																								In his note, the store owner said that after Abhisheks mother, Meena, died of cancer several years ago, he had married Parvathi to help him bring a young Abhishek up.																								The bodies, discovered by Parvathi in the morning, were taken to Ananthkrishnas ancestral town, Chenrayapatna, 150km from Bangalore. There, they were buried beside that of Meena, as Ananthkrishna had wished.

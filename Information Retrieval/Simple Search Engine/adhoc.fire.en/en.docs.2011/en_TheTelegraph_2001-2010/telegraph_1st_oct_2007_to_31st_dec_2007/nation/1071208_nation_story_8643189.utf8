				 Satellite search for Posco land

 SUBRAT DAS 
																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 7: Orissa government has decided to take help of satellite pictures to demarcate land in Posco project site, after stiff resistance from the project-affected people.
																								Commerce and transport secretary Priyabrata Patnaik, who has been appointed by the state as the nodal officer to facilitate the project, said the demarcation work would start on the basis of satellite-based global positioning system. Contractors have been engaged to carry out the work, added the officer, while residents of respective localities have been awarded contracts. 
																								Of the total 4,005 acres identified for Posco, 3,568 acres are government land and the remaining (437 acres) belong to individuals. So far, physical possession has not been handed over to Posco. Patnaik said the physical possession would be given to the company after the demarcation is complete. 
																								The proposed site, spread over three gram panchayat of Dhinkia, Nuagaon and Gadakujang, had been out of bounds for the revenue administration, police and Posco officials as the anti-plant protestors have erected bamboo barricades on the entry points of the villages. But, recently the police took control of a part of the proposed area and the district and police administration initiated negotiations with the project-affected people yesterday at Ersama headquarters. Patnaik, who led the negotiation, described yesterdays meeting as a good beginning. He said the people were convinced of the benefits of the project. 
																								On the other hand, Abhay Sahu, the president of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, the body which has been spearheading the agitation against the 12MTPA mega steel project, described yesterdays negotiation as a futile exercise. Sahu added the people were determined not to spare an inch of their land to Posco. We will not allow demarcation to start. There will be militant resistance if the government and Posco try to evict us, he threatened. Nodal officer Patnaik, however, claimed the majority of the people were in support of the plant while around 200 people were opposing being instigated by Sahu, who is an outsider.
																								The demarcation would find out the extent and nature of encroachment, names of encroachers and number of agricultural labourers so that their entitlement for compensation can be worked out. Patnaik said there was no provision for compensation for encroachers in the R amp;R policy. However, Posco authorities have agreed to pay compensation to such families. 
																								Besides, the government has decided to issue identity cards to project-affected wage earners. They would be paid an allowance for interim period till they are engaged in the Posco plant work.

Andhra Pradesh native Syed Saleems body was flown back this morning and buried amid doubts whether he was a victim or a suspect after police found the electric wires on him.																								A top Rajasthan police officer, who accompanied the body, said Saleems background and the source of the wires were being probed while the desert states government withdrew the Rs 5-lakh compensation it had announced for the dead mans kin.																								Patil, who visited the Ajmer Sharif dargah this morning, said it was too premature to say much except that the investigations go beyond our borders.

We are with you in this time of sorrow, he said and promised all help to the victims.

The joy associated with the occasion is missing, said Zakir Bhai Husain Lobanwala, who owns a nearby shop.																								No business this Id, rued Munna Lalji, another shop-owner. But Khwaja sahebs blessings will work and everything will again look up.																								Additional director-general (crime) A.K. Jain said police were working on some links but were not ready to divulge details.																								We have several leads and are pursuing our probe, confirmed Ajmer inspector-general Nand Kishore. But the details are not to be given out at the moment.																								A Rajasthan police team has left for Hyderabad to probe reported similarities between explosive devices used for the attack on the dargah and those placed in the Andhra capitals blast-hit Mecca Masjid five months ago.																								There are some similarities and all these things are being investigated, Hyderabad police commissioner Balwinder Singh told reporters.																								City police said the SIM card found in the mobile used in the Ajmer blast has been traced to the same man and the same place  Bengal  where the SIM used to trigger the Hyderabad blasts was bought.																								The SIM card was allegedly bought by one Babulal Yadav with a fake driving licence, a police officer said.																								Police sources said apart from the wires, they had also found traces of explosive materials from Saleems pocket. 																								The sources said Saleems family had disowned him after he deserted his wife and children nine years ago and shifted base to Ajmer.

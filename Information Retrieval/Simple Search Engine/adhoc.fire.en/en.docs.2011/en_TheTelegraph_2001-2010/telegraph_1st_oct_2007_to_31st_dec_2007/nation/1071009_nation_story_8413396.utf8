 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Rattle off into the record books				 																																																										The capitals, currencies and the direct telephone dialling codes of Azerbaizan, Honduras, Lesotho and virtually any other country Mohammad Faisal can rattle them off in less than a second. 				 																																																										The 22-year-old electronics engineer is busy preparing for a test that he hopes will get his name into the Guinness World Records. 				 																																																										Faisal has memorised the capitals, currencies and telephone codes of 224 countries, and claims he delivers responses with a recollection time of 0.8 seconds. 				 																																																										Faisal, who studied at Aligarh Muslim University, is hoping to beat the record by Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury, who earned his place in the Guinness in July 2006.				 																Better insured than sorry				 																																																										The train lines may be Mumbais lifeline, but Uday Shetty knows they can turn into death tracks for him any day. 				 																																																										With 10 deaths a day on the tracks, the restaurateur is not taking any chances. So he has armed himself with a Rs 5-lakh railway insurance policy.				 																																																										His family will get Rs 5 lakh on his death or full disability, and Rs 1 lakh for partial disability.				 																																																										Pessimistic? No, prudent, argues Shetty. 				 																																																										He boards a local train from Ghatkopar to Dahisar every day. 				 																																																										Anything can happen to me while I commute. A train, which is supposed to carry around 1,700 commuters, carries 5,000. Trains which should be junked after 25 years ply till 35 years. Accident claims are contested and it takes five years to get compensation. If something happens to me, I dont think my family members would get anything from the railways, Shetty says.				 																																																										The restaurateurs policy with the Oriental Insurance Company, bought on September 20, means he pays Rs 225 as premium a year. 				 																																																										The insurance cover will apply to all railway accidents for a year.				 																Brakes on IT drive				 																																																										The Andhra Pradesh governments IT has run into a speed bump. 				 																																																										The high court has issued a notice to infotech companies like Wipro, Emmar Properties and Lanco to stop their construction activities on plots sold by the government after the state wakf board staked claim to them.				 																																																										The board has said the 1,600 acres given to the IT companies by the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation in Manikonda village in Ranga Reddy district, neighbouring Hyderabad, belong to it. 				 																																																										Following a petition by TRS legislator H.A. Rahman, the court has issued notices to the government and the IT companies. 				 																																																										District collector Praveen Prakash has rubbished the wakf board claim. A land survey has revealed that the wakf claim is bogus and that it never owned those plots, the collector has said in his report to the government. 				 																Rag guard

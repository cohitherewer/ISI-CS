				 Ban looms on Red FM for Idol joke
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 2: The Centre has decided to take Red FM off air for a week after a radio jockey allegedly made derogatory remarks about the Nepalese origins of Indian Idol 3 winner Prashant Tamang.																								But the ban will have to wait because the channel approached the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal yesterday, which stayed the implementation of any government decision till its next hearing on Thursday. 																								Issued a showcause notice on Saturday by the government, which gave it less than two days to explain its position, the channel had knocked on the tribunals doors for more time. 																								Red FM argued that under the grant of permission agreement, an opportunity is first required to be given to the licensee to rectify the violation, if any, for which 15 days are allowed. 																								No such opportunity was given to them, the channel said, adding that they got the notice on the night of September 29 and were told to respond by 4pm on October 1. 																								Tribunal chairperson Arun Kumar said the government was free to proceed with the notice and take whatever decision it feels proper or necessary in the facts and circumstances of the cases. However, the decision will not be implemented till the tribunals next date of hearing. 																								Radio jockey Nitins comments had offended the Gurkha community, which took out a protest march in Siliguri. Unfounded rumours of hooliganism by the marchers had caused street riots on Friday and the army had to be called in.																								The Union information and broadcasting ministry had stepped in after the Bengal government complained to the Centre about the unrest in Siliguri and elsewhere, which led to looting and arson that left many injured.																								Red FM had issued a public statement saying a section of people had misinterpreted the statement, but this failed to douse the fire.

				 Cops not above law: judge
 							 - Rizwanur echo in trial of officers in London, murder of schoolteachers wife in Kanpur AMIT ROY				 	 Jean Charles de Menezes																								London, Nov. 2: The police are not above the law, a British judge said in a landmark case that Calcutta police, who have dealt with events leading to the mysterious death of Rizwanur Rahman, would do well to study and digest.																								Since Indian law is still based on the British model, the trenchant observations by Justice Henriques on the contract between the police and the people in a modern society appear especially relevant in the context of the Rizwanur tragedy.																								At the Central Criminal Court in London, the judge was summing up what has been a British tragedy of equal proportions  the shooting dead of an innocent man, Jean Charles de Menezes. The 27-year-old Brazilian had been mistaken for Hussain Osman, a potential suicide bomber.																								Menezes was cornered by armed Scotland Yard officers at Stockwell underground station in south London on July 22, 2005, a day after an attempted bombing on Londons transport system and a fortnight after the bombings of July 7, 2005 (in which 52 people were killed and over 700 injured). He was pinned down and shot seven times in the head.																								Within hours of the shooting, Scotland Yard realised it had made a horrendous mistake.																								Human rights activists in London have identified certain parallels in the deaths of Menezes and Rizwanur, but the police in London have, at least, the excuse they thought their target was a suicide bomber and they were trying to protect the public from mass murder.																								Still, a group of Scotland Yard officers were up before the Old Bailey in London charged with contravening the Health and Safety at Work Act  meaning they allegedly failed in their duty of care towards a member of the public.																								Yesterday, London police were found guilty of putting the public at risk over the killing.																								On Monday, Justice Henriques had told the jury to put aside any feelings of sympathy either towards the family of Menezes or individual police officers. Calm and accurate analysis of the evidence and a verdict based on reason and logic is what is called for.																								He said that in deciding their verdict they should not be concerned with its effect on the future of policing but focus squarely on the events of July 22, 2005.																								You are not in any way concerned with the future or the effect of this prosecution, the judge said.																								He made it clear that policemen had to obey the law as much as anyone else  or face prosecution.																								To suggest that it is wrong to prosecute the police for an alleged offence under the Health and Safety at Work Act is to submit that the police are above the law. It applies to them as it applies to any other employer. They are accountable.																								He went on: Had the person getting on to the bus been Osman or an associate, there may well have been a repetition of [the July 7 bombing at] Tavistock Square on the bus. Had a bomber been allowed to enter Stockwell Tube and been confronted he would have had every opportunity of blowing the underground train and its passengers to pieces.																								The judge added: You must consider not only actual danger but potential danger. Police have the duty to keep the public safe not only from actual danger but from potential danger.																								However, had the case of Rizwanur occurred in England, Justice Henriques would have wanted to know whether the police had failed in their duty of care towards him  especially as he and his wife, Priyanka Todi, had written to the police asking for protection.

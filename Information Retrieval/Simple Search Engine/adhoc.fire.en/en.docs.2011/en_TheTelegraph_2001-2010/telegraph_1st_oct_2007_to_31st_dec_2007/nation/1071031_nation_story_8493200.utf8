				 Mahajan shocker
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 30: Praveen Mahajan today made a sensational claim in court about the personal life of his brother Pramod Mahajan on the murdered mans birthday.																								Judge Srihari Daware barred the media from publishing or broadcasting the statement. He emptied the courtroom before this particular sentence as well as the rest of what Praveen had to say were recorded.																								However, by the time the media stricture was issued at 4.15pm, several news channels had already flashed the statement.																								The claim, which the prosecution found scandalous and libellous, came during the post-lunch session. Praveen, who had yesterday denied shooting BJP leader Mahajan, stood up in the dock to describe what had transpired on the day of the murder: April 22, 2006.																								When I reached the 15th floor of Purna building at 7.30am, I found that Pramod was waiting for me in the passage. We both proceeded to the living room, Praveen said.																								The moment he said the next sentence, special public prosecutor Niteen Pradhan was on his feet. He said the statement defamed a dead man who could not defend himself.

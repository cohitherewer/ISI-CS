				 Moon marriage whispers float
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 24: Avinash Bhupen Patnaik, who shot dead Moon Dass mother and uncle, had apparently introduced the aspiring model from Calcutta as his wife to friends.																								I have seen them together at many events and corporate parties. They came together and he introduced her as his better half. She smiled, said a model who met them at a party.																								Patnaik drove 2,200km in his Honda Civic to meet Moon on Thursday. On five similar occasions earlier, many saw them partying together. Avinash introduced her as his wife on those visits.																								While Moon was apparently reluctant to reveal she was married for fear of affecting her chances as a model, Avinash was keen to show her off as his wife, his friends said. They said this led to discord in their relationship. 																								Avinash, who claimed he was the MD of Shidha Vinayak food products on a social networking site, grew possessive soon after their marriage, the model said.																								During his last few visits, he would get very upset over the revealing outfits Moon wore on stage. But he would keep giving her expensive gifts.																								The police said Avinash had begun threatening Moon on her cellphone over the past few months. He went to her Andheri flat on Thursday possibly to kill her for breaking up with him in August, but she was not in.																								We havent found any records of any complaint against Avinash from Moon, so there is no question of us investigating them. The parents of the couple had no clue about their relationship or their marriage, so thats not something we are investigating either, senior inspector Kiran Sonone of Oshiwara police station said.																								Anyway, since Avinash is dead, the motive behind the crime is not of any importance. What we are investigating is how he got hold of the revolver.																								Police said Moons father Manimohan Das was yet to reach Mumbai to claim his wifes body. But her brother had landed and was tending to her in a city hospital where she has been admitted in a state of shock.																								Moon has claimed in her statements to the police that Avinash was foul-tempered and often manhandled her.																								Since Avinash grew up in a small town, he was unable to blend in with Moons way of life. Differences cropped up between them and Moon was reluctant to continue with the relationship, said senior inspector Dilip Patil.																								Avinashs father, brother and uncle claimed his body from JJ Hospital today. In their statement to the police, the family said they had no knowledge of his affair with Moon.

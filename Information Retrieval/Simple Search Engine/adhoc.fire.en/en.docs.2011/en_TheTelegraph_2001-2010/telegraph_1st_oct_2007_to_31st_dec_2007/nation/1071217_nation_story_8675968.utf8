				 Priest quits over temple cut charge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
				 	 The sacred tree
																								Gaya, Dec. 16: The chief priest of Mahabodhi Temple, Bhadant Bodhipal, resigned from his post today. 
																								Bodhipals resignation comes in the wake of his recent indictment in an inquiry report submitted by Magadh division commissioner K.P. Rammaiah and Gaya chief judicial magistrate. 
																								The report clearly states that Bodhipal ordered one of the temple employees, Deepak Malakar, to cut a branch from the Maha Bodhi tree and bring it to his temple residential quarters. 
																								The chief priest submitted his resignation to Gaya district magistrate-cum-temple committee chairman Jitendra Srivastava. 
																								The priests move is an anticipated one, as in the wake of his legal troubles he was under pressure from many quarters to clear his name.
																								Bodhipals peers, too, built up pressure on the monk occupying the most revered post. Bhadant Prajyasheel, Bodhipals predecessors had demanded his arrest to prevent him from tampering evidence and a CBI inquiry to unmask the other players. 
																								The sworn affidavit filed by Deepak Malakar, a temple gardener, ultimately pinned Bodhipal down, as Malakar confessed to cutting the branch on July 10, 2006 after being ordered by the chief priest to cut and carry it to his quarters. 
																								Bodh Gaya-based activist and monk Arup Brahmachari alias Swamiji, a campaigner who had filed a criminal complaint case against temple officials and had relentlessly pursued the case, has been demanding an inquiry into the case, as well as effective plugging of temple coffers to stop embezzlement. 
																								In order to check embezzlements, the divisional commissioner, Rammaiah, has reportedly advised the temple management to study and implement techniques applied by other places of worship, particularly Tirupati Mandir, to prevent donation leaks.
																								In most cases Bodh Gaya temple receive donations in foreign currency, particularly US dollars. 
																								The Magadh division commissioner, in his inquiry report, also favoured a high-level inquiry and assessment of the personal wealth of the chief priest, former temple secretary and public relations officer in lieu of embezzlement charges. 
																								Bodhipal and the former temple secretary, Kalicharan Yadav, have applied for anticipatory bail in a complaint case (no. 850/2007) in which the temple officials have been accused of engineering the cut. 
																								Also, Bhajju Yadav, the public relations officer of the temple committee and one of the accused has been removed from his post.

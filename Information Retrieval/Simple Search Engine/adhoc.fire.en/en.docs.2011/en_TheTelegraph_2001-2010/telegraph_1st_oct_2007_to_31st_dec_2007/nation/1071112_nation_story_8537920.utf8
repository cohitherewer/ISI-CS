				 Torture cry in terror probe
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Nov. 11: Hyderabad blast suspects have been hung upside down through the night, hit on bare soles and fingernails, thrashed with bamboo canes and given electric shocks on genitals, a report forwarded by the state minorities commission has said.																								The report of a fact-finding committee submitted to the state government last month has echoes of torture tales from Guantanamo Bay, where the Americans hold their terror suspects.																								As many as 110 suspects have been picked up since the twin blasts of August 25, said L. Ravichander of the Civil Liberties Monitoring Committee of India, which conducted the probe and handed the report to the minorities commission. Most of them are being held in isolated rooms and tortured during interrogation, he added.																								My son Abdul Kareem, 24, was arrested on August 30 but produced before a magistrate only on September 8. He was severely beaten and tortured, said Abdul Basheeruddin, quoted in the report.																								The report has also attracted the attention of jurist and former minister Ram Jethmalani, who has offered to fight the case of the youths held in police custody for the past few months. 																								It is strange that Hyderabad police pick up a suspect first and collect evidence against him later, he said. 																								But officers of the polices special investigative team inquiring into the blasts insist that those arrested have terror links. Almost all of the 110 youths picked up by us were lured into terrorist activities for jihad or for cash, a senior SIT official said.																								Jobless youths are recruited by terror groups and taught to operate computers, make crude tiffin-box bombs, fire pistols, buy bomb-making material and transfer and receive large sums from abroad and distribute it, sources said. 																								Thirty of the 110 taken into custody for questioning had served as couriers, offered shelter and utilities to militants, stashed away explosives or were human bombs in the making, the sources added. The police are still gathering evidence against the rest, they said.																								How can the son of an autorickshaw driver or a peon in a government office afford a Pulsar motorcycle and a Nokia N-series mobile phone? an investigator asked. 																								Abdul Khadri, 22, a watch repairer in the Old City, is alleged to have given shelter to suspects of the May Mecca Masjid blast and provided them with SIM cards, the sources said. Khadri is one of the 110 in custody.																								Abdul Wasi, 23 and jobless, is identified as a recruit of Lashkar-e-Toiba agent Azam Ghori who planted a tiffin-box bomb at a hotel in 2000 and shot dead a jeweller the same year, they added. 																								We are advising parents of Muslim youths to keep a watch on their activities and lifestyle, a police officer said. 																								The commission report also mentions midnight arrests and raids on madarsas.

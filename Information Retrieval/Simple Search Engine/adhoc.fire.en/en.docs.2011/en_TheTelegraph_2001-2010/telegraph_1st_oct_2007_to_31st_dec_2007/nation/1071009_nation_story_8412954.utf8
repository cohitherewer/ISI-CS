				 Congress keeps an eye on calendar
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Sonia Gandhi: Damage control																								New Delhi, Oct. 8: The Congress went into a late-night huddle to consider all possible options to save the government and the deal  in that order of preference  after the Left rejected the peace formula. 																								The mood was reportedly grim as the Congress core committee met at the Prime Ministers residence.																								The party discussed the possibility of running a minority government by asking the Left to wait for some time before formally withdrawing support. None of the options had preference on account of heavy political baggage and bitter experience.																								But a section of the Congress insisted that no ground should be yielded and the government should press ahead with the deal, come what may.																								The core committee meeting ended with a faint hope of expecting some kind of miracle at tomorrows scheduled Left-Congress panel meet on the nuclear deal.																								A Congress leader said: Now we have marked all possible dates  October 18, October 30 and finally April 2008  on our calendar. October 18 is the likely date of the CPM politburo meeting and October 30 the central committee meeting. April 2008 could see the beginning of the snap poll, the leader explained.																								The pro-nuclear deal camp is pushing for an offensive but not all leaders of the Congress and its allies are keen on early polls.																								A section of UPA ministers and Congress MPs, who are reluctant to face snap polls, had pleaded with the leadership last night to issue a clarification on Sonia Gandhis comments in Haryana, sources said.																								Two other factors  her rapport with Left leaders like Jyoti Basu and her belief that she did not have the outside ally in mind when she dubbed opponents of the nuclear deal enemies of development and peace  also prompted Sonia to authorise a senior AICC functionary to launch the damage-control exercise, the sources added.																								The clarification was a rare occurrence as Sonia is not known to retract her words. A note from party spokesperson Satyavrat Chaturvedi said: The statement (Sonias) was only in the context of Haryana, its development and the power project. No inference whatsoever should be drawn, which will be quite extraneous in nature. 																								It is believed that the speech, prepared by an AICC member who had handled Haryana, was screened four times before Sonia finally articulated it in Haryana.																								According to Congress sources close to Sonia, it did not occur to the team that her criticism of the opponents of the nuclear deal would be blown out of proportion.																								Throughout Sunday, several Congress and Left leaders were on the phone trying to avoid a confrontation. A few UPA allies, too, sounded the Congress for a face-saving mechanism to avert mid-term polls. By Monday afternoon, these leaders had a word of appreciation for the CPM for avoiding a verbal duel. 																								Within the Congress, the bulk of Lok Sabha MPs and ministers feel that there is little point in taking a risk by opting for a snap poll now.																								The misgivings are compounded by the realisation that post-election, the Congress may have to do business with the same enemy of development and peace. 																								However, some Rajya Sabha MPs, who do not have to fight the elections, are said to be advocating confrontation.																								The UPA allies are a worried lot. Lalu Prasad hates the very idea of snap polls at a time his successor Nitish Kumar is doing well in Bihar. DMK chief M. Karunanidhi is unsure of repeating his 2004 performance when he trounced Jayalalithaa.																								NCP chief Sharad Pawar, too, is not keen on mid-term polls. But Pawar feels that his party might not fare too badly, given the disarray in the Shiv Sena and the BJP and factionalism in the Congress.

				 Proposal to scrap SEZs in Goa

																								Panaji, Dec. 30 (PTI): A task force headed by chief minister Digamber Kamat today recommended scrapping special economic zones in Goa, terming them detrimental to the overall interest of the state.
																								The intention of permitting SEZs is to reap the benefits of industrialisation and consequent employment generation. These can be served without SEZs (also) if incentives are extended to incoming industries, architect Charles Correa, the task force vice-chairman, said while reading out the bodys resolution.
																								The required industrial development can be achieved if the government focuses on providing excellent infrastructure in terms of roads, water and power to the incoming industrial units, he said.
																								The task force took into account growing anti-SEZ sentiments in Goa. However, it was silent on the Rajiv Gandhi Habitat Project, which has been opposed by local residents who allege that it is a real estate scam.

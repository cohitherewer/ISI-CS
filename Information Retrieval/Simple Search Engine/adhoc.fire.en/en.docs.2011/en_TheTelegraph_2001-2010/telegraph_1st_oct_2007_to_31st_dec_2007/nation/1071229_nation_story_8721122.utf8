				 Foes patch up before polls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Patna, Dec. 28: Though locked in a cold war for the past year, NDA convener George Fernandes and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar shared the dais to inaugurate 2,957 development projects worth Rs 1,000 crore in north Bihars Muzaffarpur today. 
																								George has often used harsh words against Nitish Kumar during his Bihar visits ever since Sharad Yadav replaced him as the JD(U) president last year. Today, however, the chief minister succeeded in showing the people that he and Fernandes were united on the development issue. 
																								The two seemed close as Nitish took Fernandes to Muzaffarpur in his helicopter and helped the party patriarch climb up the stairs to the dais. The two were also seen sharing pleasantries. George during his last visit early this month had specifically stated that there was no chance of a patch up with Nitish Kumar in this life. This time he refrained from speaking against the state government at the official meeting which took place at the Nehru stadium. RJD MLA and former minister Ramai Ram who was also present there was waved off by scores of Nitish fans who were gathered there. When our district was hit by the floods, the government did nothing to provide relief, he said. But, a section of people stood to question what his (Rams) partys role was in the past 15 years of regime. 
																								Tell us how many projects your government took up and completed in 15 years of rule? asked some voices in the crowd, which was also shouting Nitish Kumar jindabad. 
																								Boosted by the public support, Nitish Kumar reiterated his governments promise of tirelessly working to strengthen Bihars infrastructure. He asked for peoples co-operation in building roads, power projects, schools and health centres. 
																								Though its too premature to comment on whether by persuading George to join him in a meeting, Nitish has succeeded in patching up with the NDA convenor. But, the Bihar CM has clearly given the message that he respects George Fernandes and wishes to end the feud in the run up to the polls next year. Fernandes represents Muzaffapur in the Lok Sabha. He spoke, at length, on terrorism and the Centres failure in tackling the issue.

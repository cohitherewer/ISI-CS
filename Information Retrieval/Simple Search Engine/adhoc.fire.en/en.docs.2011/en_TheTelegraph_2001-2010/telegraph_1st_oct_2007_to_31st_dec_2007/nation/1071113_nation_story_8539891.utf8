 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jaipur, Nov. 12: The Rajasthan governments decision to withdraw 42 cases out of 381 lodged against Gujjars for inciting violence seems to have had a calming effect on the protesting community.																								They have decided to stage a peaceful protest.																								We have not called off the agitation as our main demand of sending a letter recommending ST status to the Centre is still pending. But yes, as the government has conceded to many of our other demands, we plan to take the stir ahead peacefully without resorting to any unlawful means till December 15 when the Chopra panel report is tabled, said Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla, who is spearheading the movement.																								The decision came after government representatives and Bainsla met in Jaipur for the third round of talks on Friday.																								The cases withdrawn include 32 lodged between May 29 and June 4 when the agitation had reached its peak, claiming 26 lives. 																								As many as 296 protesters have got relief, paving the way for a peaceful solution to the long-standing crisis.

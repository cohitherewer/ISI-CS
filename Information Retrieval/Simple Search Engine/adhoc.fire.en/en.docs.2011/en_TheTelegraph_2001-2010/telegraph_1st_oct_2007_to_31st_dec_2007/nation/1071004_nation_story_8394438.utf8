				 Mittal metal in 9/11 Freedom Tower
										 AMIT ROY 			 			 SIGNED IN STEEL 		(Top)The site of the Freedom Tower and (below) an ArcelorMittal beam being sunk in																								New York, Oct. 3: Assuming Mother India can lay some claim to Lakshmi Mittal (who continues to travel on an Indian passport), it can be confirmed that an important bit of the new Freedom Tower that will rise Phoenix-like from the site of the destroyed World Trade Center will be forever Indian. 																								For, as the pace of construction work quickens at Ground Zero, Mittal has expressed pride that his company, ArcelorMittal, has been chosen to supply the resilient and extra-long steel beams that will form the backbone of the Freedom Tower. 																								A recent profile of Mittal in the Telegraph Magazine in the UK had noted: From paper clips to suspension bridge cables, ship building to car bodies, oil and gas pipes, Mittals steel is everywhere. Seventy per cent of American steel bumpers are made by his colossus of a company.																								The article also revealed that Mittal is providing the 100,000 tonnes of massive beams known as jumbos going into the foundations of the Freedom Tower that is being built on the site of the World Trade Center in New York. I am very happy and proud that we were chosen to supply that, he says. 																								The symbolism of this choice will probably dismay the old Left in India as it is left behind by the pace of accelerating change in the nature of the relationship between the US and India. 																								By and by, New York may become a city that is as Indian as it is Jewish or Hispanic today  the Big Apple may come to be known as the Big Mango. 																								To be fair, ArcelorMittal is not an Indian company and the specially-made beams being used in the construction of the Freedom Tower come from its Differdange mill in Luxembourg.																								However, Mittal, its driving force, is still the floppy-haired ex-St Xaviers boy from Calcutta who is happiest eating Indian food and rubbing shoulders with the glamorous folk from Bollywood.																								What happened on 9/11 will forever be seared into the consciousness of all Americans and New Yorkers, particularly, but the memorabilia and sentimental photographs of that horrendous day have been removed from Ground Zero, which has now become a busy construction site. America and New York have moved on but clearly the Left in India has not. 			MittalThe 1,776ft Freedom Tower, which has been designed by David Childs and is due to be completed in 2011, will include 2.6 million square feet of office space, tenant amenity spaces, an observation deck, restaurants, and broadcast and antennae facilities. 																								In December last year, the first of the Mittal columns was sunk on site in the presence of the states governor, George E. Pataki, New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, port authority officials and other dignitaries. 																								The steel symbolises our resilience and resolve to rebuild the World Trade Center, declared Bloomberg, who is also the WTC Memorial Foundation chairman. 																								There has been an elaborate operation to manufacture the columns in Luxembourg, transport them across the Atlantic by ship, fabricate them at a plant in Lynchburg, Virginia, where they were bolted and welded to make them longer and stronger, and then transfer them to the site. 																								In July, 805 tonnes of steel were produced in Luxembourg to create the first 27 extra-large steel columns required for the Freedom Tower. The columns weighed 730 pounds per foot and ranged in length from 30 feet to 56 feet for shipping.																								In America, the imported steel was turned into built-up columns by welding plates to their sides, thereby forming columns that weighed up to 2,440 pounds per foot. 																								When one American, Phil Jadlowiec, told Mittal that you purchased steel companies in the USA, are they not good enough to produce the steel needed for the Freedom Tower?, his company was quick to respond  the architects and the city of New York decided to purchase these beams, not Mr Mittal or ArcelorMittal; we are simply the providers. 																								Another comment on behalf of the company was: As ArcelorMittal does not (as yet) own any beam mills here in the US, the next best thing was to supply these beams from our Differdange mill in Luxembourg. We are the main supplier of jumbo beams for the US market and these were produced in our exclusive ASTM A913/grade 65 quality that helps to reduce weight and cost while adding strength. The engineer, building owner and construction manager are all convinced about the benefits of our grade 65 beams and plan to use it extensively in the Freedom Tower and the other surrounding hi-rise projects. 																								A spokesperson, himself an American, added: A comment to the person who felt hurt about these columns not being made in the US or Canada. We just dont have the mills here to handle such a Tall Order. Isnt this a good way for the world to be involved in righting a huge wrong, and paying tribute to those who lost their lives at the WTC? I think it is.

				 Sleuths question Todis brother
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 22: CBI officers probing Rizwanur Rahmans death today swivelled the spotlight on the Todis, calling Pradip Todi for questioning.																								Ashok Todis brother turned up at the CBI office in Salt Lake around 12.45pm and left after one-and-a-half hours. I have nothing to say, he told reporters while leaving the building. 																								According to CBI sources, the agency might call him again. If required, we may interview some women members of the family, including Priyankas aunt and mother, a source added. 																								The agency also questioned Rizwanurs radio jockey friend Rehan Waris. CBI officials visited the Ultadanga home of Rizwanurs ex-girlfriend and the Arena Multimedia centre on Chowringhee Road, where he used to work. 																								Three CBI teams criss-crossed Calcutta, gathering information about the death of the computer graphics teacher and questioning a cross-section of people.																								Arun Kumar, the CBI joint director heading the probe, said the central agency was following a course different from that of the CID. We are not going on the lines of the CID and we are examining everything afresh, Kumar said.																								Weve divided ourselves to examine different persons. We are video-graphing and taking photographs. A team also visited the spot where Rizwanurs body was found, the officer added. 																								While the strength of the CBI team has grown from seven to 24 in three days, forensic experts have already left for Delhi with the post-mortem report that was handed over by the CID.																								 It is too early to say if we are satisfied with the report. Doctors at AIIMS will examine it, Kumar said. His team, he added, is not rushing into any conclusion and is examining all aspects.																								Although the state CID has refused to share Rizwanurs call details, state home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray promised the CBI full cooperation. We are here to assist the central agency by providing all important documents relating to the Rizwanur case, Ray said.

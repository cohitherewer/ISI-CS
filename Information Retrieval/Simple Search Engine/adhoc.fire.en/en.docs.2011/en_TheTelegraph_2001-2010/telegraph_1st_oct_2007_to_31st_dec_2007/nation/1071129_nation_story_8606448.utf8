				 Wheat scam notice to Pawar
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pawar																								Mumbai, Nov. 28: Bombay High Court today issued notices to Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, the Maharashtra food and civil supplies minister, the Food Corporation of India and the CBI on a petition in the wheat import scam.																								Justices J.N. Patel and Nishidha Mhatre asked them and seven other respondents to reply within two weeks.																								The petition, filed by three BJP leaders led by former MP Kirit Somaiya, demands that the sale and distribution of defective imported red wheat through the public distribution system be stopped immediately. 																								It also questions the Centres decision to import wheat and asks for a directive to the Union government to submit details of procurement of the crop from different states and the exact process of importing it. 																								The CBI was made a respondent because the petition questioned the agencys move to abruptly end its investigation into the alleged role of the Australian Wheat Board in the scam.																								The counsel for the state government said the Maharashtra government had withdrawn red wheat from the public distribution system after tests on samples from government godowns revealed that they were defective.

				 Rehab push for sex workers
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 																								New Delhi, Nov. 22: India is set to launch its first comprehensive nationwide scheme for rescuing and rehabilitating sex workers, long identified as among the most vulnerable sections of society and a high-risk group for HIV transmission.																								The women and child development ministry is likely to announce the scheme  for which Rs 10 crore has been budgeted in the first year  in the next two weeks, senior officials said.																								The scheme is now waiting for an appropriate name from minister of state Renuka Chowdhury.																								From rescue and shelter to medical and legal help, counselling, vocational training and even assistance in finding jobs, the scheme aims to cover all aspects of rehabilitation.																								It also aims to help repatriate victims of cross-border trafficking, especially those from Bangladesh. The foreign ministry has cleared the scheme.																								According to health ministry figures, the HIV infection rate among sex workers is 8.4 per cent, nine times the rate among the rest of the population. 																								A study commissioned by the Centre in late 2006 put the number of sex workers in the country at over 3 million.																								The scheme has been prepared silently for fear of any opposition. This is one scheme we are very determined to push through, a senior official said. 																								The ministrys apprehension stems from roadblocks it has faced in its attempts to introduce a slew of legislation and amendments to existing laws. Most of the opposition has come from the law ministry. 																								Non-government organisations will be the implementing agencies under the scheme. 																								NGOs that have the experience, expertise and the infrastructure to tackle the various aspects of rescue and rehabilitation will be given grants for the implementation of the scheme, an official said. 																								State governments will need to validate the credentials of the NGOs seeking grants. The ministry will hand out a maximum annual grant of around Rs 22 lakh to NGOs under the scheme.																								The grant will include rental costs for a shelter that the NGO will need to hire to house the rescued women. The women will also have access to lawyers. 																								Once a woman takes to sex work, very often her family disowns her. The lawyers will help her fight for her property rights. There can be cases of discrimination once the woman starts working elsewhere. Lawyers will help in such situations, an official said. 																								After initial counselling, if a rescued woman wants to return home, the NGO concerned must help her in regaining acceptance from her family and the neighbouring society.																								The NGOs seeking grants will need to tie up with local small-scale industry units and training institutes to help the women learn skills and find jobs.

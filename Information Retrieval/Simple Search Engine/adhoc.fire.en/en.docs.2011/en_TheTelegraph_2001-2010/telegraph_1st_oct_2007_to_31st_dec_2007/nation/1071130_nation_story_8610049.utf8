 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 File picture of a fashion show																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: A fashion show is entertainment, not education, the Supreme Court has ruled.																								The court yesterday upheld the Gorakhpur district magistrates decision to slap entertainment tax on an organiser of the Mr amp; Ms Gorakhpur show held on July 9, 2000.																								Amit Kumar, the organiser, had argued that the show held at St Andrews Inter College was meant to educate students and was therefore exempt from entertainment tax under Section 11(3) of the Uttar Pradesh Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, 1979.																								It is difficult to believe that a fashion show was held with the object of educating prospective students who would be interested in joining the Institute of Art, Fashion Designing and Modelling the Supreme Court said in its judgment made available today. 																								The advertisement indicates the object of the show was to invite people to watch the new world of glamour and modelling and to see the world of exotic fashion in Gorakhpur itself, it observed. 																								The district magistrate had slapped an entertainment tax of Rs 43,270 on Kumar and a penalty of Rs 20,000 on Cambridge Intertia Group, under whose banner the fashion show was organised. The reason for the penalty was not clear.																								The magistrate had observed that Kumar had collected Rs 162,500 from spectators and another Rs 25,000 from five other organisers. 																								He rejected Kumars contention that he was only the choreographer, the show was competitive and that it was not for entertainment. 																								Kumar had claimed no entry fee was charged. It was a charity show with the specific purpose of publicising the proposed establishment of the Institute of Art, Fashion Designing and Modelling at Gorakhpur, he said.																								But the high court dismissed his appeal, saying a fashion show was meant to entertain. A fashion show could not be said to be in aid of education and was only meant to entertain the public, it said.																								The Supreme Court upheld the high courts ruling.

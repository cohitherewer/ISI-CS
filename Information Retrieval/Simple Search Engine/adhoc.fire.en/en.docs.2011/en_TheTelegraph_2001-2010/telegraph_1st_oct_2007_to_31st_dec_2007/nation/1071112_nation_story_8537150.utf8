				 Karnataka deputy CM suspense
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Nov. 11: Karnataka was kept guessing about its deputy chief minister on the eve of BJP leader B.S. Yeddyurappas swearing-in as chief minister on Monday.																								Behind the suspense was an apparent sibling spat between H.D. Kumaraswamy and H.D. Revanna, sons of Janata Dal (Secular) chief H.D. Deve Gowda. 																								A party source said Gowda preferred elder son Revanna for the post, though Kumaraswamy was elected leader by the partys legislators. 																								Gowda was rooting for Revanna to check younger son and ex-chief minister Kumaraswamy who, in his fathers words, has been quite wayward, the source said.																								Gowda was believed to be unhappy, for instance, with the revival of the alliance between the Dal(S) and the BJP, and had favoured dissolution of the Assembly.																								Earlier in the day, Kumaraswamy said the deputy CM would be named after a meeting between Dal(S) Karnataka chief Merajuddin Patel, Gowda and other senior leaders. But till late this evening, there seemed no consensus.																								By contrast, the BJP was gung-ho at the prospect of leading the government, its first shot at power in the south.																								Yeddyurappa will be sworn in by governor Rameshwar Thakur at noon on the steps of the Vidhana Soudha, home to the Assembly and key government offices.																								The BJP has sent general secretary Venkaiah Naidu to coordinate the event. Nearly 70,000 cadres were expected converge at the venue from all parts of the state. 																								The movement of vehicles on roads near the Vidhana Soudha has been banned for several hours tomorrow as part of the elaborate security drill. Commuters have been warned of traffic problems. Office-goers can expect a manic Monday, a police officer said. 																								Religious and superstitious, Yeddyurappa recently changed the way he spells his name  from Yediyurappa to Yeddyurappa  on the advice of astrologers who told that the variation would bring him luck.																								The 64-year-old is an MLA from Shakaripura constituency in Shimoga district. He was born in Mandya district but his family moved soon after to Shakaripura, where the he was first elected a municipal councillor. Yeddyurappas growth as a leader has coincided with the expansion in the partys base in Karnataka.																								But Yeddyurappas job was unlikely to be easy. His immediate concern would be to steer the coalition under the gaze of Gowda. The Dal (S) chief has already sent the BJP a 12-point that gives the saffron party little room for manoeuvre.																								Our aim will be to provide good governance by adhering to the common minimum programme of the Karnataka Development Front (as the Dal(S)-BJP alliance is called). The stress will be on infrastructure and development, Yeddyurappa told reporters this evening.																								Eighteen ministers from the Dal(S), including the deputy CM, and 17 ministers from the BJP were expected to be sworn in after Yeddyurappa passes the floor test. Hectic lobbying is on for the ministerial berths.

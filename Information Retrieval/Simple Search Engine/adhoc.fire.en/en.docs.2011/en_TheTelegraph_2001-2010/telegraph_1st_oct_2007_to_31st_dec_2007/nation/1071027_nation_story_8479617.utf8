				 Crores to get Raj art home
 							 - Mumbai dealer buys Ravi Varma work for 12 times reserve price AMIT ROY 				 	 The Ravi Varma painting auctioned at Bonhams in London																								London, Oct. 26: An Indian art collector from Mumbai has paid over 600,000 (Rs 4.8 crore)  12 times the reserve price  to buy a painting of the Raj executed in 1880 by Raja Ravi Varma and secure its return to India. 																								Bonhams had estimated that the 106cmx146 cm painting, depicting a meeting between British and Indian aristocrats, would fetch 50,000, certainly no more than 70,000. 																								It was bought yesterday by Neville Tuli of Osians Connoisseurs of Art, one of the foremost art dealers in Mumbai, who said his bid was significant as it was very important to bring back to India part of its artistic cultural heritage. 																								The sum fetched triples the artists own record, whose previous top price at another London auction house was 210,000. 																								The painting depicts the Maharajah of Travancore and his younger brother welcoming Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, governor general of Madras, on his official visit to Trivandrum in 1880. 																								Julian Roup, head of press and marketing at Bonhams, said: The picture is interesting because, not only is it a meeting of British and English aristocrats at the height of British Indian rule, but the painter himself was also an aristocrat, commented Roup. 																								He pointed out: It is very hard to estimate the value of something of this nature as they dont come to the market very often. However, this auction was a great success, attracting around 150 bidders. 																								Varma (1848-1906) was often invited to state occasions by British high officials and the Indian nobility and frequently recorded their activities on his canvases. 																								Explaining the works significance, Matthew Thomas of Bonhams Islamic and Indian department pointed out: This painting provides us with an almost intimate snapshot of the official contact between the British and the Indian princes. Since the end of the last war, if not before, it has perhaps been orthodox to deride Varmas work as rather kitsch and unaccomplished, both as a result of nationalist, anti-colonial feeling, and the opinions of Indian modernist painters, whose style and artistic intentions were naturally very different. But as in the case of British Victorian painters, the subject matter and its handling can often blind us to their enormous technical facility. 																								The record price of the painting reflects the growing strength of the work of Indian artists in general. This weeks Indian and Islamic Art Sale at Bonhams made a total of 3.2 million from 600 items.

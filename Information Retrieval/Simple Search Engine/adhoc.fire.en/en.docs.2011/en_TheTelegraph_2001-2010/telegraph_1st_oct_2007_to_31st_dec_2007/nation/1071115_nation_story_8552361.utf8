				 Tusker tramples vet on break-up mission 
 ANIL BUDUR LULLA				 	 Vishwanath being felicitated at a programme to mark Wildlife Week. (Telegraph file picture)																								Bangalore, Nov. 14: A vet who volunteered to separate two tame cow elephants from a wild herd was left paralysed after a tusker, furious at human intrusion, chased and trampled him in a national park last week.																								Neurosurgeons treating G.K. Vishwanath said the 56-year-old, whose spinal cord was broken in two places, has lost all sensation below his chest and could be wheelchair-bound for the rest of his life.																								Its very difficult for such patients to get back to normal. His spinal cord has been severely injured, Dr Satish S., a senior consultant, told The Telegraph.																								Doctors said Vishwanath may have been left a quadriplegic and may not regain full control of his arms and legs.																								Vishwanath, felicitated last month by the Karnataka governor for his efforts to conserve wildlife, had volunteered to lead a team of forest officials to separate Gayathri and Lilly from the wild herd on Saturday at Bannerghatta National Park when the tusker charged at them.																								While the others scampered to safety, he tripped and fell into a pit. In an instant, the tusker was upon him.																								After the huge beast had disappeared into the forest, Vishwanaths colleagues rushed him to hospital, where doctors operated on his fractured spine. He is conscious and responds to commands. His vital parameters are stable, but there is no sensation below the chest and such a condition cannot be repaired, Dr Satish said.																								Doctors said Vishwanath already had a weakened spine as he had undergone surgery for cervical spondylitis 15 years ago.																								Earlier this year, in August, a wild tusker had raided a circus in Bengal and eloped with a trained cow. It took forest officials nearly a week to cajole her back.																								At Bannerghatta, on Bangalores outskirts, park officials have been letting tame elephants loose in the adjoining forests to graze. They normally come back, except when the males are in mast, said a park official, referring to the period when tuskers are sexually active.																								Tuskers dont like intrusions when they are in the company of females. That is probably why they attacked our team, the official added.

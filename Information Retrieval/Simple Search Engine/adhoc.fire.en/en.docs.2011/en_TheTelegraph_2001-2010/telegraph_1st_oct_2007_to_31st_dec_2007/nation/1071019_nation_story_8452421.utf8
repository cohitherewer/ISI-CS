				 An admission amp; a reunion
				 - Saif happy with Kareena, John rubbishes split rumour
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta/Mumbai, Oct. 18: Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan are together and happy, and the confirmation has come from the Chhote Nawab himself.																								The air had been buzzing with rumours since they bonded over yoga sessions during the shoot of Yash Raj Filmss Tashan, got cosy at a Mumbai hotel swimming pool and partied hard at a Delhi night club.																								Last evening, at Manish Malhotras Lakme Fashion Week grand finale in Mumbai, Saif admitted he and Kareena were together.																								We are here together, yeah and thats about it and that is what I am comfortable with. We are exactly not shouting from the rooftops but I mean  yes clearly, we are together and we are happy, the actor told a questioner.																								Rewind to another fashion week finale, in September 2006, when Kareena shared the ramp with her boyfriend of four years, Shahid Kapur. The common factor: designer Manish Malhotra.																								At the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week grand finale in Delhi, the couple made the perfect picture of togetherness as they walked the ramp with Urmila Matondkar.																								The designer, however, feels Saif and Kareena make a gorgeous couple.																								Kareena is very beautiful, not just physically but also as a person shes full of fun and vitality. Saif is a great actor and a very classy person. The two make a gorgeous couple and are looking great together. I am always by Kareenas side in whatever she does because shes a very close friend, Manish told The Telegraph.																								But Saif and Kareena were not the only star couple raising a storm at this years Lakme Fashion Week. John Abraham and Bipasha Basu  who had reportedly split a few months ago, prompting popular brands to take off campaigns featuring them together  also used the event to tell the world they were very much together.Only because I was away from Mumbai for a long time shooting for two movies (Vivek Agnihotris Goal and Nagesh Kukunoors Aashayein), all these rumours started, John said.																								Designer Narendra Kumar Ahmed got Bipasha to finish his womens wear show on Monday. As Bips sashayed down the ramp in a long yellow gown, John clapped happily from the front row, looking dashing in an all-white suit.																								The roles were reversed on Wednesday evening. John modelled several outfits throughout the show, while Bips, in an ink-blue short dress, joined the wildly cheering crowd.

(Fotocorp)Labelling their relationship very stable, Ahmed told this newspaper: Superstars and real people sound paradoxical, but John and Bipasha are actually very level-headed people who share realistic goals and aims in life. Their relationship is a very mature one.																								Saif had been rumoured to be the thorn in the John-Bips relationship. But it turns out he and Bipasha were just friendly co-stars who worked together in Abbas Mustans Race.																								Saif has been going out with Kareena for sometime now and they would often book the preview theatre at Yash Raj Studios to watch new releases together, away from the public glare, a source said.																								The latest is that Saif, who was till recently living with his former Italian girlfriend Rosa, plans to move into a flat close to Kareenas new apartment in Khar.																								Box office-wise, this comes at a bad time. The Kareena-Shahid love story, Jab We Met, releases on October 26. It could do with a change of title to Jab We Split.

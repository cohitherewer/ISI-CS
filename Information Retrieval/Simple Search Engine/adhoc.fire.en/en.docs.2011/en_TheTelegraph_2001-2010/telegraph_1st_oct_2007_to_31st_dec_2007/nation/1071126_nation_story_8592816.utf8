				 Fortress Assam braces for backlash
				 - Tight security for bandh
 OUR BUREAU				 	 A boy injured in Saturdays attack. (Eastern Projections)																								Nov. 25: Assam is bracing for a fiery Adivasi backlash to the mob attack that left a trail of bloodied faces, broken bones and bruised sentiments along a three-km stretch of road leading to the capital complex in Dispur this weekend. 																								Accused of doing little to prevent the arson by Adivasi activists demanding Scheduled Tribe status and the retaliatory action by residents whose property was damaged, the state government today deployed security personnel in all Adivasi-dominated areas.																								Official sources said security personnel  both police and central forces  had been deployed in adequate numbers at all vulnerable spots and the army asked to stand by.																								The All Adivasi Students Association of Assam, which was behind the rally, called a 36-hour statewide bandh from 5am tomorrow. We will not spare anybody defying the bandh, it said. 																								Members of the association chased away Congress workers who assembled at Nandanban tea estate in Dibrugarh for a meeting on the panchayat polls. 																								The Assam Tea Tribes Students Association, too, warned the government of repercussions. 																								The organisation said it was finding it difficult to restrain members of the community  most of the tea tribes are of Adivasi origin  from avenging the mob attack on the rallyists. It declared Wednesday a black day to protest the incident.																								Its general secretary, Pallab Lochan Das, said the government would be responsible for untoward incidents in the 800-odd tea estates dominated by Adivasi labourers. We have appealed to all our district units to restrain the community members. 																								Das is camping at a Guwahati hospital with some colleagues to monitor treatment of the injured.																								Tea companies asked labour unions to maintain peace. We have asked labour leaders not to allow the workers to join the picketers, lest they go on the rampage tomorrow, the manager of a tea estate in Tinsukia said.																								The government said only one person died in the violence, but Adivasi organisations said many of those who were targeted by the mob in Beltola were still missing and some of them could be dead.

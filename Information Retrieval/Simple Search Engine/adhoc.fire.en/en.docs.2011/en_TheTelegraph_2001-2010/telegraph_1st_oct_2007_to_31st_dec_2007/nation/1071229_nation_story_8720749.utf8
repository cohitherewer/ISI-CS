				 Cloud over nuns death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Gaya, Dec. 28: Mystery shrouds the death of James Lamo (84), a Bhutanese nun, as rumours of foul play continued to do rounds in Bodh Gaya. 
																								The nun died on Thursday evening. 
																								Some people are denying the suicide angle, as they say that circumstantial evidence do not lend credence to the immolation-cum-suicide theory, as inflammable articles and agents of fire were missing from the mishap site.
																								What has also made some people more suspicious is the fact that the woman did not cry out even once, while she was on fire. 
																								According to a medical expert, the possibility of the nun being drugged and subsequently torched cannot be ruled out. 
																								The police, however, suspect the case to be a suicide and are waiting for the autopsy report. According to Bodh Gaya deputy superintendent of police, Rajvansh Singh, there are no evidence of any foul play. 
																								Singh added that though some people ran towards her and tried to douse the flames, she suffered a 100 per cent burn and died almost instantly. 
																								Bodh Gaya monk Arup Swami, while talking to The Telegraph, stressed that the woman chose Bodh Gaya for her end as it represents freedom from the earthly chains and is the holiest place for a Buddhist.
																								The victims relatives have been contacted in Bhutan. 
																								They are likely to come to Bodh Gaya to take charge of the remains of James Lamo.

				 Sarangi backs tamper theory
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sarangi arrives at court on Thursday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Nov. 22: Praveen Mahajans wife Sarangi today told a court the threatening SMS her husband allegedly sent to Pramod Mahajan was actually sent by her, and that its text had been tampered with.																								Testifying as a defence witness, Sarangi said Praveen had spoken to Pramod, his elder brother and a senior BJP leader, on April 13 last year. A day later, Praveen had told her to send Pramod an SMS seeking an appointment for himself.																								Sarangi said she sent the message around 4.30pm on April 15. Pramod was shot dead, allegedly by Praveen, on April 22, 2006.																								My message read, Maine telephone se baat ki thi main aapko bata raha hoon kab milne ka hai woh batana (I had spoken to you over the phone I am reminding you tell me when we can meet).																								She said that at the end of the message she wrote: Praveen Venkatesh Mahajan.																								Sarangi, who has been present at almost every hearing to support her husband, claimed the original text had been doctored.																								The prosecution says that the same day and at the same time, Praveen had sent Pramod an SMS using Hindi words that translate roughly as: No more prayers or requests; now there will be war. There will either be victory or death.																								The first mention of the threat SMS came from BJP leader Gopinath Munde, Pramods brother-in-law, on April 17, 2007  almost a year after the shooting  when he deposed as a prosecution witness.																								Sarangi said she had read about it in the newspapers but didnt discuss it with Praveen or his lawyers at the time. The court asked police to probe Sarangis claim and file an additional chargesheet.																								The defence had got a software engineer to show the additional sessions judge last week how an SMS could be tampered with. The prosecution today demanded forensic tests to check if the handset was doctored.																								The prosecution also wants to call state BJP treasurer and former Pramod aide Pratapbhai Ashar as a witness to refute Sarangi.																								Ashar had told the police he heard Pramod refuse an appointment to Praveen over the phone in the first week of April last year. Therefore, the prosecution argues, there was no question of Sarangi sending an SMS to seek such an appointment. 																								Hearing has been adjourned till November 28.

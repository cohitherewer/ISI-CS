				 Shut up or leave, says third front
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Vijayawada, Nov. 24: Farooq Abdullah was fuming at Taslima Nasreen.																								She should either shut up or go elsewhere (out of the country), the National Conference president thundered today in the state where the Bangladeshi writer was pelted with books, bags and bouquets at a programme three months ago.																								Farooq was in Vijayawada after 23 years to attend a farmers rally organised by the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA), which sees the Muslim vote bank as crucial.																								The UNPA today expressed concern at the alleged rise in anti-Muslim sentiments in Bengal over the Taslima controversy, and resolved she either keep quiet or quit the country.																								If she wants to continue attacking Islam, she had better go somewhere else, Farooq said, without citing any instances of her continuing to attack Islam while in India.																								Asked if the alliance was yielding to fundamentalists, Farooq said: I do not want the communal harmony of India to be disturbed (by) the antics of a foreigner.																								He added that he had every right to protest: I am not a maulvi but I am a Muslim.																								Such a stand may go down well in a state where the author was attacked at a book release in Hyderabad on August 10 by a gang led by three MLAs of a political outfit, Majlis-e-Itahadul-Musalmeen. The next day, the party threatened to kill her if she set foot in the city again but the police registered a case against Taslima.

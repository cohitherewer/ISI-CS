				 Cadres halt CRPF march
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta/Nandigram, Nov. 11: Five companies  about 400 personnel  of the Central Reserve Police Force reached Tamluk tonight. 																								A group of 16, bound for Nandigram police station to see the arrangements, was stopped midway by CPM supporters. 																								The cadres fled when the jawans jumped out of the truck and chased them. But at Reyapara, the partys women supporters formed a human shield and forced the truck to stop. The CRPF vehicle turned back and headed for Chandipur. 																								Inspector-general of police (law and order) Raj Kanojia said the CRPF personnel had come from Jharkhand. They reached Howrah station by Coalfield Express in the morning. By afternoon, they had left for Nandigram in four trucks.																								The CRPF officers held a meeting with some senior police officers in the district and chalked out their plans. The contingent will start moving into Nandigram from 4am tomorrow, a police officer said.																								The Centre had announced yesterday that it would send about 1,000 CRPF personnel for Nandigram, following a request from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and a stinging report on the violence by the governor.																								The CPM had seconded the decision to send the central force to restore peace in the war zone.																								Mamata Banerjee had opposed CRPF deployment under the state governments supervision. The CRPF or any other central force deployed in Nandigram should not be controlled by the state as they will not be able to function impartially. They should act under orders from the Centre, Mamata said.																								Officials said law and order was a state subject and the central forces in Nandigram have to take orders from the state government. 																								In Tamluk, the paramilitary personnel were housed at Kelomal Basic Training College. Some of the personnel also stayed the night at the Chandipur BEd College.

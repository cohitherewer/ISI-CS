				 Court sticks lawless label
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 A BUPC supporters padlocked house in Nandigram 																								Calcutta, Nov. 13: Calcutta High Court today observed that the rule of law had deserted Nandigram and asked the government to provide security to the media and visiting teams of social workers and lawyers.																								On the basis of the documents placed before us, we primarily hold that the rule of law is not prevailing in Nandigram, a two-judge vacation bench said.																								The court, however, turned down the petitioners demands for a CBI probe and army deployment.																								To a question from the bench, state government counsel Bikash Patranavis admitted that in Nandigram, peoples fundamental rights had been infringed on.																								The judges asked the state government to do everything possible to save lives and property in Nandigram, and take care of its peoples medical needs.																								Justice Girish Chandra Gupta and Justice Tapan Kumar Mukherjee made it the responsibility of the state home department and the East Midnapore police chief to provide for visitors security.																								At this stage, the court cannot ask the CBI to conduct a probe. Such an order can be passed after hearing both the petitioner and the respondents in detail, the bench said. The question of army deployment does not arise. The court cannot pass such an order.																								The judges sent the matter to the regular bench to be heard after three weeks.																								The courts interim order came on a public interest litigation by Amal Kumar Mukherjee, former secretary to the high court bar association, and two other advocates.

																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: Pervez Musharraf must go but Nawaz Sharif is no real alternative, said MBA student Jibran Khurshid, a frown on his bespectacled face. And allying with America is not a great option either.
																								But our biggest concern is the uncertainty. What does the future hold? None of us knows, said the final-year MBA student at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
																								Eight students from Pakistans premier B-school today shared their concerns over the instability in their country and their vision for a democratic future.
																								The future managers of Pakistan, here for an inter B-school sports meet hosted by Delhi Universitys Faculty of Management Studies, said they were shocked by Benazir Bhuttos assassination.
																								But they added they were disillusioned with most of Pakistans political leaders  including Bhutto.
																								Musharraf must go. People like us... the youth... have completely lost faith in him, said Khurram Shahzad Samad. The others echoed him.
																								Today, many students across Pakistan want democracy, they said. We think Pakistan will have democracy soon, Khurshid said. 
																								But the students said they did not want Sharif as Prime Minister again. Imran (Khan) probably holds the most support among the youth, said Ahmed Shahan Khalid. 
																								Are they looking towards the US as an ally? Not at all, said Mariam Minhas, a smile breaking out on her face. Contrary to text-book literature, the average Pakistani believes the US has only helped Pakistan for its own selfish reasons, she said.
																								The cynicism disappeared at the mention of India.
																								Quite honestly, we loved it, gushed Armaghan Zafar, hands tucked in the pockets of his Nike sweatshirt.
																								During a visit to Chandni Chowk, the students decided to try the famous Karims kebabs but found it had closed for the night. As soon as we told the owner we had come from Pakistan, he happily restarted his kitchen, laughed Khurram Sheikh.
																								At a Connaught Place cosmetics shop, the students were offered discounts. And the experience of watching Taare Zameen Par and Welcome was awesome.
																								The students were tonight travelling to Wagah and plan to cross the border on foot.

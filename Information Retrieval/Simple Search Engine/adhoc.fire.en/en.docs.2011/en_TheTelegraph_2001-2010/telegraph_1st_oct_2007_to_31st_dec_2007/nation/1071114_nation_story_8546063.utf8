				 Share option back on EPF table
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 13: The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) will examine the option of investing 5 per cent of its kitty in stocks.																								If the proposal is accepted, it will help pay higher returns to subscribers who are now given 8.5 per cent, labour minister Oscar Fernandes said today.																								The announcement comes ahead of the meeting of the board of trustees, which manages the collections from over four crore subscribers. The meeting will fix the interest rate for 2007-08.																								Fernandes said the stock plan had met with opposition from trade unions, which are members of the board, on two occasions earlier.																								However, he promised to persuade the unions and work out a consensus.																								Since board members, including those belonging to Left unions, dont agree to such investments in view of the volatility in the stock market, we will try to find out safer options, like bonds.

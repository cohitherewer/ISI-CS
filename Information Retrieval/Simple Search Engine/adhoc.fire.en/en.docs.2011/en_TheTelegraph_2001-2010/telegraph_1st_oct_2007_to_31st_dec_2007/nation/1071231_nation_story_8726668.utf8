				 Red fury on rise, top cop says no

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Cuttack, Dec. 30: The last 12 months have been what can only be described as a year of consolidation and expansion of Maoist areas of operation and growth in their activities in Orissa.
																								The year witnessed rise in rebel activities in Malkangiri district in particular. The Naxalites made their presence felt in the district when they observed Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army Week (December 2-8), forcing police to issue a high alert in the district, especially in Kalimela, MV79, Motu, Bhejanwada and the Chitrakonda areas and seal borders with Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to prevent rebel influx. 
																								The Maoists also struck thrice in major setback to the administration. While suspected Maoists in Dhenkanal killed three forest employees on January 31, a CRPF sub-inspector and two suspected Maoist cadres were killed during an exchange of fire near MV79 village in Malkangiri on April 29. In another major attack on June 22, the rebels hacked three persons to death in Deogarh district after dragging them out of their houses and tying them in a rope. A contractor was also killed in a similar fashion. 
																								Director-general of police Gopal Chandra Nanda, however, sees nothing abnormal about the Naxalite problem here. In fact, the situation now is much better as compared to other Naxalite-hit states, he claims, adding measures adopted by the police had brought down rebel violence.

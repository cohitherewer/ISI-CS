				 US envoy sets sights on Atal
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, Oct. 29: The wooing of the BJP by the Americans on the nuclear deal is likely to continue, with US ambassador David C. Mulford now hoping that Atal Bihari Vajpayee would meet him in Delhi in a couple of days.																								After a meeting with L.K. Advani last week, Mulford met BJP president Rajnath Singh this afternoon and sought to explain that the deal was not a threat to Indias sovereignty.																								The 123 Agreement was the focal point of several meetings today between Indian and US leaders, in government and outside. Mulford and US treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state, met Advani.																								Mulfords meeting with Rajnath seemed to attract most of the attention, especially since the BJP leader has spoken in public about his partys possible support for the deal if the Centre clarified its case and promised to uphold Indias strategic sovereignty.																								Sources said Mulford sought to convince Rajnath that certain parts in the 123 Agreement and Americas Hyde Act relating to Indias right to test and safeguards in perpetuity were not binding. These parts had seemed to worry the BJP leadership.																								The ambassador said the 123 Agreement was a pact between equals and Indias dependence on the US was practically nil. He is believed to have argued that both India and the US would gain enormously if the deal came through, and that the benefits would not be restricted to nuclear commerce.																								Sources on both sides said the conversation, conducted through an interpreter, was very positive. Rajnath, like Advani before him, seemed keenly interested in what the US ambassador had to say, the sources said.																								Mulfords lobbying for the nuclear deal has been unusual. It is not common for a diplomat to come out openly in favour of any issue, especially with the Opposition.																								Analysts say the ambassador is talking to the BJP much more than the Congress has done these past months, a signal that the US is still keen to pull the deal off.																								Mulfords meetings have also contributed to confusion within the BJP on the deal. All sides in the party admit that they want to continue the good relations with the US, but since the intra-party differences have widened on the issue, more than one voice has begun to emerge from the BJP.																								If the ambassadors meeting with Vajpayee, despite his poor health, comes through in a couple of days, the tide may well turn in favour of a BJP rethink.

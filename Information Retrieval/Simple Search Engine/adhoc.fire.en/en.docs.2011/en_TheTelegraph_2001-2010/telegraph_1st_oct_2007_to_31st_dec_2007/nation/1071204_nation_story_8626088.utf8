 															- Cong scepticism greets BJPgesture OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rahul Gandhi: Winning friends																								New Delhi, Dec.3: The Congress is less than impressed by the BJPs warmth towards Rahul Gandhi.																								Responding to BJP chief Rajnath Singhs interview to The Telegraph in which he said Rahul was like our children, Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi welcomed the gesture but ruled out the possibility of proximity between the two parties.																								Any understanding between the Congress and the BJP is not possible in the next 500 years, Das Munshi said.																								He said the BJP had complimented the Congress leadership in the past, too. They have been praising Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indiraji, Rajiv Gandhi and now Rahul Gandhi. It is good. 																								Then he added with a touch of sarcasm: I wish the BJP prevails upon its cadres who are trying to obstruct the Congress in every possible way.																								In the interview, Rajnath had agreed that a near-complete lack of functional relationship between the ruling and principal Opposition parties was not good for the health of democracy in the country. He had said that at a personal level, there was no reason for enmity.																								Unwittingly or otherwise, Rajnath seems to have set a trend in the BJP. Yesterday, L.K. Advani ran into Rahul at Delhi airport.																								The BJP veteran told Rahul that the two mainstream parties should view each other only as political adversaries and not as enemies.																								Rahul was on his way to Amethi while Advani was heading to Gujarat for a public meeting in the Pardi tribal area. Rahul reportedly had walked up to Advani, saying he had never had a chance to formally introduce himself and meet the senior politician.																								After exchanging pleasantries, the young Gandhi reportedly asked Advani about his mid-term views on national politics. In response, Advani told him the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election results indicated that political space for mainstream parties was shrinking while regional parties were gaining clout.																								The Congress remained sceptical about the warmth, suspecting that it could be a tactic ahead of the Gujarat polls. They have a Modi saying the most obnoxious things about our leader and then these BJP leaders saying sweet nothings about Rahul. It is the typical double face of the BJP, a Congress leader said.																								The gameplan is to sound reasonable and accommodating. Yet in the battlefield of Gujarat, they are making personal and derogatory remarks, he added.

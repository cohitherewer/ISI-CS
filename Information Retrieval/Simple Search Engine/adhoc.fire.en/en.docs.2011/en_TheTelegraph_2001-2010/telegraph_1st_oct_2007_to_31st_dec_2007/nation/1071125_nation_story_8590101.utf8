				 Rajdhani scare
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 24: The engine of the Howrah-bound Rajdhani Express got detached from its rake near a level crossing.																								The 18-coach 2306Dn New Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express arrived near Jharkands Jamtara station, under Eastern Railways Asansol division, around 11.15am. It stopped near a level crossing at a red signal. At that point, the speed limit was 20km because of some ongoing repairs, a spokesperson said in Calcutta.																								After the signal turned green, the driver drove on for about 50 metres before realising that the coaches had got detached. The coupling which attaches the engine to the coaches got detached, a railway official said. 																								The train left for Howrah in about 15 minutes after railway engineering staff restored the coupling. All passengers reached Howrah safely, officials said . 																								This is a very rare incident. Usually, when the train is in motion, the coupling does not come out because of the momentum, an official said. However, if the engine had detached from the train while in motion, the train could have been derailed, he added. 																								Eastern Railways has ordered a probe.

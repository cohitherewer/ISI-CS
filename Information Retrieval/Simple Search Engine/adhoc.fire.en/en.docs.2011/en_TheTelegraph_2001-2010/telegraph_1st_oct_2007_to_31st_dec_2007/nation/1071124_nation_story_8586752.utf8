				 Delhi toes Bengal line on Nandigram
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Centre today gave a clean chit to the CPM on Nandigram by putting the blame on some instigators with possible terror links.																								Union home minister Shivraj Patil said these elements might have taken the water route to smuggle arms and ammunition into the Bengal block, but didnt mention the Maoists, whom CPM leaders have repeatedly blamed for the violence.																								I have enough information about them but I can say only this much that they tried to take advantage of the situation. Weapons seized from the area show that the perpetrators of violence may have links with terrorist groups, the minister said in the Rajya Sabha, replying to a short discussion on special economic zones and the Nandigram violence.																								Patil evaded a direct reply on whether the perpetrators of the violence were Maoists. It is not written on their shirts whether they are Maoists or Naxalites or they belong to any other group, he said. I am not taking any names as I do not want to score any political points.																								The minister refused to answer whether the Left Front government was right in using force against the protesters.																								On the Oppositions charge that politicians and activists were not allowed to visit Nandigram, he said: If in any part of our country, anybody says you will not be allowed, it cannot be tolerated.																								Patil rejected the BJPs demand for Presidents rule in Bengal and said Article 356 should not be used lightly. 																								We will be very careful in using Article 356. We should not use it lightly or in a manner that is suspicious and will not be acceptable, he said. 																								 When the occasion arises, we will be using it (Article 356), but we will be very careful, he reiterated. 																								The most important task for the authorities, Patil said, was to ensure early return of the homeless in Nandigram.

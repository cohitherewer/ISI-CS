				 Ramlila road to poll
 SANJAY K JHA				 Rajnath																								New Delhi, Oct. 7: The setu will connect if the temple does not.																								The BJP plans to raise the Ram pitch on the Sethusamudram canal controversy in the days leading up to Dusshera, hoping to win over Hindus among whom the Sangh parivars Ayodhya temple rhetoric has lost its appeal.																								At Ramlilas (plays) organised by Sangh parivar organisations, common at this time of the year, a strong message will be sent to people that the insult of Ram will not be tolerated. Setu yatras are planned in the south.																								The plans during the 10-day festival, which also includes Navratri, follow events on Gandhi Jayanti where the BJP had stressed the Mahatmas respect for Ram.																								The BJP is convinced that the Congress antagonised people by questioning the existence of Ram in the setu affidavit the central government filed in the Supreme Court. 																								Allies, especially the CPM and the DMK, made matters worse. Senior BJP leaders said they had feedback from states that other political parties had not rightly assessed the extent of peoples anger on the affront to Ram.																								Party chief Rajnath Singh told the BJP Kisan Morchas national executive meeting on Wednesday that the insult to Ram would not be taken lying down in a speech that barely touched the problems faced by farmers.																								Singh suggested, rather bizarrely, that Sonia Gandhi should drop her Gandhi surname, saying the Mahatma adored Ram and everyone with that name should do the same.																								Why has Sonia Gandhi kept Gandhi as her surname? If you have no faith in Gandhi, will you remove that surname? he said as he declared that those who did not believe in Ram could not be saved from sinking.

				 Cong stirs on Nandigram
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 18: Pressure from the Bengal Congress has forced the partys central leadership to consider sending a high-level team to Nandigram after a week of soft-pedalling.																								A decision may be taken tomorrow when state Congress leaders meet Mohsina Kidwai, the party general secretary and minder for Bengal.																								Congress sources, however, hinted that at first only state leaders would be sent to Nandigram. Later, depending on their report, their bosses in Delhi would decide if they should go, too.																								At yesterdays All India Congress Committee session, neither Manmohan Singh nor Sonia Gandhi had said a word on the latest bloodshed in Nandigram.																								The three-line mention in the resolution, which avoided naming the CPM and cited merely the cult of the armed cadres, had left the delegates from Bengal disappointed.																								Later, Deepa Das Munshi, Shubhankar Sarkar and Manas Bhuniya had urged the Centre to act and not to spare the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government.																								Today, a team of Bengal leaders, including Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, urged Sonia and Rahul Gandhi to send a high-level team to Nandigram for a spot check.																								The sources said the BJP has stolen a march over the Congress by sending a team led by L.K. Advani to Nandigram last week.																								Most Congress leaders, however, still believe that the Central Reserve Police Force should be given some more time to bring back normality. If Delhi leaders rushed in now, it could worsen the tensions.																								Besides, the sources said, even the Union ministers from Bengal feel that coalition compulsions make it unrealistic for the Prime Minister and Sonia to pull up the CPM. For them, it is enough that Sonia agreed to the mention of Nandigram in the AICC resolution.																								She also said that a coalition cannot come in the way of the Congresss revival, particularly in states where its base has been eroded. That was a clear reference to Bengal and a signal that the state unit should fight the CPM, a central leader said.																								Mohsina, who met the delegates from Bengal and Kerala (shes in charge also of the southern state) over breakfast this morning, told The Telegraph: We are taking the whole thing seriously. The fact that our stand was reflected in the resolution means we are taking it seriously.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Bhubaneswar, Dec 16: Those who missed Lord Jagannaths carriage at Puri Rath Yatra this year, the auspicious occasion is now a click away. 
																								Footages of the four-hour-long yatra has been put up on the official website of Puri Jagannath Temple  www.jagannath.nic.in  said D. Panda, director of the National Informatics Centre. 
																								Talking to The Telegraph today, the NIC director said the centre streamed the footage from live telecast of the yatra by DD India, in collaboration with the Orissa government.
																								Scenes of yatras held over the past four years are also accessible now through the site, which was converted into a dynamic one and launched today by the information and public relations minister, Debasis Nayak. 
																								A faithful can not only view his favourite yatra footage but can also send e-greeting and devotional songs to others, thanks to the updated version. 
																								A person just has to click on the payment gateway shop and donate a amount to the temples corpus fund on-line through credit cards to receive the same. The devotees may donate any amount through the site. 
																								A hundi (donation box) funded by the State Bank of India was also inaugurated today by the states law minister, Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, who said the administration and the government plans to install such donation boxes at Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai for the temple. T
																								he deposit amount in the temples corpus fund has reached Rs 91 crore and a target has been set to make its Rs 100 crore by the current fiscal. 
																								Although the temple owns some 57,000 acres, the income from the revenue collected from the places is meagre and inadequate to run the temple, since most of the lands are encroached or are unproductive. 
																								From now long-distance devotion would get web boost, too.
																								From this day onwards, devotees can send flower and tulsi as offering to the lords from the Bhubaneswar Information Centre, said temple chief administrator Mohapatra, adding that a van was also donated by a transporter, Janakar Sahu, for the transportation of offerings. 
																								The temple administration has already built a guesthouse with 18 air-conditioned rooms and is planning to construct a bus terminal and tourist transit house to cater to 10,000 to 15,000 tourists at a time.

				 PM worried but holds tongue on lay-off barb
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today treaded with caution as he expressed concern at the alleged mistreatment of ethnic Indians in Malaysia.																								There is concern whenever Indians or people of Indian origin are affected. I wont say more because Parliament is in session, the Prime Minister said at the 8th India-EU summit today.																								The governments response came a day after a Malaysian minister asked Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi to lay off when he complained about Kuala Lumpurs bad treatment of ethnic Indians, a majority of whom are Tamil.																								This is Malaysia, not Tamil Nadu, Malaysias de facto justice minister Nazri Aziz had said. This has got nothing to do with him... lay off.																								Karunanidhi had sought Singhs intervention to mitigate the sufferings of Tamils and protect their rights.																								On Sunday, about 10,000 Tamils had staged an anti-government rally to protest discriminatory policies. Police had used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them and detained over 200.																								As the issue rocked Parliament for the third day in a row, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee assured both Houses that he would take it up with Kuala Lumpur.																								Mukherjee also said he would discuss Azizs comments against Karunanidhi.																								Certain observations have been made against respected leader Karunanidhi. I am in touch with the Malaysian government and we are taking it up, the foreign minister said, adding that the two countries share friendly relations.																								He echoed the Prime Minister, saying Delhi was concerned about all Indian-origin people living across the world. The government remains deeply solicitous of the welfare of the people of Indian origin living abroad. 																								Mukherjee repeated his statement in the Rajya Sabha. There is a large community of Indians living in Malaysia who are citizens of that country. We have friendly relations with Malaysia and are in touch with the authorities there, he said.																								Members cutting across party lines voiced their concern in Parliament today. 																								The Opposition BJP supported the DMK cause, saying it was hurt by the attack on Hindus. 																								Temples have been razed. Hindus are being treated in such an inhuman fashion. The government must go to the Commonwealth, BJP spokesperson Vijay Kumar Malhotra said.

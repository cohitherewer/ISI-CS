				 Jamait firm on Taslima
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Dec. 2: Taslima Nasreens decision to withdraw a couple of pages from her autobiography Dwikhandito has failed to placate some Muslim organisations in Bengal which have been demanding her expulsion for hurting the sentiments of the faithful.																								The Milli Ittehad Parishad, a forum of 12 organisations, today spoke out against her return to Calcutta.																								Our Parishad thinks it would be wise for her not to come back in view of the tension her presence created here. We dont want any repeat of the November 21 violence. Even the CPM could not stop its supporters from joining the Muslim resentment against her, Jamait Ulema-i-Hind leader and Parishad convener Siddiqullah Chowdhury said.																								Since her regret is not satisfactory, we would like her not to return in the interest of amity in the city and in the state, he added. 																								Taslima had on Friday said she would withdraw the controversial passages and added that it had never been her intention to hurt the sentiments of any section of people or community.																								Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee had welcomed the decision as good and Jamait general secretary Maulana Mahmood Madani said now that the Bangladeshi author had withdrawn the portions against Islam, his party had no problems if she stayed in India.																								But Chowdhury, the Jamaits Bengal leader, was not impressed. Today, the Parishad and some smaller religious groups held a meeting to take a decision on the Taslima issue.																								The Parishad, mainly an anti-Left platform, has decided to launch an agitation to highlight the plight of Muslims in Bengal in the light of the Sachar Committees findings, which revealed the communitys lack of development.

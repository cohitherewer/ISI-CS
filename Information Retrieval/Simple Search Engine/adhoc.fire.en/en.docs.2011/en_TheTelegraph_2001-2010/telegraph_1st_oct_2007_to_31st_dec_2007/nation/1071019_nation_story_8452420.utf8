 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																On the move, minus a heart				 																																																										Mumbai is always on the move. Sometimes, though, it isnt moved.				 																																																										A housewife rushing to her uncles home after his death had her arm slashed on a rush-hour train by purse-snatchers even as other passengers looked the other way.				 																																																										The attack took place around 8.30pm in a Churchgate-bound local as Bosky Shroff was preparing to get off at Grant Road station. When the train left Mumbai Central, the station before her destination, the Nepean Sea Road resident stood near the door. Just then, a woman appeared and asked Bosky to hand over her bag. 				 																																																										When she refused, the woman whipped out a blade and slashed her arm, but Bosky held on. The snatcher jumped off as the train slowed at the station and melted away in the crowd.				 																																																										No one in the ladies compartment came to my rescue despite my cries for help. After I got off, some people at the station offered to take me to hospital, she said. The famed Mumbai spirits, she realised, could go off track.				 																N-speak derails train gift				 																																																										Sonia Gandhis controversial remarks, where she had called opponents of the nuclear deal enemies of development, derailed the focus of her recent visit to Haryana. 				 																																																										An hour before the remark in Jhajjar, Sonia and railway minister Lalu Prasad flagged off two new trains. The trains will benefit the National Capital Region, especially office-goers and others, Lalu Prasad said.				 																																																										Many students from Rewari and Rohtak, Haryana towns close to the capital, daily commute to Delhi University. This train will save my travel time by over three hours, said Archana Sood, one such student.				 																																																										At present, Sood said she has no choice but to spend about five hours, both ways, travelling by bus to the university. Now, it will take her just over two hours. 				 																Sop opera in Andhra				 																																																										Mid-term polls may happen, or may not. But Andhra Pradesh has turned into a war zone  of sops and promises.				 																																																										The Congress, the Telugu Desam and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti are locked in a seemingly endless race to promise things that could leave them running a regime that resembles a donation camp, not a government.				 																																																										The Congress regime has already offered rice at Rs 2 per kg, saddling the exchequer with a multi-crore burden it will have to groan under over the next few years. Then, there are the irrigation works, low-cost housing, free power, farm initiatives and the infotech boosters.				 																																																										Desams bag of goodies has nine hours of free power for farmers, loan waivers and a unique plan to allow the poor to sell land allotted by the government.				 																																																										The TRS is touting 12 hours of free power to farmers and interest-free crop loans. On rice, it has gone one up on the Congress, though, promising to offer the staple free.				 																Lighthouse				 																																																										Blackouts will not be taken lightly this festival season, the Delhi government has warned power companies.				 																																																										The private utilities, which have faced the heat in recent months over billing and load-shedding problems, have been told to ensure uninterrupted supply till Diwali.				 																																																										The terse message was sent by power minister A. K. Walia recently at a meeting with the heads of the three companies supplying electricity to various parts of the capital. 				 																																																										They will face action if the streetlights and other illumination facilities in public places go on the blink.				 																																																	Delhi: An old machine that Kallan the kabadiwallah buys from a professor transforms his 50-year-old wife into a young nymphet. He convinces a rich businessman to try the machine. Watch Ek machine kabadi ki this Friday at Poorva Sanskritik Kendra, 14, Laxmi Nagar District Centre. Time:7pm. Entry free.

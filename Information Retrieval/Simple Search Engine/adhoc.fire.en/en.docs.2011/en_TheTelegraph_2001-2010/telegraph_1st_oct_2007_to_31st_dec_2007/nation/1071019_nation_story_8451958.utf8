				 A waste of a trip, from NY
 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES				 	 A municipal worker clears the waste found in the shipment from New York																								Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 18: Around 60 tonnes of municipal waste has been found in containers shipped from New York to Kochi that were supposed to only carry waste paper for a paper-manufacturing company.																								The Kerala pollution control board today said the waste, in three containers, has been ordered to be sent back.																								Customs authorities may take action against the importer, Kochin Kadlas, which has permission to import only waste paper.																								The company is likely to have to pay a penalty, officials said. They added that only non-halogen plastic could be imported, and that too with permission from the director-general of foreign trade.																								The municipal waste was mixed with the waste paper. It included plastic waste, biodegradable food waste, glass pieces and packing material for computer accessories, pollution control board chairperson G. Rajmohan said.																								He added that samples had been collected to see if the waste contained hazardous substances. The report on the findings in the containers has been submitted to customs authorities.																								Customs and pollution control board officials today examined the waste lying at the customs freight station in Pettah near Kochi. The pollution board had appointed a four-member, high-level committee to check the containers, which arrived two weeks ago.																								Customs deputy collector N.S. Ramachandran said a show-cause notice would be issued to the importer and action taken under customs laws.																								Last year, 12 containers of plastic waste had been sent back to the US.

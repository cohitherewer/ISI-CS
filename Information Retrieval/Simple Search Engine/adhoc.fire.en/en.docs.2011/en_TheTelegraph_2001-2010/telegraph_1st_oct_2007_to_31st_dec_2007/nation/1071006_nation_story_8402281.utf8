				 Adoption tracker
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Oct. 5: Parents adopting children will have to provide regular feedback on the childs development through a computerised tracking system that will be launched in the next six months, the government announced today. 																								The mechanism will help us react to complaints of child abuse or neglect following adoption, minister for women and child development Renuka Chowdhury said. 																								Feedback forms will be made available on the website of the Central Adoption Resource Agency (Cara), the countrys apex adoption regulatory body. 																								The information provided in these forms will be placed online for public viewing. 																								Often, neighbours may not know the extent of abuse of an adopted child by parents. But if they know that some of the information provided is incorrect, they can complain, Cara chairman J.K. Mittal said. 																								The ministry will hold consultations with adoption agencies and social workers from across the country and abroad next week before finalising new guidelines for adoption.																								As of now, it takes Indian parents some three months of harassment to adopt a child. For parents living outside India, the process takes nearly six months, Chowdhury said.

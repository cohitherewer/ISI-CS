				 How India escaped being an island
 G.S. MUDUR				 	 The circled area shows the island that could have been India																								New Delhi, Oct. 17: Seismologists have discovered that India lost a lower chunk of its tectonic plate 140 million years ago and resolved the enduring mystery behind the fastest continent after Gondwanalands break-up. 																								New findings by Indian and German scientists suggest that hot molten material from Earths interior melted the lower half of Indias lithosphere, the rigid outer shell of the planet that floats over a jelly-like zone beneath. 																								Had this massive loss of lithosphere not occurred, India would still have been an island continent  with no Himalayas, no Ganga, no Brahmaputra and, perhaps, no monsoon  separated from Asia by a wide sea. 																								This is an event that shaped the continental history of India and gave it its position that we see on the world map today, said Mangalampally Ravi Kumar, a team member at the National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad. 																								India was once locked into a supercontinent with Africa, Antarctica and Australia. Previous studies have shown that a super-plume of molten matter from Earths interior caused Gondwanaland to break up 140 million years ago. 																								After the split, India turned into the continental equivalent of a Rajdhani Express, moving north towards Asia at 20cm a year.																								Indias speed was known earlier, but there was no clear explanation for this, Rainer Kind, a seismologist and team member at the National Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam, Germany, told The Telegraph. 																								Now, in the most detailed studies so far on the thickness of continental lithospheres, the researchers have found that African and Australian lithospheres are 180km to 300km deep, while Indias lithosphere is only 100km. 																								In a study to appear in the journal Nature tomorrow, the researchers have said the super-plume that caused Gondwanaland to break up may also have melted the lower half of the Indian lithosphere, allowing the lighter landmass to move faster towards Asia.																								The researchers said diamond mines in Andhra Pradesh provide evidence that Indias lithosphere was once much thicker. Diamonds are formed deep inside Earth and need a lithosphere thickness of 180km or higher, Kumar said. Diamonds from India show that India lost a part of its lower lithosphere. 																								Without lithospheric loss, India would still have been an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean, with a wide sea north of it, Dietmar Muller, a geologist at the University of Sydney, said.

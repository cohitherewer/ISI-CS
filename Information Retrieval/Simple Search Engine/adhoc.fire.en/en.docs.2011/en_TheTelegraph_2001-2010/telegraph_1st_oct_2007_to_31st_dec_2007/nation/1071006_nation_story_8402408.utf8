 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Indian Council of Medical Research today metamorphosed into the department of health research, with greater autonomy and a promise of a five-fold rise in budget.																								The department will have the freedom to use its funds as it wishes. In its earlier avatar, it had to seek approval from the health ministry.																								Were aiming for a five-fold jump in the budget this year, Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said. 																								We expect the department to expand its research and to better articulate policies relating to health issues.																								The department expects to have a budget of at least Rs 1,500 crore this year compared to Rs 368 crore earmarked for the council. 																								We would also like the department to focus more on translational research, Ramadoss said, referring to an emerging concept in medical research aimed at accelerating ideas from the laboratory bench to the bedside. 																								It plans to set up a chain of translational research centres and public health schools and increase the flow of medical research funding to universities and medical schools, said Nirmal Kumar Ganguly, the department secretary.

				 Ramazan recess at CPM meet
 JOHN MARY 																								Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 2: The muezzins prayer call broke up a CPM meeting in Kochi yesterday  and Muslim members dispersed to pray and break their Ramazan fast with refreshments served up by the atheist party. 																								The CPM, which sees religion as the opium of the masses, has not reacted officially to the incident at the Lanthaparambu branch committee meeting in the Muslim-majority Mattancherry town. The branch is one of 25,937 in Kerala.																								But sources said the organisers announced the recess over microphone as soon as they heard the muezzins call from a nearby mosque. The meeting was being held at Regent Hotel Hall. 																								This is not the CPMs first nod to religion, though.																								Two party members elected to the Kerala Legislative Assembly  a Hindu and a Christian  had taken oath in the name of God instead of making a solemn affirmation like the rest. 																								Aisha Potti, a Brahmin and member of the CPM area committee in the southern Kollam district, had said that while she was committed to communism and the party, she would never give up her faith.																								M.M. Monayi, member of the Ernakulam district committee and a Syrian Christian, said religion was a matter of personal choice. 																								Soon after, party state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan warned workers against deviation from Marxist-Leninist principles, especially the tendency to whittle down their revolutionary zeal and take to religion.																								Pinarayi could not have been happy to see three Christians from Kerala taking the oath in the name of God in Parliament. While Sebastian Paul (Ernakulam) was an Independent backed by the CPM, K.S. Manoj (Alappuzha) and Lonappan Nambadan (Mukundapuram) had won on party symbols. 																								The open expression of faith by the branch committee at Mattancherry is a signal that the ranks of believers are swelling and the party might find it difficult to ignore them.																								Perhaps the prayer break was forced by the view that there is less harm in allowing workers to profess their faith in the open than in losing them to bourgeois parties.

																								Bangalore, Dec. 28: A man bound for Calcutta was stabbed on the Guwahati Express last night by three men who wanted him to hand over Rs 70,000 he had received as compensation for his sons death.
																								The assailants, carrying knives, barged into the general compartment as the train was pulling out of Bangalore city station at 11.45pm and stabbed Akmal Hussain, 47, twice in the chest when he refused to part with the money. He died in hospital this morning.
																								The trio also slashed his wife Ameera Bibi and nephew Nooha Ali when they tried to stop the assailants from harming Hussain. His daughter, Zareena Khatum, escaped unhurt.
																								Hussain, a Malda-based farmer, was returning after collecting compensation a court awarded him for the death of his 20-year-old son, Abdul Bari, in a road accident here two years ago. Abdul had died the day he arrived in Bangalore in search of work. Hussain had deposited the Rs 3-lakh cheque in a bank early this week but withdrawn a lakh.
																								Police sources said the robbers seemed to have known Hussain was carrying the money. They managed to locate the cloth bag that Hussain had hidden in his pyjama pocket and jumped off the train soon after.
																								There were four other passengers in the compartment, who apparently pleaded with the trio not to stab Hussain.
																								His family got off at Bangalore Cantonment station, which is 10 minutes from the city station, and filed a police complaint. The police took Hussain to the hospital where he died this morning. Ameera and Nooha were discharged after first-aid.
																								Ameera today said things had happened at such speed that they could not call for help.
																								The train had just started and we were settling down in the last bogie of the train when the attackers clambered in and demanded we hand over the money. My husband resisted and got stabbed. When I flung myself over him, they slashed me. My chain and earrings were snatched, she said.
																								Nooha, who seemed to be in a daze, said: There were very few people in the compartment. There was no proper lighting. It was all over within minutes and by the time the next station came, someone called the police and we got off.
																								Railway police said the trio must have known Hussain was carrying money. They specifically targeted him. After they got the cash and ornaments, they simply jumped off the train, deputy superintendent M. Krishnappa said.
																								He said the Guwahati Express had six general compartments. 
																								As this is the holiday season, there were few passengers in the general compartments which is guarded by one RPF constable each. Unfortunately, we found there was no constable in the bogie in which this family was travelling.
																								Although the family belongs to Malda, they were planning to get off at Howrah because they had to drop Zareena at her in-laws place in Calcutta.
																								There have been cases of passengers being drugged and robbed. This is the first time a passenger has been stabbed and so much cash robbed, Krishnappa said.

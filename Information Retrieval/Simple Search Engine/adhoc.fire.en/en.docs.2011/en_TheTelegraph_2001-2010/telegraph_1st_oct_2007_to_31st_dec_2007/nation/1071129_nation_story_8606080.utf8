				 Assam violence claims one more life
 OUR BUREAU 																								Nov. 28: Violence-racked Assam counted one more dead after a man, found buried neck deep in the ground, succumbed this evening while a five-year-old was beaten up with his parents as anger refused to die on the states troubled streets.																								A team of policemen and security personnel engaged by Oil India Ltd found the grievously wounded Shyamanta Gohain at Tengakhat in Dibrugarh district this morning. They took him to the OIL hospital from where he was shifted to Assam Medical College Hospital in Dibrugarh. He died in the evening.																								Police said Gohain may have been attacked last night by the same group of Adivasis that had targeted some OIL employees near the place where he was found. 																								Adivasis also attacked three members of a family in Tengakhat before setting their house on fire.																								Bina Gogoi said in her FIR that the assailants took away Rs 35,000 in cash, a motorcycle, two bicycles, two mobile phones and valuables after beating her up along with her husband Bulon and five-year-old son Jyotisman.																								Bina said she and her son could have been killed had her husband not hit back. We fled while he fought them alone. Fortunately, he survived, too.																								Dibrugarh additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Ashim Swargiary said seven other families fled their homes after the attack.																								Arsonists, suspected to be Adivasis, set ablaze a private bus in Kokrajhar district. The bus was carrying a marriage party from Siliguri in Bengal.

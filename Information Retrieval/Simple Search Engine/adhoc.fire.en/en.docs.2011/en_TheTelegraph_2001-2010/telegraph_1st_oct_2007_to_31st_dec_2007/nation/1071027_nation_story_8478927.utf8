				 Legal voices want apex court to step in
 SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY																								New Delhi, Oct 26: Legal experts today called upon the Supreme Court to bring to justice the Sangh parivar activists caught on camera bragging about the rape and murder of Muslims during the 2002 Gujarat riots.																								Former law minister Shanti Bhushan said the tapes of the Tehelka sting operation were admissible as evidence.																								These people caught on the tapes clearly admitted to how the conspiracy was hatched and the kind of crimes they committed. This is evidence that is admissible in the courts. The court should take cognisance of it and immediately bring them to justice, he said.																								The Supreme Court under former Chief Justice V.N. Khare had shown good judicial instinct in admitting petitions seeking transfer of 14 riot cases out of Gujarat, T.R. Andhyarujina said. 																								But I am not too happy with the way trials have since been suspended in these cases for over five years now, added the lawyer for the National Human Rights Commission, which had asked for the transfer. 																								The petitions were filed in the Supreme Court soon after the high court acquitted all 21 accused in the Best Bakery case. Trial in the cases was stayed on November 21, 2003, pending a decision by the apex court whether to reinvestigate and transfer them.																								Since then, only the Best Bakery trial has been moved to Maharashtra. Cases related to the massacres in Sardarpura, Gulbarga, Naroda Patiya, Ode, Sabarkantha and Naroda Gaon are on hold and most of the accused out on bail. 																								Delay is prejudicial to bringing people to justice investigation is stalled witnesses disappear, Andhyarujina said.																								The court should decide on these cases, he said. Once it takes a prima facie view whether a case is made out for transfer, the stay could be vacated and the Tehelka expos tapes examined by the trial court as evidence. 																								Citizens for Justice and Peace, the NGO fighting for the Gujarat riot victims, said it would urge the court to do just that. We will present this (the expose) as additional evidence to the court and seek an early hearing of the riot cases pending in the court, secretary Teesta Setalvad said. We will file a petition tomorrow.																								Setalvad said the NGO would seek a probe into all the revelations in the expos.																								Supreme Court lawyer Kamini Jaiswal said: These people on the tapes are guilty of committing offences. This should be probed by an independent agency, not the state. If the state government thwarts it, the Supreme Court should act. That is obstruction of justiceit amounts to contempt of court. 																								Jaiswal added: Modi has systematically ruined every institution in the state, the police, the executive and the judiciary. This amounts to a breakdown of the constitutional machinery in the state. The Centre should act. Otherwise, the Supreme Court can. 																								One of the Naroda Patiya accused, Babu Bajrangi, is heard on the Tehelka videotapes saying: There was this pregnant woman, I slit her open. 																								The killing of former Congress MP Ehsan Jaffri in Gulbarga is described in these words: Five or six people held him, then someone struck him with a sword, chopped off his hand, then his legs, chopped off all his organs. 																								These people are not human beings. They are worse than animals. Shame on the BJP, the VHP, the Shiv Sena and the Bajrang Dalthese people are just a group of hard-core criminals. They should be banned. They have no business being in politics, Shanti Bhushan said.

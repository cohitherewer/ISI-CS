				 Major general loses first round in scandal 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 19: The army has lined up a major general for a court martial following a preliminary investigation that concluded he sexually harassed a junior lady officer.																								The last time such a case was known to have been heard was four years ago when Major General V.K. Arjuna of the Army Supply Corps was court-martialled and found guilty. He was severely reprimanded.																								Three other major generals and a lieutenant general face court-martial proceedings now on the charge of financial corruption.																								In the latest case, the court of inquiry gave its findings a month and a half after the lady officer alleged that Major General A.K. Lal had misbehaved with her.																								The major generals family has alleged that the officer was being framed after he had hauled up the junior lady officer for indiscipline. Army sources here said he has presented his case but the court of inquiry still believed he was at fault. 																								The major general was stripped of his command of the Leh-based 3rd infantry division under the 14 corps that oversees the strategic zone in Ladakh, including Siachen, opposite Pakistani and Chinese forces.																								He was attached to the Srinagar-headquartered 15 corps for a court of inquiry in early September. The inquiry was headed by the commanding officer of the 15 corps, Lt Gen. A.S. Sekhon.																								Disciplinary proceedings under a general court martial were ordered by the northern army commander, Lt Gen. H.S. Panag, after the court of inquiry gave its conclusion.																								Army sources said Lal has now been sent back to the 14 corps for more investigation leading to the court martial.																								Parents of the lady officer, a captain with the Corps of Signals, had complained in writing to then army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh against the major general.																								Defence minister A.K. Antony had also asked the army headquarters to deal with the case urgently.																								Complaints by the lady officer and her Dehra Dun-based parents said the major general had used his position and sessions in yoga and pranic healing to misbehave with the captain several times.

				 Haneef effect on docs
																								Melbourne, Nov. 4 (PTI): The number of overseas doctors seeking to work in Australia has fallen by 90 per cent because of the governments handling of the case against Mohammed Haneef, a medical association said.																								This spells disaster for an already over-stretched and under-resourced medical work force  particularly for rural and regional areas where many of these doctors are posted, said Nagamma Prakash of the Overseas and Australian Medical Graduates Association.																								Haneef, an Indian doctor, was detained for weeks in connection with failed UK bombings on allegedly flimsy evidence before being allowed to fly home.																								Prakash spoke of growing anger among Australians of Indian background at the governments handling of the case.

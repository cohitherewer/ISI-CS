				 TB claims Salman witness
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Salman																								Mumbai, Oct. 3: The former constable who was Salman Khans bodyguard during the 2002 hit-and-run accident died today.																								Ravindra Patil, in his late thirties, succumbed to lung tuberculosis at a city hospital but his deposition in the case was over. A Bandra bakery employee sleeping on the pavement was killed and four others were injured when Salmans car ran over them.																								Lawyers said Patils testimony would stand even after his death. Once a witness has tendered the evidence, it will remain on record even if he dies. The court will assess the value of the evidence before giving the verdict, Subhas Kanse, the lawyer who represented the Memons in the Bombay blasts case, said.																								Patil had failed to appear during the trial a couple of times  a warrant had to be issued for his arrest  but told a Bandra court in March 2006 that Salman was behind the wheel in the Toyota Land Cruiser and that he was under the influence of alcohol. 																								However, Salmans lawyers pointed out that Patil hadnt mentioned that the actor was drunk in his first police statement on September 28, the day the accident took place. Patil was accused of having changed his statement under police pressure but he denied the allegation. 																								Salman wanted to visit the ailing Patil two weeks ago, sources said, but dropped the idea on fears that he could be accused of influencing the eyewitness. Dipesh Mehta, the actors lawyer, was not available for comment.																								Patil died at 11.30am. He was brought here a month ago in serious condition. We did whatever we could, said Dr Shaila Padhi of GTB Hospital in central Mumbai.

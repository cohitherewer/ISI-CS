 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Ireland skims local cream				 																																																										The Queens University of Belfast, scouting for the cream of Indian students to come and study in Northern Ireland, has tied up with the New Delhi-based National Institute of Immunology for research projects. 				 																																																										Senior officials of the university were here last week to announce the agreement with the immunology institute, which is an autonomous institute under the central governments biotechnology department. 				 																																																										The understanding with the institute will facilitate student and academic staff exchanges and help boost Indian science and technology, said Trevor Newsom, director of research at Queens. 				 																																																										The university has also signed a scholarship programme with the Bengal Engineering and Science University. They will conduct joint research in the fields of cancer research and cell biology. 				 																																																										Globally, higher education and research requires a wide range of skills. However, this being an expensive resource, universities have increasingly been looking towards international partnerships that bring different skill sets together to address these problems, Newsom said. 				 																Super chor hits the wall				 																																																										The law finally caught up with the capitals super chor.				 																																																										A man who pulled off an astounding 550 burglaries in the capital over the past seven years was recently arrested and remanded in police custody. Subhash is only 30.				 																																																										His mind-boggling strike rate meant he was involved in more than one raid on any given day  if his record is considered within the space of 365 days.				 																																																										Subhash was collared when he had come to deliver charas to a client near a graveyard in Hauz Rani, police said.				 																																																										A kilogram of the intoxicant, a car, seven laptops, jewellery worth around Rs 15 lakh and cellphones were among the items recovered from him, the officers said.				 																																																										In his short-but-formidable career, Subhash had targeted several areas, including the upscale New Friends Colony, Defence Colony, Malviya Nagar and Mehrauli.				 																Green alert for Garden City				 																																																										Rajendra Pachauri, whose UN panel on climate change shared this years Peace Nobel with former US vice-president Al Gore, is worried about where Bangalore is headed.				 																																																										During a visit to the city last week, he expressed surprise and disgust at the bumper-to-bumper traffic and the large number of private cars, saying the vehicles were contributing to the unprecedented levels of pollution.				 																																																										While he said efficient public transport like Metro rail and city bus grids were good mass transit alternatives, he wondered what would happen once low-cost cars, like the Rs 1-lakh model that the Tatas are working on, hit the roads.				 																																																										Almost everyone will buy these low-cost cars and clog up traffic. Not just the road space, but also pollution levels will go up to alarming levels, Pachauri said. The regulators should take a hard look at such cheaper options that will only add to the chaos, he added.				 																Fair chance				 																																																										One of the biggest and most eagerly awaited events on the capitals calendar could be shifted from the heart of the city because it causes traffic chaos.				 																																																										Chief minister Sheila Dikshit wants the annual India International Trade Fair moved away from Pragati Maidan to, possibly, Dwarka on the western periphery.				 																																																										The fair should be shifted. While it is on, there is complete chaos and the traffic police arent able to manage it... its a nightmare. I want to decongest Delhi, she said last week.				 																																																										An earlier proposal to shift the fair  expected to draw three million visitors this year  out of Delhi had fallen through. 				 																																																	Delhi: Carry home the images etched in your memories this Monday. Drop in to marvel at artist Deepak Banerjees collection of rare etchings. The exhibition is on at the Gallerie Ganesha, E-557 Greater Kailash-II. It is open from 11am to 7pm.

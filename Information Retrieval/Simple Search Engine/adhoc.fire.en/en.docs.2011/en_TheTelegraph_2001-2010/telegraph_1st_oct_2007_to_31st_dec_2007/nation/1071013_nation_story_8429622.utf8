				 Clock ticking on deal but door still ajar
 JYOTI MALHOTRA 				 	 ElBaradei																								New Delhi, Oct. 12: If the government has tucked away a Plan B on the nuclear deal, it doesnt have to look far for inspiration.																								Mohamed ElBaradei, the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, today pitched the nuclear deal as a means to real independence. 																								India will be liberated from restrictions of the NSG (Nuclear Suppliers Group) independence to me means freedom of choice, ElBaradei said, asked by The Telegraph if the deal compromised the countrys sovereignty.																								The NSG can lift the restrictions only after the IAEA clears the India-specific safeguards. The Left has told the government that approaching the IAEA would be a provocation to pull the withdrawal trigger.																								ElBaradei is believed to have told the Indian leadership that if Delhi took the decision to go to the IAEA, the world body could clear the safeguards quickly. 																								The IAEA is scheduled to meet on November 22. Sources said the IAEA was expected to take only a few days to approve the agreement once it reached the body, which technically leaves the government with sufficient time even if the Left withdraws support. The deal could be pushed through by the time a floor test is called, usually at least 10 days after formal withdrawal.																								Legally and constitutionally, little stops the government from approaching the IAEA as the signature of only a representative  either the ambassador or a negotiator  is needed. Intervention from a higher level is required if and when the deal is passed by the US Congress and reaches the formal signing ceremony.																								But a push by a minority government could prove politically untenable. Neither the Left nor the BJP will allow such an important step to be taken when the fate of the government itself is in doubt.																								The IAEA approval has become a milestone event because if that hurdle is cleared a future government can pick up the thread and pursue the deal. Otherwise, a new government will have to start from scratch.																								Diplomats pointed out that if India did not begin negotiations at the IAEA either by the end of the month or by early November, the deal could be in trouble. 																								If India misses the November meeting, the next session of the IAEA board is in March 2008  far too late. But the diplomats said India could also summon an IAEA extraordinary session, perhaps in January after the Gujarat elections. 																								If that route is taken, Delhi can still persuade the US to call an NSG special session by February and send the deal to the US Congress by May. That would be cutting it much too fine. But if the government is pushing the realm of possibilities, this is one, a diplomat said.

				 Black bands, not bright clothes
 							 - Low-key Id at Ajmer dargah RAKHI ROY TALUKDAR Ajmer, Oct. 14: Gulam Mohammad hasnt been cured but is convinced Khwaja Saheb has magical healing powers.																								The blast hasnt discouraged me. Rather, it has strengthened my belief that terrorists cant destroy the secular fabric of this place, said the 27-year-old, one of the injured in Thursdays blasts at the Ajmer Sharif dargah. 																								The resident of Jammu and Kashmirs Punj took special permission from the hospital authorities to visit the shrine, where Id celebrations were low key and muted.																								Bright new clothes were missing and in their place were black bands on arms, worn as a mark of protest against the attack. The nagaras (drums), played each Id for the last 800 years, and qawwalis were silent.																								Another ritual, too, was muffled  instead of the five to 10 cannon blasts, only one cannonball was fired. The festoons werent up there and the coloured lamps could hardly be seen. Not many got a taste of sewai kheer (vermicelli porridge).																								Authorities at the shrine to Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti were satisfied their tone-down appeal had worked. Everybody has complied with our appeal of keeping it (the celebrations) simple this time, said an official of the Anjuman committee, which runs the dargah.																								The number of people offering prayers this Id had fallen but despite the blast-triggered hush, about 5,000 still congregated at the shrine, crawling with security forces, from this morning. On other days, the number is 15,000. However, unlike in the past, the devotees headed home after the prayers and the Id Milan greetings.																								The shops and bylanes around the dargah were quiet. The crowds were smaller, with women and children staying indoors. 																								Youths usually bring in DJs, play loud music and dance after Id prayers. This time, they did not in keeping with the undercurrent of grief. Few dressed up for the occasion and those who did preferred to keep it plain, said Sevak, who runs a photography shop in the dargah bazaar, just outside the shrine.																								Ram Pyari, working at a nearby clinic for 40 years, couldnt hide her sadness. We have heard about attacks on other religious places but never believed that this shrine would be a target. 																								Both Muslims and Hindus celebrate Id here. It has been a special occasion for us but this time its a peculiar feeling, not being part of the celebrations elsewhere, the 70-year-old said.																								But Zain-ul Abedin, diwan of the dargah and descendent of the 12th-century saint, said the occasion had been kept simple and prayers were offered for peace.																								Khadim Roshan Chishti echoed him. Everybody prayed and sought Khawja Sahebs blessings that such incidents dont recur.

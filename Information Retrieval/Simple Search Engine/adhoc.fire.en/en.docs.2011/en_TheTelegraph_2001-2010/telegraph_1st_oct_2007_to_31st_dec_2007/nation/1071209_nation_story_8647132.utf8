				 Antony bats for Russia ties

																								Pokhran, Dec. 8: Indias strategic ties with Russia will continue to be intensive despite the Gorshkov cost hike and a growing friendship with the US, defence minister A.K. Antony said today.
																								Five days ago, the navy chief had suggested that Delhi should rethink its relations with its traditional military hardware supplier. 
																								Our relationship with Russia is not one contract-centric. It has stood the test of time for 60 years. There are problems sometimes, but they get sorted out, Antony said at an air force firepower display in this Rajasthan range.
																								Nearly 70 per cent of Indian military hardware is of Russian or Soviet origin. 
																								Asked if Admiral Sureesh Mehtas annoyance at the delays in projects with the Russians reflected doubts in the strategic establishment on relations with Moscow, the minister said: There is only one view and that is the view of the Union cabinet.
																								Where are our relations with Russia going, Admiral Mehta had wondered aloud at a news conference on Monday after noting that Moscow had demanded an additional $1.2 billion for the Gorshkov aircraft carrier. 
																								Despite appearing to be more accommodative now, the defence minister had himself taken up the issue of delays with the Russians in a public forum during his meeting with his Russian counterpart in Moscow on October 17. 
																								Mehtas comment clearly had the Russians concerned that India was increasingly looking westwards for its military supplies. Antony decided that they must be assuaged as Indias armed forces are heavily dependent on Russian equipment. More than $14.5 billion are currently riding on Indian military orders to Russia.
																								We will expand our relationship with the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Germany, France and all other countries. But let there be no question -- these will not be at the cost of our relations with old friends, he said.

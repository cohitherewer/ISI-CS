				 Home again for kids sake
 MUZAFFAR RAINA				 Relatives of missing persons take part in a protest in Srinagar on Sunday. (AFP)																								Srinagar, Oct. 28: More than ten years ago, three Uri couples had left Kashmir for Muzaffarabad to escape the alleged brutality of security forces during the height of militancy. Last Friday, they returned to secure the future of their children, born on the other side of the divide.																								The three families crossed the Line of Control in Uri early on Friday and gave themselves up to the security forces.																								They are among hundreds who crossed over in the early 1990s alleging state brutality but have begun returning over the past few years.																								Fridays group was the largest in recent years. The families are from the villages of Gawalta and Mathai near the Line of Control.																								Last year, we received a group of nine. The reason for their return is their pathetic condition, which has worsened after the (October 2005) earthquake. Employment opportunities are bleak there, a government official in Uri said.																								They told us they could give their children a better future on this side and not on the other side, the officer added.																								Of the 11 children of the three families, 10 were born across the LoC. 																								One of these couples had a child when they left. The rest of the children were born in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. They are all small kids, Uri station house officer Abdul Rasheed Khan said.																								The officer added that the families had left their camp in PoK under the cover of darkness and surrendered to the army on the LoC.																								The army has handed them over to us and we are questioning them to ascertain why they have returned, Khan said. The police are also trying to find out whether any of the families has militant links.																								Army spokesman Colonel Manjinder Singh said the families were initially dissuaded from crossing over to India. Later, the police were called. They (the families) crossed over and were arrested on the spot.																								The forces usually encourage such families and Kashmiri militants living across the LoC to return. 																								Even army moles on the other side of the divide try to persuade these people to come back home.																								However, the fear that some of them may be using surrender as a ploy to join militants in Kashmir has forced the authorities to be extra careful.

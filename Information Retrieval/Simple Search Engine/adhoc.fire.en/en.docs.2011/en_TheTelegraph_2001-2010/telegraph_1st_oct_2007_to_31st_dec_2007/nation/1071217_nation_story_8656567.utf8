				 Lobby irked over warning delay

 PRIYA ABRAHAM
				 	 Tobacco kills
																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 16: The delay in placing pictorial warnings on tobacco packets, scheduled to start from December 1, is making the anti-tobacco lobby wonder about the governments intention.
																								Is the tobacco lobby too strong for the government to implement its own decision to revise statutory warnings? asked an anti- tobacco activist of Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI). 
																								The organisation reportedly has data to prove how donations to various parties by Indian Tobacco Company (ITC) has been influencing delays in the implementation. A copy of ITCs schedule to the accounts mentions donations determined on an equitable basis by the board, made to political parties during 2005. Among others, there is a mention of a sum of Rs 11 lakh to ruling BJD in Orissa. 
																								One can rightly judge how the tobacco companies keep the parties in good humour for their own benefit, said VHAI project manager, Aparajita Itishree Kanungo. 
																								This is the fourth time in the past year that the deadline, made under the Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution Act-2003, has been nullified. 
																								The new labels were initially planned for a February launch, which was postponed to June, then October and finally to December. They are still being re-checked, Kanungo added. 
																								The Government of India on July 5, 2006 had notified that every packet of tobacco product would contain a skull and bones sign, a health warning reading tobacco kills or smoking kills and a pictorial representation of its ill-effects, along with a health message. 
																								These were supposed to start from February 1, 2007 so as to allow the trade and industries to make the necessary changes. Even the much-needed tobacco control cell is still to start, rued Kanungo. 
																								While private companies are constantly filing in petitions and trying to buy time, politicians from states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra, which have a large number of beedi manufacturers, have opposed the move saying it will affect the livelihood of people, said the activist. 
																								Health secretary Chinmay Basu, however, stressed that the Orissa government has no qualms about implementing the directive. But we are yet to receive any communiqu from the Union ministry. The department will implement it as soon as we are asked, said Basu. 
																								Besides, Orissa should not face many problems. We do not have cigarette-manufacturing companies here. However, when it comes to the local beedi-makers, we might have to be stricter, the health secretary added.

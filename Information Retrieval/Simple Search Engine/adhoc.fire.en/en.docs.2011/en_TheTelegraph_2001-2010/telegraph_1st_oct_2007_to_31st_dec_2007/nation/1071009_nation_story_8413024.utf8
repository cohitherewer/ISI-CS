				 Priyanka visits plot
																								Shimla, Oct. 8 (PTI): Priyanka Vadra today visited her land on the outskirts of Shimla with husband Robert and their children.																								She had bought 4.5 bighas near the Kalyani helipad to fulfil the wishes of her grandmother, Indira Gandhi, who wanted to buy land near Rashtrapati Niwas.																								The Himachal Pradesh government had given her special permission to purchase the plot by relaxing a law that bars non-agriculturists from buying agricultural land in the state.																								Senior district Congress vice-president Kehar Singh Khacchi, who completed the registry of the land on Priyankas behalf in August, said she wanted to have a simple house of stone and wood as prevalent in Himachal Pradesh.																								He said the family would consult a Delhi architect. Construction would start soon, he added.

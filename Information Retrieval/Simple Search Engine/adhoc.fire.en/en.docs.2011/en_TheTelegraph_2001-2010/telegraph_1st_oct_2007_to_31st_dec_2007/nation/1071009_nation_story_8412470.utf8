				 CM steps down, central rule in air 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kumaraswamy																								Bangalore, Oct. 8: Chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy resigned tonight and said he was ready to support betrayed partner BJP, but Karnataka appeared set for Presidents rule amid rumours that the governor had recommended dissolution of the Assembly.																								However, till late in the night, there was no confirmation from Raj Bhavan.																								On a day of fast political developments, governor Rameshwar Thakur summoned Kumaraswamy and asked him to resign as he didnt have the numbers to pass a floor test in the 224-strong House after the BJP walked out of the coalition yesterday.																								The chief minister, who had so far been refusing to honour the power-share pact with the BJP, told the governor he was willing to support his estranged partner, but Thakur seemed to have made up his mind.																								The resignation came after a day of hectic talks between Janata Dal (Secular) and BJP leaders to hammer out a rapprochement for a second shot at power.																								BJP leader B.S. Yediyurappa, who would have succeeded Kumaraswamy as chief minister had the JD(S) honoured the power-share pact, was summoned back to the state capital from a rally he was addressing 70km away.																								But central BJP leaders scuttled all chances of reconciliation, saying the divorce was final.																								Sources said after his meeting with Thakur, Kumaraswamy drove straight to the residence of his father, JD(S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda, where party MLAs had gathered.																								Senior JD(S) leader M.P. Prakash said his party, which has 48 MLAs, had two options before it  a floor test or the governments resignation. We opted for the second, he said.																								In the morning, the Congress, which yesterday stepped into the states troubled waters, paraded 70 legislators, including six Janata Dal (Secular) rebels, and claimed it was ready to form the government.																								Later, in the evening, Prithviraj Chavan, the man in charge of party affairs in the state, met the governor with the request to dismiss the Kumaraswamy government. Congress sources said the party wanted elections to avoid horse-trading.																								In Delhi, the Congresss core committee met tonight at Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs residence. The meeting, which lasted about 30 minutes, is understood to have discussed a report sent by the governor on the evolving situation in Karnataka. 																								Among those who attended the meeting were Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and senior ministers Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh and A.K. Antony.

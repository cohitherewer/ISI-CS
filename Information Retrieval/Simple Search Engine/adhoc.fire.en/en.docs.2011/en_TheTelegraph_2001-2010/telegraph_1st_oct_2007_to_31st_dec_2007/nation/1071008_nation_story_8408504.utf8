				 Janata parivar scraps reunion
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 BJP supporters at an anti-Kumaraswamy rally in Bangalore on Sunday. (AP)																								New Delhi, Oct. 7: After the BJP-Janata Dal (Secular) split, the Janata Dal (United) has decided to end all its efforts to unite with the latter to strengthen the NDA in Karnataka.																								According to sources, the JD(U), which has five members in the Assembly, is planning to join hands with the BJP in the event of mid-term elections.																								For over a year, the JD(U) had been trying to arrive at a working relationship with the various factions of the Janata parivar, including the JD(S). The leaders of the two parties had held a few rounds of talks.																								But today, the JD(U), which concluded its national executive, attacked JD(S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda. Gowda should have honoured the power-sharing agreement with the BJP, party spokesperson Shambhu Srivastava said.																								He also cautioned the BJP against entering into a Karnataka-type arrangement in future, saying it often ended in discord. 																								This kind of a power-sharing arrangement never works. It often meets its end at the time of power transfer, Srivastava said.																								According to party sources, the JD(U), which has so far restricted its alliance with the BJP to Bihar and Jharkhand, is seriously considering a tie-up in Karnataka.																								The sources said the party leadership felt that the decision of Gowda, who belongs to the Vokkaliga community, had led to the Lingayats tilting towards the BJP. 																								So, if the JD(U) joins hands with the BJP, the NDA would get considerably strengthened in the state. This will help our party as well, a senior JD(U) leader said.

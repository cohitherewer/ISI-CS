				 Teen killed for defying Assam bandh
 OUR BUREAU				 				 Ramnath Prasad cries over the body of his son Santosh Kumar on the highway. (Above) Bandh supporters at a Tezpur rally. Picture by Eastern Projections 																								Nov. 26: A teenager was dragged out of a vehicle on National Highway 31 and hacked to death for defying an Adivasi-enforced bandh in Assam even before the blockade began today.																								The bandh was called in protest against the clashes between Adivasis and local people near the Dispur capital complex that claimed another young life on Saturday. 																								Initial reports said Saturdays victim was identified as Zachrias Tudu, a Class VI student of the Kharlung High School near Udalguri in Upper Assam.																								But Pradip Nag, the working president of the Udalguri unit of the All Adivasi Students Association of Assam, said late tonight: The identity of the deceased has not yet been confirmed as our association members in Guwahati just now informed that Tudu is alive.																								But Santosh Kumars death is confirmed. 																								The 17-year-old was speeding along National Highway 31 in a Tata Sumo along with two others to beat the 36-hour bandh called by the Adivasi association when they were waylaid around 120km from Guwahati. He was dragged out and repeatedly attacked with sharp weapons till he died.																								He should have lit my pyre but now I will have to do it, wept an inconsolable Ramnath Prasad of the Assam State Reserve Force deployed in Kokrajhar. He held on to the body of his son in front of the charred Tata Sumo. Mein kitna badnasib hoon! 																								Prasad, from Uttar Pradesh, mumbled that his eldest son would have been on his way to Uttar Pradesh to be with his mother and two siblings once he had received his monthly salary. 																								The incident occurred when an armed group of around 10 Adivasi youths stopped the Sumo by blocking the highway with boulders, just 200m from Karigaon police outpost. They then dragged out the three persons from the vehicle and attacked them with sharp weapons, killing Santosh on the spot. 																								Santosh was going to meet his father.																								The driver of the Sumo, Barun Saha, gave the attackers the slip and informed the police at Karigaon outpost. 																								The killers burnt the vehicle (AS-16 7549) before fleeing. 																								The third passenger, Anil Dey, who lost three of his fingers, has been referred to a Guwahati hospital. The rampaging youths had left Dey for dead. 																								As the bandh was to start from 5am, we decided to reach Bongaigaon before that. We were attacked with sharp weapons, said an injured Saha. 																								In Morigaon district, Bangshidhar Gowala, the personal security officer of NSUI president Bibhuti Bhushan Borthakur was wounded after a mob attacked his vehicle near Nagaon while he was going to Guwahati. Borthakur escaped unhurt. 																								The bandh was almost total in the tea gardens and Adivasi areas with National Highways 31, 32 and 37 wearing a deserted look. Buses were off the roads as incidents of stone pelting and damaging of vehicles were reported. 																								Although the bandh was partial in the urban areas, life was anything but normal because of the rumour mill working overtime to spread panic. Rumours of Adivasis marching into Guwahati to avenge Beltola saw shopkeepers downing shutters.																								The Adivasi associations activists burned effigies of Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi and other Congress leaders near Kokrajhar.

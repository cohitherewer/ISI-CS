				 CPM mum, allies seek action
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 16: The CPM greeted the high court order in the Rizwanur Rahman case with silence but allies hailed it as the victory of public opinion. 																								At tomorrows Left Front meeting, the allies are expected to seek the removal of the police officers accused of coercing Rizwanur.																								The order reflects the anger and anguish of the people. It supported the popular demand. We have also noted the courts strong observations against the government. We will raise the issue of action against the accused police officers at the meeting tomorrow, said Forward Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh. 																								Other allies like the RSP and the CPI said they would also demand the removal of police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and four other officers. 																								The administrative inaction paved the way for this order. We had been asking for it to redeem the governments credibility in the eyes of people. The courts order and observations proved again how low the level of confidence is in state agencies, RSP central secretariat member Manoj Bhattacharya said.																								CPM state secretary Biman Bose, however, refused to react without learning the details of the high court order.																								But another party leader said: We were told that the advocate-general was opposed to the removal of Prasun Mukherjee and others since that would make the plea for CBI probe stronger. But todays order proved it wrong. We will suffer more loss of face if the government delays action against the police officers.																								Advocate-general Balai Roy has ruled out appealing against the order but the party has not announced its position.																								The focus has shifted to whether action would be taken against the officers as promised by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to his predecessor Jyoti Basu. Basus aides said he would skip the meeting tomorrow.																								Party leaders like Benoy Konar and Subhas Chakraborty challenged the courts authority to order a CBI probe without the concurrence of the state government. 																								The states opposition to the CBI probe into the Chhoto Angaria massacre of 2001 is pending before a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court. 																								Another section of the party is opposed to any appeal against the order. It will be suicidal, a senior minister said.																								Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee appealed to the Prime Minister to ensure that the CBI conducted an impartial probe.

				 Visa to shoot, not see film
																								Islamabad, Nov. 26 (PTI): An Indian filmmaker who spent eight months in Pakistan to shoot a documentary on the countrys bleak classical music scene has been denied a visa to attend the screening of his movie in Karachi.																								Yousaf Saeed, who met several musical legends across Pakistan while making Khayal Darpan, said visas were not issued for research between India and Pakistan. I had to pull all sorts of strings before I could get a special visa for eight months to shoot the documentary.																								The film was screened in the southern Pakistani port city on Saturday by Safia Beyg, a prominent vocalist who runs Sampurna, an NGO that promotes classical music. 																								Saeed told The Daily Times that Khayal Darpan was an attempt to explain how classical music could be revived in Pakistan. The legendary classical music ustaads (teachers) who migrated to Pakistan have passed away... the loss is so great that it can only be repaired if strenuous efforts are made.																								The director, who won a scholarship from the Bangkok-based Asian Scholarship Foundation to research and shoot the documentary, interviewed Badey Ghulam Ali, Chote Ghulam Ali, Salamat Ali Khan and Roshan Ara Begum.																								Although his documentary focuses on vocal traditions, which dominates Indian classical music, it has not ignored developments in instrumental music in Pakistan.																								The future of classical music is not that good in India.... But in India, promoters of classical music are reintroducing classical music at the school and college levels. 																								Saeed said elitism is responsible for the decay in classical music and, unless it is made for a popular audience without diluting its basic structure, it cannot be saved from extinction in Pakistan. 																								The director said his stay in Pakistan also helped him collect enough material to argue against the superficial cultural division between the two countries.

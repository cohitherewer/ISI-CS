				 Aquatic treat for Nandan Kanan visitors

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 
				 	 Fishy tales for visitors
																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 28: The Nandan Kanan Zoological Park is set to inaugurate its exclusive aquarium building tomorrow. 
																								The world-class aquarium took Rs 53 lakh to be completed. The cost makes sense, as zoos contribute significantly to conservation of wild species, particularly for populations whose numbers are declining, explained the zoo director, Ajit Pattnaik, today. 
																								This specialised project was assigned to Idco, which came up with the project proposal, detailed plan and estimate for the 26 aquariums. This was followed by an agreement, executed by the additional president of CCF (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden of Orissa and the Idco managing director on December 1, 2003. 
																								The Ahmedabad centre for environment education (CEE), supported by the Union forests and environment ministry was roped in for the purpose. The CEE with prior experience in installing a similar aquarium at Satapada Interpretation Centre, run by Chilika Development Authority, took up the job. 
																								As many as 14 aquariums are now complete, equipped with in-situ filtration and recycling mechanism. Four among the ultra-modern glass aquariums are marine (salt water ones), while the rest are fresh water cages equipped with titanium chillers. 
																								Of the 14 aquariums; two are larger marine aquariums, two smaller marine ones, six large fresh-water aquariums and four smaller fresh water ones.
																								Marine aquariums are a big draw at any zoo, but at the same time they are very complex cages to maintain. They are expensive, too, as gadgets and components required to run an aquarium are imported, said Pattnaik. 
																								There would also be displays of education materials, through 30 translides and display boards set up with an estimated cost of Rs 10 lakh, for the zoo visitors.

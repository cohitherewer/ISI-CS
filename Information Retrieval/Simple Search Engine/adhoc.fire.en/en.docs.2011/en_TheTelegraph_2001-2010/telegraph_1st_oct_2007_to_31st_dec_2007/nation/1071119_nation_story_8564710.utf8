				 Karnataka rift 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Nov. 18: Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa today said he saw no problem in proving his majority tomorrow even as his party failed to agree to a 12-point pact that ally Janata Dal (Secular) has been insisting on.																								I dont foresee any problem at all. My government will complete its 19-month term, the BJP leader said after a meeting with H.D. Kumaraswamy of the Dal(S).																								Kumaraswamy said senior leaders, including party chief H.D. Deve Gowda, would meet ahead of the trust vote, in a sign that the two sides hadnt been able to resolve their differences. 																								The 80-member BJP needs 113 votes in the 225-member House to win the trust vote. The Dal(S) has 49 MLAs.

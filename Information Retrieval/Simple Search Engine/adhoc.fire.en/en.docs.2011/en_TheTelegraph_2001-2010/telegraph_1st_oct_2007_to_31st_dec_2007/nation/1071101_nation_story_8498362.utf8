				 Abuse shivers over heartland crime bill
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mayavati																								Lucknow, Oct. 31: The Mayavati government today introduced a bill to prevent, tackle and control organised crime in Uttar Pradesh and proposed death as the maximum penalty.																								Modelled on a similar law in Maharashtra, the bill has stirred memories of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, with the chief ministers detractors claiming she might use it selectively against her political opponents.																								According to the bill, organised crime would include terrorist activities, contract killings, kidnapping for ransom, forcibly obtaining government tenders, occupying land through forgery or by force, money laundering, human trafficking and manufacture and smuggling of spurious drugs.																								A list of people indulging in such activities would be kept at police stations and the government would not provide police cover to members of such crime syndicates, the bill said. This is being seen as a move to withdraw security to politicians with criminal antecedents.																								The bill said the government feared there was a nexus between crime syndicates and militant outfits in the state. Efforts would be made to stub out such activity and penalties could range from five years in jail to death and a minimum fine of Rs 5 lakh.																								The roots of organised crime in Uttar Pradesh are very deep. An effective act is necessary to curb and control it, chief minister Mayavati said at a news conference. Some people support criminals covertly and manage their benami property. Such people would now be dealt with firmly.																								The bill empowers the state government to form special fast-track courts in consultation with the high court to try offences. Cases would be heard on a day-to-day basis and adjournments allowed only in rare instances.																								The government would also set up a state organised crime control authority with powers to cancel land contracts grabbed forcibly.																								Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Prashant Kumar Mishra said the bill would be sent to the President for approval because some of its provisions overlapped with those in the Criminal Procedure Code.																								Samajwadi Party state secretary R.S. Das said the bill, which will be named the Uttar Pradesh Control of Organised Crime Act once it is passed,sounds like an alternative to the IPC as it appears to have covered all major crimes. We wish it is not used only against the political opponents Mayavati keeps threatening to send to jail.																								BJP state secretary Ramapati Tripathi said he feared the bill could be abused.

 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																On strong wicket at fashion bash				 																																																										His performance in the Test matches against India remains to be seen, but Shoaib Rawalpindi Express Akhtar bowled over sections of Delhis fashion enthusiasts even before a ball had been bowled in the series. 				 																																																										Not with his characteristic swagger, nor with his stylish goggles, but with the attention he gave each and every autograph-seeker at an event recently. 				 																																																										Shoaib and the rest of the Pakistan cricket team took a day off from practice to launch a mens fashion showroom in Noida. Called Ministry of Fashion, the showroom boasts apparel from top international design houses. The outlet plans to expand to other cities, besides opening more branches in Delhi and the National Capital Region. Red Valentino, Alexander McQueen, Thierry Mugler, Roberto Botticelli and several other renowned brands have committed their labels to the showroom. 				 																																																										But the spotlight was clearly on the Pakistan team during the launch with fans rushing for autographs and photos with the stars. Some of the cricketers tried the apparel  much brighter than their whites in the Test matches. 				 																Short-haul rides easier				 																																																										Hopping in and out of BEST buses will not pinch pockets anymore.				 																																																										The state-owned company last week decided to slash short-distance fares by Re 1 to Rs 3 in a move that officials believe will benefit over 45 per cent of the passengers.				 																																																										To make up for the loss, ticket prices for longer distances will be raised by a minimum of 50 paise to Rs 6.				 																																																										This fare restructuring is being done to keep short-distance passengers from opting for auto-rickshaws and other modes of conveyance, BEST chief Sanjay Potnis said.				 																																																										The new rates will come into effect after the regional transport authority puts its seal on the changes, which will benefit the large number of people who use the buses to reach the nearest railway station from their homes.				 																MP jumps into channel fray				 																																																										If its a new launch anywhere in the country, chances are high that you will be tuned to one in Chennai.				 																																																										Tamil Nadus politicians are over and done with engineering colleges, their earlier pet projects. Now, the action  business and politics  has shifted to channels.				 																																																										The latest to hit the airwaves is Mega TV, floated by Salem MP K.V. Thankkabalu, a Congress old-timer who had worked closely with Sanjay Gandhi.				 																																																										It is hard to delink the channel from its owners legacy. The launch was held on November 19, Indira Gandhis birth anniversary. The logo resembles the Congress flag but since it isnt an exact replica of the Tricolour, the lawmaker is unlikely to get tied up in legal knots. Both Sonia Gandhi and M. Karunanidhi blessed the launch.				 																																																										Thankkabalus isnt the only channel waiting in the wings. Another waiting to enter the picture is a network planned by Vasanth Kumar, also from the Congress.				 																																																										Kumar, who runs retail chain Vasanth and Company, believes a channel will give his image a boost.				 																Power punch				 																																																										The capitals demolition men are often on shaky ground. And sometimes, the threat can come from within. 				 																																																										An MCD engineer getting an illegal construction torn down was allegedly beaten up by a woman councillor.				 																																																										Rekha Gupta, who represents Pitampura (North) and heads the MCDs women and children panel, is accused of thrashing Manoj Shah as he was supervising the operation. Rekha later tried to settle the issue amicably but Shah was determined to have her prosecuted. 				 																																																	Delhi: Musician and painter Vijay Kant presents Blue Jazz, a collection of paintings in a solo exhibition at the Poorva Sanskritik Kendra (PSK) this Wednesday. The venue is located at the district centre, 14 Laxmi Nagar, Vikas Marg, in east Delhi. Time: 12pm to and 8 pm.

				 Police in war zone after 10 months
 							 - Two officers enter Nandigram with CRPF IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI				 	 Pradhan and Mondal in Nandigram. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Nandigram, Nov. 14: Bengal police today entered Nandigram for the first time in over 10 months since violence broke on January 3.																								Accompanied by gun-toting CRPF personnel, two officers of Nandigram police station nervously stepped into Garchakraberia and Sonachura this afternoon.																								Sub-inspectors Krishnendu Pradhan and Pradip Mondal walked slowly, eyes trained on villagers who came out of their homes at the sight of the CRPF personnel.																								The last time I came here was on January 3, the day trouble broke. After that, there were barricades all over the area and police were denied entry. Things worsened after the police firing on March 14, Mondal said.																								Along with his senior Pradhan, Mondal stopped outside a house and knocked. A man came out and the trio exchanged glances. The man, later identified as Abu Islam, 45, shook hands with the officers.																								Bhalo aachhen? Mondal asked, and the man nodded, panic on his face. Villagers standing nearby whispered in each others ears. The officers then proceeded towards Garchakraberia School.																								The guns have fallen silent but the situation is still tense. We know so many villagers and we can make out from their faces. Lets hope that things get back to normal, Pradhan said.																								I still cannot believe I am inside Garchakraberia, he said as the team walked all the way from the bazaar to the farthest point in Garchakraberia.																								Several villagers spoke in hushed tones at the sight of the policemen.																								Things are worse now. We are living in fear but cannot say anything. We do not have faith in policemen as they opened fire on us and killed 14 persons. They work on the instructions of CPM leaders, a bearded man said.																								The next stop was Sonachura bazaar, about 1km from Bhangabera bridge, where police had opened fire on March 14. People who had come to buy vegetables looked scared as the policemen alighted from the CRPF vehicle and began moving around.																								Soon after, the CRPF personnel staged a flag march. The villagers then started coming up and speaking to DIG (CRPF) Alok Raj.																								Mondal and Pradhan went up to a shop-owner who recognised them. When Pradhan held his hand and asked how he was, he took a step back. People are still scared. Their eyes say it all, Pradhan said.

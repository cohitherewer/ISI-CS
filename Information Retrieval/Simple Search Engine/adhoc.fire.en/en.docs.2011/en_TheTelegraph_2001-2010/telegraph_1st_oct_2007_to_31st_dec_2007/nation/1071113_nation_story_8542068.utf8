 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A victory march in Nandigram on Monday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Nandigram, Nov. 12: Nandigram police said they were yet to find evidence to prove hardcore Maoists were present in Nandigram.																								It seems students, probably influenced by Maoists, were present. A few Naxalites might have trained villagers, especially in Sonachura, to fight with guns and bombs. But we have not found evidence of large-scale presence of Maoists, an officer of Khejuri police station said. 																								He added that some students were still holed up in Sonachura and Garchakraberia and were expected to leave soon. The rest fled after the CPM cadres launched the offensive on Monday night. 																								Most of them escaped after crossing the Talpati canal on Tuesday and Wednesday, while some of them could not go because of continuous firing by the CPM cadres. They seem be hiding somewhere, waiting for an opportunity to leave. The CRPF has arrived and the students can now move out without fear of being attacked, the officer said this evening.																								The cadres, who have regained control of the entire Nandigram, had launched a massive hunt for the Maoists after reclaiming Sonachura yesterday but could not find even one till late tonight. We have found the base where they provided the training. We also seized some bombs and revolvers but not much ammunition, a CPM source said.																								The CPM source echoed the police officer who felt that students could be involved. We raided a house where Maoists sympathisers, basically university students, used to hold meetings. Some women members had also accompanied them and trained the villagers. We found Maoist literature as well as some revolvers but there was no sophisticated weapon. It seems they have fled, realising they could not put up enough resistance this time, he said. 																								Another officer of Nandigram police station said some retired soldiers in the area could have helped the students give the villagers basic tips on handling weapons. We have information that some hardcore Maoists had come to Nandigram after the March 14 firing and stayed for a week. They provided arms but did not take part in the waves of clashes that took place later.																								Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee said: If the Maoists are there, they should be produced before the media.

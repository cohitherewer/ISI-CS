 The Buzz in Big Cities 
Boardroom boys at play				 																																																										The boardroom boys were out, matching their wits and stamina to achieve goals other than annual growth targets. 				 																																																										These executives showed that they dont just work, they play, too. They also demonstrated that companies could think of games other than cricket if they want to sponsor sports.				 																																																										Last week saw some unlikely tie-ups between companies and sports, with one firm bringing out cutting-edge technology sponsoring a game that dates back to feudal times, and hoteliers coming out for a spot of cricket. 				 																																																										The Carlsson group of hotels organised a seven-a-side cricket tournament between executives from its various brands and affiliates across India. The group owns the Regent, Radisson and Park Plaza hotels, several inns as well as the popular restaurant T.G.I. Fridays. 				 																																																										And Hewlett-Packard, one of the worlds top computer hardware companies was seen sponsoring a polo tournament.				 																																																										The polo tournament, the Indian Open Polo Championship 2007, was held at the Jaipur Polo Grounds opposite the Prime Ministers residence, on November 18. A special-edition laptop was released by Hewlett-Packard on the occasion. On the etiquette highway				 																																																										Mumbais cab rides could get safer, smoother and friendlier.				 																																																										The taxi drivers who keep much of the city on the move are shifting gears on the way they go about their business. Recently, many signed up for etiquette classes.				 																																																										If the lessons are picked up well, Mumbaikars can hope to get past rude, tobacco-chewing cab drivers who race their way unsteadily to their destination.				 																																																										The training sessions, organised by the regional transport authority with a private fleet operator, did not appear anything short of a conference, with the classes held in a corporate office and for well-dressed pupils.				 																																																										The tips were related to personal hygiene, cautious driving, resetting meters, not adjusting the rear-view mirror when a female passenger gets in, not smoking or chewing tobacco and playing music of the customers choice. Cops on site to help out				 																																																										Maharashtra police have hit the cyber trail to reach out to people.				 																																																										The force has set up an interactive website that is meant to serve as a bridge between the public and the lawkeepers.				 																																																										Through the initiative, the officers expect to stay connected to police stations, numbering more than 960, across the state. 				 																																																										The site will have updated and detailed information about missing persons, those arrested, jail inmates, unidentified dead bodies and even stolen vehicles.				 																																																										Every police station has been instructed and given the equipment necessary to update data on the website. If they cant do it because of power shortages or connectivity problems, they will have to inform the district police headquarters, said DIG (establishments) Sanjay Barve, who has been working on the project for the past year.				 																																																										The site, www.mahapolice.gov.in, will also feature a search engine that will throw up information on a variety of areas. Applications can be sent online to district police chiefs or commissioners and complaints, even anonymous ones, about problems posted on the portal.Villa rush				 																																																										Move over luxury apartments, its time for million-dollar villas.				 																																																										Hyderabads software surge has created enough room for developers to set up a Singapore-lifestyle villa project.				 																																																										The Rs 480-crore project, with 350 luxury villas designed by Singapores Surbana, is being set up by Bangalores Alliance group. Spread over 60 acres, the villas will come up on plots of 2,400sqft to 6,000sqft. Prices range from Rs 80 lakh and Rs 2 crore. 				 																																																	Delhi: Theatre legend Habib Tanvir presents his classic play, Charandas Chor, at Sarojini Nagars Navyug School this Saturday. The show begins at 11am. Entry is free. The play is organised by Spicmacay as a part of their Viraasat festival.

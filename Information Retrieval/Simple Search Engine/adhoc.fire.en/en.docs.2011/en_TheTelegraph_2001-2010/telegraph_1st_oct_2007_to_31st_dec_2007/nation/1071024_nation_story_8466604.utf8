				 To China, in a new role
 JYOTI MALHOTRA				 	 Sonia Gandhi																								New Delhi, Oct. 23: Nineteen years after travelling to China as the Prime Ministers wife, Sonia Gandhi will visit the northern neighbour this week as the power behind the current Prime Minister.																								With the October 25-29 trip, she will be ensuring she makes her presence felt on the international stage. Sonias meetings with President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and key members of the newly strengthened politburo on October 26 will be closely watched.																								Whatever the real or presumed tension between India and China in recent months, especially over the Indo-US nuclear deal, signals from the Sonia-Hu meeting are likely to shape the relationship between Asias biggest powers in the near future.																								Sonia will be accompanied by son Rahul, Congress general secretary Prithviraj Chavan, junior foreign minister Anand Sharma and the head of the Congresss foreign affairs cell, Karan Singh.																								She and Rajiv had been the toast of Beijing in December 1988. That was the first high-level visit between the two countries since Zhou Enlai came to India in 1960, and it buried the trauma of the 1962 war.																								Deng Xiaoping, who went out of his way to warmly welcome Rajiv and Sonia at the time, had announced to the world media that the meeting between the youngest leader in Asia and the oldest leader in Asia would herald the Asian century.																								Rajiv had delivered a speech at one of Beijings two major universities, the Qinghua University (Vajpayee, during his China visit in 2003, spoke at the other one, Peking University). Sonia will address the Qinghua University on October 27.																								The visit is a reaffirmation of party ties between the Congress and the Chinese Communist Party. Sonia and Hu are unlikely to discuss bilateral issues such as Chinas possible support if and when the nuclear deal comes to the Nuclear Suppliers Group, or even the boundary discussions. Yet Sonias meetings with the Chinese leadership will impact on the bilateral relationship.The Congress president has made quiet strides over the last few months from the domestic stage to the international arena.																								Early on and true to type, she preferred travelling to low-profile think tanks, for instance in the Netherlands.

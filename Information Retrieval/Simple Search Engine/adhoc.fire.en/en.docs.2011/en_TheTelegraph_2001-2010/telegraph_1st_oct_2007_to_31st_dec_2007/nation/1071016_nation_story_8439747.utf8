				 Police focus on Kashmir angle
 GAJINDER SINGH AND NISHIT DHOLABHAI 				 	 A blast survivor at a hospital in Ludhiana on Monday. (PTI)																								Chandigarh/New Delhi, Oct. 15: Police are investigating whether militants have joined hands with remnants of pro-Khalistan groups to carry out last nights bomb attack in a Ludhiana multiplex.																								State police chief N.P.S. Aulakh didnt specify the group behind the attack, which killed six persons and injured over 30, but a senior officer suggested that splinter groups fighting for Khalistan, like the Babbar Khalsa, were being investigated for their possible role in the blast.																								We are yet to pinpoint the group. We cant say anything at the moment as investigations are yet to be completed, Aulakh said, asked whether he believed the Babbar Khalsa was involved.																								But another officer suggested that investigators were looking at the possibility. We are examining if Khalistani splinter groups have joined hands with Kashmiri terrorist organisations to trigger the explosion. But it is too early to link them, the officer said.																								The blast at Shingar cinema has raised fears of a renewed attempt by terror groups to target migrants, who formed the bulk of victims and the injured in the attack.																								Mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the migrants  engaged as farmhands or in unskilled jobs in industrial units  have been accused by Sikh radical leaders like Simranjit Singh Mann of usurping jobs by working at wages lower than those that need to be paid to local residents.																								At the height of the militancy during the 80s and early 90s, the migrants had fallen prey to Khalistani militants bullets. Twelve labourers working on the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal in Morinda were mowed down in 1989. Four years later, Khalistan Commando Force activists killed 19 at Ajnala, not far from Amritsar. The deaths had sparked an exodus of migrant labourers.																								Chief minister Parkash Singh Badal today visited the injured in the civil hospital and Christian Medical College. Asked whether the blast was aimed at scaring away the migrants, he said he would wait for the probe to be complete. He denied suggestions that the blast hinted at a revival of terrorism. 																								Blame game begins																								The multiplex attack has triggered a blame game between the Congress-ruled Centre and the Akali Dal-led Punjab government. 																								Junior home minister Sriprakash Jaiswal criticised the Punjab government for not being able to prevent the attack despite reminders from the Centre. They were not alert enough, Jaiswal said. 																								However, a senior minister in the Badal government said there were no inputs from the Centre.

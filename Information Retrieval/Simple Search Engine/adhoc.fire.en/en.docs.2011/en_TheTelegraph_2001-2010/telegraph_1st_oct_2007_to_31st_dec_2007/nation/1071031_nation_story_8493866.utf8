				 $5-million award for fired NRI
																								Silicon Valley, Oct. 30 (PTI): An Indian engineer who was fired after she complained about her seniors racist conduct has been awarded $5.5 million by a San Francisco federal jury.																								The jury found Kiran Pandes former employer Chevron liable for wrongful termination and retaliation and ruled that she be given around $3 million for past and future economic losses, and $2.5 million in punitive damages.																								Indian-born Pande, who holds a PhD in petroleum engineering from Stanford University, was fired by Chevron in late 2003 after 15 years with the company.																								After a three-week trial on incidents that occurred between September 2000 and December 2003, the jury found that Chevron retaliated after Pande complained about discrimination and fired her for reasons that violated a public policy.																								Chevron hired Pande as a research engineer in 1988. From 2001, Pande faced racist remarks and discrimination from her senior Rex Mitchell, who is now the companys chief compliance officer, according to her complaint filed in a California court.

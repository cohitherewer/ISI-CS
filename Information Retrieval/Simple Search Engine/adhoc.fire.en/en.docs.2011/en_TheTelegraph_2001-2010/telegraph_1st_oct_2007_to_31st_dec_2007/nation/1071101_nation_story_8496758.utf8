				 Snehasish, MLA quizzed by CBI
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Snehasish Ganguly (right) with a CBI official in Calcutta. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								Calcutta, Oct. 31: Snehasish Ganguly was today questioned by the CBI for over an hour in the Rizwanur Rahman case and he confidently fielded all questions on his links with the Todis, sources said.																								Dressed in a light blue shirt and deep blue trousers, Snehasish apparently told the CBI how he had introduced Ashok Todi, the father of Rizwanurs widow Priyanka, to former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.																								Snehasish spelt out how he had received a request from Pradip Todi, Ashoks brother, asking him to put him on to Prasun Mukherjee, using his CAB contacts. Snehasish said he introduced Todi to Mukherjee, a CBI insider said.																								Older brother of former India skipper Sourav Ganguly, Snehasish is the assistant secretary of the Cricket Association of Bengal, of which Mukherjee is the president.																								Snehasish was escorted into the interrogation room at Nizam Palace around 11am by DIG (CBI) Satish Golcha and remained closeted till 12.10pm. He was asked how long he had known the Todis and if he had any business relationship with them, the sources said.																								The CBI also apparently tapped Snehasish on whether the Todis had paid him any money for his help and whether he had used his contacts to influence the top cops.																								The sleuths cross-questioned the former cricketer on his statement to the CID before taking him to the room where Ashok Todi was being questioned. After both were quizzed together, Snehasish was allowed to leave.																								Snehasish Ganguly was interrogated along with others because we wanted to clarify certain things. It would not be proper for me to go into the details of the interrogation, CBI joint director Arun Kumar said.																								Krishnendu Das, a former sub-inspector of police in the detective department, was not let off as easily as Snehasish. Brought in for questioning at the same time, Das was quizzed till 7.15pm on why he had threatened Rizwanur, whether he knew Ashok Todi and Priyankas uncle Anil Saraogi and if he was following a brief from his superiors.																								This is the second time Das has been questioned. The CBI joint director claimed it was to collect a few documents.																								Ballygunge MLA Javed Khan walked out of the interrogation room a little before Das, after facing the CBI sleuths from around 5pm. But he refused to give anything away.																								I visited the Rahmans on September 7 when they asked me to intervene. I will not speak out on which police officer asked me to step in. I have told the CBI everything in detail, he said.

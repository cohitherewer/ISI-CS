				 IAEA boss fights to save nuke deal
 JYOTI MALHOTRA 				 	 Manmohan Singh																								New Delhi, Oct. 11: IAEA director-general Mohammed ElBaradei has possibly done more to promote the nuclear deal in the last couple of days than anybody in the government, with the exception of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has in the last couple of years.																								In his meetings with the Indian leadership, the IAEA chief has been so gung-ho that he is believed to have indicated that if the deal clears the IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group  and even if it fails an up-down (yes/no) vote in the US Congress later  India will still be able to engage in nuclear commerce with the rest of the world. 																								That is because once India clears the restrictions imposed by the 45-member NSG on nuclear commerce, it can simply go ahead and ignore what the US Congress does or doesnt do.																								The government has been trying to sell this formula at its meetings with its Left partners, but the rising distrust between the two sides has precluded any agreement so far. 																								It has now taken El Baradei, an Egyptian, to drive home the same point. The IAEA chief has been strongly criticised by the US before and after it invaded Iraq, and more recently, on the Iran crisis.																								ElBaradei met the Prime Minister over lunch today and had a separate meeting with national security adviser M.K. Narayanan. He had met foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon yesterday. 																								After his meeting with Mukherjee, ElBaradei said the nuclear deal would liberate India from the stranglehold of the sanctions that have always been imposed on the countrys civilian nuclear regime. India should participate as an equal partner and recipient in the NSG-controlled nuclear commerce worldwide.

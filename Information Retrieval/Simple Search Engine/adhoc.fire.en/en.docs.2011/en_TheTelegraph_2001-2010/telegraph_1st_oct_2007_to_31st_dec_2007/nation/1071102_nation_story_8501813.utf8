				 Jaswant feast for Raje rebels
 RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR																								Jaipur, Nov. 1: Jaswant Singh hosted state BJP dissidents to lunch at his village home yesterday, strengthening speculation that he is emerging as the point man for baiters of chief minister Vasundhara Raje.																								Neither Raje nor any of her loyalists was invited to the family feast at the senior BJP leaders home in Jasol, Barmer.																								Jaswant explained the chief ministers omission, saying: In such religious ceremonies called riwan, women are not invited.																								The former Union minister denied reports that he had followed the Marwar tradition of feeding the guests opium (kesar manuhar). Yesterday at my function, no opium was served. It was a mix of gangajal, kesar, jaggery and tea, he said.																								Most of the guests, who included senior minister Ghanshyam Tiwari and MP Kailash Meghwal, said they had come only for the feast and did not have politics on their mind. But the long discussions  with Jaswants son and Barmer MP Manvendra, too, present  have led to talk about a possible confrontation with the chief minister over demands to remove state BJP president Mahesh Sharma, a Raje loyalist.																								Chief whip Mahavir Prasad Jain, a guest, said: The meeting and lunch were good but we will let our grievances be known directly to leaders in Delhi.																								Sources said the dissidents were looking at Jaswant to get their complaints against the chief minister and Sharma across to the central leadership, and that Jaswant had promised to do so.

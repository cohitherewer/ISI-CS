				 Info rap amp; penalty on IIT
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 21: The Central Information Commission has rapped the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, for denying information on selection of OBCs as faculty to a former member of Parliament.																								The IIT has been ordered to pay the airfare of K.N. Murukes, who represented Tamil Nadus Karur in the 10th Lok Sabha. Its a small victory, the fact that IIT is being penalised. But they still havent provided the information Id asked for, Murukes told The Telegraph.																								Murukes had asked the IIT for details of its appointment procedures, specifically those related to OBC applicants. Under the right to information act, all applications seeking information must be replied to within 30 days. Under special circumstances, the public authority can take up to 45 days. 																								The IIT, however, took 90 days to respond and, when it did, the reply was incomplete, the information commission concluded.																								In addition to Murukess travel expenses, the institute may have to shell out as much as Rs 25,000 as fine for the delay. The commission has issued a showcause notice to the IIT seeking an explanation.

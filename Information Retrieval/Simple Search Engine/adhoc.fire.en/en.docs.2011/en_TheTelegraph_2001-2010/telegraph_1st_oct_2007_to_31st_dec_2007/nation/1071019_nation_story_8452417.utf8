				 Dissent in Cong over BJP rebels
 OUR BUREAU 				 	 Zadaphia: In trouble																								Ahmedabad/New Delhi, Oct. 18: As the Congress weighs whether to open the door to BJP rebels in Gujarat, not everyone in the partys state unit is happy.																								Amreli in Saurashtra, a traditional BJP stronghold, has been the centre of the rebellion against Narendra Modi with three of its five MLAs having revolted. 																								The Congress should have been happy that the BJP bastion  the party won five of the six seats here in 2002  has crumbled. Instead, grassroots workers have written an angry letter to district Congress president C. Thakursinh threatening that they would stop working for the party or might even join the BJP. 																								The letter, sent yesterday, warned the party leadership against ignoring loyal workers and giving tickets to BJP rebels expected to cross over to the Congress after Dussehra. 																								Human rights activists Teesta Setalvad and Shabnam Hashmi have also petitioned the Congress not to admit Gordhan Zadaphia and those like him and warned that if it did, its secular underpinnings would be damaged throughout the country. 																								Zadaphia, who was home minister during the 2002 riots and is blamed for the violence along with Modi, is one of the rebel leaders eyeing entry into the Congress.																								Congress leaders Prithviraj Chavan and B.K. Hari Prasad, who is in charge of Gujarat, will be in Vadodara and Surat till tomorrow. 																								There are cracks in the BJP but only after the local leaders recommend something, the high command will discuss and decide, spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said. 																								Hari Prasad and Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel are the core decision-makers.																								Soma Patel, a rebel BJP MP who plans to join the Congress with another MP, Vallabh Kathiria, and 11 MLAs, said he had spoken to Patel. There is no problem as the Congress has also realised that it needs us as much as we need them to defeat Modi, our common enemy, he said.																								But Rajkot-based Congress general secretary Kashmira Nathwani confirmed resentment in the state unit. 																								After receiving the letter, Congress legislature party leader Arjun Modhwadia and state unit chief Bharatsinh Solanki held late-night talks to pacify the workers.																								BJP spokesperson Vijay Rupani has also confirmed that his party has thrown open its doors to Congress workers who want to join. 																								In Delhi, the Congress central leadership has yet to take a decision on the mixed bag of BJP rebels. While Zadaphia is riot-tainted, another prominent rebel leader, Suresh Mehta, is seen as a moderate. 																								Sources said the broad view is to assess each on their own merits and align with those thought to be winnable.

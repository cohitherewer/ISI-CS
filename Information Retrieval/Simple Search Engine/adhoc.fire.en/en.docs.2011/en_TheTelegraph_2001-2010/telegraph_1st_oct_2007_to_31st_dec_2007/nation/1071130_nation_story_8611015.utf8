				 Nayachar sour grapes for Nandi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 29: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has said Nayachar would one day make Nandigram realise its mistake.																								Addressing a CPM rally in South 24-Parganas, Bhattacharjee said the people of Nandigram would one day regret their refusal to accept a chemical hub. 																								The people of Nandigram would have benefited a lot if the chemical hub was set up there. But they will realise their mistake when the hub comes up at Nayachar (an island off Haldia). See, what a remarkable transformation Haldia has undergone over the years with petrochemical industries being set up there, he said. 																								In February itself, I said that the hub would not come up in Nandigram as the people there did not want it. So why has the violence and killings continued there? 																								The chief minister said he would not allow an Assam-like situation to prevail in Bengal. Tell me, what is going on in Assam? Either there is flood or violence. Do we want here an Assam-like situation where violence is a regular event? 																								Bhattacharjee criticised the Opposition for taking Maoists to Nandigram. See how dangerous it is. The so-called Maoists have infiltrated Nandigram and unleashed violence. Can we allow such things to happen in Bengal? he asked.																								He attacked the Opposition for criticising him for handing over land to the Tatas for their small car plant in Singur, where over 4,000 people will get jobs.

				 Bandh ban murmur
 OUR BUREAU																								Sept. 30: A Supreme Court order saying shutdowns not directed against specific organisations are illegal ruffled the Lefts feathers today but the Congress agreed that bandhs were best avoided.																								Congress media cell chief Veerappa Moily said from Moscow that bandhs cause serious social, political and economic instability.																								Whatever the cause, legitimate or illegitimate, bandhs should be avoided. On the International Day of Non-Violence (October 2) to mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, it is more appropriate that we should shun bandhs, he said.																								But CPI secretary D. Raja said: I dont know how the judiciary can define this (strikes as opposed to bandhs). Then wheres the scope for political parties to express their views in a democracy?																								The interim court order virtually defines bandhs, banned since 1998, distinguishing them from strikes and hartals that have a much narrower scope and are legal. Political parties are used to calling bandhs and passing them off as strikes.																								Some Left leaders continued to blur the bandh-strike distinction when asked for comments on the court order.																								M.K. Pandhe, the president of the CPM labour arm Citu, said: The Supreme Court order is undemocratic. The people have the right to strike.																								What can the apex court do if employees resort to a strike to press their demands? Can the court arrest five lakh people for resorting to a strike? CPM central committee member Benoy Konar asked. 																								Most other parties confined their comments to the specific context of the order  a restraint on the DMK-led alliance from observing a Tamil Nadu bandh tomorrow. The DMK wants the Centre to speed up the Sethusamudram ship canal project.																								The BJP, opposed to the project, hoped Ram would bestow good sense on the DMK.																								They should now think of an alternative alignment so that the project can go through without touching the Ram setu, spokesperson Prakash Javdekar said.																								ADMK member N. Jothi, whose party had moved the apex court against the bandh, praised the order as remedying the situation.																								But Raja said: People have been resorting to various forms of protest since our freedom movement. How can the court suddenly say that bandhs are illegal? We cant accept that. Political parties now have to get together and find a way out of this.																								The court, while passing the order, had observed that the rights of individuals are superior to those of political parties.

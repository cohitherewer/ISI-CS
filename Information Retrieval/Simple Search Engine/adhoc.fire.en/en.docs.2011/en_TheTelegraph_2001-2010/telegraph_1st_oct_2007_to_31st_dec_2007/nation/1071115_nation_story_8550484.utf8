				 Modi foxes rival with lollipop to son
 BASANT RAWAT				 				 Keshubhai Patel, Narendra Modi: Howzat? 																								Ahmedabad, Nov. 14: If you cant tame your rival, tempt is son.																								Narendra Modi has done just that  and appears to have succeeded in luring away dissident leader Keshubhai Patels son Bharat to his side in a body blow to the BJP rebel camp in election-bound Gujarat.																								The party high command came up with an offer that Keshubhais ambitious son has not refused yet: the post of deputy chief minister if the BJP returns to power in the December polls.																								But Bharat has to contest as a party candidate, not as an Independent.																								The bait seems to have worked.																								Bharat said he had not made up his mind, but if he did contest the polls, it would be as a BJP candidate. There is absolutely no doubt about it, he said. Im a loyal BJP member.																								Just four weeks ago, he had said he had decided to contest as an Independent candidate from Visavadar, in Junagadh, which his father, a former chief minister, represented twice. 																								That was after Keshubhai had made it clear he would not campaign for the BJP, though he would remain in the party.																								Bharat, however, denied that the party had promised to make him Modis deputy if the BJP won, but confirmed that he had been approached.																								If Bharat had taken the field as an Independent, it would have hit the ruling BJP hard. It would have implied that Keshubhai, an undisputed leader of the Patel community, was no longer with the party.																								But the chief minister appears to have turned the tables on his main rival. Keshubhai is learnt to be so miffed that he has reportedly told his son to do whatever he likes.																								Bharat said his father was really upset. That is my dilemma, he added.																								Dhiru Gajera, a vocal dissident leader, refused comment, saying he had not spoken to Bharat and so would not like to react.																								It makes no difference to us, said senior Congress leader Hasmukh Patel, who tried to play down the development. The Congress will field its candidate against Bharat Patel.																								Sources said the question now was whether Keshubhai would canvass for his son or stick to his earlier decision of not campaigning for the BJP.																								Bharat, who was vice-president of the BJPs youth wing in 2002, is also clueless about what his father would do.																								He said he wanted to fight the last polls but his father prevailed upon him not to. He wanted me to establish my business before I took the plunge. Now that I have established my business, I want to fight the upcoming election, he said.																								Sources in Modis camp said if Bharat contested as a BJP candidate, it would mean a split in the Keshubhai family. It would also show that not all Patels were with the dissidents.																								Rebel sources, however, said they were not surprised as Modi was an expert in turning family members against each other for political gain.																								They claimed industry minister Anil Patel was turned against his brother Arvind, who is now a rebel.

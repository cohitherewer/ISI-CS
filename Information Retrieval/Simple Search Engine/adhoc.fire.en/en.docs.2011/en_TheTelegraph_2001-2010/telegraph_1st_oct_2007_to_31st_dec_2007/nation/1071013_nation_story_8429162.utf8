				 Maya plugs Amit escape route
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Amitabh at Siddhivinayak temple on Friday. (Fotocorp)																								Lucknow, Oct. 12: The Mayavati government today blocked Amitabh Bachchans efforts to strike a deal with a panchayat to escape criminal prosecution in the Barabanki land case.																								Bachchan had accepted an offer from the Daulatpur gram sabha, which owns the plot he is accused of buying through forged documents, to give up his claim on the land and escape criminal charges.																								The government, however, threw a spanner in the works, saying the gram sabha was not authorised to decide whether the actor should be prosecuted or not.																								The Faizabad commissioner had cancelled the land allotment to Bachchan, ruling the plot had been bought through forgery, but the high court had stayed the order on an appeal from the actor.																								As the case dragged on for four months, gram sabha lawyer R.N. Gupta yesterday offered Bachchan the deal as a birthday gift.																								The land belongs legally to us. In case Bachchan stakes no claim to it, it will come back to us. In that case we will not file any criminal case against him, Gupta told the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court.																								Bachchans lawyers filed an affidavit today that said: Honouring the argument made by the gram sabha lawyer, we would make it clear that our client Amitabh Bachchan would not stake any claim on the land any more.																								The affidavit also sought permission to withdraw the appeal against the Faizabad commissioners judgment and end the lawsuit, Bachchans counsel Gaurav Bhatia said.																								When the case came up for hearing this afternoon, Justice A.N. Verma asked the gram sabha lawyer if his offer still stood. Gupta said it did.																								But around 3pm, state government counsel D.K. Upadhyay filed another affidavit.																								The land might have been owned by a gram sabha in Barabanki but the records that were tampered with in connection with the alleged sale belonged to the state government, it said.

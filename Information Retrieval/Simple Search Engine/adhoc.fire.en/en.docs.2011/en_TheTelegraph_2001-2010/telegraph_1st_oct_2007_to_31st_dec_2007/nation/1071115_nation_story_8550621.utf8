				 1000 channels to surf amp; learn
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI																								New Delhi, Nov. 14: India is set for an unprecedented expansion of its distance education programme through television.																								An agreement between the human resource development ministry and the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) aims to take different courses, prepared by institutions like the IITs and IIMs, to every home. 																								Without a serious pinch to the pocket, television viewers will soon be able surf a thousand channels, each offering a different course. 																								The agreement will be operationalised under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, senior HRD ministry officials have told The Telegraph. 																								Forty new transponders  transmitters and receivers  will be provided by Isro for the programme, in addition to the 12 that are currently on board Edusat, Indias lone satellite that transmits education programmes, sources in the HRD ministry said. 																								A second satellite that Isro hopes to launch by end-2008 will share the burden of the 40 transponders with Edusat. 																								Currently, no complete courses are offered through Edusat. The 12 transponders offer individual lectures on different subjects without any scope for repeat telecasts.																								Now, there will be channels dedicated to specific courses that will run through the year, like episodes of a soap opera, the sources said. 																								Like the soaps, there will be repeats of each episode, they added.																								Why would anyone use Edusat lectures as they are right now? You wouldnt learn any subject based on one lecture. Now, the thousand channels will allow students to study a complete course on television, a source said. 																								Edusat channels currently require a separate dish, which costs more than Rs 1 lakh. 																								Under the new plan, users will only need a receive-only-transmitter, a device that costs around Rs 2,500.

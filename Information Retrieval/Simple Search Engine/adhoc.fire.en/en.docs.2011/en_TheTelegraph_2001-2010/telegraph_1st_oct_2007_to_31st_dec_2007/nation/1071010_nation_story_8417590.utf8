				 Confused soldiers kill colleagues
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Imphal, Oct. 9: A column of soldiers on counter-insurgency duty mistook another for militants in the darkness of night, gunning down two of their colleagues.																								The incident occurred around 3am today at Kakching Khunou Lamkhai in Thoubal, 32km from the Manipur capital, after seven columns of the Assam Rifles 21 Battalion converged from different directions.																								As they advanced noiselessly in the dark, a moment of confusion led soldiers in one of the ambush units to react to movements on the opposite side with a volley of gunfire.																								The other unit retaliated instantly, turning an elaborately planned operation against militants of the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak) into target-shooting among themselves.																								By the time either side realised its mistake, havildar Satpal Singh and rifleman Dharampal Singh lay dead. Two riflemen, Ramesh Kumar and Man Bahadur, were critically wounded.																								An Assam Rifles spokesman, Major Shamsher Jung, said a misunderstanding had led to the exchange of fire. The troops found it difficult to recognise one another in pitch darkness. It was purely a case of mistaken identity.																								Kumar and Bahadur were shifted to the army hospital at Leimakhong, the headquarters of the 57 Mountain Division, about 25km from Imphal.																								The soldiers involved in the operation were drawn from Assam Rifles posts at Kakching Khunou and Pangaltabi, also in Thoubal district.																								The operation was launched after Prepak militants killed six CRPF men and an Assam Rifles jawan in two attacks since September 30. 																								These attacks were part of Prepaks routine strategy of targeting security personnel in the run-up to its raising day.

				 Climate alarm for India 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: Climate change driven by global warming could exacerbate Indias water shortages, reduce food production, trigger mass migration to cities and reverse the countrys social and economic gains, a new report indicated today. 																								India could suffer from impacts ranging from insecure food supplies and reduced availability of fresh water to extreme weather events and sea-level increase, the report prepared by a group of non-government agencies and research institutes said. 																								Climate change is already significantly affecting agriculture. The rate of growth of production and yield from 1991 to 2005 has been the lowest since 1947. Less water for rain-fed and melt-water-fed agriculture could cause a loss of up to 30 per cent of Indias agricultural production including food grain, the report said. 																								Environment activists are using the report to argue for Indian government action to deal with climate change. There is a need to shift subsidies to renewable energy programmes, said K. Srinivasa, a climate change campaigner with Greenpeace India. 																								The report by the Fifth Working Group on Climate and Development has warned that as agricultural systems suffer from declining productivity or complete collapse, people will be forced to migrate in search of work. Distress migration from rural to urban areas could result in rising social tensions and conflicts as well as the overstretching of urban infrastructure and amenities, the report said. 																								Trends of hunger deaths, farmer suicides and agrarian distress  already visible  will be accentuated by climate change, members of a coalition of non-government organisations said yesterday after releasing the report. The Energy and Resources Institute, New Delhi, Greenpeace India, the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies and ActionAid were among some 40 NGOs that contributed to the report.

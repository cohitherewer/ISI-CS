 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Pay-up punch queers pitch				 																																																										As far as coincidences go, this one must be painfully expensive.				 																																																										The Hyderabad Cricket Association has been asked to pay Rs 47 lakh in security expenses for the third India-Australia ODI. The hosts had lost the match by 47 runs.				 																																																										The match, in which Ricky Pontings men had piled the 290 that Team India couldnt chase, also left behind a raging controversy over illegal sale of tickets and passes.				 																																																										The pay-up notice has been slapped by the city police, which has argued that it provided foolproof security to the players at the hotel as well as the stadium.				 																																																										The cricket body has refused to cough up the money. The security was given by the state government in view of the terror threat and not on our request, secretary Shivlal Yadav, a former Team India player, said.				 																																																										Three thousand policemen had been deployed on the day of the match. Yadav asked the police if they would ask Ganesh puja organisers, who were provided security, to pay the money that had been spent on the drill. 				 																BEST flaunts track record				 																																																										Delhis killer Bluelines could take a lesson from Mumbais BEST.				 																																																										Since April this year, BEST buses have caused only 15 deaths while Blueline buses have run over several times more. 				 																																																										BEST general manager Uttam Khobragade is proud of the track record. We are the best in the country.				 																																																										BEST drivers are put through a comprehensive training programme, which includes Vipasana classes and meditation lessons imparted by the Art of Living Foundation.				 																																																										Most accidents happened because there are so many vehicles on the road and so much traffic. There is no discipline. I am not justifying the accidents but the drivers are not always at fault, says Khobragade. The low accident numbers indicate that BEST is truly the best bus transportation service in the country, he adds.				 																Temple to Mahatma				 																																																										Tamil Nadu can possibly boast of the first temple to the Mahatma.				 																																																										Vaiyapuri Mudaliyar, an ardent admirer of the freedom icon, has built the shrine in Erodes Goundapadi in the memory of the Mahatma and his wife Kasturba. 				 																																																										Unlike the countless memorials in the country that come alive on October 2, the Mahatmas birthday, prayers at the temple are offered every day.				 																																																										But on Gandhi Jayanti early this month, there was an added ring of excitement and celebration. 				 																																																										Women from the village cooked sweet pongal in a tent pitched outside the structure and offered it to the deity. The huge crowd gave the place the feel and fervour of a festival as the prasad was handed to the villagers.				 																																																										Mudaliyar believes he has not done anything out of the ordinary, saying the temple will serve as a reminder to the people of the Mahatmas sacrifices and ideals each day. 				 																																																										Bapu was the one who won us freedom. He lived like a god among men, just like the Buddha and Jesus Christ. It is to bring out this truth that I built a temple to the Mahatma.				 																Women hostels				 																																																										The Delhi government has struck another blow for women, especially those who have come to the capital for jobs.				 																																																										Last week, it announced that 13 more hostels would be set up in various areas of the city for the benefit of working women. These will add to the 25 already in place.				 																																																										Chief minister Sheila Dikshit announced the decision after the inauguration of one such hostel in Rohini, a northwest suburb that is home to many migrants.				 																																																	Delhi: From nolen gurer cheese cake to pantua pastry to navratan cheese cake, Uppals Orchid is dishing out delights for those with a sweet tooth. The hotel is near the international airport. Time: 10am to 10pm. Happy hours (50 per cent off) from 7pm to 10pm.

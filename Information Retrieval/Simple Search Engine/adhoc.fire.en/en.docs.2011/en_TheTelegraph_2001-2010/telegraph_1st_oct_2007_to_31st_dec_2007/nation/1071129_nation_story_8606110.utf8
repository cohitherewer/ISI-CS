				 Literacy leap, minus 35-plus
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 Little help? 																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: India plans its biggest jump in literacy rates by 2012, but has made no financial allocations in its latest five-year plan to target the largest section of illiterates in the country.																								The human resource development ministry today announced the target of achieving 85 per cent literacy by the end of the 11th five-year plan, an increase of 20 points from 65.38 per cent recorded in the 2001 census. 																								But the 11th plan, with a record Rs 6,500 crore allocated for adult education, will focus only on those between the age of 15 and 35, ignoring  despite frantic pleas from officials  those above 35.																								According to National Literacy Mission (NLM) records, 150 million Indians above 35 are illiterate against 100 million in the 15-35 age group. 																								The largest section of illiterate people is not being targeted. The new target is impossible, even mathematically, an NLM official said. 																								Announcing the new targets at a conference, NLM director-general Vandana Jena said India had witnessed the biggest increase in literacy in a decade between 1991 and 2001  nearly 12 percentage points and could replicate its performance in this decade. 																								It will not be easy. But we need to set ourselves tough targets, she added.																								The Rs 6,500-crore allocated for the NLM in the 11th plan is a three-fold jump over the allocation under the previous plan. NLM officials said the amount would not be anywhere near enough to meet the target. 																								The HRD ministry announced a two-day international meet on literacy being hosted by the Indian government along with Unesco. 																								India and 163 other countries had pledged to provide education for all by 2015 at the World Education Forum in Dakar in 2000.																								Education and finance ministers from 14 countries, including India, will participate in the Delhi conference, which kicks off tomorrow.																								UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi will inaugurate the conference, which will be addressed via teleconference by US First Lady Laura Bush.

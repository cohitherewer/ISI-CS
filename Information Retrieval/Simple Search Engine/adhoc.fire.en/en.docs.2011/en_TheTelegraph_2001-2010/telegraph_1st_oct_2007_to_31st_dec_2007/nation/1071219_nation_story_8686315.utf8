				 Dont need any Mahajan

																								Sarangi Mahajan said she did not need help from either the Mahajan or Munde family, hours after her husband Praveen was sentenced to life imprisonment by a Mumbai sessions court on Tuesday. 
																								I dont need any Mahajan or Munde. I am ready for the struggle and I have prepared my children for the same, Sarangi said in response to Praveens brother-in-law Gopinath Mundes words of sympathy. 
																								I will file an appeal in the high court. Right now, my priority is to save my husband and look after my children  Kapil and Vrushali, she added, trying hard not to break down.
																								Sarangi said she had the full support of her brothers Prasad and Shailendra Pullewar. Whatever happens, I have to fight.
																								Asked if she planned to join politics, she said: I have not yet thought about politics. But we have some money saved, with which we can live comfortably.
																								She also expressed relief, saying: At least Praveen has not been awarded death. 
																								I am mentally prepared and I have prepared my children, too, for the struggle ahead, she said.
																								Prasad later told reporters that his first priority was to help his sisters family become independent and move on. 
																								Prakash Mahajan, the eldest of the Mahajan brothers, said: For us, both the days  today and May 3 (the day Pramod died)  are equally painful. (PTI)

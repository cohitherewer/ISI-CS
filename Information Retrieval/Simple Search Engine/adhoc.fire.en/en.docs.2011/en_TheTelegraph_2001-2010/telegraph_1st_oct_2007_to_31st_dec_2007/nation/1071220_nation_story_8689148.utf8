																								Bokaro, Dec. 19: Over 2,000 students but only one toilet, no common room and a library which has not been updated for the past five years. 
																								A science laboratory, which has been left deserted, a sports room without equipment, a department of music, with students but no teachers and salaries not cleared for nearly three years  this is the story of an institute that claims to be the best in the district  Bokaro Mahila College. 
																								Established in March 1976, nearly 2,100 students study here (1,573 undergraduate students and 450 intermediate students) in two shifts. Students either have to bring water from home, buy it from hotels or borrow from houses nearby, as the two taps here run dry. 
																								Whats worse is that the prestigious girls college has only one loo. If a student needs to use the toilet, she either has to return home or pray to someone living in Sector-III allows her in. That is something we are not proud of. The toilet here is so dirty. Moreover, it has an open window. Its unhealthy and gives one no privacy, said students council president Pratibha Singh. 
																								The recently elected president has also written to the chancellor and governor about their plight. The college has no common room and in the letter Singh has pointed out that students cant even sit on the campus grounds as the supposed garden has not been mowed for the past 20 years inviting snakes, insects and encouraging thorny bushes.
																								No one has entered the science laboratory for the past two years as it lacks basic chemicals and equipment.
																								College principal R.N.S. Yadav, who took charge a year ago, even admitted that the library is not updated because of lack of funds. And when the girls requested for sports facilities they were told by teachers to go home and play. In fact, teachers do not visit the college regularly and they have not been paid for the past 33 months. 
																								While speaking to The Telegraph, a third-year science student Annu Kumari said, she has was allowed to visit the laboratory only once and was only shown the apparatus but not allowed to touch anything. One can imagine how students manage to cope with their studies.
																								Probably one cant blame the staff, as they have not been paid for nearly three years. A non-teaching staff, Nakul, said: You call this a college? This is a museum! How can one work properly without being paid? 
																								The college principal was sympathetic towards the students and assured that he was trying his best to improve the situation.
																								Yadav, who is also the principal of B.S. City College, said that they only get Rs 30 lakh as grant from the government whereas the expenses run into Rs 72 lakh per annum.

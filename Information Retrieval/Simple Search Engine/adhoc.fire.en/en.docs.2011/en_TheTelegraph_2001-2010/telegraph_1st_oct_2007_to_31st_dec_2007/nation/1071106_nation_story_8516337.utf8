				 CBI caught in playboy trap
 BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA																								New Delhi, Nov. 5: Playboy businessman Abhishek Verma has stumped the CBI: he is at once an accused in the navy war room leak and an approver in another case.																								So, as he cools his heels in Tihar jail for allegedly leaking classified military information, he is also helping out the agency with dope on former Enforcement Directorate deputy director Ashok Aggarwal.																								Curiously, the same officer is handling both cases. But superintendent of police Ramneesh does not find it funny when he has to take a call on whether to treat Abhishek with the carrot or the stick.																								To start with, Verma and Aggarwal were both accused of falsely implicating a Delhi-based jeweller under the now-annulled Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. But somewhere down the line, Verma turned approver and wangled a pardon from court.																								His revelations as an approver also set the CBI on the trail of Sonia Gandhis close aide Vincent George, against whom the agency has registered a case for having more wealth than his known sources of income.																								Sources said Verma had told the CBI that he used his foreign contacts to help George launder off Rs 3 crore abroad. Aggarwal reportedly advised George on how to manage his finances.																								With this case hinging on Vermas statements, the CBI has little option but to treat the 38-year-old son of former Rajya Sabha MP Veena Verma and Hindi poet Srikant Verma  he helped Rajiv Gandhi brush up his Hindi  with kid gloves.																								In the war room leak, however, Ramneesh cannot take the same approach. It is like walking the tightrope for the young officer, a senior CBI official said.																								Ramneeshs predicament has made him the butt of jokes within the CBI. Not just colleagues, even seniors rib him about the carrot and stick policy he is forced to follow with Verma  carrot in the Aggarwal case and stick in the war room leak.																								But it is not always light-hearted fun. Questions are raised about his impartiality and that of his team while dealing with Verma, the CBI official said.																								This August, Aggarwal filed a plea in the high court questioning Vermas credibility as an approver after his alleged involvement in the navy war room leak came to light.																								Verma is, however, no stranger to controversy. A regular on the Page 3 circuit till not so long ago, he was often seen in the company of beautiful and even exotic women.																								Often photographed in his Versace collection, including diamond-studded shoes, he openly talked about his Ferraris, private yacht, a safe deposit at Harrods, a telecom firm in France and an Internet service in the UK.

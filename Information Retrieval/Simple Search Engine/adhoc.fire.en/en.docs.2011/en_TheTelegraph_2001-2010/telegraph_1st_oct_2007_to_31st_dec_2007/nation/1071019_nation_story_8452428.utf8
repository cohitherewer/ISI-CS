				 Russia deal for futuristic fighter
 SUJAN DUTTA 																								Moscow, Oct. 18: India today signed an agreement with Russia, committing itself to developing a futuristic fighter aircraft in a joint venture. The project could cost as much as $5 billion to start with. 																								New Delhi and Indias defence establishment hope that the signing of this agreement will address diplomatic concerns about Indias strategic policies. Discordant notes in India-Russia ties have been evident in recent weeks. But officials with the defence minister asserted that relations with Russia have a tomorrow that is not governed by todays seemingly pro-US policies. 																								The Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft programme has to be talked about. Now it is final at the policy level. Only the nitty-gritty has to be worked out. Very soon, we will also have an agreement on a multi-role transport aircraft. By and large, this visit (of mine) has been successful, defence minister A.K. Antony said after the meetings. 																								An important decision that was reached, he said, was to increase the frequency and scope of military exercises. Indias armed forces have been engaging with several countries in the last five years in military drills. But most of them have been with the US. Antony said engagements with the Russian forces were going to be more intensive from now on. 																								India will also put more money into the relations by investing in futuristic projects and sharing the escalation in costs of contracted programmes.

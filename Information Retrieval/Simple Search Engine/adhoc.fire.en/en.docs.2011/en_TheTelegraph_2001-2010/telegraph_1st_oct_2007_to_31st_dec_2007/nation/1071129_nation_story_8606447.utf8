				 Congs turn to shoot the messenger
 																											- Priya sees plot in riot expose timing OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Das Munshi																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today said he smelt a deep-rooted conspiracy in the timing of the Tehelka expose on the Gujarat riots and defended a ban on its telecast, betraying the Congresss reluctance to raise a sensitive issue before elections. 																								An investigation has been launched into the connivance between certain people in Delhi and Gujarat to stir up communal passions just before the elections in the state, the information and broadcasting minister told the Rajya Sabha. 																								The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, authorises district collectors to ban telecast of material found endangering peace and harmony, Das Munshi said.																								Ahmedabad collector Dhananjay Dwivedi did the right thing (in banning Tehelka). I support it, he said. 																								No other district magistrate in Gujarat showed the courage and wisdom to ban the telecast, he added. The Election Commission had cleared the decision. 																								The channel (showing the expose) was asked to give its complaint against the ban in writing but has so far not made any complaint, Das Munshi said. 																								Members from the Left, Samajwadi and the Telugu Desam parties were up on their feet, accusing the minister of trying to shield the Narendra Modi government. 																								The Congress party is second to none in defending secularism. The government is not against highlighting the happenings during the 2002 Gujarat riots, but the timing of the broadcast on the eve of the Assembly elections smacks of a deeper conspiracy of polarising voters along communal lines to benefit some parties, Das Munshi said.																								The Congress had as an Opposition party made the most of the Tehelka campaign against corruption that forced George Fernandes to resign as defence minister and Bangaru Laxman as BJP chief.																								Polls are due in December and the Congress fears any polarisation of voters along religious lines will help Modi. 																								Das Munshi said a company called Infinium had been found to be misusing its VSAT licence to block out prime time programmes on regular channels and air the Modi-backed channel Vande Gujarat. The state-run Gujarat Fertiliser is also involved, he said. 																								The Cable Operators Federation of India had complained on August 21 that political campaign cassettes and CDs were being distributed by Gujarat entertainment tax and information personnel, with a letter on the department letterhead saying operators are directed to show these footings on prime time, he said.

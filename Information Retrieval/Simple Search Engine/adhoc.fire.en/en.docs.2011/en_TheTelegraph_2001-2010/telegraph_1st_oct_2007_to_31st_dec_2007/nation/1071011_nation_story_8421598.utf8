				 Modi gets two days to fight
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 10: Two-stage polls in Gujarat have delighted the BJP while the Congress, which wanted a one-day exercise, has declared that it respects the decision.																								Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said one-day voting would have ensured a fair poll but added that his party respected the poll panels decision. 																								Rivals were of the view that staggered polls would give chief minister Narendra Modi more time to marshal his forces and focus more sharply on weak spots.																								Both sides appear to agree on one point, though  that this election is all about Modi. Nothing else matters.																								The elections will be a fight between the Modi-led BJP and the Congress, which will be supported by BJP dissidents. 																								New entrants such as the BSP and the NCP  if it fails to tie up with the Congress  could enter the picture but the contest will largely be between those who support Modi and those who want him dislodged at any cost.																								The dissidents include former bigwigs such as Keshubhai Patel and Suresh Mehta (both former chief ministers), a few MPs and about a dozen suspended BJP MLAs.																								But, unlike the previous polls in 2002, held against the backdrop of the Godhra riots, Modi would be locked in a tough fight. 																								The BJP is banking on his image and his much talked-about development initiatives. But the dissidents have questioned the chief ministers claims of having brought development, queering the comeback pitch.																								The rebels will try to prove that their survival does not depend on Modi and that the BJP blundered by not removing him as chief minister. Having opposed Modis autocratic style of functioning, they hope for a verdict that shows they were morally right in taking that stand.																								BJP spokesperson Vijay Rupani said the party would win the elections hands down. 																								Asked about the disaffection among the Patels and a section of the Koli community, which have traditionally supported the BJP, he said: We can only say the people of Gujarat have never supported defectors and power-hungry politicians. They will face the music. Time will prove us right.																								Gordhan Zadaphia, the rebel group convener, vowed to make Modi bite the dust. Modi is our enemy number one. He added that his group would reveal its strategy after October 12, the start of the nine-day Navratri festival.																								Shabnam Hashmi, a Delhi-based social and cultural activist camping in Gujarat, echoed the Congresss fears, saying a two-phase election would allow Modi supporters the scope to influence the outcome on the second day. 																								She said the Congress was in a better position this time but there was a possibility of dissidents rejoining the Modi camp on a last-minute intervention by the RSS. 																								Gohil said the Congress was prepared for the polls, but there were fears the smaller parties could cut into its votes, giving Modi an advantage.

				 Nuke boss beckons, Delhi shy 
 OUR BUREAU 																								New Delhi, Oct. 10: The International Atomic Energy Agency seems ready to tie the knot with India, but Delhi remains hesitant about crossing the Lefts Lakshman rekha. 																								When Pranab Mukherjee met IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei this evening, the Indian foreign minister explained the nuclear deal to his guest.																								However, Mukherjee was unable to give ElBaradei any commitment on if and when Delhi would go to the IAEA to negotiate a safeguards agreement. 																								ElBaradei was being more than courteous when he told waiting reporters that he wanted India to finally emerge from the restrictions on nuclear commerce.																								As a friend of India, I would like to see India making full use of nuclear energy to enable it to sustain its 10 per cent growth rate, he said. Mukherjee explained the 123 Agreement to me.																								He said an India-specific agreement would not require protracted negotiations as the country already had four such agreements with the IAEA on safeguarded reactors.

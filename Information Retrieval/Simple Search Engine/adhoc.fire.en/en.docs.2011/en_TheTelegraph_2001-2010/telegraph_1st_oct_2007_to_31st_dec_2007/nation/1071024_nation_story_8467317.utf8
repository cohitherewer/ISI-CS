				 Bengal lags in womens protection
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI																								New Delhi, Oct. 23: Bengal and several other states are yet to appoint full-time protection officers to help victims of domestic violence even a year after the government introduced a law to tackle the scourge.																								The states, however, claim the Centre has been slow in sanctioning funds that they say are essential for appointing these nodal officials responsible for implementing the law.																								The Centre has not sanctioned funds for additional appointment of protection officers. Thats why we have no full-time protection officers, S.N. Haque, secretary in Bengals department of women and child development, told The Telegraph from Calcutta today.																								The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, came into force on October 25 last year. The rules clearly say each district must have at least one trained, qualified and full-time protection officer.																								Under the act, victims have to first approach the district protection officer, who has to help them file a police case and provide psychological or medical assistance if needed.																								District social welfare and probation officers now double as protection officers, a job that involves spending hours with women, discussing cases of abuse by their husbands.																								Frankly, its impossible to do justice to either my job as a social welfare officer or as a protection officer. And I dont get paid extra, said a social welfare officer from Karnataka who didnt want to be named. Why would I wish to devote extra time to the implementation of the domestic violence act?																								Activists like Sudipta Shankar, who has been working with victims of domestic violence in Andhra Pradesh, point to the better results shown by states that have appointed officers dedicated to the task of ensuring implementation of the law.																								Andhra, one such state, has seen over 200 cases of domestic violence forwarded by protection officers to police.																								Delhi has 14 full-time officers, five more than the number of districts.																								But Bengal, which has 18 districts, has just one protection officer. The information that Bengal has sent us suggests that it has only one protection officer... and that, too, part-time, said a senior official in the ministry of women and child development.																								The Centre accuses states like Bengal of being lax and sources said minister Renuka Chowdhury could raise the issue at a conference with state ministers in November.																								Haque, however, said his department had appointed part-time protection officers for each district.																								The social welfare officer in each state has been given the task of protection officer, the Bengal officer said.

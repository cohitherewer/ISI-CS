				 Karat smells them but...
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Karat at the news meet. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha																								New Delhi, Nov. 12: Prakash Karat today attacked the Trinamul Congress for allegedly taking Maoist help to foment trouble in Nandigram, and said the CPM would not yield to force.																								We cannot allow anyone to dislodge us by force with the help of Maoists, the CPM general secretary said, defending the recapture of the villages.																								He alleged that the Maoists drove families out of Nandigram, and Trinamul and other groups prevented the administration from entering.																								The Trinamul Congress has been taking the help of Maoists in creating trouble in Nandigram. They could not win the confidence of the people of Nandigram democratically. We are not going to oblige them (by allowing them) to dislodge us by force, Karat told reporters at the end of a two-day politburo meeting.																								Minutes before his news conference, the ultra-Left CPI-MLs student wing, the All India Students Association, demonstrated in front of the CPM headquarters, AKG Bhavan, denouncing the Bengal government.																								Karat said national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, too, had yesterday spoken about the Maoist hand in Nandigram. The CPM leader claimed that the Naxalites had built bunkers and set up training camps in the East Midnapore battle zone.																								The gang-up of political forces against the CPM and the Left, operating in the guise of a Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee, virtually set up a parallel raj in the area.																								Karat said his party would do everything possible to maintain Left Front unity but the allies, who yesterday blamed the CPM for the violence, should be conscious of their role.																								As the biggest party in the front, we are conscious of our responsibility. The other Left parties should also play their role in strengthening the unity of the front.																								The CPM chief asked the allies to view the recent violence in Nandigram in the proper context.																								The situation in Nandigram was abnormal and disturbed all these days. The process to bring peace to the region has begun, Karat said.

 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																March to warn of silent killer				 																																																										The marchers stomped down warning of the silent killer that has been stalking the countrys health system.				 																																																										More than 100 health activists walked down Parliament Street last week, holding placards urging citizens to join a campaign to spread awareness about diabetes.				 																																																										November 14, declared by the UN as World Diabetes Day, was an occasion to remind the country about the disease that has already snared 41 million Indians. 				 																																																										Changing lifestyles, increasing stress, a genetic pre-disposition and neglect of screening and treatment have resulted in the pandemic, said Melvin Oscar DSouza, managing director of NovoNordisk, a healthcare multinational that was one of the organisers of the walk. 				 																																																										Dr A.K. Jhingan, who heads the Delhi Diabetes Research Centre, said the number of diabetes patients is expected to rise to 79 million by 2030 if current trends continue. We need to curb the menace now and create more awareness on the issue.				 																Name tussle over airport				 																																																										A plan to rename Madurai airport after a colleague of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose has raised plenty of dust.				 																																																										Chief minister M. Karunanidhi has written to the Centre suggesting that the airport be named after P. Muthuramalinga Thevar in a move that has the support of the BJP. 				 																																																										But opposition to the renaming has come from an unlikely quarter  the CPM. The party has asked the chief minister to reconsider his decision, saying the new name also has a strong caste ring to it. The Thevars are a dominant OBC group whose tensions with Dalit formations in the states southern districts had come to the fore during the DMKs previous regime in 1996-2001.				 																																																										An all-party meeting had decided then that no public institution would be named after political leaders. The Marxists are now reminding Karunanidhi of that agreement but the chief minister hasnt changed his mind yet.				 																Anti-dropout plan stumbles				 																																																										A plan to stem school dropouts in Mumbai appears to have stumbled after it was announced early this year.				 																																																										The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had promised schoolchildren 27 items free but with the early semesters already over, there is no sign yet of the largesse.				 																																																										Uniforms, textbooks, tiffin boxes, shoes and even milk had been promised to nearly half a million students but little of that has reached the children so far.				 																																																										Students were to receive their kits by June, before the academic year began. The civic body even claims to have spent Rs 110 crore but there is little to show for the money.				 																																																										Some schools in the heart of the city have reported receiving the items but many others elsewhere have not.				 																																																										The civic body admits that there have been lapses but denies that the promise hasnt been kept. It was the first year, so we had a problem in tendering and distributing. And the number of students is huge, a senior official in the civic bodys education department said.				 																New hospital				 																																																										The capital will have a new medical college-cum-hospital in three years.				 																																																										The Delhi cabinet last week cleared the construction of a 750-bed Bharat Ratna Indira Gandhi Hospital at Dwarka, one of the fastest-growing townships in the city.				 																																																										Chief minister Sheila Dikshit said the hospital with teaching facilities will come up over 15 acres at a cost of Rs 350 crore. 				 																																																										The hospital will be ready by 2010. The cabinet has decided to go in for a state-of-the-art facility, which will serve the population over the next 50-100 years, she said.				 																																																	Delhi: Artist Karthik Pynes paintings on nature are on display at Art Konsult, 23 Hauz Khas Village. Titled A celebration of the natural, the exhibition depicts humans, birds, animals and other elements of nature in their most natural forms. You can visit between 11am and 7pm.

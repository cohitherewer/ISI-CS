				 Negligent doctor gets second chance
 AMIT ROY 																								London, Nov. 30: Amit Misra, a 37-year-old Indian doctor who was found guilty of manslaughter and received an 18-month suspended jail sentence after one of his patients died, has been allowed to return to work, it was disclosed today. 																								He was found guilty of gross negligence in 2003 after his patient, Sean Phillips, 31, died at Southampton General Hospital after developing toxic shock syndrome following a knee operation.																								Indian doctors generally have a good reputation but this case does not show them in good light.																								Misra was suspended from practising by the General Medical Council (GMC), which found that he had failed to carry out a basic test that would have disclosed the problem. 																								But the GMC has now ruled that Misra, who graduated from medical school in Delhi in 1992, can start practising again so long as he undertakes a course in surgical skills and fulfils 20 stipulated conditions.																								But his return has angered the dead patients father, Myles Phillips, from Faversham, Kent. 																								It is a disgrace that he is going to be on our wards again. I am amazed the GMC has given him a second chance. Are they really that desperate for doctors? He effectively killed my son because of negligence, he said.																								The dead man has left behind a child.																								Phillips said his sons former partner Annabel Grant wishes Misra had been struck off immediately after this happened to Sean.																								Sean had gone into hospital for a knee operation but suffered a rare condition called toxic shock syndrome, which both Misra and his fellow senior house officer Rajeev Srivastava failed to diagnose. 																								The patient was eventually transferred to intensive care but died on June 24, 2000.																								In April 2003, both doctors were convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, which was suspended for two years, by a jury at Winchester Crown Court.																								In November 2005, the GMCs fitness to practise panel suspended Misra for 12 months. That suspension was extended in 2006 for another 12 months. Srivastava was suspended for six months.																								Misra returned to India but sought permission to return to work in the UK. 																								Brian Gomes da Costa, the GMCs panel chairman, has imposed conditions that Misra will have to fulfil over the next three years. 																								He said: The panel notes that knowledge gaps were identified in three out of the four areas of Dr Misras assessed professional performance. The panel has noted the gross negligence in post-operative care that led to Dr Misras conviction for manslaughter, but it has also heard of efforts that Dr Misra has made with his mentors in India to rectify the deficiencies in his clinical skills. 																								What is unclear is whether the fault is Misras or of the training he received at his medical school in India. No information is currently available about Misras personal background, his academic record and how he managed to get into medical school in Delhi in the first place. 																								Given Misras track record, the GMC has shown huge leniency in letting him back into the medical fold. 																								The GMC assessors found, significantly, that overall Dr Misra had demonstrated a bare minimum surgical and orthopaedic knowledge base  suggesting his training left much to be desired.																								They added: Balancing those errors against giving Dr Misra the opportunity to remedy the shortcomings in his clinical deficiencies, the panel determines that it is appropriate, necessary and proportionate to impose conditions on his registration for a period of three years. This period of conditional registration will ensure patient safety until his failings have been fully and adequately addressed, such that Dr Misra is a safe doctor.

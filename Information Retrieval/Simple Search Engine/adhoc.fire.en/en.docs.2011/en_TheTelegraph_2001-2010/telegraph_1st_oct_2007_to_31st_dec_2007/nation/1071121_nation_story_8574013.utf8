				 Cyber Naidus bedfellow is Farmer Naidu
 							 - Former CM spends night in Assembly lobby to protest low minimum support price for paddy G.S. RADHAKRISHNA				 	 Naidu and other MLAs bed down in the Assembly. Picture by Sarfaraz Khan 																								Hyderabad, Nov. 20: Chandrababu Naidu has been literally losing sleep  over downgrading his image from Cyber Naidu to Farmer Naidu.																								The former Andhra chief minister, who spent his years in the hot seat giving his state a Silicon Valley makeover while neglected farmers committed suicide, has of late become extremely concerned about the lot of paddy growers.																								So worried have he and his Telugu Desam flock been that they slept last night on the hard, cold marble floor of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly lobby, lined up one beside the other as though in some crowded quake or flood relief camp.																								Not that there were no mattresses or pillows or food  the Assembly secretary hired the bedding and bought them dinner from the nearby Rajdoot Hotel. Tuljanand Singh even ensured that the ladies were righteously segregated from the men.																								The point of Naidus protest was  no, it had nothing to do with his earlier passion, IT  the minimum support price for paddy.																								Over the past 10 days, since the Assembly convened for the winter session, he has been screaming himself hoarse that the Rs 740 MSP for a quintal of paddy should be brought on a par with the Rs 1,000 MSP for wheat.																								Congress chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has been toeing the Centres line and declaring that this could not be done as raising the support price would roughly cost the Centre an additional Rs 4,000 crore. 																								Even yesterday, when Team Naidu again tried to move an adjournment motion for a discussion on the paddy support price, the Andhra Speaker rejected it for the umpteenth time and adjourned the House at 6.55pm.																								Furious, the MLAs trooped to the well and demanded a statement from the chief minister. When their protests fell on deaf ears, Naidu decided that he would have to do something out of the way to be heard.																								Till 10.30 at night, the Andhra legislature secretariat tried to placate the protesters and send them home. But Naidu was adamant that he and his team would not leave the premises.																								Somehow, Assembly secretary Singh convinced him to vacate the hall and move to the lobby. Naidu, thus, became the first former chief minister to spend a night on the Assembly premises, along with 32 MLAs.																								It was certainly a new experience for us to take care of the MLAs even at night, said Hasan Ali, a personal attendant of the Speaker.																								Naidu entertained reporters as he bided time sleepless in the Assembly, telling them how the Reddy government had let down the paddy farmers and short-changed them by ignoring the steadily rising costs of paddy production.																								State agriculture minister N. Raghuveera Reddy dismissed Naidus concern as crocodile tears. Since when has the Desam president become farmer-friendly? he asked sarcastically.																								This morning, the protesters trooped in when the House convened at 8.30am and marched out in a small procession, sheaves of paddy in hand, after the House adjourned sine die.																								Earlier, the Congress moved a resolution demanding that the support price for paddy be raised by Rs 300. If you think that by leading an all-party delegation to Delhi we can manage to get a higher MSP, I dont mind heading one right now, the chief minister said.																								But the man who lost his sleep was still not happy. We staged the dharna because the Congress tried to get away without making a statement, he said. 																								Now the least it can do is protect the farmers by raising the MSP on its own.

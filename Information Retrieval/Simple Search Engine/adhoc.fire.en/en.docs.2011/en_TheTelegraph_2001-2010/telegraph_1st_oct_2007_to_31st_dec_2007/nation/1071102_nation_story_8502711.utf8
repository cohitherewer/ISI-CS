				 Sibal dares CM to debate
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								 New Delhi, Nov. 1: The Congress has dared Narendra Modi to a debate on development, which the chief minister has made his election plank.																								Wary of bringing up communalism in Gujarat, party leader Kapil Sibal challenged Modi to discuss any aspect of development  education, agriculture, electricity or water.																								The Union minister, who heads the Congresss media management committee for elections, resisted getting sucked into the fresh debate on the 2002 riots following the Tehelka expos. The real persona of Modi is known to everybody and the need of the hour is to expose his newer lies, he said. 																								A film made by Modis supporters shows him as a development messiah who has solved power, water and infrastructure problems in rural areas.																								But Sibal trotted out figures to try and punch holes in these claims. Gujarat has fewer engineering and medical colleges than developed states like Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and even backward states like Orissa and Uttar Pradesh, he said. 																								Schools have poor infrastructure and the dropout rate is one of the highest in the country, Sibal added. Quoting government figures, he said 36.62 lakh children in the state had dropped out between 2001 and 2005. 																								The Union science and technology minister said the states farmers were the most indebted in the country and faced 14 to 16 hours of power cuts a day. 																								Modis government had said that 148 farmers had committed suicide in the state in 2006 but a Right to Information plea revealed the number was 300. Investments have come in Gujarat and we are not denying that. Big houses enhanced their turnover. But we are talking about the common man who is in misery, Sibal said.

				 Singh quiz silences vocal trio
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Lalu Prasad with the CPMs Sitaram Yechury after the meeting. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Oct. 22: Lalu Prasad, Sharad Pawar and T.R. Baalu havent been the quietest of men on the nuclear deal. But today, the trio were silent when the matter was raised during the meeting with Left parties.																								They possibly didnt have much left to speak after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed anguish at the reported U-turn of the UPA allies hours before the session with the communists at Pranab Mukherjees home.																								The RJD chief didnt utter a word. Lalu Prasad was unusually silent, said a source present during the talks.																								At earlier meetings, he had appeared to be backing the Left demand not to operationalise the nuclear deal.																								Earlier in the day, the allies had met at the Prime Minister residence and came out visibly tense, though no one made any public statement on what transpired at the meeting.																								Sources said the Prime Minister asked Lalu Prasad and the DMKs Baalu to state their final positions. Singh is learnt to have pointed out that none of the allies had ever voiced any opposition during the cabinet meetings where the nuclear deal was discussed.																								Sources in the RJD and the NCP said the two parties felt that the deal was good but when they approved it at the cabinet meetings, they hadnt anticipated the Left would oppose it so strongly that the government would be threatened.																								But while there were no public statements from the RJD, DMK and the NCP after the meeting with the Prime Minister, the sources said the allies didnt want to face an early election on an issue like the nuke agreement. They said the Prime Ministers unprecedented confrontation with the allies silenced the leaders. 																								At the last two meetings of the UPA-Left panel, Lalu Prasad had been particularly vocal. He gave the first hint that he was shifting from the governments position on October 5, when he had backed the Lefts demand that the deal should not be operationalised until the panel came out with its findings.																								At the talks on October 9, he became more vehement in his opposition while trying to bridge the gap between the UPA and the Left in a desperate effort to avert mid-term polls.																								Baalu and the NCPs Pawar, too, had come out in support of Lalu Prasad, making it clear that they did not want fresh elections. DMK chief M. Karunanidhi later said the governments survival was more important than the deal.

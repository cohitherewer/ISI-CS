				 Rs 500 for hit-and-run
 MANDIRA NAYAR AND NALIN VERMA																								New Delhi/Patna, Oct. 24: The killer vehicle that mowed down young Sansrity Sinha in Delhi airport on Monday night could get away by paying Rs 500.																								It could be even less  Rs 100.																								Under traffic rules framed by the Airports Authority of India, the speed limit within the restricted area at Delhi airport is 15kmph.																								The penalty for exceeding the limit ranges from Rs 100 for a first offence to Rs 500 for second-time offenders.																								Outside, on Delhi roads, the minimum fine for traffic rule violators is Rs 600. 																								Over 48 hours after Sansrity, an aeronautical engineer with Deccan, was found dead off the tarmac after she had attended to an aircraft, police are trying to identify the vehicle that killed her. Vehicles of all airlines have been rounded up for a forensic tyre test.																								The accident has underlined the need for better traffic regulations at the airport. Although an official claimed that licences of third-time offenders are cancelled, sources said strict action is rare.																								An airport official said restricted zones  especially on the apron side where construction work for modernisation is going on  dont seem any safer than Delhis roads, where speeding Blueline buses are the biggest killers.																								As the area is cordoned off, there is a blind turn and almost every day there is an incident of a vehicle scraping another, said an airport official.																								The airport has 1,700 licensed vehicles and over 500 licensee drivers. At peak hour, the traffic on the ground is chaotic.																								In Patna, Sansritys family today demanded a CBI investigation. It is difficult to believe my daughter was the victim of a simple accident, said her father Arun Kumar Sinha, who wondered how no one saw the vehicle that crushed Sansrity. Someone must have killed her.

				 Lalu plays desperate cupid
 DHIRENDRA K. JHA 																								New Delhi, Oct. 9: The inscrutable Prakash Karat is allowing himself a wide grin. The martinet A.B. Bardhan is gingerly letting his left hand to be held aloft. The jovial Sitaram Yechury is guffawing.																								Political crisis, what crisis? 																								Lalu Prasad, the master of bluff and the great charmer of Indian politics, is at it again, playing the unity tune in a desperate bid to prevent the divorce of the Congress and the Left.																								At the last two UPA-Left meetings on the nuclear deal, Lalu Prasad has been at the forefront trying to persuade both the sides to budge from their stands so as to save the government and avert looming mid-term elections. 																								Like a trapeze artiste, Lalu Prasad has been swinging between the Congress and the Left, trying to mollify the two. As the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader is part of the government, he cannot oppose the deal. However, as he does not want elections, he has been asking the Centre  at the nuclear deal panel meetings  to address the Lefts concerns. 																								Behind the manoeuvring to bring about a truce lies Lalu Prasads apprehension that his party could be one of the biggest losers if the government falls and elections are held early.																								The former chief minister knows that it is the Muslim-Yadav (M-Y) factor in Bihar that is keeping him afloat as a political heavyweight at the Centre. 																								Fighting an election in support of the nuclear deal with America runs the risk of alienating the minority community. Early polls will also prevent him from reaping maximum benefit of the anti-incumbency factor that, the RJD feels, requires some more time to set in against the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar. 																								My MPs are not ready for early elections. The government should address the Lefts concerns, a source quoted Lalu Prasad as saying at todays meeting of the UPA-Left panel.																								According to sources, the RJD chief had made a similar intervention at the last meeting of the panel on October 5, when he supported the Left parties demand that the government should not proceed further till the panel came out with its suggestions. 																								 Lalu Prasads shifting posture has helped him win the confidence of the Left parties considerably. Some Left leaders said in private that the RJD chief would soon throw his weight behind the communists on the controversial issue. 																								The Congress alone is pushing the deal. Even allies in the UPA do not want early elections. They see merit in our concerns. The Congress should not take any step that will create problem for its allies, a CPM politburo member said after a Left meeting today.

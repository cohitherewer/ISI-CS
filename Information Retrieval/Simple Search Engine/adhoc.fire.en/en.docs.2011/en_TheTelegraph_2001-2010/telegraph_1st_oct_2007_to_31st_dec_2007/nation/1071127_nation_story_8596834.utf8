				 Quake jitters in capital
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: Shaking beds woke up Delhi residents at dawn today as an earthquake of magnitude 4.3 struck, kindling fears whether the capitals buildings were designed to tolerate bigger tremors.																								The 4.42am quake that had its epicentre near the Haryana-Delhi border was too weak to damage structures, seismic and civil engineering experts said. But they warned that India should remain prepared for high-magnitude tremors. 																								No one knows what proportion of buildings conform to the structural engineering guidelines specified by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) to protect them from severe damage and collapse during a high-magnitude earthquake, engineers said.																								The outrage that we saw after the buildings collapsed in Ahmedabad (in 2001) has faded away. Its business as usual, said Durgesh Rai, associate professor of civil engineering at IIT Kanpur.																								The BIS codes are like zebra-crossings for pedestrians at traffic lights, said a senior seismologist with the India Meteorological Department. The BIS guidelines are to be followed but engineers suspect that the enforcement is weak.																								Buildings can be made earthquake-resistant during construction through a mix of techniques such as the use of high-quality and high-strength materials and appropriate designs to develop beams and columns of the right strength.

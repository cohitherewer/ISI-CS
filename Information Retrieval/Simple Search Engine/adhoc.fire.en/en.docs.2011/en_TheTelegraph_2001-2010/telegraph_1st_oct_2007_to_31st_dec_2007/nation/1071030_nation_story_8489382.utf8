				 Bangla alters tune on rebel camps: BSF 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 29: The Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) has admitted the existence of militant bases in its territory, the BSF said today.																								BDR authorities promised to look into the matter during a recent meeting between the two forces in Dhaka, BSF director-general A.K. Mitra said.																								We have handed over a list of about 141 locations of the militant camps. This time, they admitted that the camps existed but were not sure about their number. They had earlier denied the existence of any such camp, the BSF chief said. 																								BSF and BDR officials met in Dhaka for a routine biennial session from October 24-29 to discuss border conflicts.																								For the first time, the BDR has assured us that they will seek and destroy the camps of Huji (Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami), Mitra, who reached Calcutta this evening on his way to Delhi, said. We know that Huji is actively involved in organising terrorist camps inside Bangladesh territory.																								Bangladesh has destroyed two terrorist camps and are looking for more. This reflects how we are closer to resolving problems together, Mitra said.																								His upbeat comments are in line with the signals emanating from Bangladesh ever since a military-backed caretaker government took over.																								However, the proposed Calcutta-Dhaka train service remains under a cloud, the BSF chief said.																								The BDR pointed out to us that our security measures for the train when it enters Indian soil involves fences within 150 yards of the Zero Line at Gede. But the BDR will not allow us to set up the fence, Mitra said. 																								Underlining the importance of building the fence, Mitra said the BSF had caught 19 people with links to militant outfits, including Huji, near the south Bengal border in the past several months. We are still trying to work out a solution, he added.																								The BSF chief said cattle and foodgrain were regularly smuggled from India to Bangladesh, in which some BSF personnel might be involved. 																								Nearly 1.16 lakh heads of cattle have been smuggled to Bangladesh in the past two years and already 163 BSF personnel have been dismissed from service on charges of corruption, Mitra said.																								The BSF chief also expressed concern over the increase in trafficking of women from Bangladesh and circulation of fake currency notes in the border villages. We have rescued 85 women in the last 10 months, Mitra said. 																								We have also found out that fake currency notes are being heavily circulated in the border villages. We have seized fake currency notes adding up to Rs 5 lakh this year so far, which BDR officials told us were printed in Pakistan.

				 Bandh with cop sympathy
 OUR BUREAU				 	 A girl rides past a burning tyre in Jamshedpur. Picture by Bhola Prasad 																								Oct. 28: Jamshedpur was crippled today by one of the worst shutdowns since Jharkhand was formed as Babulal Marandis supporters hit the streets to protest the massacre in which the former chief ministers son was also killed.																								Clashes broke out in some parts of the state during the bandh enforced by the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM), Marandis party. Nineteen people were killed in the Maoist strike in Giridih on late Friday night.																								The bandh in the run-up to Diwali hit business establishments badly but in some places, traders downed shutters on their own.																								Over 100 JVM workers were arrested for violating prohibitory orders. But police  a frequent target of Naxalite ambushes  sent an oblique gesture of solidarity to the party workers by offering them chairs, an unusual practice in police stations. The arrested were also given breakfast.																								In Jamshedpur, JVM supporters blocked roads and burnt tyres. Later, they moved around on motorbikes, enforcing the bandh and beating up those who defied the call. At least one shop was looted.																								 We have never seen such a bandh. Not only are shops closed, but not a single vehicle can ply on the roads, said Mohan Karmakar, a mason, in the afternoon.																								However, in Dhanbad, the bandh enforcers ran into resistance after they broke the windshield of an auto-rickshaw.																								Armed with lathis, people waited for the JVM supporters to return from a rally. The party workers were beaten up but before the clashes spun out of control, the police intervened and tried to pacify the people. So heated was the exchange between the two groups that a policeman fainted while trying to broker peace.																								Several passenger trains were stopped or delayed in the Dhanbad division but goods trains were allowed to run. However, Bharat Coking Coal Limited suffered losses as the bandh halted coal loading.																								The bandh went off peacefully in Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Bokaro and Dumka largely because most people stayed indoors.

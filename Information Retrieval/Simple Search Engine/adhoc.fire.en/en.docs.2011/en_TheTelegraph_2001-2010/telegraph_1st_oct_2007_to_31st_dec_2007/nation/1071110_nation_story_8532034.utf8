				 Animal panel irks producers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 9: The film producers guild has said the animal welfare boards insistence that its permission be taken before animals are used for shoots was holding up movies.																								film producers are required to seek the boards prior permission before a film is certified fit for release and for any feature film, which contains depiction of an animal in any manner regardless of whether there is any cruelty or not, the board has started insisting on prior clearance the India Motion Pictures Producers Association has told the Supreme Court.																								It claimed the board was insisting on watching all movies, including those that had only a solitary shot of an animal. The board had only one office in Chennai and animal owners and trainers had to submit applications there, it added. As a result, the applications are piling up, the guild has said.																								The apex court then issued notices to the Centre, the censor board chairman, the animal welfare board, PETA and former environment minister Maneka Gandhi.																								The producers claimed they had to submit scripts to the board regardless of whether the animal had a key role or a marginal one.																								...the board has been insisting on scrutinising the entire script due to which things have become difficult for film producers they are now required not only to seek the consent of the censor board but also the animal welfare board, the guild has said.																								They urged the court to empower the Centre to certify that there was no cruelty to animals during shoots by setting aside a 2002 order declaring the board as the prescribed authority.																								Bombay High Court had on a petition filed by PETA and Maneka held that the board was empowered to prevent certification of films that did not have its clearance.																								Under the rules, the censor board would clear a movie for screening only after the welfare board certified that no animal had been treated cruelly while shooting.

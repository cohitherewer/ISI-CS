				 Rajasthan forced to house writer
																								The media release issued by the Rajasthan government on Friday evening. It is being reproduced verbatim.																								The State Government has categorically stated that it is left with no alternative except to have Ms. Taslima Nasrin as a guest of Government of Rajasthan due to the reluctance of West Bengal to allow her to go back to Kolkata. 																								It has also sought immediate intervention of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) regarding the stay and security of the Bangladeshi Writer in Rajasthan. 																								Apprising about the coming of Ms. Nasrins to Jaipur yesterday on 22nd November, 2007, evening, the State Government said that an official of West Bengal Police contacted his counterpart in Rajasthan Police and informed that Ms. Nasrin had been put on board IC 267 from Kolkata to Jaipur. 																								It was also informed to Inspector General of Police (Security), Rajasthan, that Ms. Nasreen enjoyed Y category security status. In other words, Government of West Bengal virtually presented a fait accompli to Government of Rajasthan without any prior intimation or consultation. 																								Apparently, Kolkata Police had roped in an office-bearer of Rajasthan Foundation  which is an organization of people of Rajasthan origin settled in other parts of the country and abroad to arrange for boarding and lodging arrangements of Ms. Taslima Nasrin.																								At this point of time, DGP Rajasthan, on his own, spoke to his counterpart in West Bengal and initially an impression was given that the Bangladeshi writer was coming to Jaipur to attend some literary event. This input was cross-checked immediately and it was found that no such literary event in which Ms. Nasrin had been invited or was expected to participate, was taking place.																								Meanwhile, since she had landed in Jaipur and enjoyed Y category security status, she was taken to Hotel Shikha duly escorted in view of security consideration. She did not have her Passport on her person and gave the impression that since she had been virtually put on a plane at a very short notice, her passport had been left back and that she only had a residential permit issued by FRRO in Kolkata. 																								The visa documents of her companion Mr. Faizal Kabir Moman are valid only till 24th November, 2007. 																								Meanwhile, Govt. of Rajasthan started receiving calls from media in Delhi and subsequently from Jaipur regarding the details of the travel and future plans of Ms. Nasrin. 																								Not only this, the fundamentalist elements within Rajasthan also started making preparations for staging concerted protests against the continuance of stay of Ms. Nasrin. 																								Looking to the possibility of outbreak of violence in various parts of Rajasthan, especially, Jaipur which could be ignored only at the peril of ignoring the possibility of worsening of law amp; order situation in Jaipur, senior officials of Govt. of Rajasthan contacted Ms. Nasrin who expressed a desire to be sent back to Kolkata immediately. 																								Accordingly, arrangements were made by Government of Rajasthan to send her by Flight No. 6E, 207 of Indigo Airlines from Jaipur to Kolkata which leaves Jaipur at 7.50 in the morning. 																								However, unlike what was done by Govt. of West Bengal, Govt. of Rajasthan decided to apprise West Bengal Police about the planned arrangements based entirely on the wishes expressed by Ms. Nasrin. The W.B. Police simply refused to countenance this idea. 																								At this stage, Govt. of Rajasthan was left with no alternative except to have Ms. Nasrin as a guest of Govt. of Rajasthan, till such time MHA takes a final view regarding her stay and security.

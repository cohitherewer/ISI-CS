 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Mobile trap for runaway rider				 																																																										Mobiles leave as big a footprint as fingerprints. At least thats what a two-wheeler rider, who knocked down an acclaimed collage artist fatally and fled, found out. 				 																																																										V. Balu, known for his peace collages, was on his evening walk near his home when the two-wheeler rider hit him, killing him on the spot. 				 																																																										Police questioned many bystanders and zeroed in on a florist. 				 																																																										After checking his scooter for tell-tale accident signs, they asked him about his whereabouts on the fateful day. But Ranganath, 25, claimed he was 12km away from the spot that evening. 				 																																																										The police let him go but asked him to leave his mobile number behind. From the phone records, the police found that Ranganath was miles away from the accident as he claimed  but that was at noon. 				 																																																										At the time of the accident, he was very much within range of the cellphone tower near the accident spot. Confronted with the records, the youth broke down.				 																Plugged in for a hike				 																																																										Electricity may soon be more expensive in the capital, with each of Delhis three power providers petitioning the government for tariff hikes. 				 																																																										Over the past two weeks, BSES Yamuna Power, a company that has been formed by public-private collaboration, North Delhi Power and the Bongaigaon Refinery and Petrochemicals have expressed concern over recurring losses. 				 																																																										In its petition, BSES Yamuna has asked the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission  the body mandated to regulate tariff rates and services to consumers in the capital  to be allowed a hike of 8.5 per cent. 				 																																																										North Delhi Power, which has been suffering the maximum losses out of the three agencies, has asked for a tariff increase of 12 per cent. Bongaigaon Petrochemicals has asked for a hike of at least 5.52 per cent.				 																After puja, sweet talk				 																																																										After last months Ganesh Puja, some sweet memories of this years event are lingering as talk of the town.				 																																																										Among the many points that have kept the city agog is the result of the auctions held for the special Ganesh laddoos, believed to be divine, by various puja committees.				 																																																										The highest bid was Rs 7.05 lakh, for a 25kg laddoo, while the lowest was a paltry Rs 25  for one that weighed 71kg. The sweets are put on the block by organisers each year before the immersion of Ganesh idols.				 																																																										The highest bid was received in the Saroornagar area. The lowest was made at a puja in Secunderabad.				 																																																										The famous Balapur Ganesh laddoo was auctioned for Rs 4.15 lakh while the one in Yellareddyguda, in the Ameerpet, fetched a whopping Rs 7.05 lakh. Another laddoo in Badangpet, in Rangareddy district, drew a bid for Rs 6.5 lakh.				 																																																										Bids above Rs 1 lakh were common. Organisers said the bids were partly fuelled by the realty boom that has spawned many property czars.				 																Outbreak alert				 																																																										The Delhi government, not ready to take a chance with an epidemic this festival season, has put its medical teams on their toes.				 																																																										Officials of civic bodies, NDMC and MCD, have been asked to scan areas where malaria and dengue are still a threat.				 																																																										The number of dengue cases was 166 and chikungunya 24, though there were no deaths. 				 																																																										More employees have been assigned to the civic bodies malaria-busting teams. Health staff will get no leave this month.				 																																																	Delhi: A sequence of scenes depicting the beauty of everyday life, Bhalobasha Kao Ke is a Bengali play that will both pull at your heartstrings and tickle your funny bone. Watch it at 9.30pm at Chittaranjan Parks K-Block Maidan on Wednesday. What better way to enjoy Shasthi.

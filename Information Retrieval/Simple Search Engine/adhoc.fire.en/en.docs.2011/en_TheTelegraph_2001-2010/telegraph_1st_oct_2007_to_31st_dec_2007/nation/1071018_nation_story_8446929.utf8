				 Careful CBI yet to start probe
 BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA																								New Delhi, Oct. 17: A cautious CBI chose not to start the Rizwanur Rahman investigation today even though it had received a copy of the Calcutta High Court order.																								The agency has first called for the original petition filed by Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan and brother Rukbanur in the high court. The court yesterday accepted their plea for a CBI probe into the death of the graphics designer.																								The CBI has also sought details of the investigation conducted by the CID so far. 																								Usually, the CBI starts investigating immediately after it is handed a case. If not a regular case, at least a preliminary enquiry (PE) is registered at the earliest. Neither has been done in the Rizwanur case. 																								In the Nandigram police firing, the agency had wasted no time in registering a PE and starting the probe. This case is different from Nandigram, a senior CBI official said, adding that the agency was being very careful. 																								Sources in the agency said since the case is sensitive, they want to go through all the documents with a fine-tooth comb and seek legal opinion on what sections it could be registered under. 																								It is not the norm for the agency to seek legal opinion before registering a case.																								The CBI is treading softly because senior police officials and a prominent businessman are involved, the sources said. 																								At the end of it all, most of the CBI investigators are also IPS officers. Many of them will have to carry out a probe against their seniors. It is not going to be an easy job for them, the official said. 																								Rizwanurs family had petitioned the high court asking for a CBI inquiry because they believed the CID probe would not be impartial.

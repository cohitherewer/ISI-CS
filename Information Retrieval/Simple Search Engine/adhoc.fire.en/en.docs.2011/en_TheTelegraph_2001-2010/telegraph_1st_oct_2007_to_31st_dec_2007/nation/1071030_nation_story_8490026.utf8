				 Ronen regrets chicken barb
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 29: Indias ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen, today offered an unconditional apology to the Lok Sabhas privileges committee for his headless chickens comment.																								The apology appeared to have satisfied the 15-member panel of MPs. 																								Members said Sen expressed regret as soon as he came in, telling the panel that he understood and appreciated the responsibility and accountability his job demanded.																								Political parties have their own ways of handling issues and looking at them, so who am I to sit in judgement. How then can I ever call them (opponents of the nuclear deal) headless chickens? he was quoted as saying.																								Sen, according to an interview  he called it a casual chat with the correspondent of a news agency  had rounded on critics of the nuclear deal. It has been approved here by the President, and there its been approved by the Indian cabinet, the envoy was quoted as saying in Washington in August. So why do you have all this running around like headless chickens, looking for a comment here or comment there, and these little storms in a tea cup?																								The comment kicked up a furore during the monsoon session of Parliament, though the diplomat claimed he had journalists in mind, not politicians, and apologised.																								Today, the mood appeared to have changed. I did not mean disrespect to anyone. I make these comments even at home when I have guests and my wife keeps running around, he said, drawing chuckles from the MPs.																								But a CPM member of the panel, Varkala Radhakrishnan, told Sen that journalists wouldnt be amused.																								Radhakrishnan reminded the envoy that members of the media, at whom Sen said the comments were directed, didnt enjoy the constitutional privilege of taking cognisance of and acting against offensive remarks. Therefore, it is all the more improper of you to say such things about journalists, the MP said. Sen also submitted an explanation in writing to the committee, which will meet again on October 31 to finalise its report, to be sent to speaker Somnath Chatterjee. 																								The report will be tabled during the winter session.																								A member of the panel said todays apology should be accepted and Sen pardoned. We will suggest that no further proceedings are initiated against him, the member said.																								The ambassador will have to appear before the Rajya Sabhas privileges committee on November 2.																								If Sen is pardoned, he might count himself lucky. Similar panels have cracked the whip in the past. Journalist R.K. Karanjia, who had been critical of Jawaharlal Nehru and Parliament, was summoned to the bar of the Lok Sabha, which itself is a punishment, and rapped.																								A deputy secretary at the Centre was reprimanded for having wilfully misled the panel. Former Lok Sabha secretary-general Subhash Kashyap was admonished for comments he made about the Speaker.

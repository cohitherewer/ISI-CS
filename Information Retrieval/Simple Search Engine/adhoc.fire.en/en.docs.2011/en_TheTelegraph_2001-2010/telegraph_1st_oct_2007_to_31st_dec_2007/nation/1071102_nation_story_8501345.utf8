				 Karat keeps barbs on hold 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 1: Prakash Karat today steered clear of barbs against the UPA government on the nuclear deal while iterating the Lefts opposition to Indias strategic alliance with American imperialism.																								The CPM general secretary, addressing party workers in Howrah and Calcutta, appeared careful not to spoil the mood of cordiality created by his salute to the Prime Ministers integrity.																								Karat did touch on the nuclear deal, either to record a success or criticise the US, not to make threats. Our success in the last three months, if any, was to engage the government in the debate on the nuclear agreement and make it listen to us, which it had earlier refused to do, Karat said. 																								The general secretary asked party workers to prepare for the CPM congress, saying it would be held on schedule in March.																								This, along with his remarks in The Telegraph that he saw no reason the government should not last its full term, was seized by some leaders as an indication that mid-term polls are unlikely, at least not in the first quarter of 2008.																								However, another section pointed out that the government has yet to give any explicit assurance that it would not go ahead with steps to operationalise the deal. The absence of an assurance leaves all possibilities open.																								Despite the show of tactical politeness, the anti-American rhetoric wasnt muffled. Karat declared that his party wouldnt rest until the design to make India a subordinate ally and strategic partner of the US imperialism is foiled. The Left believed the nuclear agreement was part of the strategic alliance, he said.																								The comments came with forecasts of a stormy winter session, from November 15. The Americans are more eager to operationalise the agreement since they are asking India to hurry up. The Left has to play a crucial role in Parliament and outside to thwart the game.																								Karat made it clear that the CPM would fight the twin dangers of communalism and imperialism simultaneously. The remarks appeared directed at those within the party who considered the BJP a bigger threat.																								But party veteran Jyoti Basu sought to keep the focus firmly on communalism. Speaking at the opening session of the womens wing of the CPM, Basu said the aim of supporting the UPA was to keep the BJP-led communal forces at bay.

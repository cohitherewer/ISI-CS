 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Stinging pinprick by ATM thief				 																																																										Writing down your ATM pin code can be dangerous. Ask Neena Andrews (name changed).				 																																																										The 30-year-old had carried her ATM card and a scrap of paper with her pin number scribbled on it to a gym. While she worked out, someone was at work at an ATM, withdrawing Rs 12,000 from her account.				 																																																										Her locker at Gold Gym in Lokhandwala had been opened and her Saraswat Bank ATM card stolen.				 																																																										Neena, a garment exporter and resident of Andheri, registered an FIR at Oshiwara police station.				 																																																										The card, along with the pin code slip, was missing from the locker and someone had withdrawn Rs 12,000 from a Juhu ATM while I was working out in the gym, she told police.				 																																																										Situated at Heera Panna mall in Lokhandwala, the gym is frequented by celebs, including Shahid Kapur, Rimi Sen, Deepika Padukone and Rakhi Sawant. 				 																																																										Neena alleged in her complaint that lockers provided by the gym were not safe. Although my valuables were locked, I found that anyone could access it with the keys of other lockers, she said. 				 																																																										According to a policeman, criminals take up temporary membership in posh gyms across the city and leave after cleaning out lockers.				 																Storm in a T-shirt				 																																																										Casuals can cause serious distress, as a constable at Raj Bhavan discovered the other day. 				 																																																										Subbiah, assigned security duty for visiting Bulgarian Prime Minister S. Staines, caused a flutter at the governors house when he stepped off an autorickshaw in a T-shirt carrying an AK-47.				 																																																										The guards at the gate could not recognise their colleague and surrounded the stranger. After extensive questioning, they realised it was Subbiah.				 																																																										The constable later explained to the guards that he forgot to change into his uniform as he got late. 				 																																																										The Raj Bhavan security staff then contacted Subbiahs office and verified his credentials. However, an inquiry has been ordered into the constables conduct.				 																Scorpios in terror drive				 																																																										Its Scorpio all the way for the terror-stung Andhra Pradesh government. It plans to replace all VIP vehicles with the SUVs.				 																																																										So, off with the 100-odd bullet-proof Ambassadors and Tata Safaris. Each Scorpio will cost the government Rs 8-15 lakh. Another Rs 5 lakh will go into making the vehicle bullet- and mine-proof. 				 																																																										Besides chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy, some handpicked politicians and police top guns are among the 60-odd VIPs provided bullet-proof vehicles.				 																																																										The recent bomb blasts and the growing Maoist menace have put the police on their toes. 				 																																																										The Scorpio move is part of the governments Rs 882-crore plan to strengthen the police to combat terror. The drive includes recruitment of 37,000 policemen over the next five years and the creation of a 1,600-strong anti-terror force called Octopus.				 																Pen power				 																																																										Between managing the countrys security, home minister Shivraj Patil has found the time to write two books. One is a collection of poems and the other a synopsis of Bhagvad Gita.				 																																																										While the collection of poems is almost complete, the book on Bhagvad Gita will be released by the month-end, Congress leader Pradip Rathi said.				 																																																										The poetry collection, titled Fragrance of Inner Self, runs into 100 pages and the book on Gita will be around 150 pages, Rathi, who is Patils close associate, said.				 																																																										Both books are being published by the ministers daughter-in-law Archana.				 																																																										Next in Patils pipleline is How Politicians Should Behave. A hot cake for sure.				 																																																	Delhi: Heres one artist who likes to keep his paintings simple. Anand Karmakar presents an exhibition of his paintings of the feminine in various forms at Shanta Art Gallery this Thursday. The venue: 8, Birbal Road, Jangpura Extension.

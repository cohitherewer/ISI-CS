 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Setu row fuels Ramayan sales				 																																																										Publishers of Ramayan might consider giving M. Karunanidhi a slice of their royalty for opening a new chapter of gains.				 																																																										Sales of the text have zoomed to a new high after the chief ministers controversial remarks over the Sethusamudram project. Bookstores, too, have been quick to turn the raging setu row into a marketing opportunity.				 																																																										Even small outlets are stacking Tamil translations of Valimikis Ramayan. Many are offering attractive discounts.				 																																																										Pick up a Tamil translation of Valmiki Ramayan at an attractive price reads a promo in a shop in the Mylapore area. The tome, an authentic translation from Sanskrit, has been published by the Gorakhpur-based Geeta Press, reputable publishers of Hindu religious texts.				 																																																										Karunanidhi himself fuelled, though unwittingly, the rush for the texts by citing a translation in the columns of DMK mouthpiece Murasoli. He asked critics of his controversial remarks to look up the Ramayan translated into Tamil by scholar C.R. Sreenivasa Ayyangar. 				 																																																										Many find it ironical that sales of the text should get a fillip from the words of a non-believer like Karunanidhi.				 																RTI notice to varsity				 																																																										The Central Information Commission has slapped a showcause notice on Delhi University for a delayed response to an appeal under the Right to Information Act. 				 																																																										Vandana Rai, a research associate in the universitys department of plant and molecular biology, had filed the application seeking to know why she was not selected for the posts of lecturer and reader. 				 																																																										Under the act, the university was required to reply within 30 days. Her application, filed on January 5 this year, received a reply on July 9, more than six months beyond the deadline. 				 																																																										Though the commission upheld the contents of the reply, the information watchdog has asked the university to explain why it should not be fined for the delay. Under the act, delays are punishable with a fine of Rs 250 per day. 				 																Coach clash sparks siege				 																																																										Women angry over losing some of their exclusive bogies in a rush-hour train nearly laid siege to a Navi Mumbai station recently.				 																																																										The trouble began over a new timetable under which some extra coaches of the 9.14am local from Vashi to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus  one of the most popular services for office-goers were opened to all.				 																																																										But even after the changes were introduced, the women refused to leave the bogies and stopped the men from entering. They claimed that their appeals to railway authorities went unheeded. 				 																																																										We decided that we would occupy the compartments that had been allotted to women earlier. We spread the message among regular commuters, who supported us, said Shilpa Karkera, a bank employee who was among those who led the protests.				 																																																										Authorities said they had set aside extra coaches in an earlier train, at 8.47am, but the commuters argue that the facility should be provided after 9am, when the crowd peaks. The special compartments have allotted to another local. Women commuters may not be aware of it, a railway official claimed.				 																Vision panel				 																																																										A team of eminent experts will help lay the roadmap to make Delhi a world-class city. The panel, headed by Lieutenant Governor Tejendra Khanna, will suggest ways to achieve the goals in Delhis master plan for 2021. 				 																																																										The committee, the Delhi vision group, includes Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Delhi Metro chief E. Sreedharan, Delhi University vice-chancellor Deepak Pental and others. Chief minister Sheila Dikshit will be vice-chairman of the group, which will meet every six months.				 																																																	Delhi: From tiny lampshades to luxurious sofas and shelves, Italian- designed household items are on display at the Lalit Kala Academy, Rabindra Bhawan. The venue is walking distance from the Mandi House Metro station. The exhibition is open between 11am and 7pm.

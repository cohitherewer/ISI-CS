Price bad taste for paddy JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Oct. 1: The government plans to hike the price of wheat purchased directly from farmers by Rs 350 a quintal while giving paddy-growers a raise of Rs 64 only.																								The proposal, loaded against the south and the east (both paddy-growing regions) and favouring the north (known for its wheat bowls), has been made in a note circulated to the cabinet committee on economic affairs.																								Government agencies, such as the Food Corporation of India, buy wheat and paddy for sale at subsidised rates through ration shops and to create a grain buffer.																								Food ministry officials said leaders from Andhra Pradesh had cried foul at the apparent bias. The wheat price is being raised partly because of pressure from Punjab and Haryana politicians, an official said. 																								Andhra chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy has written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asking for paddy prices on a par with that of wheat from this winter. He said the current difference was highly discriminatory. 																								In 2001, the Centre paid Rs 510 for a quintal of paddy and Rs 570 for wheat. The difference was Rs 60 then. Last year, the gap was Rs 240 a quintal. This time, it is Rs 325, the official said.																								The ministry has blamed hardening global wheat prices  a result of crop failure in many parts of the world  for the difference. 																								But the explanation has not cut much ice. In Andhra, where the FCI made almost 20 per cent of its total purchases last year, the demand for higher paddy prices has united political rivals: Telugu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu has written to Singh asking for a higher price. 																								Such a demand has not come from Bengal, another large paddy-growing state, probably because the central purchases from there are limited. Only 5 lakh tonnes of the FCIs total purchase of 250 lakh tonnes come from the state.																								Officials said the bias has deepened at a time two-thirds of the Centres buffer stock is made up of rice. We will have a problem if rice farmers shift to other crops, the official said.

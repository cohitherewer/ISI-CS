				 Jail threat for killer Blueline drivers
 MANDIRA NAYAR 				 	 The Blueline bus that ran over seven persons on Sunday																								New Delhi, Oct. 8: Delhi police have decided to use the threat of a prison term to rein in rash Blueline bus drivers.																								The decision, announced this evening, comes a day after a Blueline bus mowed down seven persons and injured six near the Delhi-Haryana border, taking the toll this year to 94. 																								We will now charge drivers under the Indian Penal Code in addition to the Motor Vehicles Act. Drivers will be charged with rash and negligent driving and arrested immediately, said a Delhi police spokesperson.																								The police will also monitor drivers against whom action has been taken. Fifty police control vans will be stationed across the capital to catch errant drivers. 																								The Delhi administration received a tongue-lashing from the high court today, which said the capitals public transport system was worse than that of a banana republic. 																								It issued notices to the Blueline Association, the Delhi government and Manish Kakar, the owner of the bus that killed seven persons yesterday. 																								Expressing shock over the ease with which the buses continued to ply, a division bench of Justices Mukul Mudgal and Reve Kheterpal sought from the government a list of MLAs, MPs, policemen and their relatives who own such vehicles.																								The judges said in the case of accidents, the accused would not be released from police custody without the courts permission. Human life is precious. Now the court will monitor the situation. This (yesterdays) incident is a catalyst for us.																								It is becoming shocking day by day, the bench said. Even in a banana republic, the transport system wont be like this.																								The judges said the Supreme Courts guidelines to buses in the capital had been completely forgotten. 																								Its a mockery of the Supreme Court order.																								The Delhi government has tried several options to check accidents  from pulling the Blueline fleet off the roads to installing speed governors on the buses. But nothing has worked. 																								The much-hyped speed governors  they ensure that vehicles cannot go beyond 40kmph and were introduced this summer after a spate of fatal crashes  are practically useless as they can be easily tampered with, according to experts. Yesterdays bus had fixed the speed limit without breaking the seal.																								Delhi transport minister Haroon Yusuf has asked officials to list all possible ways in which bus owners can tamper with speed governors. 																								Sources claimed the government was soft on the matter as the buses are owned by local politicians. 																								Experts underlined the need for better infrastructure.																								The road infrastructure in the city needs to be designed to make it commuter-friendly, said Gitam Tiwari, a professor at Delhi IITs transport research and injury prevention programme.

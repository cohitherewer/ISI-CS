				 Car breather for Sushmita
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 11: Bombay High Court today set aside the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporations decision to impose a penalty of over Rs 23 lakh on actress Sushmita Sen for evasion of octroi on the purchase of her Toyota Landcruiser.																								However, the court also issued showcause notices to Sushmita and NRI Vasu Tamani asking why action should not be taken against them for fraudulently importing the sports utility vehicle, which cost Rs 41 lakh. The actress and her car dealer have been given six weeks time to reply.																								The high court directive came during the hearing of a petition filed by Sushmita challenging the BMC notice sent to her in August asking her to pay Rs 2,16,998 as octroi on the car bought by her in 2005 and Rs 23.86 lakh in penalties for evading the duty.																								BMC authorities said the Landcruiser had been valued at Rs 41 lakh, hence the duty.																								On receiving the BMC notice, Sen had shot off a letter to the BMC commissioner, Johny Joseph, stating that she was willing to pay the octroi, but not the steep penalties. She subsequently filed a petition challenging the imposition of penalties ten times the octroi. 																								BMC counsel C.U. Singh said: We are yet to see the final order. The high court allowed her petition and set aside the corporations decision to impose the penalty on the grounds that it was beyond the civic bodys powers to impose such a penalty. The court said only a magistrate could impose such a penalty for octroi evasion after convicting a person under specific sections.																								Sushmita had told this paper last year that she had acquired the Landcruiser from a well-known car dealer under a lease agreement in 2005.

				 Raje chopper raises dust
 							 - Global tender shortlists model, does not call for bids RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR				 	 The 15-seater Agusta Westland- 39 helicopter																								Jaipur, Nov. 13: Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje is caught in a twirl over a chopper deal.																								A global tender issued by her government for the purchase of helicopters has kicked up a row because instead of calling for bids from makers, it has already specified the company and the model intended to be bought.																								The 15-seater Agusta Westland-139 (AW-139), costing Rs 40 crore, has been named in the tender document put out by the Rajasthan Civil Aviation Corporation Limited. 																								The Opposition Congress has questioned the move, saying there was little point in issuing the tender if the model, the company and the amount to be spent had been decided.																								There is something fishy. What is the point of a global tender with only one company mentioned? When they have already decided on the AW-139 helicopter, the tender notice is a mere formality and seems farcical, state Congress president C. P. Joshi said.																								Some slammed the deal as a waste of public money. Raje cant run the state on the lines of a royal family and the public cannot suffer because of her lavish lifestyle and tastes. The BJP government already has two aircraft and a helicopter. Where is the need to buy more of them? Congress vice-president Raghu Sharma said.																								An Agusta chopper (A-109 E model) was bought for the chief minister at a cost of Rs 20 crore two years ago, while a Rs 25-crore aircraft was ordered last year. More than Rs 2 crore has been spent on luxury cars for her ministers.																								The AW-139, developed by Italys Agusta and British company Westland, is a relatively new chopper that made its maiden flight in 2004. Used largely for offshore military sorties or to ferry VIPs over short distances, the model hasnt been tested in desert conditions, aviation experts said.																								In Rajasthan, temperatures often soar above 40C. The experts said the AW-139 is suited for use between -40C and 40C.																								Parliamentary affairs minister Rajendra Singh Rathore dismissed the allegations of irregularities, saying a panel of aviation experts and pilots had shortlisted three companies, one each from France, the UK and the US. 																								Asked why AW-139 had been specified in the tender, he said: We already have an Agusta helicopter. The cost of maintaining a new one (of the same make) would be lower as we have the facilities. Experts have conducted tests and then picked the AW-139. There is nothing irregular about the deal. He denied any waste of public funds, saying the chopper would be useful during natural disasters.																								But the explanation has not worked. A special Congress panel formed to highlight the alleged instances of corruption in the Raje government will examine the deal and raise it at a protest rally on December 8, which marks the fourth anniversary of the BJPs rule.

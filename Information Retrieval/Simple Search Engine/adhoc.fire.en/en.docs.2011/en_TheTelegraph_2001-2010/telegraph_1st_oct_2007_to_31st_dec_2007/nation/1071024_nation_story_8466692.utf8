				 Junta massage amp; message for UN
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 23: India played the perfect host to the UNs special envoy on Myanmar but not at the cost of its pragmatic relationship with the junta.																								I am very satisfied with all my meetings, which have been at the highest level, said Ibrahim Gambari, who has been touring the region to spread the message that Myanmars neighbours must do much more to bring about a peaceful reconciliation between the military and pro-democracy activists.																								Delhi went out of its way to make the former Nigerian foreign minister and the current UN chiefs special emissary feel at home, arranging meetings that included one with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.																								I have reason to believe that India will do whatever it can with Myanmar, Gambari told a media conference.																								But an Indian foreign office statement was more cautious. Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, the release said, had pointed out that he had spoken to his Myanmarese counterpart U Nyan Win when he was in New York and stressed the need to expedite political reform and the national reconciliation process.																								Delhi is unwilling to compromise its relations with the Myanmarese junta for fear that Yangons other big neighbour, China, will step into the vacuum. 																								Reflecting the concern, the foreign office statement added: As a close and friendly neighbour, India has multi-dimensional linkages with Myanmar. Consequently, initiatives should be mindful of the need for a peaceful and stable Myanmar. 																								Gambaris media conference seemed like a subtle exercise on the UNs part to remind India of its democratic responsibilities. Asked if India could do more, Gambari replied: Theoretically, of course, everyone can do more.

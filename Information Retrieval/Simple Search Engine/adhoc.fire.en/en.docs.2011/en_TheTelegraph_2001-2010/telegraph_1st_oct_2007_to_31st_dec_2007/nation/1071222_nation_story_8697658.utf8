				 Little Bengal not enough for Taslima

				 	 Taslima: No alternative
																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: Taslima Nasreen was offered secure accommodation in Chittaranjan Park, the Bengali hub in south Delhi, so that she would feel at home but the author insisted Calcutta had no alternative, sources said.
																								Taslima kept insisting that she wants to go to Calcutta, an official said a day after it was disclosed that the Centre told her that the demand to visit the Bengal capital could not be accommodated.
																								Taslima apparently wants to be in Calcutta to attend the annual book fair but Delhi has ruled that out. She can stay in Delhi with her security taken care of. The ball is in her court now. We just hope she doesnt make things more difficult for us, another official said.
																								He said there was no change in the Centres stand and all it did was convey the message that her presence in Calcutta could precipitate matters. On Taslimas complaint that she was under house arrest, he said the security threat demanded restrictions from which there was no escape.
																								However, if she persisted with her rigid stand, the Centre would have no option but to ask her to leave once her visa expired on February 17, 2008, he said. The government did not want things to come to such a pass, he added.
																								The sources said the Centre had tried to accommodate her wishes and make her stay as comfortable as possible.
																								The CPM steered clear of the controversy, saying the matter was in the Centres domain. The state government (in Bengal) has nothing to do with it, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said.

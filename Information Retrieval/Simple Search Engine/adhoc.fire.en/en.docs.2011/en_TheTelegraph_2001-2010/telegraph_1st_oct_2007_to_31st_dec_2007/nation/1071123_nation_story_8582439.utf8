 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Man weds dog to battle curse				 																																																										At 33, Selvakumar, almost weary of his failure to find a bride, was desperate to shake off his dog days.				 																																																										Then, his astrologer offered him a possible reason for, and a way out of, his predicament. Selvakumars problems, he was told, was the result of a curse that befell him because hed killed a dog in its moment of intimacy. The astrologer suggested that Selvakumar marry a dog.				 																																																										Diligently following the advice, Selvakumar set about changing the course of his destiny and told his family about the plan. Aghast relatives tried to dissuade him, saying the bizarre act would embarrass them all.				 																																																										But in no time, the bride, a demure-looking female dog, aptly named Selvi, was arranged and decked for the big day  in a gleaming red saree and marigold garlands.				 																																																										A crowd of 100 in the village, in Tamil Nadus Sivaganga, witnessed the proceedings as Selvakumar tied the mangalsutra on Selvi. A feast followed the wedding ceremony. The astrologer has told the young man that the good effects will come six months after the rituals.				 																Toll tax in higher gear				 																																																										Commercial vehicles will have to pay more to drive into the capital.				 																																																										The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has jacked up the toll tax rates, the first such increase in seven years, in a move that will boost its revenues by Rs 60 crore this year. But the higher levy could also tell on the prices of essentials that have to be brought in from other states.				 																																																										Taxis, tempos and three-wheelers will have to pay Rs 35, a rise of Rs 10. Buses and trucks will be charged Rs 70 instead of Rs 50. Mayor Aarti Mehra said the sum raised from the increase would be spent on development projects.				 																																																										Diesel and petrol rates have been raised several times. The cost of the vehicles has also almost doubled in the past few years. Hence, this step was inevitable, she said. 				 																Film revives crash shivers				 																																																										The worlds worst mid-air plane collision, over the Delhi skies on November 12, 1996, has come alive again, this time on television.				 																																																										Miditech, one of Asias largest independent production houses, has prepared an investigative docudrama  documentary-cum-drama  which examines the reasons that could have led to the disaster. 				 																																																										The film, which some might have watched on the National Geographic channel earlier this week, pieces together the final moments before the collision between the Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin-76 and a Saudi Arabian Boeing 747. 				 																																																										The villages of Charkhi and Dadri (located in neighbouring Haryana), where the debris fell, were the starting points for the investigation behind the film. The team from Miditech examined both planes logbooks that had been left behind on that fateful day. Transcripts were also studied to compile data for the film. 				 																																																										The findings of the Justice Lahoti Commission, which inquired into the collision, have also been incorporated in the film as inputs on what still remains one of scariest days the capital has seen in its recent history.				 																Green pat				 																																																										The capital won hosannas from an unlikely guest and for an unusual feat not many Indian cities can boast of.				 																																																										London mayor Ken Livingstone heaped praise on the citys drive to protect its green cover by planting trees.				 																																																										This is a database of trees we plan to plant that can survive for decades, combating the threats of climate change, Livingstone said here at a seminar attended by chief minister Sheila Dikshit and other environment experts. 				 																																																	Delhi: Enjoy an evening of Jazz from Europe at Ficci auditorium, a two-minute walk from the Mandi House Metro station, this Friday. Chet Baker Tribute from Norway, Caf Du Sport from Germany and Sascha Ley from Belgium are some of the bands that will perform. Time: 6.30pm.

				 Call shield in six days
 JAYATI GHOSE																								New Delhi, Oct. 5: The national do-not-call registry kicks in from October 12.																								Landline and cellphone subscribers who registered their numbers before August 31 will be protected against telemarketing calls from next Friday, an official of telecom authority Trai said.																								Those who got their phone numbers listed on the national do-not-call (NDNC) registry after August 31 must wait till November 25.																								Only 65 lakh among the countrys 24.1 crore telephone subscribers  2.6 per cent  will be shielding themselves from unwanted calls and messages, though.																								Only those who registered through their telecom service providers will get the relief, the Trai official said.																								The regulator cannot govern calls made to subscribers who have registered themselves individually with banks, credit card companies and other such agencies for do-not-call services.																								Trai has advised telemarketers to register themselves with the department of telecommunications at the earliest.																								They have been given some more time to register themselves with service providers and the DoT before the government cancels their licence to make calls or send text messages, the official said.																								Telemarketers will be fined Rs 500 for every call or text message to a number on the NDNC registry. A second offence will double the fine. For a third such call, a telemarketer would risk losing his phone connection even if he is registered with the DoT.																								Trai says that 15,000 telemarketers have so far applied with telecom service providers to get themselves registered with the DoT. About 25,000 to 30,000 telemarketers operate in the country, making over 1,000 crore unsolicited calls every year.																								Mobile users can get their numbers on the NDNC registry by contacting their service providers through a text message, a call or even a letter, or by logging on to the company website. They can also register their phone numbers on www.ndncregistry.com.

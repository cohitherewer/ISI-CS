				 Scientists robbed at sea
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Oct. 10: Some  unknown persons climbed into a boat carrying six scientists  from the National Institute of Oceanography off the coast  of Udipi, Karnataka, and attempted to take away scientific  instruments, NIO sources said today. 																								All the six scientists are safe, but it is still unclear whether the persons who boarded the boat two days ago took away the instruments or threw them into the sea, the sources said. 																								The scientists had geophysical survey instruments on their rented boat and were sailing in shallow water when the group came on their own boat. NIO sources declined to speculate whether they were pirates of fishermen. 																								Our primary concern was safety of the scientists, and weve been busy getting them into a secure area near the New Mangalore port, Satish Shetye, director of the NIO, Panaji, told The Telegraph. 																								Well have details of the incident after weve debriefed them, he said. The scientists, who are from the NIOs regional centre in Vishakhapatnam, will fly back from Mangalore tonight. 																								Shetye said he could not give details of which instruments had been lost. 																								There have been instances in the past when fishermen have objected to NIO scientists carrying out routine marine surveys near their fishing zones. 																								They perhaps feel that it will interfere with their fishing activities, one scientist said. 																								One marine research team from the NIO had to endure long arguments with dozens of fishermen a few years ago when it was attempting to carry out surveys off the coast near the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. 																								On one occasion, a metal instrument that NIO scientists had placed in a shallow region of the sea, just three metres deep, off the coast of Ratnagiri (Maharashtra) was picked up by people from a coastal village, presumably to be sold as scrap. 																								The scientists had to plead with the village panchayat to get it back. 																								Three years ago, NIO scientists engaged in underwater inspection of the Sri Salem dam in Andhra Pradesh were detained by suspected Naxalites who took away their wireless communication and video recording equipment.

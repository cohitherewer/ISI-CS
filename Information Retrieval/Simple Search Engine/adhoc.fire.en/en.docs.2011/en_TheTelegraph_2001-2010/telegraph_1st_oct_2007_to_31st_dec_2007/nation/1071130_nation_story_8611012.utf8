				 AIIMS strike off
 OUR BUREAU 																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: Doctors at AIIMS called off their strike this afternoon after being threatened with cancellation of licence and a pay cut.																								If they (resident doctors) go on strike, their salaries should be deducted and their licences should be cancelled, Delhi High Court said. 																								In the morning, doctors in most departments had skipped work though the strike was originally to be limited to the outpatient department. 																								I came here just after 7am and was told to wait. The queue built up, but there was no movement. Only around 10am was I told that doctors are on strike, said Raghunath Tripathi, a farmer from Bihar waiting for a check-up in the gastro-enterology department.																								But faced with action after the court order, the resident doctors called off the strike against a bill that will end the tenure of AIIMS director P. Venugopal. Instead, they moved Supreme Court against the AIIMS Act amendments passed by Parliament. 																								We will wait for the verdict of the Supreme Court before deciding whether to continue our protests, said Kumar Harsh, the president of the AIIMS Resident Doctors Association. 																								The petition was filed on behalf of the faculty association, which said the changes would erode the autonomy of the institution. 																								Another petition was filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of Venugopal, against a proviso that fixes the directors retirement age at 65. The retrospective effect affects only the petitioner, Dr Venugopal, and none else. The petition is unconstitutional, it said. 																								BJP boycott																								The BJP today boycotted the Rajya Sabha for the whole day against the passage of the AIIMS bill and handed a written complaint to the House chairperson. Later, spokesperson Sushma Swaraj had a tough time explaining to the media why the BJP was going to such lengths for a doctor who faces the charge of politicising AIIMS and whose term was to have ended in July according to his appointment letter.

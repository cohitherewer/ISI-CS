				 Weeks wait for Sanjay
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT				 File picture of Sanjay Dutt outside a Mumbai court																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: Sanjay Dutts hopes of securing bail rose today with the Supreme Court saying it would mainly consider the length of convicts sentences when it hears their petitions on November 27.																								The actor, serving a six-year term at Punes Yerwada jail, has a lighter sentence compared with many of the 1993 Bombay blast accused.																								We will hear all bail petitions filed in the blasts case next Tuesday, the court said when the petitions of Sanjay, Yusuf Nullwala, Zaibunissa Kazi and Samir Hingora came up before it.																								The bench indicated it would pass a general order and that anyone who fell within its scope would get bail.																								We cannot go into the merits of the charges or the evidence at this stage. So we will pass orders depending on the term of the sentence, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said.																								Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium, appearing for the CBI, had urged the court to make a distinction between the main conspirators and those peripheral to the plot while granting bail.																								This yardstick, too, would have favoured Sanjay. The trial court had acquitted the actor of all charges under the anti-terror law Tada and sentenced him to six years under the Arms Act for illegal possession of firearms.																								Sanjays lawyer V.R. Manohar seized on this point today to argue that the Tada restrictions on bail for terror convicts should not apply to his client.																								Hingoras lawyer said his client, given nine years under Tada for supplying weapons to Sanjay, had already spent more than six years in prison and undergone heart surgery.																								Nullwala, a friend of Sanjay, was convicted of destroying the actors weapon and given five years. Kazi, 64, was awarded a five-year term for helping an aide of gangster Abu Salem carry the weapons from Sanjays home to her house.

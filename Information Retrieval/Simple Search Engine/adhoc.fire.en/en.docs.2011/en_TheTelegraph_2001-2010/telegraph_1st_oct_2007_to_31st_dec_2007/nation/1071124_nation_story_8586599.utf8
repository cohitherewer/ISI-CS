 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 A bomb blanket covers a live bomb recovered from the Lucknow civil court complex. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Nov. 23: The BJP will press for a Parliament debate on internal security next week to corner the Centre over todays serial blasts in Uttar Pradesh.																								The party, which blamed the UPA regimes soft stance for the increase in terror strikes, will demand that the government tell the nation about the preventive measures taken after similar attacks in the past three years. 																								The issue has come up in almost every session since the UPA assumed office, and todays explosions have prompted the BJP to turn the heat on the government again. 																								The message the party appeared keen to send out was that it was the Centres lack of will that was the biggest stumbling block to the nations fight against terror.																								Opposition leader L.K. Advani left little doubt today that the matter would be raised forcefully, saying the spate of serial blasts, which require elaborate planning, pointed clearly towards an intelligence failure.																								Advani, speaking in the Lok Sabha after the blasts, pointed out that such attacks were spreading from Delhi and Mumbai to other parts of the country.Unlike his party, he stopped short of directly blaming the government for todays blasts, though in the past he had accused the government of having failed to tackle terror because of its attitude and vote-bank politics. 																								The Centre will make a detailed statement on Monday but the BJP plans to demand an explanation from home minister Shivraj Patil on the action taken in specific cases. 																								BJP chief Rajnath Singh, who will visit Varanasi, Lucknow and Faizabad tomorrow along with senior leader Murli Manohar Joshi, said the attacks were a result of the governments soft approach towards terrorism.																								Terrorists are striking at will. It is a challenge to the rule of law, he said.

																								Calcutta, Dec. 19: A babys death sparked a rampage at Chittaranjan Seva Sadan today after the family blamed it on wrong blood transfusion by the hospital.
																								One-and-a-half-month-old Bishan Kumar was admitted to the hospital on December 14 with fever and died at 5am today.
																								Father Dinesh Shaw, a tea-stall owner in Kidderpore, said the hospital asked him to bring blood twice yesterday. The first time, I brought one unit of blood from SSKM Hospital. Later, they asked me again and I brought another two units of blood from Life Care Blood Bank on Linton Street, he said.
																								The Telegraph found out from SSKM and Life Care that Bishans relatives had collected blood of the same group (+) from both places.
																								But Shaw claims that when he arrived with the blood from Life Care, a nurse exclaimed that the child was being given blood of the wrong group.
																								The nurse called up a doctor and immediately stopped the blood that was being given to my son and started giving the blood I had brought from Life Care, he said.
																								A senior health department official said an inquiry has been started. We are looking into the matter. We cannot comment before conducting a thorough investigation, the official added. 
																								Severe anaemia and other medical complications were given as the cause of death in the certificate issued by the hospital. 
																								But the childs family insisted there was negligence and went on a rampage, smashing hospital furniture and pushing doctors and other staff around.
																								A team from Bhowanipore police station had to go to control the mob. 
																								The mob turned violent alleging that medical negligence caused the death of the infant. Our team from Bhowanipore police station immediately rushed to the spot and finally managed to control the mob, said Vineet Goyel, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

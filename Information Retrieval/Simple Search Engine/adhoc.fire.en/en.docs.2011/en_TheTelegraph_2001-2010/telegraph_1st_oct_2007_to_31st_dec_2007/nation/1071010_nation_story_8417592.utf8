				 Life term for honour killings 
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 9: The Supreme Court today condemned honour killings but stopped short of handing out the death penalty to the relatives of a Sikh girl who wiped out the family of her lower-caste husband in 1999. 																								The trial court had handed the capital punishment to four relatives but the high court reduced them to life terms.																								Rajvinder Singh married Ravinder Singh secretly as her family didnt approve of his status and caste. Ravinder was from the Matharu Ramgariah caste of artisans, while Rajvinder was a Jat Sikh, an upper caste. 																								When Rajvinders parents, Baldev Singh Sardar and Maya Kaur, came to know of the marriage, they solemnised a second wedding at a gurudwara between their daughter and a groom of their choice. However, soon after, Rajvinder shifted out of her parents place, in Panvel near Mumbai, and began living with Ravinders family.																								Rajvinders mother and an aunt, Nirmal, went to her home one night and demanded that she return the jewellery and clothes shed taken. 																								She handed back the items and the two left, but minutes later, other relatives, including Rajvinders father and uncles, stormed the house with weapons and pushed her off the balcony. 																								Wounded, she crawled to the house of a neighbour, who called police. But by the time the officers arrived, Ravinder, his brother Harvinder and parents Dilip and Lakhwinder were dead. 																								The trial court awarded death to four relatives and life imprisonment to her mother and aunt. Father Baldev and another relative were acquitted. The high court changed the death penalties to life. 																								Today, the Supreme Court said it fell within the rarest of the rare cases that deserve death penalty but did not strike down the high court ruling.

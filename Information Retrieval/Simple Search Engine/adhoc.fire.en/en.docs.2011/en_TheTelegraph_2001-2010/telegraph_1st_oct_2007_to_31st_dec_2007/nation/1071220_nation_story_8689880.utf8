				 Maoist top guns land in net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Hyderabad, Dec. 19: Two Maoist top guns from Andhra Pradesh have been arrested in the past week, jolting the rebels at a time their jailbreaks and prison revolts are making headlines.
																								Raji Reddy was picked up from Keralas Ernakulam on Monday, while Sagar alias Panduranga Reddy was held in Chennai with wife Madhavi and an aide last week.
																								Raji Reddy, a central committee member of the CPI (Maoists), was a contemporary of Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, who had helped raise the rebels armed division. Sagar, also part of the central committee, was an area commander in Gunturs Nallamala region.
																								Sagar was produced in a court in Markapuram in Prakasam district but Raji Reddy has yet to appear before one.
																								Raji Reddy, a Class X dropout from Karimnagar, has over 87 cases against him since he joined the Peoples War Group in 1974. In the 90s, he was called Toofan (storm) for his dare-devil ways. His wife Nirmalakka was allegedly killed in a 1998 encounter in Chhattisgarhs Bastar. 
																								Raji Reddy carried a reward of Rs 15 lakh on his head. The bounty for Sagar, who faces 21 cases, was Rs 12 lakh. 
																								Maoist poet Varavara Rao, balladeer Gaddar and rights activist Bhim Reddy  Raji Reddys brother  have urged home minister K. Jana Reddy to ensure the safety of the duo. 
																								Rajamma, Raji Reddys mother, and Bhim have filed a habeas corpus petition in Andhra Pradesh High Court to have him produced in court.
																								The arrests come days after TV channel reporter Srisailam Yadav was picked up for alleged links with the rebels. He has since been remanded in judicial custody.
																								A spate of arrests and surrenders this year have rattled the Maoists. Key rebels felled in encounters include Mattam Ravi Kumar, Sande Rajmouli and V. Chandramouli. The police said 1,075 rebels have been arrested this year compared to 763 in 2006.
																								The encounters have fanned fears that Raji Reddy might meet the same fate. We want to ensure that Raji Reddy is not bumped off like Chandramouli and Rajmouli, who were brought from Bangalore and killed in the forests, said Raghunath, a leader of the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee.
																								We have broken their hegemony in the Nallamala forest belt from where they kept supporting their cadres in Chhattisgarh, state police chief S.S.P. Yadav said.
																								The crackdown has been intensified in the past month, leading to the surrenders of two commanders who were steering operations in neighbouring Orissa and Chhattisgarh.

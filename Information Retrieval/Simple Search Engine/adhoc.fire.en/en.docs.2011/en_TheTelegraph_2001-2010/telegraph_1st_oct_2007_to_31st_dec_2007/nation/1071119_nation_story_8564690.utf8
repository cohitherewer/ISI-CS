 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Search for roots in long-lost river				 																																																										Call it a pilgrimage to connect with ones roots in an ancient river. Over 200 members of the estimated 25,000-strong community of Chitrapur Saraswats congregated in the capital recently to travel to the foothills of the Siwaliks. 				 																																																										Led by their spiritual leader Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji, the pilgrims collected a bit of the residual water of what they believe is the Saraswati river that emerges in the plains at Adibadri, 90km from Kurukshetra.				 																																																										The Saraswats believe they are the descendants of Vedic-age people who migrated after the Saraswati dried up. Geological evidence points to the existence of a large river with the Yamuna on its east and the Sutlej on its west as its tributaries. Natural events are believed to have caused it to dry up between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago. 				 																																																										The water from Adibadri will be ferried to the communitys heritage institution in Shirali (Karnataka), part of a larger effort to collect water from Indias nine great rivers by early next year to mark the institutions 300th year				 																Governor keeps em on toes				 																																																										At 83, he may be near retirement as governor, but N.D. Tiwari still has enough left in him to give his aides in Raj Bhavan and the Y.S.R. Reddy regime enough to worry about.				 																																																										The tantrums apparently began from the time he took charge in August. Days after he moved in, the Uttarakhand politician threw a fuss over what he said was stinking cutlery, stationery and furnishings. Officials were asked to have them replaced immediately.				 																																																										Tiwari, known to have an entourage of at least 10, is miffed easily at the slightest of slips in protocol and deference. 				 																																																										The governor has also been taking swipes at the government. Weary of his utterances, the chief minister raised the issue with the higher-ups in the Congress but was told he would have to tolerate him for some time now.				 																Devdasi hint in shrine raid				 																																																										The devdasi system of dedicating young girls to the service of temples under an oppressive feudal social order has long been legally abolished but its remnants still rear their ugly head in parts of Tamil Nadu. In one such case early this month, police rescued a 12-year-old minutes before she was about to be dedicated in a ceremony at a Durga temple in a village near Villupuram.				 																																																										A handful of villagers, mostly the elderly who were present at the event, were taken away for questioning along with the priest who was conducting the ceremony. District authorities have promised the poor girl scholarship to help her pursue her studies in school. 				 																																																										Under the traditional devdasi system, girls were given away to temples where they displayed their skills in classical dance and music but often ended up being exploited sexually by the powerful and influential. Social reformer and Indias first woman doctor Dr Muthulakshmi Reddi had built pressure on the authorities to bring the law in what was then Madras Presidency.				 																Land-grab heat				 																																																										The Delhi Development Authority is under court glare over allegations that it allowed encroachments for money.				 																																																										Last week, Delhi High Court slammed its officials for allowing encroachments on government land. Public land worth crores of rupees is being taken away, a bench comprising Justices T.S. Thakur and Veena Birbal said.				 																																																										Metro Rail Corporation had filed the petition saying it couldnt build a station because the agency had failed to remove encroachers on 10 bighas allotted to it in Ashok Nagar.				 																																																	Delhi: Rare photographs from the time of the 1857 uprising against the British are on exhibition at Delhi University. The exhibition, Traces of 1857: The Indian Mutiny, is on at the conference hall of the university on north campus. Time: 11am to 7pm.

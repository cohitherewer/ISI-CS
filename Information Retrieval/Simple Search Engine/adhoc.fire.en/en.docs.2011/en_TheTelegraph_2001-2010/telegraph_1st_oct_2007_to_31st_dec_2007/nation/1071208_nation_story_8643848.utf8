				 Bengal plea

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT
																								New Delhi, Dec. 7: The Supreme Court will on December 13 hear Bengals appeal against the Calcutta High Court order criticising it for the March 14 police firing in Nandigram.
																								The state wanted an early hearing but those opposing its plea said copies of the appeal had not been sent to them. The high court had dubbed the firing wholly unconstitutional and unjustifiable and ordered a CBI probe.
																								The matter cannot be heard as the state government has not bothered to serve copies of its appeal to any of the caveators in the case, lawyer Sanjeev Sen told a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan.
																								We have to be first served copies of the appeal so that we can present our case, said Sen, who represents the Medical Service Centre, one of the petitioners before the high court. 
																								In its appeal, the Bengal government said it was not seeking a stay on the CBI inquiry but challenging the directive to pay a uniform compensation to the 14 victims of the firing.
																								K.K. Venugopal and Altaf Ahmed are the states lawyers. Ahmed sparked a storm in court when he told those opposing the appeal: Please dont create a Nandigram here. 
																								The court listed the matter for hearing on December 13.

				 Governor attacks, Mayavati deflects
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Police inspect Fridays blast site in Lucknow. File picture 																								Lucknow, Nov. 28: Uttar Pradesh governor T.V Rajeswar today lashed out at the state government for failing to rein in terror, prompting Mayavati to pin the blame on the Centre. 																								Blasts at regular intervals point to the hyperactivity of the militants sleeper cells, Rajeswar said, five days after serial explosions rocked courts in the state.																								But police here have not been ardent enough to curb their growth, he added.																								After every incident, the police go overboard in approaching the media and then fall silent. No back-up actions are pursued, he said at an event to mark Police Week.																								A former Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer, Rajeswar said the intelligence network must work round the year if it wanted to crack the terror network. 																								The governor said a new government had taken over in Uttar Pradesh, but the polices attitude had remained unchanged. He deplored the states gun culture, saying it was an indication of poor law and order. 																								Mayavatis response came five hours after the governors salvo. But the chief minister did not criticise Rajeswar. She lambasted the UPA government in Delhi instead.																								The Centre has failed miserably in intensifying vigilance on the border and checking infiltration despite the fact that this state always shares intelligence with Delhi, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said.																								She added that Uttar Pradeshs porous border made it easy for militants to enter the state, live like other citizens and keep in touch with their leaders across the border.																								Mayavati said she honoured Rajeswars sentiments.																								I know the governor has experience as an intelligence officer. But my study of the situation is that till infiltration is checked, it would be difficult to get a grip on terrorist activities, she said, adding that she had written to the Centre about this.																								The feud over the spurt in terrorist activities had started immediately after Fridays blasts when Mayavati blamed the Manmohan Singh government for not providing enough intelligence inputs. The IB had refuted the charge.																								Senior intelligence officers  both from the Centre and the state  said the spat would shift the focus from the more serious issue: the many inventive ways in which terrorist modules were carrying out attacks.																								Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have arrested around 150 militants involved in 60 operations since 2001. They said there were not enough policemen for sustained back-up action. The state has about 94 policemen per 100,000 people, as against a national average of 143. International norms recommend a 250:100,000 ratio.																								IB officials in Delhi blamed the Centre for not properly implementing the recommendations of the Girish Saxena Committee, formed after Kargil War. 																								The government had set up the Multi Agency Centre and the Joint Task Force on Intelligence  which collect terror-related information and pass them on to states. But both are under-staffed, under-equipped and ineffective, the officers said.

				 Mattress Millionaire quits to cushion son
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sukh Ram being taken to court. File picture																								Shimla, Nov. 25: Congress leader Sukh Ram, 80, may be haunted by mattresses but he had more than a good nights sleep on his mind when he announced he was retiring yesterday.																								P.V. Narasimha Raos communications minister  who became a symbol of corruption a decade ago after stacks of cash were allegedly seized from under his mattress  is quitting active politics to win a cushioned seat for his son.																								The Mandi Sadar MLAs announcement came after he had made sure that his son Anil Sharma would be given the Congress ticket from the constituency in next months Himachal Pradesh elections.																								I will not contest elections any more, Sukh Ram told a public gathering in his ancestral village of Kotli, in Mandi district, 200km from Shimla.																								People say I am leaving politics to make way for my son. There is nothing wrong in it. Whatever the father earns, he gives back to his son. Anil will come up to the expectations of the people who have placed their faith in me for four decades.																								His 45-year political career saw Sukh Ram rise to become a Union minister until it all came apart in 1996, when the CBI seized Rs 3.6 crore in cash from his official residence in Delhi.																								The money was allegedly the spoils of an irregular telecom contract he had awarded. Sukh Ram was handed a three-year term by a Delhi court in July 2002, but soon got bail. His appeal is pending while another case, of unaccounted wealth, goes on against him.																								After the Congress expelled him in December 1996, Sukh Ram formed the Himachal Vikas Congress in 1997 and won four seats in the 1998 state elections. His backing helped the BJP form a government, snatching power from Sukh Rams former party rival Virbhadra Singh.																								Sukh Ram, however, was allowed to merge his party with the Congress in April 2004. He patched up with Virbhadra by supporting his wife Pratibha Singh from the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency.																								Virbhadra, now chief minister, has promised Anil the Congress ticket from Mandi Sadar once Sukh Ram vacates it.																								Sukh Ram was in a tearful mood on Saturday, recollecting the old days.																								I shall ever remain indebted to the residents of Kotli  and of Mandi district as a whole  who have played a big part in my life, he said, adding that he had been framed in the corruption case.																								I did not leave the Congress but was deserted by the Congress. I rejoined the party as I originally belong to the Congress. I am against the politics of caste and regionalism, he said.																								Sukh Ram won the Assembly election from Mandi Sadar 12 times and twice became Mandi MP.

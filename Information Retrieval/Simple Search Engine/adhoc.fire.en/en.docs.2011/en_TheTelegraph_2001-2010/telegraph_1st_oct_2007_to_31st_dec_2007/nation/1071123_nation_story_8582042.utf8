				 CVC seeks info act immunity
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 22: The Central Vigilance Commission does not want its files opened to public scrutiny under the Right to Information Act. 																								The CVC, Directorate General of Income Tax, the Railway Protection Force and a slew of government agencies have sought exemption from the RTI act, Indias transparency law, the government disclosed today. 																								Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha today, minister of state for personnel and training Suresh Pachauri said 16 government bodies had written to the ministry, asking for exemption. 																								The armed forces (the army, navy, air force and the coast guard) wanted immunity for security reasons, but their appeal was turned down. 																								The office of secretary (security) at the cabinet secretariat and the Bureau of Civil Aviation (security) sought exemption on identical grounds, and were also turned down. 																								The Special Protection Group, the Defence Research and Development Organisation, Border Road Development Board and the Financial Intelligence Unit are the only bodies that have been excluded from the acts purview, Pachauri said.

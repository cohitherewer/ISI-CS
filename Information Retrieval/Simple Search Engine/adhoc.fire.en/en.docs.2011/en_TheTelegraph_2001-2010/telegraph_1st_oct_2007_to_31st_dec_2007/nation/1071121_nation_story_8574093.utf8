 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Real-life blood in action scene				 																																																										Art imitates life. But when it comes too close to death, the parallel can be devastatingly real  and gory.				 																																																										Few would have realised the home truth like actor Chandrasekhar, who recently had blood  not the ketchup concoction used to make action scenes look real  oozing out of his belly because the knife proved too real.				 																																																										The blame has fallen on the stunt director, who insisted on a real knife to be used in shooting the sequence. Usually, a spring knife is used in such scenes but the one brought in on the set of Thotta wasnt found to be good enough. 				 																																																										Chandrasekhar is now recovering from his wounds at a city hospital where he was rushed to after the real knife pierced his body a few inches and left him bleeding.				 																																																										The bizarre occurrence also left DMK chief M. Karunanidhi worried. Chandrasekhar is a long-time activist. Cant you people make films without such things as knives? the chief minister asked director Selva. Thats not easy to answer for filmmakers on a knifes edge.				 																Fines muffle Diwali burst				 																																																										Decibel penalties appeared to have muffled Mumbais Diwali this year, snuffing the sound out of the festival of lights.				 																																																										Cracker sales dipped, leaving many fireworks makers with furrowed brows. Retailers blamed the slump on the tough noise pollution norms and the fines, imposed by the police. 				 																																																										Stockists spoke of consignments being returned to them by neighbourhood retailers. 				 																																																										Fireworks worth over Rs 1 lakh have come back to me. Retailers felt people would buy noisy crackers but they were wrong. Nobody wants to pay fines, said wholesaler Navin Chandra Chhadwa.				 																																																										Most people seemed to favour the curbs, though. 				 																																																										I have purchased only noiseless crackers, so did my friends. I prefer these crackers so that I can contribute to reducing noise pollution, said Hiren Bhatt, 20, from Andheri.				 																Keys to Audi in a scratch				 																																																										Delhiite Ashish Raheja now has something in common with Sri Lankan cricket star Sanath Jayasuriya. 				 																																																										Like the Matara Marauder, as the fiery batsman is known, Raheja has won an Audi 06, a luxury sports car, as prize in a competition. 				 																																																										But unlike Jayasuriya, who had to smash runs against opening fast bowlers at the World Cup in 1996 to be chosen the player of the tournament, Raheja only had to scratch a locket. Raheja was handed the locket with a new Motorola handset he purchased, as a part of a Moto Lucky contest the handset-maker is running.				 																																																										A casual scratch and Raheja won the grand prize of the contest, the Audi. We hope Ashish Raheja remembers us each time he drives his new car, Lloyd Mathias, Motorolas marketing director for India and Southeast Asia said. 				 																																																										Other gifts, still up for grabs, include 12 Honda City Exi cars, 140 bikes of the 100cc variety, sunglasses, wristwatches and, of course, mobile phones from the company.				 																Crowd pangs				 																																																										Delhi, girding up to host large numbers for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, is shuddering at the thought of making arrangements for 2.5 lakh members of village bodies.				 																																																										The panchayat representatives from across the country will arrive in the capital for next months two-day rally organised by the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government.				 																																																										We cant manage so many guests even for two days. Many guests would be women and we cant risk their security. We have requested the Centre to cut down the number to a lakh, a senior Delhi government official said.				 																																																	Mumbai: This Wednesday, watch Ho Sakta Hai Do Aadmi Do Kursiyaan, a play that dissects urban relationships through unconnected stories linked by the emotions of love, loss and absence. The venue is Prithvi Theatre in Juhu. Time: 9pm. Call 26149546 for more information.

				 Rapist let-off under glare
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: The Supreme Court has admitted an appeal against the acquittal of an alleged rapist on the basis of a police officers suicide note that said the accused had been framed. 																								The petition has been filed by the Maharashtra government, which argued that Bombay High Court was wrong in acquitting Armogam Munnaswami Kounder, convicted by a lower court on the charges of raping and murdering a six-year-old on July 1, 1995, in Mumbai.																								The states counsel, Ravindra Keshavrao Adsure, said the high court had freed Kounder only on the basis of the suicide note when medical evidence in the case had conclusively proved his involvement in the crime.																								Daily wager Kounder was accused of carrying away Angamma while she was sleeping with her parents outside her home in Andheri in suburban Mumbai.																								Angammas mutilated body was found in a gunny bag, along with a shirt and lungi that three witnesses identified as Kounders. The knife used to mutilate her and the stone to kill her were also recovered. 																								Doctors said the child had died of shock caused by fracture of skull with sexual assault. 																								The trial court had convicted Kounder on several counts of murder and rape and sentenced him to life on April 19, 2000. 																								But the high court overturned his conviction a year later when newspapers published reports about a suicide note left behind by inspector Iqbal Abdul Quadir Bargir, who was one of the investigating officers in the case registered in the Oshiwara police station.																								Bargirs note said he had been forced by his superiors to frame Kounder and several other accused in other cases.																								The state, the prosecuting agency in criminal cases, said the note had never been produced before the high court and an inquiry officer asked to examine its veracity had also rejected it. 																								The high court had erroneously set aside the conviction order without appreciating the evidence and material on record adduced in the case and the observations of the trial court, the state said in its appeal. 																								Kounder claimed he was innocent and had been framed.

				 Nitishs Modi moves in rally

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
																								Patna, Dec. 7: Those wondering why an NDA minister would speak against another  JD(U) president Lallan Singh offers a clue. Chief minister Nitish Kumar did not attack Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, but the statement made on Sohrabddin, as he condemns any move which may create communal divide, said Singh.
																								Political observers see Nitish Kumars rally reaction as a calculated one to keep his Bihar constituency, dominated by Muslims, intact, while he campaigns in Gujarat. Also his partys prestige is at the stake in Bikramganj seat which has 80,000 Muslims and which is ready for the by-polls  to be held early next month. 
																								In one of his election meetings, Narendra Modi justified the death of Soharabuddin in a police terrorist encounter for which the Election Commission issued a notice on him. The Bihar chief minister who was in Badodara yesterday was quick to react: Narendra Modi should not have raised the issue, which is still sub judice. He (Modi) has raised it to polarise a section of voters in his favour, which is wrong. 
																								While campaigning in various parts of Gujarat, Nitish went to the extent of alleging: The Gujarat chief minister has deviated from the path of development and has been ignoring the cause of tribals and Dalits. 
																								Grapevine alleges that Nitish Kumar cannot afford to identify himself with Narendra Modi, as Nitish has launched many measures to bring Muslims into his fold, which have always paid dividends. 
																								The measures include sending a Muslim MLA (Ali Anwar) to the Rajya Sabha, paying sumptuous compensation to the victims of 1989 Bhagalpur riots, rehabilitating Bhagalpur weavers, fencing graveyards, ensuring conviction to the accused in the riots and appointing members of the community in the states key positions. In return, the JD(U) has received substantial number of votes from the community in the by-polls that took place after Kumar took over as the chief minister. 
																								For instance, the JD(U) snatched the Muslim-dominated Manihari Assembly seat from the UPA last year. A sizeable section of Muslims voted for JD(U) candidate for the Nalanda Lok Sabha seat. 
																								The JD(U), which has two MLAs in Gujarat, neither has a stake in that state nor is a party to the Modi government. Its good for us that Nitish Kumar has shown his dislike for Modi while campaigning there. The Muslims understand that the JD(U) is a secular party, remarked a JD(U) MLA. Interestingly, Bihar BJP, which is party to the Nitish Kumar government, has preferred to stay silent on Nitishs remarks on Modi, though the states deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi who campaigned for another Modi in Gujarat.

New Delhi, Dec. 27: The BJP Big 2 reacted with shock and indignation at Benazir Bhuttos assassination today, with shadow Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani warning that the Talibanisation of Pakistan was a threat to India as well.
																								The party has requested Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss the whole gamut of issues related to terrorism with the Opposition.
																								In a statement, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee condemned the assassination and described it as a big jolt to democracy and civilised society.
																								Advani, who described Benazir as a tall leader, said he had the feeling that the kind of Talibanisation of Pakistan that is taking place is a threat to Indias security also.
																								The leader of the Opposition spoke to the Prime Minister, who is in Goa, and the Pakistani high commissioner in Delhi.
																								Vajpayee said terrorism had become a big challenge for democracy and peace-loving society and we have to fight it out together.
																								Advani, who shared a personal rapport with Benazir, said the news from Rawalpindi came as a shock.
																								The former Prime Minister of Pakistan and a tall leader who for years had been struggling for restoration of democracy in Pakistan has fallen victim to a terrorist attack, he said.

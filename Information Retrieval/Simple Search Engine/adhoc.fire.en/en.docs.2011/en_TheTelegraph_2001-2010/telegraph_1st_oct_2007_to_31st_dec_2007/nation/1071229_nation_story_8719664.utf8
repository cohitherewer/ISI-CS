				 Govt confirms 2 tension deaths

																								Phulbani, Dec. 28 (PTI): The Orissa government today confirmed that two people were killed and 25 injured in the violence that broke out at Khandhamal district. 
																								After three days of violence, the region was peaceful today.
																								Senior officers assigned to control the flare-up in the tribal-dominated district said one had died in stone pelting at Barakhama village on Christmas while another succumbed to police firing at Brahmanigaon village yesterday.
																								Last evening, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had said the government had received reports of two deaths at Brahmanigaon. However, Naveen added that the government was not sure of the number of persons killed in the police firing. Revenue divisional commissioner (RDC) of southern division Satyabrata Sahu put the number of affected families at 300 and said 30 houses were burnt down. The unofficial claims were over 300 houses. He rejected the claim, made by Archbishop Raphael Cheenath, that 55 churches, including five major ones, were either ransacked or set on fire during the tension.
																								According to government reports, 15 places of worship, including 10 churches and five prayer halls, have been affected, Sahu said, adding that Brahmanigaon and Barakhama were identified as the worst-hit areas. No untoward incident has been reported since last night, said inspector-general of police (special armed police) Pradip Kapoor. Yesterday a mob set a police station at Brahmanigaon village fire, forcing the police to fire nearly 30 rounds in the air, he said.

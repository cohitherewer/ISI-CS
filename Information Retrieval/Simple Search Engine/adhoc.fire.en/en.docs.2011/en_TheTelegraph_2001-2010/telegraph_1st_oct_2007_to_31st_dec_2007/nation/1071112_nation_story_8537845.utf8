				 Push for Tamil medium schools
 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, Nov. 11: A new report on reforming school education in Tamil Nadu has recommended that Tamil be the sole medium of instruction in all classes, although English should also be taught keeping rapid globalisation in mind.																								In line with international practices and recommendations of various national committees, school education in Tamil Nadu should be fully through the medium of Tamil, the C. Muthukumaran Committee report said.																								Experts, too, have acknowledged that learning through ones mother tongue is the best way to learn, it added. 																								As for the linguistic minorities, the report said, they should be taught in their mother tongue. Telugu-speaking students, for instance, could be put in one class and the ones with Malayalam as their mother tongue in another, it said. 																								The committee had been constituted by the DMK regime last year following several representations, including one by the PMK, which has been vociferous about protecting Tamil culture.																								The Muthukumaran committee looked into the viability of setting up a common school system to ensure equal opportunities for all children, irrespective of their social or economic background. The report said once a common system was established, there would no need for the four state boards that exist now. 																								The report, tabled in the just-concluded monsoon session of the Assembly, was prepared after extensive consultations with teachers, experts and parents. 																								The panel stressed the need for phased implementation of the proposals, as recommended by an earlier committee. 																								The Ramamurthy committee had suggested that the state first focus on the primary level and then move on to the secondary stage. It had also urged the government to discontinue aid to schools imparting education in a medium other than the mother tongue/regional languages.																								English should be taught as a subject and a common syllabus designed in such a way that students achieve basic proficiency in the language in five years  by the time they are in Class VIII, the Muthukumaran committee said.																								Introducing English from Class I instead of Class III has not delivered results, the report added. 																								The committee also made suggestions on improving syllabi and the exam pattern and upgrading laboratories and other school infrastructure.

				 Karva Chauth fast, with a difference
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Karva Chauth in Jammu. (AP)																								Indore, Oct. 29: For Ravindra Gupta, the boot is on the other foot  or rather, the mehendi is on the other palm.																								Today, as men across north and central India were busy shopping for their wives on Karva Chauth, Ravindra was running a comb through his receding hair  a streak of sindoor glowing in the parting  waiting to break his fast after the moon comes out.																								Karva Chauth is traditionally womens domain, where they go without food and water from one moonrise to another, praying for their husbands longevity. But the Indore-based astrologer decided to reverse the roles.																								Ravindra says he has been fasting since 1984, a year after he married Rohini. I love my wife, so I thought I should be fasting for her instead of she doing it for me, he said. Initially, she used to feel a bit awkward but later understood my intention. Today, both of us are fasting.																								Karva means clay pot and chauth refers to the fourth night after the full moon in the month of Kartik, according to the Hindu calendar. While the woman waits for the moon, she decks herself with mehendi and jewellery.																								When the moon appears, the couple take a look at it together. The woman then offers prayers and receives the first morsel and drop of water from her husband. The man gifts his wife jewellery and clothes.																								Ravindra says his familiarity with religious and cultural texts prompted him to start fasting for his wife. 																								Since this custom signifies extreme love for and devotion to the spouse, as shown by a wifes willingness to suffer for her husbands well-being, I thought of taking the lead, he says, watching a group of women pass on their prayer thalis (plates) in a circle  a ritual observed seven times. 																								Ravindra might have to wait a while before he gets to inspire a group of other men to tread his path.

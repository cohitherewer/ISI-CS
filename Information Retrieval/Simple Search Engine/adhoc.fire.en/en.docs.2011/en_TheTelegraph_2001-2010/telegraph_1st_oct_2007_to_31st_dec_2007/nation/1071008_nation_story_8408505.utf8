 							 - Party leaders meet governor with offer to form next government OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Oct. 7: The Congress today waded into the Karnataka tangle with an offer to form the next government after the betrayed BJP formally stormed out of the Janata Dal (Secular)-led coalition, ending 20 months of uneasy ties.																								Sources said some senior leaders met governor Rameshwar Thakur and asked him to take the party, the second largest in the state after the BJP, into confidence before taking any decision.																								Legislature party secretary Ramesh Kumar told reporters the Congress had asked Thakur, a Congressman, to invite the party to form the next government.																								Kumar said his party was against forcing mid-term polls on voters. We have the strength to form the government. The life of the JD(S)-BJP coalition government has ended. We are staking our claim to form the next government, he said.																								That efforts were on to form a government became clear when chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy also said he would request the governor to give him a chance to prove his majority in the Assembly. 																								JD(S) sources said Kumaraswamys father, H.D. Deve Gowda, was trying to strike a deal with the Congress to let his son continue as chief minister with outside support, though the former Prime Minister has denied such overtures.																								We want to avoid immediate polls as the BJP will be in a better position if it goes before the people as a betrayed party. The recent urban local body elections (where Gowdas party upstaged both the BJP and the Congress) may not be a true indicator as the voting percentage was low compared with an Assembly poll, a JD(S) source said.																								But in the first sign of revolt within the JD(S), an MLA threatened to quit the party over the refusal to honour the power-share deal.																								I am contemplating quitting the JD(S) itself if the party fails to retrace its decision of not handing over power to the BJP, Mahima J. Patel, son of former chief minister J.H. Patel, told PTI.																								Vijay Sankeshwar, a former BJP MP who joined the JD(S), also threatened to quit.																								Both leaders are from the dominant Lingayat community, to which B.S. Yediyurappa, who was the BJPs nominee for chief minister, also belongs.																								More MLAs are set to follow them, sources said.

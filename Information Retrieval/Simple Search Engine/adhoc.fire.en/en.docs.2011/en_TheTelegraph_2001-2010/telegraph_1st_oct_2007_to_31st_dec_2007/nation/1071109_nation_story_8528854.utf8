 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Sleuths break Telgi tax jinx				 																																																										Abdul Karim Telgi earned his crores from fake stamp papers, but he forgot to pay income tax. To recover the dues of the scamster cooling his heels in Punes Yerwada jail, the Bangalore circle of the tax department put three buildings owned by him up for auction.				 																																																										Three years and several auctions later, the jinx was broken. The remaining two commercial properties were sold recently but at a price well below market rates. 				 																																																										While one palatial bungalow was auctioned in 2005 for Rs 1.43 crore, the IT department raised the reserve price for the two complexes, in a prime locality, to Rs 16 crore, thanks to the real estate boom. But, even after many auction dates, no one came forward to bid for Sana Point and Sana Plaza, named after Telgis daughter. Finally, a nationalised bank bought both buildings for Rs 6.27 crore. 				 																																																										The department is still short by Rs 4.15 crore as Telgis estimated tax violation was Rs 11.85 crore. It is still not clear how the shortfall will be recovered. 				 																RTI to check exam cheating				 																																																										A civil services applicant in Delhi has used the right to information act to force a government agency to provide details of the seating arrangement of his competitors at the Union Public Services Commission examination. 				 																																																										The seating plan, he claimed, shows that his competitors  identified as roll numbers 3512, 3520 and 3521  had copied from each other during the test. 				 																																																										It appears from the seating arrangement that roll numbers 3512, 3520 and 3521 sat in the same row during the examination, and that 3512 and 3520 copied from 3521, the appellant, S.K. Rathee, complained to the central governments department of personnel and training.				 																																																										The central information commission slapped a fine of Rs 3,250 on the department for not replying to the complaint and not responding to the notice for the information. 				 																Eyes glued to the comrade				 																																																										Whistles and catcalls, common in Tamil Nadu cinemas, gave way to a hush at a recent screening.				 																																																										It wasnt a MGR potboiler being replayed but a film on the life of veteran Marxist leader A.K. Gopalan or AKG. 				 																																																										The silence was in stark contrast to the noisy reception that star-turned-politicians often receive in theatres when they wow audiences with their crusading zeal.				 																																																										The 75-minute biopic in Malayalam, directed by Shaji N. Karun, begins with Prakash Karat emerging from behind a large red screen in a dhoti to recount, in English, how AKGs life and times shaped the partys progress.				 																																																										The CPM general secretary is shown recounting the days when he first met comrade AKG after returning home from the UK, where he had gone to pursue higher studies.				 																																																										The scenes of AKGs struggles for the cause of Keralas working class and peasants kept the audience, including Tamil actor Sathyaraj who played Periyar, riveted. But the image that left the audience spellbound shows AKG beseeching Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to lift the Emergency.				 																Cops in class				 																																																										The low rate of convictions has sent Delhi police back to class  taken by some of the countrys finest lawyers.				 																																																										Leading criminal lawyers Ram Jethmalani, K.T.S. Tulsi, Mukta Gupta and Ramesh Gupta will be among those lecturing sub-inspectors and inspectors during the one-month programme now under way. 				 																																																										This is a first for a force in the country. We are seeking professional guidance and have roped in the best in the legal field for the training, an official said.				 																																																	Delhi: Painters Vijay Kumar, Vipul Chandra Das and Ranjeeta Bhattacharya present a selection of their best works at Canvas Art Gallery. The venue is located at 1/71 Guru Angad Bhavan, Nehru Place, in south Delhis business district. The exhibition is open between 11am and 7pm.

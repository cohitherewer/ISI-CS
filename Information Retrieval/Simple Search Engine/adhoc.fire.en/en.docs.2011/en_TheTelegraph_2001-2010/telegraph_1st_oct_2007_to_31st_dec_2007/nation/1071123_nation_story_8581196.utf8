				 Nerves taut in Taslima building
 OUR BUREAU																								Nov. 22: Taslima Nasreens neighbours on Rawdon Street would be happy the author is far away in Jaipur.																								There are 10-15 kids in our complex who play in the courtyard downstairs. What if something happens to them? asked a mother getting into a car, a day after Go back, Taslima became the main slogan of rioters who terrorised the city.																								Policemen guard the black iron gates of the apartment complex that is a stones throw from the Shakespeare Sarani and Park Street police stations. There are more inside, in uniform and mufti.																								My 25-year-old son and I are completely in favour of an individual choosing to live where he or she wants to. And her presence means the petty thieves keep away from our car batteries at night. She is a nice person to speak to, said a resident over the intercom. But yes, my wife is scared. What if someone lobs a bomb inside, she asks.																								No one would give their name. We do not want to get into trouble was the refrain.																								A man with streaked hair was indignant. The way the place was guarded yesterday, it seemed like we were in a prison. He wasnt home and heard all about it this morning from my family. 																								His advice to the government: take Taslima away to some secure place. 																								The cook of an adjacent apartment claimed to have seen just that  the author being driven away in a police car in the afternoon. 																								Taslima has moved to a modest Jaipur hotel frequented by marriage parties. Two five-star hotels had cited full occupancy, PTI reported.																								Director-general of police A.S. Gill said: We have provided her enough security.																								Later in the night, sources said Rajasthan home minister Gulab Chand Katheria had called a meeting. PTI quoted him as saying: I am not in a position to say anything about Nasreen since the state government was not informed about her visit.																								A Union home ministry official said even when we extended her tourist visa the last time, the Bengal government had expressed reservations. It does not seem likely that her visa will be extended beyond February 17. Even if it is, she would be asked to move out of Calcutta.																								Biman flip-flop																								CPM state secretary had said yesterday Taslima should leave if her presence caused breach of peace. 																								The Centre has a role in deciding on Taslimas stay here the chief minister agreed to allow her to stay after two Union ministers wanted so, he said.																								But when the statement was aired on TV, Left-leaning intellectuals criticised it as capitulation to the rioters. Bose hastily changed his tune, saying he was tired after visiting the affected areas. 																								I stressed on if (her presence caused disturbance), he said. I am not sticking to what I had said. In a democratic and secular country, everything cant be decided on the basis of religion. But both the Centre and the state should consider the total situation and decide accordingly. We want peace. 																								Today, he issued another statement. Last night, I said the state government has no right to cancel or extend visa. Its the prerogative of the Centre alone. I should have worded it more clearly. 																								On behalf of the party state committee, I inform the people of the state that I am correcting my last nights comments. We want the Centre to take the proper decision.

				 Leg lost but not will to save others
 MUZAFFAR RAINA				 	 An anti-personnel landmine																								Srinagar, Oct. 29: For every life saved by the Kashmir militants decision to eschew landmines, thank Khurram Parvez.																								The rebels landmark decision that has impressed even the UN is the result of tireless efforts by the young rights activist, who lost a leg and a colleague to an improvised explosive device (IED) three years ago.																								Parvez and Asiya Jeelani were touring Kupwara on April 20, 2004, to monitor elections when the blast killed Asiya and their driver Gul Mohammad.																								It was a huge loss and I made up my mind to ensure that no more lives were lost to such weapons, Parvez, 31, said.																								During the past three years, I have been vigorously campaigning for a ban on the use of all landmines in the state, and we have succeeded in bringing the militants on board.																								The 13-member militant alliance, the United Jihad Council, announced on October 16 that it would not use landmines any more. 																								The statement was released by the Nobel-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) two days later.																								Parvez, coordinator of the Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (the ICBLs local arm), had faced a tough task when he began his efforts to convince the separatist political and militant leadership that landmines should be banned.																								We initially talked to the politicians but they seemed more concerned about whether the decision would benefit them politically. Later, when we talked to the militants, they were more flexible, said Parvez, who won the Reebok human rights award last year.																								His campaign recently took him to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir where he met the heads of all the militant groups, including Hizb-ul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin.																								Apart from the pledge not to use landmines, his group also secured assurances against the use of IEDs and grenades  which have killed hundreds of civilians in the state  in public places.																								They (the militant leadership) appeared in no mood to stop using IEDs and grenades, which they said were their most potent weapons, Parvez said.																								But they promised to abide by the humanitarian norms of the Geneva Convention, which says they cannot use such weapons where there could be civilian casualties. They have given us repeated assurances on this count.																								The decision has already paid the militants some dividends. The UNs Mine Action Service has put the statement on its website. 																								This is the first time any UN-affiliated body has given such recognition to a militant group, and they (the UN body) are using it as a point of reference to persuade other militant groups to follow suit, Parvez said.																								But the task ahead, Parvez said, is bigger: convincing the Indian and Pakistani governments to sign the Mine Ban Treaty.																								Many people here have lost their lives to landmines, which do not exist on the Line of Control alone, he said. 																								There are many instances where they have caused casualties away from the LoC. We are working to persuade the two countries to sign the treaty.

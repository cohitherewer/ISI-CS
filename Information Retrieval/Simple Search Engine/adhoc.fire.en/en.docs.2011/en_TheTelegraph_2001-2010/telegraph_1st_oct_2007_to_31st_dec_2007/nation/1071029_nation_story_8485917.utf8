				 Body found on Jogi premises
 SHEENA K 																								Raipur, Oct. 28: The body of a middle-aged man was today found on the premises of a bungalow owned by former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi in Raigarh. 																								Jogi had bought the house, 200km from here, when he was elected MP from Raigarh in the early nineties. He had rented out Anusha Villa, named after his late daughter, to Ansh International, a private company. 																								The firms manager, Amrish Singh, stays in the bungalow with his family. Police sources said the family had gone out of Raigarh three days ago. There were no security guards on the premises.																								A woman, who comes every day to clean the house, discovered the body this afternoon. A foul smell led her to the corpse, lying in the bushes near the boundary wall, and she called the police. 																								The body was naked and there were no injury marks, a police official said, adding that the man appeared to be between 40 and 45. It appeared to be three-four days old, he added.																								The police are not ruling out the possibility of the man being a burglar who might have scaled the wall to break into the empty house. 																								We have sent the body for post-mortem, said Raigarh superintendent of police Deepanshu Kabra.

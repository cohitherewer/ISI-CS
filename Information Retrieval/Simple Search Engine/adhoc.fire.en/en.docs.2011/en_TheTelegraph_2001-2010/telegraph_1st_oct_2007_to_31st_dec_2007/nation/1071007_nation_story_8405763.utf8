				 Big cats poisoned for buffalo killing
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Is the meat safe?																								Guwahati, Oct. 6: Villagers poisoned two young tigers at Assams Orang National Park early this week because the animals had hunted down one of their buffaloes.																								The killings coincide with the observance of Wildlife Week in the country, where a dwindling tiger population has moved even the Prime Minister to express concern.																								Two tigers had been poisoned in the park last winter for the same reason  killing villagers cattle.																								The 2000 census had counted 20 tigers in Orang, considered a miniature Kaziranga and located on the Brahmaputras north bank in Udalguri district, 150km from here. The Wildlife Institute of India, Dehra Dun, is conducting a fresh census.																								An official of the Mangaldoi wildlife division said the tigers had attacked the buffalo at Bhabapur village, dragged the carcass inside the park and bounded off to a waterhole to drink.																								Some of the villagers had been watching. They crept up to the carcass and laced it with some variety of insecticide. The tigers died after eating the meat.																								The two big cats are believed to have been aged between two and three years. Their mother was heard letting out desolate cries, the official said.																								The body of one of the tigers was discovered on Tuesday and that of the other on Thursday. Samples of their organs have been sent to the forensic science laboratory in Guwahati to confirm the cause of death.																								Villages living near Orang often let their cattle loose inside the sanctuary to graze.																								We have had good relations with the residents of Bhabapur, but you will find some mischief-makers everywhere, the official said.																								We must now take a second look at the ties between the park authorities and the villagers. Else, there can be disaster, a state forest department official said.																								On August 20, a rhino was shot dead inside the 78.8sqkm park. In 2006, the number of rhinos at Orang was estimated to be 68. 																								The parks roads are in poor condition and the forest office says that for the past four months, it hasnt even received the money to buy petrol for its vehicles.																								Wildlife Week aims to build popular awareness on wildlife conservation. About 60 forest department and NGO employees will be honoured for their work in the field tomorrow, the concluding day of Wildlife Week.																								The tiger population has fallen across the 28 tiger reserves in India. The decline has been between 40 and 60 per cent in states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh, according to the latest count, conducted across 17 states, in February this year.

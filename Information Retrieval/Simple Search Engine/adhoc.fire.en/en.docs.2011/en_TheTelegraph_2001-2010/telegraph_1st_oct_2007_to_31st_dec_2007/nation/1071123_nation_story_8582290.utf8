				 Cricket boss in flag fix
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jaipur, Nov. 22: A court complaint was filed today against Rajasthan Cricket Association president Lalit Modi over alleged disrespect shown to the Tricolour by his guests during the November 18 Indo-Pak one-dayer.																								NGO Nagarik Morcha, which filed the complaint, said the flag was used as table cover on which the foreign guests had kept their liquor glasses. 																								The Morcha told the court there were pictures of the incident at Sawai Man Singh Stadium and some of these photographs had been beamed on channels and carried in newspapers.																								The NGO has argued that the offenders  Modi, association vice-president Vimal Soni, secretary Subhash Joshi and two others shown in the photographs  be booked under the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, and the central excise act (since it concerns serving liquor). The case will be heard again on November 27. 																								Under the 1971 act on insults to national honour, disrespect to the Tricolour in public places can be punished with prison terms of up to three years or a fine or both. 																								Some foreigners, said to be personal guests of Modi, in the VVIP gallery (the presidents box) were using the national flag as table cover and kept their liquor glasses on it, showing utter disrespect to the flag, Suresh Mishra, the Morchas coordinator in Rajasthan, said. He added that the sentiments of millions of Indians had been hurt.																								Mishra alleged that no association official protested against the insult to the Tricolour. The audience in the presidents box usually comprises personal invitees of Modi. 																								Asked about the incident, Modi denied knowing the guests. I dont even know who they were. And there is nothing to react as there is no controversy, Modi told The Telegraph.

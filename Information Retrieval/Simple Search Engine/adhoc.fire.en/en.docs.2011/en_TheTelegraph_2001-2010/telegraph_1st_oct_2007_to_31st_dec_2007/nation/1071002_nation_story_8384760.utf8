				 Crafts course on school cards
				 - Student hope for ailing industry
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 																								New Delhi, Oct. 1: Schoolchildren may get a chance to study about Indias traditional handicrafts through a novel course education authorities are set to launch next year.																								Ironically, the course  which includes internship with an artisan  will not prepare students for possible encounters with children even younger than them weaving, stitching or spinning the potters wheel. 																								The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) will launch the course  titled Indian Crafts  for classes XI and XII from the next academic year (2008-09).																								The course will be optional with any of the conventional streams  science, humanities and commerce. For instance, students who choose physics, chemistry and math could study this course in place of computer science or biology, officials explained.																								The syllabus was finalised at a meeting of the human resource development ministrys national monitoring committee, headed by minister Arjun Singh, on September 24, officials said. 																								The course aims to sensitise our children to the problems facing the handicrafts industry in our country. We want to create a cadre of children who are trained to market the products of traditional artisans better, Jyotsna Tiwari, one of the NCERT officials in charge of the project, said. 																								Students will be taught techniques of packaging, designing and presenting the products in a form that they sell anywhere in the world, a senior CBSE official said. 																								Officials acknowledged the high incidence of child labour in the largely unorganised sector, but said it was beyond them to address the problem. The Indian crafts syllabus does not even mention the problem.																								According to the 2001 national census, the unorganised crafts sector is the largest contributor to child labour after agriculture. 																								Weaving, stitching and other craft work in India involves child labour in a big way, said Shantha Sinha, chairperson of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). 																								Another NCPCR official pointed out that students might encounter child labour during internship. What are they expected to do? The syllabus should specify, she said.																								Sinha said she would speak to the NCERT director about the contents of the syllabus.

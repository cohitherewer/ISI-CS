																								New Delhi, Dec. 17 (PTI): A court today questioned a Delhi cop on the delay in investigations into the murder of fashion designer Mona Suri who was burnt to death outside her south Delhi house four months ago.
																								You are supposed to know the rules of investigation. Why havent you recorded the statements of the relatives of the victim so far? metropolitan magistrate Tarun Sehrawat asked Ram Gopal Naik on a petition by Mona s father.
																								The court had summoned the assistant commissioner of police to apprise it of the status of investigations. Naik has been asked to file a status report on December 22.
																								Manjeet Bawa, the father, had alleged that the police seized a diary maintained by Mona which contained notes hinting at ill-treatment by her husband Naveen Suri.

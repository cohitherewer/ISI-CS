				 Hands up for frisk? Not this AK
 SUJAN DUTTA 				 	 Antony after signing the agreement in Moscow. (PTI) (Below) Pranab Mukherjee				 																								Moscow, Oct. 18: Antony has finally discovered the military in his AK. For the Indian defence minister, it had to be by the Moskva river, a whisper from the Kremlin. In supermarkets across the Russian capital, AK is a gun-shaped bottle of Kalashnikov Vodka.																								That would be a shock for teetotaller Arakkaparambil Kurien Antony who has not ventured out of his hotel  save for meetings  in the cold to discover Moscows delights.																								His high may lie elsewhere  in the contrast that he draws with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is also his predecessor in the defence ministry. 																								Last week, Mukherjee, Indias foreign minister, was bodily searched  his arms, legs, thighs, back and torso felt for weapons and banned substances  during his return from the Russian capital.																								Indian diplomats accompanying Antony or organising his visits say too much should not be read into these developments. These are mere discordant notes in a symphony of India-Russia relations.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is scheduled to visit Moscow next month. A protocol lapse then would amount to much more than a diplomatic gaffe today.																								In the run-up to that summit between the Indian and Russian heads of government, the visits of Indias foreign minister Mukherjee, last week, and defence minister Antony, now, are laying the groundwork. 																								Mukherjee and Antony have a lot in common. Mukherjee is a Bengali, one of the non-martial race. The only thing military about A.K. Antony when he took over as the defence minister were his initials. AK is better known the world over as the Avtomat Kalashnikov.																								Definitely Russian.																								But here, in the middle of an upscale locality near the night-club district of Arbat, it is also a vodka-filled gun-shaped bottle that contains pure and transparent liquid intoxication.																								Thats a high, really Antony has scored where Mukherjee failed.																								The minister for external affairs failed to meet his counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov had to meet Robert Gates, US secretary for defence, and Condoleezza Rice, US secretary of state, for talks on missile defence in eastern Europe.																								Mukherjees was an unpublicised visit, probably because his office had a premonition of what was to happen. 																								He not only did not get to meet his Russian counterpart, he did not even get a telephone call from him. To compound matters further, the minister was also bodily searched at Sheremetyovo airport while exiting Russia.																								It is not a nice thought for the right-wayed to have policemen at the gates frisking them by hand or by a metal-detector. A diplomat explained that the document on him (Mukherjee) had not reached the right hands in time.																								Never mind the bureaucratese. Indias foreign minister was searched, his pockets upturned, his cap taken off, his coat taken off and him taken aback.																								The last time a similar thing happened was in the US. The then defence minister in the NDA regime, George Fernandes, was bodily felt for weapons and banned substances on his way through the US to Latin America in 2002.																								In Delhi, the Congress dismissed suggestions that Mukherjee was frisked. But in Moscow, an Indian diplomatic source said Russia today apologised for the treatment to Mukherjee. Another diplomat said that being frisked  like Mukherjee was  is not quite the same as being stripped and searched  as Fernandes was in the US.																								AK was smarter. When he left Delhi, it was with a trunkload of 80 gifts that he was expecting to distribute among his Russian hosts. Much of that will return with him on the Brazilian Embraer he flew into Moscow with. Not all of his hosts met him.																								His office was told he might get to meet President Vladimir Putin. It has not happened. When Antony reached here, he was told that the appointments were uncertain. 																								Antony could return to New Delhi like an AK that is cocked but ordered not to fire. 																								But unlike Mukherjee, Antony managed to meet his counterpart Anatoly Eduardovich Serdyukov and gift him some bidri work from Andhra Pradesh. Much of what he will carry back with him is un-gifted and, worse, paid-for. 																								The consolation, probably, is that this time the letter certifying the exit of Indias defence minister from Moscow will have reached the immigration officials at one of Moscows airports. Antony, who has given up his mundu as a concession to the Russian winter, is, therefore, not likely to be felt like Mukherjee. 																								These are not mere anecdotes. They are illustrations of a cooling-off. In November 2005, when Mukherjee came to Moscow as defence minister, he was received warmly at the Sheremetyovo II, the most important airport in the Russian capital, and hosted at meetings at the headquarters of the Russian defence ministry. 																								Two years later, he came as Indias foreign minister and was bodily frisked. His successor in the defence ministry may not have to go through the same rigour. But the venue of the inaugural session of the Indo-Russian Inter-Governmental Military-Technical Commission has been downgraded from the defence ministry building to the Russian armed forces cultural centre, as if it were little more than a sideshow. 																								Antony was also scheduled to visit the tactical missile development corporation, but the trip was called off.																								Indian diplomats say too much should not be read into these developments. But these are discordant notes in a symphony of India-Russia relations that is preparing to celebrate 60 years of friendship next year.

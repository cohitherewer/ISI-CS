				 Akbar to Advani, a gateway to heaven 
 RASHEED KIDWAI			A relative attends to a man injured in the blast at a hosiptal in Ajmer. (Reuters)Visiting the Ajmer Dargah was not high on my agenda but The Telegraph assignment took me to the shrine that for centuries has attracted kings and commoners alike.																								The occasion was the visit of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf who, like the great Mughal emperor Akbar, was to journey from Agra to Ajmer.																								But unlike Akbar who undertook his trip barefoot as a thanksgiving to the Sufi saint who the emperor believed granted his wish for a son, Musharraf had to call off his visit as no agreement could be reached during the Agra summit.																								Minutes after Musharrafs visit was called off, there was huge disappointment inside the dargah. The caretakers had made several arrangements, including a Sipahnama in praise of the general. Dozens of sajjadanashins (caretakers), who were praising Musharraf, began criticising the Pakistan President, alleging that his intentions were not pure. Therefore, he could not get an audience with Khwaja Garib Nawaz, another name for Moinuddin Chishti.																								The dargah is a majestic and massive monument situated in the heart of Ajmer at the foot of a barren hill. The monument is not built at one stretch and it shows the influence of various eras of different kings ranging from Sultan Altamash to Humayun, Akbar and Shah Jahan.The dargah has Jannati Darwaza (gateway to heaven) that opens only once in a year during Urs, the birth anniversary of the saint that usually falls in the eighth month of the lunar calendar.																								Devotees believe that whatever is asked for with a true and sincere heart while passing through the Darwaza will be granted. The gateway has attracted both L.K. Advani and Uma Bharti. 																								During his visit to Ajmer, Advani had expressed his desire to pass through the gate. Uma, too, had expressed a similar wish last December when the leader who exhorted Ram sevaks to ek dhakka aur do paid a visit to the dargah to propagate religious harmony. 																								Uma had told an audience at the dargah: Prayer, fasting, charity and pilgrimage are the first steps in all religions. Respect all prophets, all saints and all messengers of God. All saints speak the same language (the language of love). All religions lead to God. Remember this point well and live in peace and harmony with all.																								The mosque inside is often overlooked by devotees who rush to pray before the Khwajas grave to seek blessings for a good life.																								Many years ago when freedom fighter Maulana Mohammad Ali visited the shrine, he had taken his shoes in hand while entering the mosque. But when the great maulana tried to enter the dargah, he was checked by a caretaker. The maulana asked the caretaker in jest if he could take shoes inside a mosque (house of God), why he couldnt he do the same at a grave.																								The shocked sajjadanashin retorted: Uska kaun hai, yahan to hum baithe hain (God does not have representation here but from the Khwajas side, I am sitting here).

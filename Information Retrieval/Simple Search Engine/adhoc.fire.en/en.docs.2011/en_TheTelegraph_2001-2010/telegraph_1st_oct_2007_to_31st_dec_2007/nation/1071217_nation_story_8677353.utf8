				 Indiscreet dad told to keep off campus

																								New Delhi, Dec. 16 (PTI): A court has barred a father from visiting his sons engineering college and talking about embarrassing family issues with the teens friends. 
																								Additional district judge Kamini Lau said it was imperative for the father to stay away so that the 17-year-old was not bombarded with questions on the discord between his parents.
																								This is of paramount importance for the welfare of the boy, the court said.
																								His father should be asked to exercise restraint because such conduct is not conducive to his mental and psychological development, the court said while hearing a custody case filed by the father in 1993.
																								Lau said the court had no option but to restrain the man if the student was distressed and adversely psychologically affected by his visits to the hostel.
																								The court asked the director of the Ghaziabad engineering college to ensure its order was not violated.
																								The welfare of the child... would include the physical, psychological, moral and religious welfare, irrespective of the status of his father or his mother. The father is an adviser to the central government.
																								The boys mother alleged the man went to the hostel on September 30 when he was not in, rummaged through his belongings and discussed the familys private matters with his friends, including litigation between the couple. 
																								But the father denied the allegations, saying he had not done any such thing in the last 15 years when he had legal permission to meet his son. He alleged the complaint was a ploy to poison his sons mind.
																								The court then called the boy, who supported his mothers contentions and said he had gone through immense agony when his friends asked him about his parents estranged relationship.
																								The court said it could not ignore the boys desire while deciding his welfare and found it fit to ask his father not to see him in college.

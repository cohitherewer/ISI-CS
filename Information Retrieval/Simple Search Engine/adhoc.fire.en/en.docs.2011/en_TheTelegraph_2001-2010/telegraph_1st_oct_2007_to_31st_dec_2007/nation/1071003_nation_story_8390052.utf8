				 Big Apple gets a bite of Gandhimania
 K.P. NAYAR																								New York, Oct. 2: After a surfeit of Incredible!India60 Incredible!India60 last week, New Yorkers are this week exposed to a spot of Gandhimania.																								Delegates to the UN General Assembly, international civil servants and diplomats in this city were up early today to get to the UN headquarters for a function to observe the first International Day of Non-Violence on Gandhi Jayanti.																								At 1.30pm local time, the hoi polloi of the tri-states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were gathering at Manhattans Union Square Park before a statue of the Mahatma for a solemn, but elaborate event to observe the 138th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation.																								The programme there includes garlanding of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi and singing of Gandhijis favourite bhajans. 																								In the evening, the hoi polloi and the creme de la creme of the Big Apple will come together at the UNs Dag Hammarksjold Library Auditorium for a screening of a film, Mahatma: the Great Soul.																								Immediately following an informal meeting of the plenary of the 62nd UN General Assembly to observe the first International Day of Non-Violence at the UN, addressed among others by Sonia Gandhi, Indias permanent mission to the UN here called a roundtable meeting at the headquarters of the world body to discuss the annual implementation of the observance.																								Gandhi Jayanti was designated International Day of Non-Violence for the first time this year following a General Assembly resolution in June reaffirming the universal relevance of the principle of non-violence and the desire to secure a culture of peace, tolerance (and) understanding.																								According to the resolution, the International Day of Non-Violence is an occasion to disseminate the message of non-violence, including through education and public awareness.																								External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee set the tone for todays events when he thanked all Member States of the UN for the unanimous adoption of the resolution.																								Being a politician in the Congress mould, Mukherjee could not, however, stop himself from bringing in the other mandatory Gandhis in his address to the General Assembly yesterday.																								Indias long-standing commitment to universal, non-discriminatory and comprehensive nuclear disarmament is embodied in the vision of late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for a nuclear-free and non-violent world. This vision was put forward nearly two decades ago, he reminded the General Assembly.																								It remains undiminished today.We will be bringing proposals to member states and this organisation to see how we can refocus on general and complete disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, Mukherjee added.

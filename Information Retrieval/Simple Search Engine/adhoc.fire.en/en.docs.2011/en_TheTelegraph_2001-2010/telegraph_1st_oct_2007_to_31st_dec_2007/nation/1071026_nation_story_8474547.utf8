				 Srikrishna action deadline
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 25: Muslim leaders today gave the Maharashtra government time till December 5 to punish those indicted by a panel that probed the 1992-93 riots and warned of a nationwide march to jail if it failed to act.																								The jail-bharo threat from December 6, the day of the Babri Masjids 1992 demolition that preceded the riots, came at a rally where over 35 organisations demanded that the Congress-led state government implement the Srikrishna Commissions report. 																								The report had named politicians like Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and 32 police officials guilty of complicity in the pogrom.																								Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi, who was part of the Azad Maidan gathering, set December 5 as the cut-off date to take action against former city police chief R.D. Tyagi and the 31 other officials.																								An eight-point resolution passed at the rally called for the arrest of the instigators, perpetrators and absconders under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.

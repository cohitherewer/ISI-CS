				 Bride hides from father in police station
 RESHAM MUKHERJEE																								Dhanbad, Oct. 6: A Dhanbad girl who eloped and married has taken refuge in a police station to escape her businessman father, who allegedly cajoled her home and wants to marry her off again.																								The police have taken Shilpi Agarwal, 22, into custody after she begged them to do so, saying she did not want to return to her father Jagmohan Agarwal.																								The college graduate had met Prashant Upadhyay, son of a Calcutta trader and an electrical goods supplier in Delhi, over the Internet. Agarwals problem is that Prashant is from a different caste and not so well off.																								After the father got Shilpi engaged to a man of his choice, she fled to Delhi on September 2. The next day, the couple went to the Tis Hazari courts and got married through an affidavit signed and sealed by an oath commissioner (notary).																								We would have got the marriage registered soon, Prashant said.																								Agarwal then allegedly told Shilpi he had accepted the marriage and got her to return on September 6. He then said he did not recognise the marriage and Shilpi must now marry the man he had chosen for her.																								Prashant has petitioned Delhi High Court, which has summoned Shilpi on October 22, but her father refuses to let her go. Prashant arrived in Dhanbad yesterday, when Shilpi sneaked out of home to Jorpokhar police station and refused to leave.																								The Dhanbad police chief is bemused. Her father wants a guarantee from us that the boys family will not kill her if she is allowed to go with them. How can we guarantee that? But she wont return to her father, so she is in the police station.																								Legal experts said an affidavit signed before an oath commissioner had the validity of a marriage-certifying document though subsequent registry is a must.																								This evening, Shilpi was preparing to spend her second night at the police station.

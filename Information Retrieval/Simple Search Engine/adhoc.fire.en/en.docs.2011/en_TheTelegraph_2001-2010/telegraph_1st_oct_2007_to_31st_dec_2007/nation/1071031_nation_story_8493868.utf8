				 Marry, scoot amp; dump 9000 kids
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Abandoned wives at Chandigarh Press Club after they were provided financial help. Picture by Gajinder Singh																								Chandigarh, Oct. 30: Nine thousand children are growing up fatherless in Punjab after their mothers were dumped by their NRI husbands.																								His parents left me in my house after he went back. Even after our son was born, he never returned. I have survived only for my son, said Sukhjeet Kaur, who had looked forward to a life in Britain when she married Shamsher Singh in 1997.																								Now she is one of about 30,000 holiday wives in the state. NRI grooms touch down for a quick wedding, spend some time with their wives and go back promising to send them visa papers. That is the last the women see of their husbands and the hefty dowry their families often pay by selling land or running up debts.																								Baljinder Kaurs parents gave her husband Joginder Singh Rs 15 lakh when she got married. She even has a CD of the money changing hands. He not only took that amount but another Rs 5 lakh to scout for a groom for my sister. He is in Italy, she said. I have no option but to kill myself after my parents die, added Baljinder, whose parents are ill and need expensive treatment.																								The women are often not educated enough to be able to find a job and not all of them have parents who can support them. Some make cowdung cakes for a living, others depend on crumbs from relatives or complete strangers. 																								Eight of the victims today received Rs 15,000-Rs 40,000 in cash from the Lok Bhalai Party, with help from the Yamunanagar-based Guru Nanak Girls College run by a social organisation. 																								Balwant Singh Ramoowalia, head of the Lok Bhalai Party, has long been championing the cause of the deserted wives. I am appalled how 117 legislators and 13 MPs from Punjab and those from the rest of the country have been napping over a phenomenon that has ruined the lives of 25,000-30,000 Indian girls, he said.

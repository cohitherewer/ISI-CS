				 Rein on fake Potters 
				 	 The cover of Deathly Hallows; (below) Rowling				 																								New Delhi, Oct. 2 (PTI): Delhi High Court has restrained a Bangalore-based publishing firm from printing and selling counterfeit books of the Harry Potter series.																								Justice B.D. Ahmed yesterday granted an interim injunction in favour of Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and her publishers while restraining City Publication and its agents from reproducing, adapting, printing and selling books of the series.																								A suit filed through advocate Akash Chitranshi said Rowling was the author of the Harry Potter series and Bloomsbury Publishing the owners of its copyright.																								The lawyer also told the court that Bangalore police had recently seized 1,500 fake copies from City Publication.																								The court went through the original book and the fake and found it was an unauthorised adaptation.																								The matter contained in the book is an adaptation of the matter contained in the original work. The defendants have copied the main characters.																								It is apparent that the front cover has been copied though the printing is of very poor quality. The back cover is an unauthorised identical reproduction of the cover of the US edition, the court said.																								These books are well-known worldwide and the plaintiffs have trademark as well as copyright registrations for characters, covers and literary contents, advocate Chitranshi added.

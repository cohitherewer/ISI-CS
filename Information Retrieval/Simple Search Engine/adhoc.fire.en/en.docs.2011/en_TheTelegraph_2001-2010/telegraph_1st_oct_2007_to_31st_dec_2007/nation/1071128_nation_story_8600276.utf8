				 Security Council lolly
 JYOTI MALHOTRA																								New Delhi, Nov. 27: The US, buoyed by Delhis move to begin discussions with the IAEA to take the nuclear deal forward, is set to hold the first ever substantial talks with India on expanding the UN Security Council. 																								The talks, to be held in Washington DC on November 30 between US assistant secretary of state for international organisations Kristen Silverberg and senior foreign ministry official K.C. Singh, are a surprising indication of the Bush administrations interest in the UN. 																								Officials on both sides say the Bush administration, aware of the negative reaction in India when it vetoed Shashi Tharoors candidature as UN secretary-general last year in favour of treaty ally South Korea, now wants Delhi to play a greater role in the UN. 																								The US knows that if it supports Indian aspirations for a permanent Security Council seat, a lot of the anti-US opposition in the Indian elite will melt away, a source in Delhi said.																								It is not as if the Silverberg-Singh talks will deliver a UN Security Council seat for India, but this is the beginning of the process, and Delhi knows that. 																								India has so far pursued the G4 route to get into the Security Council, along with Japan, Germany and Brazil, with each country self-representing its own region in terms of population, size, resources and contribution to world affairs. 																								Only last week, officials from all G4 nations met in Tokyo to pursue their dream and propose a big expansion, from the current 15 to 25.																								While Britain, Russia and France have supported Indias desire to enter the Security Council, the other permanent members, China and the US, have never articulated their views clearly. 																								Until recently, the Bush administration only said it would like two or more members, including Japan. 																								For the first time in September at the General Assembly, George W. Bush said the US would like democracies to play a more active role in the UN. India, naturally, has taken this to refer to itself.																								That is why the talks between Silverberg and Singh could be interesting, even if the Bush administration hardly has any time left to push Delhis case. Indian officials hope that once the process gets under way, the next US President will have little option but to carry it forward.

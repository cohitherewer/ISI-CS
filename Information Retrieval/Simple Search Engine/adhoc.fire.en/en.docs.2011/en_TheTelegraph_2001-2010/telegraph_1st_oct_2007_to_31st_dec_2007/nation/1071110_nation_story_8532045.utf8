 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Plastic power to fight road blues				 																																																										Polythene bags, pet bottles and film-grade plastic thrown without a thought is being mixed with bitumen to resurface roads. 				 																																																										An experiment to relay some arterial roads by mixing discarded plastic has shown excellent results as the 8 per cent plastic mixed with bitumen has helped the surface to hold better during the monsoon. 				 																																																										The Bangalore City Corporation was surprised the roads had better strength and longer life. This not only saves money spent on frequent resurfacing but also on raw materials.				 																																																										The corporation has signed a pact with KK Plastic Waste Management for recycling plastics to be used in roads. 				 																																																										Also on the cards is a pilot project where citizens will be paid Rs 6 per kg of plastic they donate. 				 																																																										The incentive means more effective removal of plastic from drains, where these choke the flow of sewage water, and better income for rag pickers. Studies show mixing plastic in bitumen improves stability. Already, 40km of the citys arterial roads have been laid with this material. 				 																When axed, turn to act				 																																																										An officer at Delhi Universitys Shri Ram College for Commerce has turned to the Right to Information Act for help, after the college suspended her for being violent with other staff members. 				 																																																										Surinder Kaur has asked for copies of all records and files pertaining to her suspension. 				 																																																										After the university turned down her plea, Kaur has now turned to the Central Information Commission and sought its intervention.				 																																																										Kaur has alleged that she was suspended for mala fide reasons. The information commission has ordered all relevant files to be opened up for Kaurs scrutiny, but the papers would be shown to her in its office. 				 																																																										Officials of the college, however, allege that Kaur has a violent history and had even manhandled members of the staff in the past. They didnt say why complaints hadnt been filed or action taken on those occasions.				 																Lady officers snare Romeos				 																																																										They almost thought theyd worked their charms and got ladies into their net  but the Romeos got it all wrong and, instead, landed in a well-woven net.				 																																																										The group of never- say-die girl chasers had been busy with their antics at a bus stop outside a city womens college recently when they were caught by their collars and hustled into a van by two lady officers posing as students.				 																																																										After responding to the youths roving eyes and gestures, the undercover officers called their colleagues waiting in a nearby lane and the police van arrived just when the boys might have thought of a long drive together.				 																																																										The police trap followed rising complaints of eve-teasing, especially outside a few prominent womens colleges.				 																																																										The lady officers even pointed to the gold chains that some of the youths had been flaunting and asked them if they would like to be hauled to the police station in golden handcuffs. Do you deserve a gold embellishment as well? one of the ladies asked the group. Lips sealed, the boys got into the van without a fuss.				 																Nursery free run				 																																																										The capitals nursery schools, often accused of being arbitrary in the way they take in pupils, have been given a free hand in admissions.				 																																																										The Delhi government last week allowed these schools to frame their own policies for admission, depending on their needs.				 																																																										Every school has its needs and problems. We have asked the schools to set their own norms for admissions to nursery classes, education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely said.

				 Amar land lash at Lady Tughlaq
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 				 Amar Singh, Mayavati 																								Lucknow, Oct. 8: Amar Singh has hit back at the person he loves to hate  Lady Muhammad bin Tughlaq.																								And no prizes for guessing who she is.																								The Samajwadi Party general secretary, under fire for alleged irregular allotment of flats in a prime Lucknow area, today said he had documents to prove that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati, too, was involved in a land scam.																								The Tughlaq jab came sometime during his tirade.																								Singh said he saw in Mayavati a female version of the eccentric 14th-century king, remembered for shifting his capital  and its entire population  from Delhi to Daulatabad, in the Deccan region, and then moving it back after the experiment failed.																								He said Mayavati had herself built the Ambedkar Park during an earlier stint in power, only to demolish it and rebuild it later. The new park, Singh smirked, would be demolished the next time she comes to power in Uttar Pradesh.																								The comments came on a day the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court stayed the state governments move to file FIRs against Singh and several others for alleged irregularities in the allotment of 28 plots during the previous Mulayam Singh Yadav regime.																								Perhaps emboldened by the reprieve, the Rajya Sabha MP struck back.																								I have received documents which show that Mayavati was also involved in a land scam and acquired huge property. Otherwise, why should she pay Rs 14 crore as advance tax? Definitely, her total property would be more than the Rs 52 crore that she had announced in her affidavit, he said.																								The Bahujan Samaj Party boss had paid Rs 14 crore as advance income tax for the assessment year 2008-09 between July and September this year.																								I have some documents to show that landed properties were transferred in her name, hiking her property to a few hundred crores now, Singh added.																								Bristling with injured pride, the Samajwadi leader  who looked scared before the court breather though he had taken Mayavatis threat to jail him as a political slogan  said he was being made to feel like a land-grabbing gangster and not an Opposition leader.																								But if I am a rival gang leader, she should be a mafia queen, he said, without mentioning the BSP leaders name.																								He dared the chief minister to send him to prison and even challenged her to get him killed if she so wanted.																								A BSP spokesman said Mayavati would give a fitting reply tomorrow when she addresses a rally on her mentor Kanshi Rams first death anniversary.																								Last month, a probe report had recommended scrapping the allotments.																								Prominent among those allotted land were R.C.S. Rawat, the father-in-law of Mulayams son Akhilesh, Anita Singh, special secretary to the then chief minister, and her husband Subhash Chandra.																								The Supreme Court had also restrained those who had been allotted the plots from transferring the land.																								While ordering the stay today, the high court bench said the issue was before the apex court. So no action could be authorised without its permission.

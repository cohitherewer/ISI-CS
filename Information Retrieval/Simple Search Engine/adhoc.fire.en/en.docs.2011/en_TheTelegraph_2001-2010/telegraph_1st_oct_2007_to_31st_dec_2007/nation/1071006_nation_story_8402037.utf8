				 Pranab prescribes Yangon pill
 K.P. NAYAR				 	 Pranab Mukherjee (top), Myanmar foreign minister U Nyan Win																								Washington, Oct. 5: External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee proposed a four-point formula to resolve the crisis in Myanmar when he met the countrys foreign minister, U Nyan Win, in New York on Monday, according to sources familiar with the meeting and the UN as well as US officials who were subsequently briefed about its outcome.																								The Myanmarese military juntas announcement yesterday that it was willing to meet opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is said to be, in part, a response to Mukherjees formula for defusing the situation in Yangon.																								Indias stock at the UN and in key world capitals like Washington and in the European Union headquarters in Brussels has received a significant boost with the generals in Naypyidaw, the new capital of Myanmar, taking swift action to demonstrate that they have paid heed to Mukherjees advice.																								The four points outlined by Mukherjee to his Myanmarese counterpart are: an end to bloodshed; continuation of the process of national reconciliation and political reform; an inquiry into recent incidents, including the use of force; and release of some political prisoners.																								According to information reaching here, the junta has released 692 people detained in mass arrests connected with the anti-government demonstrations that began last month in Myanmar. Separately, it released four of its citizens working for the UN, members of their families and another citizen working for a foreign diplomatic mission in Yangon.																								Thereafter, the military rulers announced an offer with conditions attached to meet Suu Kyi. Mukherjees initiative appears to be the result of both diplomatic and domestic political considerations.																								UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who was in New York with Mukherjee this week, is said to have a soft spot for the Myanmarese woman leader. The Congress president is also believed to have strong views on the impediments to democracy in Myanmar.																								According to Congress sources, Sonias views on Myanmar prompted the head of the partys media department, M. Veerappa Moily, to make an exceptionally strong statement on developments in that country. Moily said on September 29 that unilateral resort to violent means is most reprehensible and must be eschewed.																								Moilys choice of the words most reprehensible, used by diplomats only rarely, sent the political leadership of South Block scrambling for an Indian initiative.																								In addition, former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral and former defence minister George Fernandes have taken part in demonstrations against the Myanmarese junta. So have leaders of the BJP unit in Delhi. 																								The UPAs allies-turned-unfriendly partners, the CPI and the CPM, have issued strong statements in support of the just struggle of the people of Myanmar and against repression there. 																								Mukherjee, who is already in the thick of dealing with the Left parties over their objections to the Indo-US nuclear deal, is keen to prevent critics of the UPA from coalescing against the government on another foreign policy issue.																								Indian officials in New York, New Delhi and Washington are loath to admit that there is any Indian formula on Myanmar, lest it make the Chinese, who are strong backers of the junta, intransigent.																								But Mukherjee told American TV talk show host Charlie Rose in New York shortly before returning home on Tuesday that during his meeting with U Nyan Win, he suggested that to satisfy the international community, it would be desirable if you (order) some sort of inquiry into the recent violence in Myanmar. Of course it must be credible.																								Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York this week, Mukherjee reiterated the need for a broad-based and inclusive process of national reconciliation and peaceful reform to lead Myanmars political evolution. Bloodshed in this situation is unacceptable. 																								Mukherjee has, however, chosen not to go public at any forum about urging his Myanmarese counterpart to release political prisoners.

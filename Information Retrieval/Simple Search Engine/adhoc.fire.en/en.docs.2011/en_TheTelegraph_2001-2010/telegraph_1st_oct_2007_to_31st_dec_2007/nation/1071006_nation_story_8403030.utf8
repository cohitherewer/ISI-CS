				 Star sees star but not a twitter
				 - Bachchan amp; SRK keep clear of each other at SANJAY book launch
 SATISH NANDGAONKAR				 	 Sanjay Dutt with Amitabh Bachchan at the launch of a book on his parents in Mumbai; (bottom) with Shah Rukh at the same programme. (Fotocorp)																								Mumbai, Oct. 5: An event in Sunil Dutts name brought Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan under the same roof last night. But despite being within a few feet of each other for almost half an hour, they exchanged neither words nor glances.																								The punctual Amitabh arrived first at the Taj Lands End hotel in Bandra, where the Dutt family released Mr and Mrs Dutt: Memories of Our Parents, a 200-page book co-authored by Sunil Dutts daughters Namrata Gaurav and Priya Dutt.																								The books Delhi launch came last week at an event attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.																								Bachchan and his shadow Amar Singh were at their table in the ballroom before the programmes scheduled 8.30pm start. Many other stars sat at the other tables in front of the dais.																								The guests included the actors Suniel Shetty, Akshaye Khanna and Govinda, and directors Sanjay Gupta and David Dhawan  all close friends of Sunil Dutts actor son Sanjay.																								Actors of yesteryear such as Waheeda Rehman, Asha Parekh, Sanjay Khan, Prem Chopra, Simi Garewal and Neetu Singh were there; so were Ramesh Sippy and wife Kiran Juneja.																								Shah Rukh walked in with wife Gauri 10 minutes late even as the master of ceremonies, Karan Johar, chatted away with Sanjay, Namrata and Priya. The Khans sat at a vacant table.																								Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu walked up to todays star couple to plant affectionate kisses on their foreheads. Then the 84-year-old former heartthrob and his actress wife climbed up the dais to release the book on their late friend.																								After the 25-minute programme was over, Bachchan and Amar posed for pictures with Sanjay and his girlfriend Maanyata, resplendent in a sari speckled with small mirrors, for a few minutes and left.																								On the other side of the room, Shah Rukh was greeted by Bollywood colleagues. Sanjay and Maanyata joined the Khans soon for a photo-op.																								It was Amars presence that is likely to have kept Bachchan and Shah Rukh from greeting each other. The Samajwadi Party leader and Shah Rukh have traded insults at past film events, and the actors closeness to the Congress high command would not endear him to Amar.																								After the programme, Sanjay said he would be reviving Ajanta Arts, Sunil Dutts iconic banner that produced films such as Yaadein, Reshma Aur Shera and Mujhe Jeene Do.																								The cinema Dutt sahab created was truly ahead of its time. He made films like Yaadein, a one-character film, in those days. I want to merge the Ajanta Arts banner with my company and continue making different cinema like he did, he told The Telegraph.																								The newly floated Sanjay Dutt Productions Pvt Ltd is likely to commission a new film, Beehad, directed by Milan Luthria to revive the Ajanta Arts banner.																								Sanjay is also scheduled to start shooting from October 12 for a film titled Easy Monthly Instalments, directed by debutant Sourav. The film, which also stars Urmila Matondkar, tells the story of a man whose life is governed by EMIs on loans he has taken.																								The actor is out on interim bail till the Bombay blasts trial court hands him a certified copy of the verdict, probably by the end of this month.

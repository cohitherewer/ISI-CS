				 HC push for ban on plastic

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 
																								Cuttack, Dec. 20: The ban on polythene bags received a fresh push with Orissa High Court summoning industries secretary to explain the proliferation of the non-biodegradable product. 
																								On Wednesday the court directed Ashok Mahadev Rao Dalwai to appear on January 10, 2008, to explain how polythene bags (less than 20 microns) were still in circulation. 
																								The court also expressed reservations at the governments insincerity in implementing the ban.
																								The two-judge bench also directed Cuttack Municipal Corporation and Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation to file fresh affidavits on steps taken to enforce the ban. 
																								The order was passed after advocate S.N. Panda, in a PIL, prayed for court intervention due to the governments failure in preventing the manufacture and use of polythene.

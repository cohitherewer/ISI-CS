				 Forget rice, have potato 
 SUZY JAGGER				 	 French fries																								London, Nov. 19: What do old people, fresh water, physical education and potatoes have in common? They have all been designated their own year by the United Nations.																								Solanum tuberosum  the potato  will have its year in 2008. The UN is trying to wean developing countries off rice and persuade them to adopt the potato as a staple food. 																								Potatoes beat rice on most measures. They need less water and less space to produce a crop. They also grow faster, yield more food and have a far greater nutritional value than a comparable quantity of rice grains.																								Within developing countries, where family land has been divided into smaller and smaller allotments through generations, families have less land to cultivate to feed themselves. With ever more volatile weather patterns, those families also need to produce robust crops.																								Charles Crissman, of the International Potato Centre in Lima, Peru  the birthplace of the potato  said: Potatoes produce more food per acre per unit of time than a grain crop. Potatoes come out of the ground faster than rice and provide more nutrition.																								In non-tropical conditions, a potato crop can yield food within 90 to 100 days, compared with 120 to 140 days for a rice crop. Crissman pointed out that it is possible to exist entirely on a diet of potato and one protein-rich food, such as fish or milk. 																								With mashed potato, mixed with milk, you have vitamin C, other trace minerals and a complex carbohydrate, he said. On mashed potato alone, you would be doing pretty good.					 THE TIMES, LONDON

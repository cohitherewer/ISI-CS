				 Centre smacks lips at nuclear fissures
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: The nuke deal debate has given the Centre much to smile about.																								The Samajwadi Party supported the accord, though with caveats, the Telugu Desam abstained, the DMK expressed full solidarity and the Biju Janata Dal was divided. 																								As the fledgling United National Progressive Alliance  the Samajwadi Party and the Desam are part of it  virtually came apart during yesterdays Lok Sabha debate on the deal and the Left held back much of its ammo, it was left to the BJP to stretch the government and Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs nerves, sources said. 																								The governments feedback was that some more BJD MPs, such as Jay Panda from the Rajya Sabha, were pro-deal and likely to state their cases forcefully when the issue is debated in the Upper House on December 3.																								But the government has decided not to make any more overtures to bring BJP leaders on board. The BJP is hypocritical. An Opposition party has the right to take on the Centre but the BJPs flip-flop on an important issue such as the nuclear deal is astounding. No senior politician has done such flip-flops. At least the leaders of the Left are consistent, a source said, referring to L.K. Advani, the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. 																								Advani began as a proponent of the deal and went against influential anti-deal voices such as Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie.																								Then, he nearly recanted from his initial position in a signed statement, only to restate them after a while. But eventually, the BJPs considered position was not to back the deal despite the efforts of US emissaries to bring the partys leaders around. 																								India managed to convince the Democrats but (Henry) Kissinger couldnt convince Advani, the source said.																								Going the extra mile to build a consensus, Manmohan had met A.B. Vajpayee earlier this month to brief him on the deal. Advani was also present. It was in response to the BJPs complaints about the Centres lack of a political gesture.

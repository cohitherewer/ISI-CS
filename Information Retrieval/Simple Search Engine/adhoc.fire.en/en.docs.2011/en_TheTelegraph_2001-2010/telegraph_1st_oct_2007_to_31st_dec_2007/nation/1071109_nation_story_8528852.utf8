				 Madam MP, is my sari stylish?
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 File picture of Sonia Gandhi																								New Delhi, Nov. 8: Rae Bareli has just got fashionable. 																								The National Institute of Fashion Technology  the school that has produced designers such as Sabyasachi Mukherjee  will have its eighth centre in the dusty town two hours from Lucknow, the Union cabinet decided today.																								This will be the first in any backward area, finance minister P. Chidambaram said. 																								Why, you might ask. 																								The answer lies with the lady with possibly the most-envied sari collection.																								Sonia Gandhi made sure NIFT came to her constituency, Congress sources said, and not to Lucknow or Kanpur that were in the race.																								She has probably one of the finest collection of saris. You see her in some beautiful but simple drapes. From what I hear, she has also inherited pieces from Indira Gandhis wardrobe, and Indira Gandhi did have an awesome collection, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, the Calcutta-based designer, said.																								Her mother-in-law not only gave Sonia her saris, but also taught her how to wear them, tips the Congress president might want to share with students at the fashion school.																								If encouragement is needed, Anamika Khanna, another Calcutta designer, provides it: Sonia is one of the most elegantly dressed women in Indian politics today.																								Classes are already on. A derelict schoolhouse, infested with bats, termites and birds nests, was hurriedly turned into a fashion institute with a five-member faculty after Sonia told textiles minister Shankersinh Vaghela to launch it before the current academic year. She inaugurated it on February 13, 2007.																								Teams from NIFT and the central public works department converted abandoned living quarters on the campus of the nearly defunct Indian Telephone Industry factory into students hostels. 																								The first batch of students, selected through an all-India exam, arrived in July 2007.																								But this was not a full-fledged institute  just an extension of the Delhi NIFT.																								The cabinet today changed that. The eighth NIFT centre, like the rest, will be funded on the lines of the IITs and IIMs, Chidambaram said. This would provide financial autonomy and encourage it to generate more internal resources, promote innovation and result in an overall improvement in the standard of education and research.																								Akhilesh Pratap Singh, the Uttar Pradesh Congress spokesperson, said the centre fits in with Rahul Gandhis vision of transforming Rae Bareli and neighbouring Amethi into Indias new education hub.																								The cabinet also cleared a Rs 43.25-crore plan to modernise the Indira Gandhi National Flying Academy in Rae Bareli. Instead of 40 pilots now, it will train 100 a year.

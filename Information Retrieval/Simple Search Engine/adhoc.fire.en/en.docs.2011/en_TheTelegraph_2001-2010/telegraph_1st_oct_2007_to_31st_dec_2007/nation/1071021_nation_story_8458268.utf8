				 3 engineers in rebel custody
 KHELEN THOKCHOM 																								Imphal, Oct. 20: Three government engineers have been taken hostage in Manipur by the Kuki Revolutionary Army. 																								 The militant outfit has allegedly demanded a ransom of Rs 1 crore from the public health engineering department, where the three work, for their safe release. 																								Executive engineer Laishram Ibomcha Singh, assistant engineer Okram Meino Singh and section officer Ningombam Upendro were taken hostage on October 12, their colleagues said today.																								The department has not formally approached police out of fear that this might put the officials lives at risk, they added. However, the police have on their own started an inquiry.																								The engineers, posted in Imphal East division, were on an inspection in the Nongren area of the district when they were kidnapped, the sources said. 																								The abductions came to light after employees of the health department, the public works department and the irrigation and flood control department, led by their respective heads, staged a sit-in from 10am to 4pm today to demand the release of their colleagues. 																								Carrying placards saying Let the engineers work freely for development and Release the innocent engineers, the protesters urged the Okram Ibobi Singh government to trace and rescue the three.

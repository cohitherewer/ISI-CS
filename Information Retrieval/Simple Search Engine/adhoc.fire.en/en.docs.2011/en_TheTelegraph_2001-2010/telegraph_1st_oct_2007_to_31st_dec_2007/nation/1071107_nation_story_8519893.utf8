				 Rahul set for debut in CWC
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rahul Gandhi 																								New Delhi, Nov. 6: Rahul Gandhi will tomorrow attend his first Congress Working Committee meeting after his induction as a general secretary.																								The committee, which is the partys highest decision-making body, will draw up the agenda for the November 17 AICC session. The working committee will meet again on November 16 to clear the draft resolution that will be placed before the AICC delegates for ratification.																								Sources said the resolution was expected to be an overarching review of the domestic political situation, international politics and the state of the economy. It was likely to place the partys stamp of approval on the Indo-US nuclear deal without sounding overly enthusiastic, given the perception that the government had reached some kind of a truce with the Left.																								The panel has already endorsed the draft twice. But sources said the resolution was unlikely to go into the debate of coalition politics versus single-party rule, a theme Prime Minister Manmohan Singh resurrected at an international conference on federalism yesterday.																								Singh has expressed his reservations about coalition politics at least thrice recently but the Congresss pro-coalition position was unlikely to change anytime soon, sources said.																								The resolution could point out how the Congress had managed coalition politics at the Centre for over three years and brought about stability and growth in the process. But mention could also be made of the need to consolidate its support base and to shore up its strengths in the areas where the party has been marginalised.																								Also on the CWC table will be the recommendations of a panel on amendments to the party constitution. Headed by Pranab Mukherjee, the committee has proposed a single category of ordinary members instead of the primary and active groups in place now.																								The AICC session is important because it could project Rahul as a youth icon and a future leader, besides setting the tone for next months Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh polls.																								Party leaders at the session could be asked to hard-sell the UPA governments achievements, especially those in the social sector, and not allow non-Congress governments (in states) to take the credit for these policies.

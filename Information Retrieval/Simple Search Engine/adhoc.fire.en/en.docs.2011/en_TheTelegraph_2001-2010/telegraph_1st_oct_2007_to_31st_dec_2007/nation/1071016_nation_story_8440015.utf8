				 PM takes pain to Bush
 OUR BUREAU AND PTI				 Bush, Singh																								Oct. 15: Prime Minister																								 Manmohan Singh today told President George W. Bush																								 of difficulties in operationalising the																								 deal, a few hours after the Congress ruled out a U-turn.																								The Prime Minister explained to President Bush that certain difficulties have arisen with respect to the operationalisation of the India-US civil nuclear cooperation agreement, a release issued by Singhs media adviser said today.																								Bush made the call to the Prime Minister who is now in Nigeria.																								Sources in Vienna had told The Telegraph yesterday that India wanted to defer signing the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), not because of domestic compulsions but to ensure foolproof guarantees from the Nuclear Suppliers Group.																								Todays government release said Bush and Singh discussed both the deal and World Trade Organisation talks. The call came through late in the evening after attempts to establish contact between the two leaders earlier failed.																								The conversation came in the wake of the statement made by the Prime Minister last week it would be a disappointment if the deal did not come through but it was not the end of life.																								A few hours before the Prime Minister spoke to the President, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee told US ambassador David Mulford that India was postponing its side of the 123 Agreement. 																								Mukherjee insisted that the go-slow was being done because of domestic compulsions. Sources said Mukherjee did not tell Mulford that India was backing out of the deal as he did not have the mandate to do so. 																								The meeting came about on the request of the US embassy, which had been waiting for word from the foreign office on the nuclear deal.																								Earlier, the Congress said there was no backing off right now on the deal. Asked whether the deal was on hold, AICC spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said: I dont think they (Singh and Sonia Gandhi) have said that. There is no question of a U-turn.

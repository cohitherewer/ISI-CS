				 Small voices fight big retail
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Participants at the rally. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Oct. 10: Asif Shaikh spent last night at the Chhatrapati Shivaji railway terminus so he could join the 20,000 protesters railing against organised retail at nearby Azad Maidan.																								I wanted to lend my voice to the protest. So I took a train to Mumbai. When small voices come together, there is a roar. That is what we want the government to hear, said the 58-year-old school dropout who owns a grocery shop in Kolhapur, 400km away. 																								At the rally, Shaikh met many traders, shopkeepers and small farmers who had come from his hometown as well as others whod travelled from elsewhere in Maharashtra.																								The protesters want a ban on the entry of big business, foreign or local, into retail. 																								Unity will ensure we dont perish. Otherwise what is a small trader against a giant, be it Reliance or Wal-Mart. But together, we can take them on, said Shivnath Waygankar, a groundnut farmer from Punes Chinsuad.																								Waygankar said Reliance Fresh had approached him for procurements. I said no. They will give us a good price. It is tempting. But eventually, they will squeeze us.																								The rally shut down shops across Maharashtra. Many Mumbaikars had to go without vegetables as the biggest wholesale market in the city, in Navi Mumbais Turbhe, pulled down its shutters. 																								The rally was organised under the banner of Vyapaar Rozgaar Suraksha Kriti Samiti.

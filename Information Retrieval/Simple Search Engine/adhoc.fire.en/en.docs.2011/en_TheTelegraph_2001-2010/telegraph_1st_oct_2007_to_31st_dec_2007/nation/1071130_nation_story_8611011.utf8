				 Only films on Sanjay mind
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Sanjay interacts with fans from behind the gates of his Bandra residence on Thursday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Nov. 29: Out of jail, Sanjay Dutt has no time to waste worrying about the fate of his appeal against his Bombay blasts conviction.																								As the actor returned home today from Punes Yerwada jail after 37 days, freed on regular bail, he hinted he was thinking only of his films and nothing else.																								A fan asked him at the gates of his Pali Hills home what he thought the final judgment might be. Sanjay replied with a smile: Dont you want to watch Munnabhai 3?																								That must wait for now. The actor is expected to sign up for Idiots, the next film to be made by Munnabhai director Rajkumar Hirani.																								Hirani is keen to finish Idiots before he starts the third film in the Munnabhai series, Munnabhai Chale Amrika. Bollywood is also a touch worried that Sanjay needs court permission to travel abroad.																								Todays drive home, however, sparked Diwali in the afternoon. Fans, waiting for hours outside his Bandra house, burst crackers and distributed sweets as the 48-year-old actor stepped out of his car around 12.45pm.																								A smiling Sanjay, who had flown to Mumbai on a chartered flight, hugged a couple of fans before he was hustled inside by friends and relatives.																								The crowd, however, wasnt denied. Sanjay arrived at the gate two hours later, looking tired but freshly scrubbed, accompanied by brothers-in-law Owen Roncon and Kumar Gaurav and lawyer Satish Maneshinde.																								As the fans cheered, Sanjay thanked them. I have full faith in the judiciary. I just want to thank the people of my country, the love of my fans. I want to thank the media for being so supportive. I want to thank my family. I love them.																								Sanjay sounded keen to resume shooting though he said he would be resting for the next four or five days.																								The Bollywood star, handed a six-year term by a special Tada (anti-terror) court, left the Yerwada jail this morning with friend and fellow convict Yusuf Nullwala who, too, was granted bail by the apex court on Tuesday. 																								Sanjay avoided any interaction with the guards at the gates. The last time he had been released, he had shaken hands with several of them, provoking the authorities to threaten to punish the guards for behaving in such a star-struck manner with a convict.																								Sanjay had to spend an extra two nights in the jail since the bail papers had to be brought physically from the Mumbai Tada court to the Pune prison.																								Rohit Roy, director of one of the 10 stories in Sanjays Dus Kahaniyan, was overjoyed at the actors return.																								We are over the moon, he said. He (Sanjay) is involved in Dus Kahaniyan as an actor and producer. Now that he is home, we are all hoping he joins us soon.

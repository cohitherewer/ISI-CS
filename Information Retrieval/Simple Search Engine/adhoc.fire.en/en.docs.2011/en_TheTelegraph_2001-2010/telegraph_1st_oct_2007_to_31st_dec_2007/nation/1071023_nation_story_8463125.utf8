				 Daunting paperwork dims Sanjays Diwali hope
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sanjay Dutt arrives at the anti-terror court. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Oct. 22: The words in judge Pramod Kodes verdict sent Sanjay Dutt to jail, now the typesetting is looking to keep him there as long as it can.																								The actor today walked back to prison after two months of freedom, with his hopes of being home for Diwali on regular bail looking bleak.																								Sanjays interim bail from the Supreme Court came to an end at 4 this afternoon when the trial court handed him a copy of the judgment. He was sent to Arthur Road jail and around 9pm left for Punes Yerwada Central Prison, which he was expected to reach around midnight.																								After being allowed a phone call to daughter Trishala in New York immediately after his surrender, Sanjay told reporters: I hope I am home for Diwali (November 9).																								But one look at the copy of the judgment, and his lawyers knew this wouldnt be easy. Standing in the way of the Bollywood hunk were such little devils as font sizes and leading  details of the printing trade that would never have bothered the actor before.																								Sanjays lawyers said Supreme Court norms demand that a convict seeking bail submit nine certified copies of the judgment. The text should be in 14-point font size and the lines double-spaced for easy reading, and wide margins should be left on both sides.																								The copy Sanjay received in a rectangular cardboard box is printed in different font sizes on different pages, and is double-spaced only in parts. His lawyer Farhana Shah said this meant it could not be photocopied right away but must be typed all over again.																								At 4,340 pages, the job will take some time, she added.																								Only 88 pages concern Sanjay and his three fellow Arms Act accused, the rest being about the 96 other convicts.																								Once the lawyers file for bail, the appeal will be mentioned before the Chief Justice before it is put on the courts normal business list.																								Unless the bail plea is heard and decided by November 2, Sanjay cannot be freed by Diwali. The court will stay closed from November 3, a Saturday, till November 11, a Sunday, for Diwali.																								Sanjay, sentenced on July 31 to six years imprisonment in the Bombay blasts case, spent 23 days at the Yerwada jail before the apex court gave him interim bail on the ground that he had not received a copy of the judgment.																								Criminal lawyer Majeed Memon held out some hope, saying the actor was likely to get regular bail as soon as the court admitted his appeal.																								There are three grounds for this: that he has been on bail since 1994, has not been convicted under (anti-terror law) Tada, and has never misused his bail conditions.																								Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, however, said he wanted Sanjays acquittal under Tada challenged. I will advise the prosecuting agency (the CBI) to appeal against the acquittal.																								Sanjays lawyers Satish Maneshinde, Karan Singh and Shah requested the trial court to allow the actor to speak to his teenaged daughter and sisters Priya and Namrata over the phone. Kode, unwilling to set a precedent, allowed a call only to the daughter.																								Sanjay climbed down from the first-floor courtroom to a ground-floor room and called Trishala from Maneshindes mobile. He wouldnt reveal what they said to each other.

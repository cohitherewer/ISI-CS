				 Rally heat on Raje regime

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Jaipur, Dec. 18: Rajasthan High Court has asked state officials to explain why they allowed the ruling BJP to hold a rally that brought parts of the city to a standstill recently.
																								Acting on a complaint by Pawan Godhra, a resident of an area affected by the December 8 gathering, the court served notices on the chief secretary, the police chief, the collector, the civic body chief and other officials.
																								Coming down heavily on the inconvenience caused by the rally marking four years of the Vasundhara Raje government, the court said all parties needed to think twice about holding such events.
																								All parties and organisers have to make an introspection whether such glorification celebrations are justified at the cost of great inconvenience of public....
																								It appears that the entire city was forced to a standstill by indirectly putting everybody at ransom for such a glorification, the court said.
																								The rally was like a bandh in its impact, it continued, adding that a handful of people could not be allowed to take the public for a ride. 
																								The celebrations were no less than a bandh. The courts cannot be a silent spectator binding its hands tightly behind the back.

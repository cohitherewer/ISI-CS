				 Maoist whiff in seizures
 KINSUK BASU AND ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR 				 	 The CRPF displays seized arms and ammunition at Nandigram College. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								Nandigram/Calcutta, Nov. 15: The CRPF today seized arms, ammunition and Maoist literature from an abandoned house and a pond in Sonachura, much to the satisfaction of the CPM top brass.																								Most of the cache was found inside an abandoned house in Shitpara village. The Maoist literature  and a part of the ammunition  was recovered from a sack found in a pond in the village of Gholpara.																								But Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee leaders claimed that the CPM had been in control of Gholpara since October 27.																								Party Bengal secretary Biman Bose, who visited Tamluk to attend a special meeting of the East Midnapore district CPM secretariat, said the Maoists had stashed away a huge quantity of arms in Nandigram.																								A CRPF team led by commander Jayant Kumar and a few officers from Nandigram police station went to Shitpara and Gholpara around 10am and carried out a search on specific information.																								Altogether, the forces found 24kg of explosives, 72 electric detonators, 407 live cartridges of single-barrel guns, 42 spent cartridges of 12-bore guns, a country-made gun, 11 rounds of 9mm cartridges, two pipegun cylinders, a circuit tester and two drilling machines. This has been the biggest arms haul in Nandigram.																								The Maoist literature included magazines like Peoples March and posters.																								It is difficult to say how such ammunition had reached the interiors of the villages but the seizure of the leaflets and posters along with live cartridges throws up some obvious links. But we are not jumping to any conclusions yet, a senior CRPF commandant said.																								CRPF officers said the information had reached them through the helplines opened for the villagers.																								The seized items have been sent to us. We will try to find out how these arms arrived here. We, too, have received a few tip-offs and are working on them, said S.S. Panda, superintendent of police, East Midnapore.																								In Calcutta, the inspector-general (law and order), Raj Kanojia, said this afternoon that the three suspected Maoists arrested on Tuesday night at Kakdwip, South 24-Parganas, had confessed after interrogation that they were part of a group of 10.																								On November 12 (Monday), they had boarded a trawler from Garchakraberia and were heading towards Sagar Island when they were arrested, Kanojia said at Writers Buildings.																								The police are looking for the remaining seven members of the group.																								Officials said there had been no reports of clashes in the past two days. The CRPF and state police today visited several houses. They also met relief camp inmates and tried to persuade them to return home.																								A peace meeting was held at Nandigram in the presence of the district magistrate and the police superintendent, Kanojia said.																								The CRPF entered Nandigram on Tuesday and has since then carried out a series of raids and searches. It has also held flag marches.

				 BMW sting sucks in lawyer
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 3: A television channel has claimed that a key witness against Sanjeev Nanda, the prime accused in the 1999 BMW hit-and-run case, stayed in a Shimla bungalow owned by defence lawyer R.K. Anand.																								The witness, Sunil Kulkarni, was a guest at Anands guesthouse for over 45 days, the channel has alleged. However, details of the sting are sketchy, with the channel unwilling to reveal most of the footage.																								The sting, the channel alleged, also shows that Anand is listed as Kulkarnis father on his drivers licence, indicating connivance between the prosecution and the defence.																								Nanda is accused of mowing down seven people. Six of the victims died. 																								Earlier this year, Kulkarni had alleged that Anand tried to pressure him into giving Nanda a clean chit. Kulkarni, whose reliability as a witness has been questioned, is accused in three cases of extortion and blackmail in Mumbai.

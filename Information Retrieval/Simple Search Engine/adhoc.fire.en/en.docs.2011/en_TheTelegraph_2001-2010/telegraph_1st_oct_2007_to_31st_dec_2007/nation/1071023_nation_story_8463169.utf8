				 Defence chiefs to meet amid row
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 AK Antony																								New Delhi, Oct. 22: Commanders of the three armed forces will meet from tomorrow for the second of the annual conferences this year, this time in the middle of a row over promotions and salaries of senior officers.																								The army, navy and air force commanders will meet separately and also jointly. 																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to speak at a combined commanders conference on Wednesday  a ritual  on a platform that is usually reserved to outline the strategic vision that will influence military policies for a year. 																								Singh is unlikely to touch upon the controversial issue of promotions. He is expected to give his views on military diplomacy and new equipment for the forces.																								The Prime Minister is also expected to speak on Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast. 																								The official agenda for the separate conferences of the army, navy and the air force disguises the discussions concerning promotions as administrative or personnel matters. 																								The issue of implementing recommendations made by a committee led by former defence secretary A.V. Singh has not been listed on the agenda papers. The recommendations are on promotions of officers from brigadier and equivalent ranks and upwards. Defence minister A.K. Antony, who is also slated to address a joint conference on Thursday, has asked the three chiefs of the services to propose a common mechanism to implement the recommendations. 																								But the three service chiefs, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major and General Deepak Kapoor, have not yet found common ground. 																								The navy and the air force are apprehensive of the army cornering a larger proportion of three- and two-star rank officers at their cost. The army has argued that unless it got more major generals and lieutenant generals, strategic policy formulation might get lopsided. 																								Apart from trying to resolve the differences on the ground, the armed forces will also seek to frame a common approach for military applications of space technology. The army has scheduled a discussion on coordinating space-based assets in a joint services operational environment. 																								It has circulated a presentation called Armys Space Vision 2020. Its headquarters has set up a space cell. Naval headquarters is also creating a similar office. 																								The air force mooted the proposal for an aerospace command first. It wanted to head the command but now the defence establishment favours the view that it should be a joint command since not only the armed forces but also other agencies are involved. 																								A background paper for the conference has suggested that space-based applications were more important now because the army is moving from platform-based warfare to network-centric warfare. 																								The Indian Air Force commanders will take stock of new acquisitions that are expected over the next six months. Among these are the first of the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers from British Aerospace, three business jets from Boeing for the President, Vice-President and the Prime Minister that are likely to be inducted into the air headquarters communication (VVIP) squadron in January, and three Israeli-mounted Phalcon Airborne Early Warning Craft.

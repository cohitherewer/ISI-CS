				 Cops quiz stars at gangster cricket show
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT			Hrithik at an event in Mumbai (PTI)																								Mumbai, Oct. 26: Hrithik Roshan, Salman Khan, Priyanka Chopra and Shilpa Shetty were among stars questioned as part of a probe into shows and celebrity matches organised by a deported Chhota Shakeel man.																								Joint commissioner (crime) Rakesh Maria said the four were asked about their participation in an exhibition match organised by Iqbal Attarwala, whose company Showbiz Media held the event at Abu Dhabi in April.																								We had called them to check if they had travelled to the UAE after signing a proper contract or under pressure from certain elements, Maria said. Salmans brothers Arbaaz and Sohail and Arbaazs wife Malaika were also quizzed, as were Esha Deol and Urmila Matondkar.																								The stars were questioned on different days over the past two months. Salman, Arbaaz and Malaika were called to the Bandra crime branch office, while Sohail was summoned to the one at Jacob Circle. 																								Suniel Shetty, whose company Popcorn Entertainment organises celebrity shows and matches, was also called. Maria said the stars have sought more time to submit the contracts and other documents on the events.																								We will also question cricketers who took part in the exhibition matches organised by Attarwala and collect video recordings, he said, without disclosing names.																								Attarwala was brought to Mumbai from Dubai on September 6 for his alleged role in a land-grabbing case. The 43-year-old, who fled to the Gulf in 2005, also faces cases of cheating, criminal intimidation and extortion. 																								The Interpol had issued red-corner notices against him in 2006.																								The land-grabbing case dates back to November 11, 2004, when businessman Ranchodbhai Patel had lodged a complaint accusing Attarwala and 35 associates of taking control of his 2,000sqft flat on Link Road forcibly.

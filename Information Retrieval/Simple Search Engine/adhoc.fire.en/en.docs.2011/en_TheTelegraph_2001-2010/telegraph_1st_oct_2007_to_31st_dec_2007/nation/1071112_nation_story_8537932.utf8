				 Delhi gas gains evaporate
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Cars vs clean air																								New Delhi, Nov. 11: Delhiites can no longer say they are proud of their clean air.																								The first city in the country to switch to compressed natural gas, the capital has slipped back to nearly pre-CNG-level pollution less than five years after it went clean, according to figures revealed now.																								A study by the Centre for Science and Environment shows last years annual average of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM)  or dust and soot particles  in residential areas was 136 microgram per cubic metre, 7 less than the pre-CNG level of 143 in 2002.																								The figure was 115 in 2005  that is, three years after CNG was introduced.																								The permissible limit for residential areas is 60. 																								The winter of 2006-07 saw the RSPM monthly average go up to 350 microgram, 16 less than the pre-CNG average of 366 in 2001.																								The level can be much higher this year, experts have warned.																								RSPM is more concentrated in winter, said CSE director Sunita Narain. The levels are already much above what is considered safe.																								According to experts, prolonged exposure to particulate matter can cause respiratory problems.																								Levels of nitrogen oxides, released from exhausts of vehicles, have also seen an upward trend  a clear indication of vehicular pollution.																								While the figure for 2002 was 33 microgram, it was 42 last year.																								Narain laid the blame on the lack of a comprehensive transport system and the insatiable demand for cars. Drastic changes were needed, she said, and fast.																								We will have to introduce tough measures to control growing air pollution and fast. A massive plan for public transport is needed. Today, private cars marginalise buses, Narain said.																								She is right. Sixty per cent of Delhis residents travel by bus. Yet, buses occupy only 8 per cent of road space.																								Of late, the city has been adding 963 new personal vehicles onto its crowded roads every day  almost twice the number in the pre-CNG days.																								Only 20 per cent people travel by car, but they occupy 70 per cent of the road space, Narain said, emphasising that the skewed system needed to be changed.																								Buses pay an annual road tax, which is more than the lifetime tax paid by car owners, added Anumita Roychoudhury, the head of the CSEs campaign against air pollution.																								The capital has also seen an increase in the number of diesel cars and the CSE claims emissions from these vehicles add to that from nearly 30,000 diesel buses.																								The Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers says the market share of diesel cars has increased to over 30 per cent over the last 18 months.																								The government should cancel licences of diesel car owners and manufacturers, Narain said. Driving a diesel Mercedes is criminal.

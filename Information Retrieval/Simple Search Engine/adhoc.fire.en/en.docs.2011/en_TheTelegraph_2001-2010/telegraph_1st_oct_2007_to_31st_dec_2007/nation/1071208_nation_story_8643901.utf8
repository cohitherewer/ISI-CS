				 Delhi blow to nursery reform

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								New Delhi, Dec. 7: The Delhi government today officially junked the recommendations of a high court committee on making nursery admissions more transparent, giving private unaided schools a free hand in deciding the procedure for selecting students.
																								Education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely said admissions would continue the way they have earlier, with two years of pre-primary schooling, as opposed to the one year recommended by the panel. 
																								The committee, headed by CBSE chairman Ashok Ganguly, had suggested that formal schooling begin only at four. The minimum age now is three and a half. The government has said schools can start admitting kids as young as three. 
																								Under the governments guidelines, schools are free to assign weightage among five pre-selected criteria. Those who live closer must be given preference, as also those from socially deprived communities, a term that hasnt been defined. Single parents, girls and students seeking transfers from other schools would have to be given preference.

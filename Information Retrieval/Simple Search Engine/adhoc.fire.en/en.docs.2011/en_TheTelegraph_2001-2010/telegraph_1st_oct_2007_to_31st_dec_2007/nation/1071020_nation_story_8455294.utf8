				 Deadly virus lab in 3 years 
 G.S. MUDUR 																								New Delhi, Oct. 19: The countrys first high-security laboratory designed to handle some of the most deadly viruses known to infect humans will be set up in Hyderabad to enable scientists to explore the biology of such organisms.																								The government-funded Rs 98-crore National Biosafety Level-4 (BSL4) Facility for Human Infectious Diseases is expected to be ready for operations within the next three years, project coordinator Gopal Pande said.																								Were creating the capacity to deal with the most dangerous known and unknown viruses, said Pande, a cell biologist at Hyderabads Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, which had pitched the proposal to set up the BSL4 unit.																								While India has a BSL4 facility for animal diseases in Bhopal  where scientists had investigated the H5N1 outbreaks in poultry  virologists have long been handicapped by the lack of BSL4 for human diseases. This has led to outbreaks remaining unsolved, said Pande.																								An outbreak of brain fever affected tens of thousands of children in Andhra Pradesh a few years ago, but the identity of the virus that caused the disease is still under debate.																								Some researcher groups have identified it as the Chandipura virus, but others have contested the finding. Its hard to draw conclusions when theres no place in India to culture (grow) such lethal viruses, Pande said.																								A BSL4 laboratory is kept under low pressure from the surrounding atmosphere to prevent air from escaping. Its researchers typically wear spacesuit-like apparel to work on organisms that cause potentially fatal diseases, for which there are no known cures. All solid, liquid and gaseous wastes from a BSL4 facility are decontaminated before anything leaves the laboratory. 																								The new facility in Hyderabad is expected to take up basic research involving the human immunodeficiency virus, the Japanese encephalitis virus, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, as well as emerging viruses such as Nipah and west Nile fever. 																								In India, there are sporadic outbreaks that appear to fade away, we dont fully understand whats going onand when we have no idea what were dealing with, the organism needs to be studied in a BSL4 facility, Pande said.																								The Centres department of science and technology will provide 65 per cent of the project funds, while the rest will come from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. 																								The department of health research also has a high-security laboratory, the Pune-based Microbial Containment Complex, for infectious organisms. This lab primarily investigates outbreaks. The microbial complex is a BSL3-plus laboratory, said Nirmal Kumar Ganguly, secretary in the department. Studies at the laboratory helped identify the Nipah virus as the organism that had caused an outbreak in eastern India, he said.

				 Nuke hopes kick back to life
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 13: The UPA and the Left are expecting the next meeting of the joint mechanism to yield some sort of a breakthrough on the nuclear deal.																								The hopes have risen after the Left suggested that the government was free to pursue talks for an India- specific safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as long as it was not finalised.																								The breakthrough is expected to be reflected in letter and spirit in a joint statement emanating from the next meeting of the nuclear panel on Friday.																								However, the Congress was unsure what the breakthrough meant and if it was a substantive or temporary reprieve for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the government from the Lefts pulls and pressures.																								The Left feels that the government should broadbase the sources for nuclear fuel and reactors to include more countries instead of focusing on the agreement with the US. The Left also wants the government to take Parliaments sanction before concluding an agreement with the IAEA.																								The joint mechanism meeting  which was originally scheduled for November 16 but was cancelled for various reasons  has been reconvened on the same date after the Lefts go-ahead.																								A government source said that the nuclear panel, which has senior Congress, UPA and Left members, was expected to crystallise the breakthrough in the shape of a detailed statement (unlike the pithy releases of the previous five meetings) which would spell out what it meant and what the conditionalities were.																								The hints of some movement  dropped by CPI leader A.B. Bardhan yesterday  fuelled speculation that the CPM was buying the Congresss silence on Nandigram in exchange for the nuclear soft-pedalling but government sources clarified that the ground had been laid weeks before the fresh flare-up in Bengal. But the CPM was under pressure by the Bengal unit to avert elections.																								The spadework was done at a series of meetings foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, also the panel convener, had with CPM general secretary Prakash Karat over the last couple of weeks.																								Sources said Mukherjees line of persuasion was that the IAEA talks were not just about the 123 Agreement with the US. 																								Countries such as Russia and France were eager to sell nuclear reactors to India and, therefore, the safeguards agreement is needed to facilitate the process. The government hoped by delinking the nuclear deal from the US or at least not projecting it as an America-centric endeavour, it would give the Left some ideological space to rethink.																								The Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi came into the frame after the Congress was reasonably certain that the Left would yield some ground  enough for the Congress to project that the deal was on and Singh had not lost his credibility.																								Singh hosted an ice-breaker lunch for Karat and Bardhan last Saturday during which it was decided that with the forward movement, the nuclear panel would resume talks as planned. In the past, Singh wondered what the meetings achieved when both sides merely iterated their known stands.																								An unspoken agreement was reached that neither side would say a word on the breakthrough because the Congress was wary of saboteurs. However, Bardhan suggested in a television interview yesterday that the Left would allow the government to go to the IAEA. 																								Today, the CPI leader said his statement did not indicate a climbdown. We are opposed to the deal because we consider the 123 Agreement detrimental to the national interest, said Bardhan.																								Sceptical of the purported breakthrough, a Congress cabinet minister asked what the fuss was all about afterthe Left declared loud and clear that it would have the veto powerat every step. Lets be realistic. The deal is all about the 123Agreement. When the Left has said a firm no to its operationalisation,such breakthroughs are small face-savers. We know the Congress is going to get slapped again by the comrades, the minister said.

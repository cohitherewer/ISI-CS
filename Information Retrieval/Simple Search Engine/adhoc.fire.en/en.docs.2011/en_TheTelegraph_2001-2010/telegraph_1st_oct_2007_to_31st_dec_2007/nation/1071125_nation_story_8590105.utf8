				 US logistics pact on track
 SUJAN DUTTA 																								New Delhi, Nov. 24: A Logistics Support Agreement with the US is very much in the works despite the protestations of the Left, the government has made clear. 																								The agreement (LSA) will allow Indian and US military aircraft, ships and equipment to be refuelled and replenished in either country through a barter system. 																								The LSA has been pending with Delhi for the last four years and with the cabinet committee on security for more than a year, but the Centre has so far been wary of talking about it in public. 																								But this week, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Parliament: Government are in the process of considering a Logistics Support Agreement with the USA as a facilitating framework for mutual logistical support when deploying defence resources in disaster relief operations or joint exercises and without commitment for assistance in situations of armed conflict. 																								Mukherjee was giving a written reply to a question. The agreement will not affect the independence of Indias foreign policy. The logistical support that will be provided in disaster relief operations abroad will enhance Indias ability to assist affected countries efficiently. 																								The LSA draft that is with the committee was vetted and cleared by armed forces headquarters. If signed, it will allow India and the US to borrow military equipment. The agreement was proposed during the regime of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. It is comparable with the Access and Cross Servicing Agreements that the US has with about 65 countries. On a request from India, the Pentagon agreed to call it the Logistics Support Agreement. 																								In a joint statement last year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President George W. Bush had committed to signing it. But opposition from the Left to Indias perceived closeness with the US military led the Centre to think twice. Till Mukherjees statement, it was assumed that the agreement was in the freezer. 																								Earlier this month, the US once again prodded India to sign the LSA. An Indian Air Force contingent that was invited to participate in the combat aircraft Red Flag Exercise would have to pay nearly Rs 100 crore as costs unless the LSA was signed, Washington sent a reminder. The government pondered over the cost before sanctioning the amount last week. 																								CPM leader Prakash Karat has written and said on several occasions that the LSA would draw India into a tighter US military embrace.

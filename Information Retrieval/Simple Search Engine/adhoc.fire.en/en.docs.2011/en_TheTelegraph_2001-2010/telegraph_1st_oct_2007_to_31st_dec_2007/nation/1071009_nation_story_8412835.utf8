				 Credit card trick
																								New Delhi, Oct. 8 (PTI): The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission has issued a warning to ICICI Bank for selling insurance policies to its credit card holders without their consent and has asked it to stop the practice.																								Acting on a complaint filed by Leeladhar Pant to whom the bank had sent an ICICI Lombard policy without consent, a bench headed by Justice .P. Dwivedi passed a cease-and-desist order and held it as an unfair trade practice to promote its business.																								The practice of issuing Lombard policy in the name of the complainant without his request or consent would clearly amount to adopting an unfair trade practice by the bank to promote its business, the bench said.																								Pant, who also has a savings account in the bank apart from a credit card, had been sent a group death insurance policy. Later, the bank asked him to pay Rs 460 for the policy for which he never opted. 																								He made several requests to the bank to remove the cover but was instead asked to pay Rs 13,000 for the policy.

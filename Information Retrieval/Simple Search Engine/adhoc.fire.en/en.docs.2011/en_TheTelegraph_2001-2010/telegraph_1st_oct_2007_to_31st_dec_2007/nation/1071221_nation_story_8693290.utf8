				 Postmen, cops in fake passport net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Mumbai, Dec. 20: Two policemen and two postmen were arrested today for overlooking bogus addresses in a fake visa-passport racket that had earlier landed an airhostess in a lock-up.
																								The arrest of three Surat passport officials raised the days catch to seven and the overall number to 21 in the scam involving 43 illegal immigrations to Britain and the US.
																								In the net are a boutique owner and the son of the proprietor of a Bandra eatery, as well as airhostess Aliya Rizvi, 24, who allegedly posed as a clients wife for Rs 1.8 lakh to get him a US visa.
																								The American consulate has forwarded the police details of 72 other airhostesses for investigation of their possible links to the racket.
																								Constables Nitin More and Mahadev Londhe are accused of accepting Rs 5,000 each from kingpin Aslam Panchal, who is believed to have sent 35 illegal immigrants to Britain. Postmen Maruti Shinde and Mohan Vichare were paid Rs 2,000 each, the police said.

				 Price gift to farmers 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT		ChidambaramNew Delhi, Oct. 9: The government today raised the minimum support price of wheat by a record Rs 250 to Rs 1,000 per quintal and announced relief for sugarcane growers.																								The farm package, declared ahead of possible early elections, gives paddy growers a price of Rs 695 per quintal, including a bonus of Rs 50. 																								However, the export of non-basmati varieties of rice has been banned to check soaring prices. 																								The new prices will be effective this financial year.																								The decisions were taken at a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 																								Banks will give sugar mills low-rate loans to clear the dues of cane growers, with the help of subsidies from the government. 																								Also, the mills will not have to repay loans already taken for another three years, extending a relief that was granted to them in 2005 for two years.																								In another boost to the sugar industry, the Centre has made it compulsory for oil firms to blend 5 per cent ethanol, produced by sugar mills, with a litre of petrol with immediate effect. That will go up to 8 per cent next year.																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram said the export ban would help the Centre procure more rice for the public distribution system.																								The prices of barley, gram, masoor (dal) and mustard were also raised.

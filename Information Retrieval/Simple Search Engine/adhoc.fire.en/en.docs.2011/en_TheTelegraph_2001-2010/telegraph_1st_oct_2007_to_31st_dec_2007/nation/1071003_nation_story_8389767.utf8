				 Mermaid to lil champ
 SATISH NANDGAONKAR		Swapnali Yadav in actionMumbai, Oct. 2: An eight-year-old Mumbai girl who is afraid of jellyfish has become the youngest in the world to swim the 30km Messiniakos Gulf in Greece.																								Swapnali Yadav, nicknamed Little Mermaid, was the lone Indian at the 19th Open World Swimming Marathon at Kalamata, Greece, on September 1.																								At eight years and seven months, the Class IV student from Andheri was about a third the age of the next youngest competitor  22 years  at the world swimming body-approved event.																								Swapnali took 11 hours and 10 minutes  50 minutes less than the 12-hour target  while two of the 16 participants failed to finish.																								At first, I was scared of jellyfish. I decided to change direction every time the fish was near, a website quoted the student of Raigad Military School, Oshiwara, as saying.																								At todays news conference, however, Swapnali had her say about a gulf she had failed to cross  that between the governments and medias treatment of cricketers and those from other sports.																								I believe that we swimmers, especially those who achieve so much individually after making so many sacrifices, deserve much more recognition from the media, who I think are only cricket crazy, she said, sounding serious for her age.																								It was not clear if she had been tutored to say this. But she expressed disappointment that her feat had been ignored for a whole month.																								Long-distance swimming is not easy. Arent we making a significant effort? What do we get in return? Virtually nothing. In fact, my feat in Greece went unnoticed, she said.																								Swapnalis real test, however, will come years later if she competes at international events and holds her own against the worlds best.																								I swam with former Olympians and English Channel swimmers, which enhanced my confidence, Swapnali said. I knew I had to finish the race. I trained very hard for it. I am proud that I was among the 14 who completed.																								Her next target is the English Channel.																								The money for the Rs 6-lakh Greece trip came mostly out of the familys own pocket, though the chief minister and the Mumbai collector arranged for a part of it.																								Swapnali had swum across the 12km Uran-Gateway of India stretch in April 2006 in five hours when she was just over seven. 																								In November that year, she had crossed the 35km stretch from Dharamtar to the Gateway of India in 10 hours and 10 minutes.

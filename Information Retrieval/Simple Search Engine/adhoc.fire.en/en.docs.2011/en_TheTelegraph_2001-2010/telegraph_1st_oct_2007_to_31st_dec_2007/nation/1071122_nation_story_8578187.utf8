				 Harass cry, now from CPM
 KINSUK BASU AND ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR																								Nandigram, Nov. 21: The CPM today accused the CRPF of picking up and harassing its cadres in Nandigram villages.																								The allegations were made in a complaint that the zonal committee secretary of the party in Nandigram, Ashok Bera, submitted to East Midnapore police chief S.S. Panda today.																								We are looking into the complaints and will ensure that common people arent harassed during the CRPF raids, Panda said.																								Ashok accused the central force of acting on the complaints of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee. They (the CRPF) are ransacking our leaders houses in the name of search operations and beating up and arresting our supporters, he said.																								Badal Mondal, a Sonachura resident and a member of the zonal committee, said the jawans ransacked his house during a search this morning. They threw items on the floor. I dont know what they were looking for. They also beat up my brother Anup and took him away. He was released after we contacted senior police officials.																								Swapan Bera, a primary schoolteacher and member of the local committee in Amdabad, had a similar complaint. 																								The jawans arrived in four jeeps at my house after I had left for school around noon. When my wife Sheila couldnt find the keys to the steel cupboard, they broke it open. I have lost some important papers I had kept in the cupboard, Swapan said.																								Two CPM workers, Ganesh Ghorai and Krishnapada Ghorai, were picked up in Brindabanchowk but released later. Both Ganesh and Krishnapada were beaten up. The CRPF was to help restore peace. But they are spreading panic, Ashok said. 																								The CRPF said Badals brother Anup was detained on several charges, including those of attempt to murder. 																								CRPF deputy inspector-general Alok Raj said a list of the most wanted in Nandigram had been sought from the police but it had not been furnished so far.																								Missing list																								The police will hand over a list of missing persons prepared by the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee to the CID. Senior officials said they had the names of 42 people allegedly missing since the November 10 firing on Pratirodh Committee marchers in Maheshpur. 																								We have a list of 42 missing persons and we will hand it over to the CID, Panda said.

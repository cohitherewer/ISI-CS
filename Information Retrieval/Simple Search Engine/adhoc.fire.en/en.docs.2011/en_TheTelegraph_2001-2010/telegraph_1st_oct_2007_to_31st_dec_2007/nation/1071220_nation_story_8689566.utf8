				 Four black bucks dead

																								Hyderabad, Dec. 19 (PTI): Four black bucks were today found dead in the cornfields in Andhras Kurnool district.
																								A forest official said the animals, which roam freely in Devanur village at night, may have consumed fertilisers.
																								As the deaths appeared accidental, no action was likely against the farmers in whose fields the carcasses were found, he said. A post-mortem will, however, be done.
																								The official said some farmers of the area were hostile towards the black bucks as they damaged crops.

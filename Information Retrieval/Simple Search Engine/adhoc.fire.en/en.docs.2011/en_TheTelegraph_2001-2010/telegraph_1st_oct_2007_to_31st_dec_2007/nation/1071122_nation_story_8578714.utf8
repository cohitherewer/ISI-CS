				 Modi rebel pangs for Cong
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 BJP workers in Narendra Modi masks campaign in Ahmedabad for the Assembly elections. (PTI)																								Ahmedabad, Nov. 21: BJP rebels who joined the Congress in Gujarat have become a source of worry for their new party.																								Resentment among local Congress workers is rising against six rebels that the party  hoping to come back to power after 17 years in next months polls  decided to field from three seats in Amreli, two in Kutch and one in Surat.																								The hostility is particularly deep in Amreli, the anti-Narendra Modi campaigns epicentre, with district Congress chief Thakarsinh Mehtaliya saying the three rebels were unlikely to be accepted by his partys workers. He said the Congress would be better off without the trio  Bechar Bhadani, Bavku Undhad and Balu Tanti.																								Mehtaliya said it would be tough to motivate grassroots workers to campaign for the three who, as BJP and RSS members, had in the past fought against Congress leaders.																								Another problem was that the rebels joined the Congress without any local BJP colleagues, who might have ensured that they were not isolated in their new party.																								Mehtaliya feared the Congress might have just ruined its chances in Saurashtra by inducting rebels and making wrong choices in several constituencies in the region, where the party had begun to gain popular support.																								The rebels were aware of the resentment that they had stirred by dashing the aspirations of local Congress workers who could not get tickets because of them. But they hoped that ultimately, the local units would honour the Congress high commands decision to field them.																								In other places, too, the Congress was facing resistance from within. In Surendranagar, local leaders were upset with the choice of outsiders  those who did not belong to the region from where they have been fielded  as candidates for the Halvad and Wadhwan constituencies.																								Such was the rancour that former finance minister Arvind Sanghvi and other senior leaders told Congress bosses in Delhi they would resign if Himanshu Vyas, who is from Ahmedabad, was not dropped from the Wadhwan seat.																								Today, Sanghvi appeared to have softened his stand but said the party had not addressed his grievances. 																								Workers in another constituency, Halvad, were also seething because of the decision to nominate Devji Fatepara, a businessman from faraway Rajkot. 																								But state Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki ruled out any change. Theres nothing we can do. It is the high commands decision to field Vyas from Wadhwan. There is no question of reconsidering it.

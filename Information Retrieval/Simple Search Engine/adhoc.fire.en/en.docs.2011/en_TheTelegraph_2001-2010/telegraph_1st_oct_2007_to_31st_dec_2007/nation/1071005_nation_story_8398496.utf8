				 PM sermon for police
				 - A family affair at intelligence meet
 NISHIT DHOLABHAI 				 	 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh confers the Presidents police medal on son-in-law Ashok Kumar Patnaik in Delhi on Thursday. The 1983-batch officer of the Gujarat cadre, who is married to Singhs second daughter Daman, is a joint director in the Intelligence Bureau. Singh, who was addressing top police officers at an event organised by the IB, patted the 49-year-old Patnaik and exchanged a few words with him after presenting the medal and a citation. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Oct. 4: Bihar was on Manmohan Singhs mind but the message will be of use to the Prime Ministers good friend Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as well.																								The Prime Minister today told police not to forget the common mans everyday worries, suggesting that one of the reasons behind the recent spurt in mob justice could be dissatisfaction over the functioning of the law-enforcement system.																								we are seeing many incidents of vigilantism and citizens taking law into their own hands, particularly in Bihar, he told a meeting of directors-general of police and senior Intelligence Bureau officials.																								The lynching of 10 alleged thieves in Bihar might have prompted him to make the statement. But the comments came at a time the Bhattacharjee government in Bengal is facing a public backlash over police interference in the marital life of Rizwanur Rahman and Priyanka Todi.																								Seek out the citizen, identify his needs and expectations, address them on priority. Try to improve their satisfaction levels.																								People want a secure environment to live and carry out their activities. Their worries centre around petty nuisances, harassment by local criminals or gangs, goondaism, dadagiri, and in some areas, threats of violence and even kidnapping and extortion, Singh added.																								The polices role in maintaining law and order on matters which directly impinge citizenry are often neglected, he said. 																								While some of it (vigilantism) could be a result of personal frustration, some of it also arises out of dissatisfaction over the functioning of the law-enforcement and justice system, Singh said.																								He asked policy-makers to examine new methods of crowd control and dispersal and develop a user-friendly police uniform. 																								The Prime Minister also touched upon harassment of womens and parents concerns over child abuse. As we get more urbanised, these offences are increasing.																								Asking policemen to improve their image, Singh said people should be willing to approach a policeman with the same assurance with which they visit a doctor. 																								Singh said policemen should introspect what peoples concerns are as far as policing is concerned, what they expect of the police and whether peoples priorities are being effectively addressed. 																								He referred to a meeting of the steering committee of the national police mission, a body set up to suggest measures to improve policing. I would like the mission to come forward with practical solutions to problems like non-registration of FIRs.

				 SMS rap 
																								New Delhi, Oct. 9 (PTI): Idea Cellular has been found guilty of deficiency in service for disconnecting the phone line of a consumer who had refused to pay an incorrect SMS bill.																								The Delhi Consumer Commission recently slapped a penalty of Rs 8,000 on the company and ordered it to restore the number of Vikas Rathaur. It also asked Idea Cellular to revise his bill.																								Rathaur had said he converted his pre-paid mobile connection into a post-paid one in August last year and subscribed to an offer of 1000 SMS free.																								The complainant was, however, charged for text messages in the next three months bills though he did not cross the limit during any calculation period. 																								The company did not take note of his complaints and disconnected his line for non-payment of bill.

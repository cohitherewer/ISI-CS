				 Tea and talks spark rumours 
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Rahul Gandhi at the summit. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Oct. 12: After the morning relief, the day resembled an Indian ODI innings for the Congress  a solid start by the Big Two followed by bouts of nervousness.																								The first howzatt went up at 5.30pm when the Prime Minister decided to have tea with President Pratibha Patil.																								The Congress broke out in a sweat. Was Manmohan Singh too unhappy to continue?																								An hour later, news that the Congress core committee was meeting had the party on tenterhooks. Why such a meeting when Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan had already settled the nuclear-deal row, and crisis managers Pranab Mukherjee and Ahmed Patel were out of town?																								A third shiver ran down the Congresss spine when a member of a ministers staff gave out the wrong venue for the core committee meeting: 10 Janpath.																								It was a slip of the tongue. The meeting was on at its customary venue: the Prime Ministers 7 Race Course Road residence.																								The whispers and rumours somewhat ruined home minister Shivraj Patils birthday celebrations with callers more interested in the latest news than the cake, sweets or the ministers famed assortment of Maharashtrian namkeens.																								With all the gravity at his command, Patil kept telling everyone there was no threat to the government. But in Congress circles, Patils breezy optimism has always been taken with a pinch of salt.																								Senior Congress officials gave each other knowing glances  the Prime Minister was surely torn between his convictions and the party leaderships command?																								They were not completely off the mark. Left to him, Manmohan may have made the nuclear deal a matter of prestige and packed his bags, a thought that is believed to have crossed his mind a few times. He, however, would have also realised the debt he owed the party and Sonia.																								He was appointed Prime Minister although he did not contest the Lok Sabha elections. Sonia had supported him all along on the nuclear agreement, and is believed to have given him a commitment to back the deal in the future, too.																								Some Congress leaders, however, feel the pause on the deal would hurt the Prime Minister. Apart from undermining his political authority, it may spur the Left to similarly veto his retail and pension reforms and assert itself on various other thorny issues.																								Manmohans managers also fear similar veto being wielded by allies such as Mayavati, Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad.																								The Prime Minister is believed to have been ready for snap polls in the face of the Lefts threat and initially seemed to have the party with him.																								A majority of senior ministers and Congress allies, however, worked hard to persuade Sonia to avoid a showdown. Sources said she was not entirely convinced but gave in to the majority view.

				 Indian flees to new life, US cops sink $250000

																								Chicago, Dec. 30 (AP): Anu Solanki wanted to get out of her marriage, so the 24-year-old Indian woman met a male friend at a Chicago-area forest preserve on Christmas Eve, jumped into his car and headed down the highway for what she hoped would be a new life in southern California.
																								Only days later, she told investigators, did she learn from an online report that her disappearance had made headlines and prompted a costly search by authorities, who had feared that Solanki might have drowned in a river that runs through the forest preserve.
																								She expressed regret and embarrassment, the Cook county sheriffs office spokesman, Bill Cunningham, said on Saturday, a day after Solanki flew back to Chicago from Los Angeles and spoke to investigators for several hours. She claims she in no way meant to deceive people into thinking she fell into the Des Plaines river.
																								Authorities spent about $250,000 on their search, which included divers and a helicopter. Her family also handed out flyers with Solankis picture.
																								Obviously were upset that so many individuals have had to work on this for so many days and that so many resources were spent on it, Cunningham said. But she maintained she had no idea it would create the kind of reaction it did.
																								Police will meet prosecutors soon to determine if Solanki broke any laws, but Cunningham declined to say what charges she could possibly face.
																								The first thing youd think of is making a false report. But she didnt make a false report, he said. Its not a crime to deceive your husband and family.
																								The discovery of a Honda Civic Solanki drove to work the day she went missing heightened concerns for her welfare. The doors were open and the keys inside.
																								She told investigators she left the car because it belonged to her husband.
																								She didnt want to have any of his possessions and wanted to completely break with him, Cunningham said. She indicated that she was not a victim of abuse in their relationship. She just stated she regretted getting married and wanted out of the marriage.
																								A message left on Saturday for Solankis husband, Dignesh Solanki, was not returned.
																								The Solankis were born in Gujarat, and were married on October 6, 2006. They held a second wedding on May 6 in New Jersey.
																								Cunningham said investigators inquired about whether their marriage was arranged, but it was not clear whether or not it was.
																								Anu Solanki, who spent Saturday night at a Chicago-area hotel, claimed that she and the 23-year-old man who drove her to California, Karan C. Jani, were close friends and not romantically involved, Cunningham said. They had known each other about a year.
																								It was Jani who first saw the report about the search for Solanki on a website on Thursday; he then encouraged her to contact her family.
																								By the time authorities learned on Friday that Solanki had been in touch with relatives they had already concluded by looking at cellphone records that she was alive.
																								In their interview with Solanki on Friday, the authorities also learned the fate of a religious statue that featured in their investigation.
																								Dignesh Solanki had said during the week that his wife may have been placing a religious statue in the Des Plaines river on the day she went missing.
																								The statue of Ganesh was used in the couples marriage ceremony. It had broken and a religious leader told them that placing it in the water would ward off bad luck.
																								Before she got in her friends car and headed to California, she did what she told her husband she would do in a quest for better luck: she placed it in the river.

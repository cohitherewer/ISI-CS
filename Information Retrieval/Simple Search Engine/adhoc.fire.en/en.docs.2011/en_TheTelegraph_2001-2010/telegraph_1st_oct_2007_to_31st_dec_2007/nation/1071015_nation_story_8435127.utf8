				 11 hired for Posco site held hostage 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Bhubaneswar, Oct. 14: Eleven people, including 10 contract workers hired for constructing a bridge on the Posco site in Jagatsinghpur, Orissa, are being held captive for the past three days.																								The abduction came to light as four senior officials of the South Korean steel maker were released seven hours after being held hostage.																								Abhay Sahu, the president of the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, the organisation spearheading the anti-steel plant agitation over the past 27 months, said: We have detained 10 labourers engaged to build a wooden bridge to the Posco site, and a driver. 																								He, however, said the hostages were safe and being looked after well. Nobody had come to the village for their release yet.																								A Posco official said the workers neither belonged to the company nor had they been engaged for any construction work connected with the steel plant.																								Jagatsinghpur district collector P.K. Meherda said the workers were hired by the states rural development department.																								The workers had unknowingly gone to Dhinkia village, the epicentre of the protest against the Posco plant, on October 11 to enquire about the location of the proposed wooden bridge and were captured, Meherda said. Talks are on. Hopefully, they will be released soon.

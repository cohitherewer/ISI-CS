				 Glare on south suspect 
 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES				 	 The blood-stained blast site Picture by Rohit Jain																								New Delhi, Oct. 12: Shahid Bilal, the Karachi-based operative of Bangladeshi militant group Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami, has emerged as the prime suspect behind the iftar blast at the Ajmer dargah yesterday.																								Sources said the Harkat may have been backed by the Jaish-e-Mohammed as both are strongly opposed to the Sufi strain of Islam. The Harkat and Jaish support the Deobandi sect of Islam.																								Bilal is suspected to have masterminded the Mecca Masjid explosion in Hyderabad in May. The dargah glare is on him because the modus operandi of both blasts is similar, the sources said.																								He may have pulled off the blast in cahoots with Jaish sleeper cells, they added.																								Home secretary Madhukar Gupta said the Centre was banking on close coordination between Rajasthan police and central investigative agencies to crack the blast. The Rajasthan government said it would set up a special investigative team to look into the blast.																								This team will remain in close and continuous coordination with state and central agencies, Gupta said after talks with the Rajasthan director general of police.																								The strength of central agencies should be used by the state SIT at all times, Gupta said. A team of National Security Guard bomb experts left for Ajmer today.																								Preliminary investigations have revealed that tri-nitro toluene (TNT) was used in the blast triggered apparently by a cellphone alarm.																								One of the two bombs placed on the dargah premises was today found unexploded. We are analysing the explosive material and assembling of the device, Gupta said.																								The police will begin consultations with the dargah committee on what arrangements can be made to beef up security at the shrine, sources said.																								With Id falling on Sunday, the Centre has alerted states to threats from anti-national elements and asked them to tighten security at places of worship and crowded spots.																								Sleuths are looking into the trend of using commonly available chemicals to set off explosions. While ammonium nitrate was used in the Hyderabad blasts in August, potassium chlorate and sulphuric acid were used in the April 2006 Jama Masjid blasts.

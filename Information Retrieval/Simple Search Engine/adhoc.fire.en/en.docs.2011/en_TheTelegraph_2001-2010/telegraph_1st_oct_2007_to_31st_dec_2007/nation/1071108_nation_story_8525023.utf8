				 Circus rape summons for Maya MLA
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Nov. 7: One more politician today added his name to the heartland roll of dishonour after a magistrate summoned a Bahujan Samaj Party legislator and his brother for allegedly raping two Nepalese employees of their circus company.																								Bulandshahr MLA Mohammad Alim and his brother Ahsan were told to appear in court on November 19 by the Muzaffarnagar additional chief judicial magistrate, Mitan Chandra.																								The summons came a day after BSP minister Anantsen Yadav was forced to step down amid allegations that he masterminded the kidnap and alleged murder of a young woman, believed to have been romantically involved with him.																								The Mayavati-led BSP government yesterday ordered a CBI probe into the womans disappearance.																								The Muzaffarnagar magistrates summons to Alim, who is in his late 30s, and his younger sibling followed the rescue of 40 minor girls from the circus company in June 2004.																								A case had been registered then and a medical examination confirmed the two had been raped, but the Uttar Pradesh MLA got a stay order from a court and succeeded in delaying the trial for nearly three-and-a-half years.																								Kailash Satyarthi, president of NGO Global March Against Child Labour and part of the raid on the circus, said he was happy the law had finally caught up with the influential leader.																								He also claimed that when the raid was on, one of the managers of the circus whipped out his pistol and fired at the activists before police overpowered him.																								In Faizabad, Anantsens wife Indu said her husband was a victim of political conspiracy. She told reporters her husband was not involved in any way with the 24-year-old Shashi who disappeared on October 22. We know the girl and her family members because of our political background, Indu said.																								Shashis father Yogendra Kumar, also a BSP leader, has, however, submitted some photographs and a letter in English to a court in Faizabad to prove that his daughter was close to the minister.

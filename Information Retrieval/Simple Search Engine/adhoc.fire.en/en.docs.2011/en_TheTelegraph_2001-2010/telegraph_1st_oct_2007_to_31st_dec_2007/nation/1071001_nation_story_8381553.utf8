				 Cong cautious on nuke talks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 30: The Congress will wait till the UPA-Left panel on the nuclear deal meets this week before responding to statements made by the CPM politburo and central committee.																								The panel will hold its third meeting on October 5 after Sonia Gandhi and Pranab Mukherjee return from the US on October 3 or 4. 																								The Congress, however, does not hope to achieve a positive result as the second interaction saw the two sides agree to disagree after the Left rejected the UPAs position paper.																								A senior Congress leader said at best he hoped to be able to assess if the Left was serious about persisting with the panel or calling it a day.																								Sources said they had reason to believe that if the Left withdrew support, the decision would be prompted not just by its anti-imperialist line but many other factors. 																								The most important would be the position of the BJP and the third front.																								The last has not been heard on the imperialism versus communalism polemics. The BJP may not count for much in Left strongholds but its leaders will take into account the big picture before doing anything, a source said.																								The Congress was assessing the impact of the Ram setu row in west and north India to gauge if it could become another Ayodhya card and the extent to which it had recharged the BJP and the Sangh cadre.																								With the BJPs strengths yet to be assessed, the sources claimed the Samajwadi Party did not want early polls. 																								 Samajwadi Party sources said they would like a Lok Sabha poll at least after eight months. By that time, Mayavati would have been discredited enough, said a party MP.

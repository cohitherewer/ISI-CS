				 Friendship express runs into a fence
 NISHIT DHOLABHAI 				 	 A file picture of the Maitreyee Express taken in July Picture by Amit Datta																								New Delhi, Nov. 1: The Maitreyee Express is struggling to reach where the Samjhauta Expresses has gone.																								Bangladesh has deferred the launch of the Calcutta-Dhaka train service because it isnt prepared to accept Indias condition that 800 metres from the border on either side should be fenced.																								Such differences on security measures havent cropped up with Pakistan over running the cross-border Samjhauta Express.																								The Dhaka train was to be flagged off in July. The schedule was later pushed to October, possibly around Id, because customs and immigration facilities werent ready then.																								The message that the Friendship Express wouldnt be rolling out anytime soon was conveyed to the Indian authorities at a recent meeting between the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR). Dhaka doesnt want any structure within 150 yards of the zero line (the border point) on either side of the border. 																								India wants box fencing of tracks, from the zero line to Gede in Bengals Nadia district. Home ministry sources had said last month that 200 metres of the fence were ready.																								Bangladesh has objected to the use of the word fence, and also said that such a step amounts to fortification. Dhaka believes such measures go against the spirit of the historic 1974 pact between Mujibur Rahman and Indira Gandhi. 																								Although the message about the refusal to accept the fencing was conveyed by the Bangladesh Rifles, the opposition has come from senior military authorities in Dhaka.																								Indian home ministry officials, however, made it clear they would keep insisting on the fence.																								Pakistan hasnt had problems when we took security measures for the train service but Bangladesh fears we will insist on such fencing at other places, too, a home ministry official said.																								Asked when the Dhaka train could start, the official said: When Bangladesh feels the need for it.																								Officials in the ministry are surprised at the opposition to the fencing because the train service would benefit Bangladesh more as thousands come to Calcutta for treatment and on business.																								Dhaka hasnt objected to checking the papers of truck drivers and consignments at Petrapole, in Bengals North 24-Parganas, though these were conducted within 10 metres of the border. 																								A meeting was held last month between railway officials of both countries but the discussions were limited to the running of goods trains. Railway officials said they would wait for a go-ahead from the ministries of home and external affairs before taking the next step on the Friendship Express.																								The final number of coaches and fares would have to be worked out through a memorandum of understanding with Dhaka.

																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 30: For Orissa the year was marked by a series of clashes.
																								The year ended with communal clashes in tribal-dominated Khandhamal, beginning from Christmas. The carnage that followed claimed three lives (two died in the clashes and one in police firing). The district remains tense despite the presence of central paramilitary forces. 
																								The year also witnessed sustained agitation over land and water issues. During the early part of 2007, heavy police in the proposed Posco plant area in Jagatsinghpur, apparently to mount pressure on the anti-displacement brigade, was deployed. But, the state was forced to pull out forces due to adverse opinion. 
																								Towards the end of the year, the same area witnessed strife between anti-plant protestors and supporters in November, in which more than 15 persons were injured. However, after two years, the police and officials got the opportunity to enter the proposed plant area, which was out of bounds for them. The project still remains on shaky grounds due to resistance by the locals. 
																								In the southern district of Kalahandi, tribals carried on agitation against the alumina refinery and bauxite mining project of Vedanta Group. Their struggle received a shot in the arm with Supreme Court denying permission to the Vedanta Alumina to go ahead with the plant and project in the Niyamgiri hills. 
																								Like land, water, too, was an issue. Farmers in western Orissa raised their voice in protest against the allocation of Hirakud water to the industries. Much to the discomfiture of the government, the police forces used lathi charge on a peasant rally at Burla in Sambalpur. 
																								The agitation intensified with the backing of the Opposition parties, who stalled Assembly for nine days and held rallies supporting the cause. The government had to abruptly end the winter session, 18 days ahead of schedule, triggering a yet another controversy. 
																								In July, Orissa woke up to a shocking news of discovery of female foetuses from a private nursing home in the sleepy town of Nayagarh. Subsequent raids revealed that the illegal practice of pre-natal sex determination and female foeticide was prevalent all over the state. 
																								Smaller scandals rocked the state, too. States school and mass education minister Bishnu Das was embroiled with a scandal in which his sons marksheet was found to have been fudged. Das resigned, while several senior officials of the Orissa Board of Secondary Education, were put behind bars. 
																								That wasnt the only resignation of the state as recently, steel and mines minister Padmanabha Behera tendered his resignation in the wake of the clashes between Pano, a Dalit community and Kondh, a tribe in his home district.

				 Magic cancer bullets
 NIGEL HAWKES 																								London, Oct. 30: A new targeted therapy against cancer has shown impressive results in animal experiments. 																								By using a beam of ultra-violet light to activate antibodies inside a tumour, a team at Newcastle University has created magic bullets that can use the bodys immune system to destroy tumours while leaving healthy tissues unharmed. 																								The magic bullets use antibodies  the bodys own natural defences  that are injected into the tumour. But before injection, the antibodies are cloaked by attaching them to an organic oil that renders them ineffective.																								Once in place, a beam of ultraviolet light breaks up the cloaking chemical, bringing the antibody back to life. The antibody then binds to T-cells, the bodys defence system, and triggers them to target the surrounding tissue. 																								Antibodies are the big growth area in cancer therapy. Drugs such as Avastin and Herceptin have shown good results in shrinking tumours. 																								But targeting them precisely and avoiding damage to the surrounding healthy tissue have proved stumbling blocks. The team believes that its technique could reduce or eliminate these problems. 																								Two papers published today in the journal ChemMedChem report that in a small animal trial, the technique eliminated ovarian cancers in five out of six mice, and greatly reduced the tumours size in the sixth mouse. 																								The body is not very effective at using its own defences to fight cancer, possibly because it fails to recognise the tumours as a threat. The aim of the technique is to activate the killer T-cells to attack cancer cells and destroy them.																								However, the process will require extensive testing in animals and human trials before it reaches a cancer clinic. David Glover, an expert in antibody technology and drug trials, estimated yesterday that it would be a decade before such a product could reach the market.					 THE TIMES, LONDON

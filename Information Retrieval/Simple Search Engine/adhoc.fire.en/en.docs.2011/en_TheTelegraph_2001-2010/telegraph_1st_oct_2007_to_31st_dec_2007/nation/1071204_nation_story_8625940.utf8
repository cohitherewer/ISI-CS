				 Ad guns for dictator
 BASANT RAWAT				 	 Keshubhai Patel																								Ahmedabad, Dec. 3: Gujarati newspapers today carried a half-page advertisement with a picture of BJP heavyweight Keshubhai Patel and a purported quote from him saying the dictator should be overthrown. The reference is clearly to chief minister Narendra Modi.																								The advertisement has been issued by the Sardar Patel Utkarsh Samiti, an organisation floated by Surats powerful Patel diamond barons, together with suspended rebel MLAs Dheeru Gajera and Gordhan Zadaphia.																								Keshubhai, the mentor of the party dissidents, enjoys huge support among the Patel community, which is one of the biggest threats to Modi. But till now, he had preferred to stay in the background, neither openly joining the rebellion nor agreeing to campaign for the BJP.																								The advertisement quotes Keshubhai as saying: Ask the people to overthrow the dictator  apparently a direction to his associates. It suggests he may now come out openly against Modi, who had replaced him as chief minister in 2001.																								A source close to Keshubhai said the former chief minister would travel to Saurashtra and make his displeasure with Modi known to the Patel community. Modi is expected to struggle in the region, which accounts for 58 seats  almost a third of the states 182 Assembly constituencies.																								Even if he addresses just one meeting in Saurashtra, it will make a huge difference, tilting the balance in favour of anti-BJP candidates from the Congress or other parties, the source said.																								State BJP spokesman Vijay Rupani claimed the quote in the advertisement was an old story that has no relevance today. He cited Keshubhais recent declaration that he would not quit the party.																								Conscious of Keshubhais political clout, the party officially keeps claiming he is not a dissident but a senior and respected leader. Central BJP leader and Gujarat election minder Arun Jaitley has met Keshubhai several times.																								Rupani, asked if Keshubhai would be expelled if he campaigned against the party, said: We will be forced to take action if he openly campaigns against the party. But as of now it is a hypothetical question as he is still a BJP leader  a very senior and respected leader.

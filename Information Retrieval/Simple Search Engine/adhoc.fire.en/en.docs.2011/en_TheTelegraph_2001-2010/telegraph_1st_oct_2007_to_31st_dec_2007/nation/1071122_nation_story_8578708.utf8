				 Friday fate for Uphaar guilty
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 21: The trial court hearing the Uphaar fire case will on Friday pronounce the sentences on the 12 convicted.																								Arguments on the quantum of punishment began in the packed court today. But only the lawyers of those convicted could put forward their points. The prosecutions turn will come tomorrow. The sentences were expected today. 																								The days proceedings were marked by high drama. Some lawyers who could not enter the courtroom started shouting and calmed down only after additional sessions judge Mamta Sehgal intervened. 																								Minutes later, a former official of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Shyam Sunder Sharma, one of those convicted besides Sushil and Gopal Ansal, fainted as soon as the defence began arguments. 																								The defence lawyers stressed that custodial punishment was not mandatory under Sections 304A, 337 and 338 of the IPC  under which their clients were held guilty. They said the convicted should either be fined or released on probation. 																								Other than the Ansals, who owned the cinema hall, and Sharma, those convicted on the lesser charge of causing deaths by negligent acts included MCD official N.D. Tiwari and Delhi fire service officer H.S. Panwar. 																								Seven others, including those responsible for managing the theatre, and three Delhi Vidyut Board officials were convicted on a graver charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the IPC. The maximum punishment under this section is life term.																								A spark in a faulty transformer in the theatres basement started the June 13, 1997, blaze in which 59 people had suffocated to death during the screening of Border. The transformer was installed in violation of norms. 																								Unhappy with the conviction of some of the main accused on lighter charges, the Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy said it would appeal Tuesdays verdict in the high court. The Ansals will also contest the ruling.

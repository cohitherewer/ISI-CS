				 Databank on BPO cabbies
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 5: Maharashtra police today said they would store details of call centre cabs and their drivers in computers to prevent another rape and murder on dark, lonely roads.																								We have decided to compile detailed records of all call centre cabs and their drivers and would appeal to the companies to scrutinise the background of the drivers and security guards they employ, state police chief P.S. Pasricha said today.																								For starters, we have decided to call a meeting of all Pune BPO managements.																								The move comes in the wake of young Jyoti Choudharys rape and murder in Pune last Thursday. The 22-year-old Wipro BPO employee had made the mistake of taking the company pool car though a stranger sat next to the driver.																								Two years ago, Bangalore-based call centre employee Pratibha Srikanth Murthy was raped and murdered by her pool-car driver. The incident sent ripples though the IT city but measures  like security guards in pick-up vehicles and background checks on drivers  introduced after the 24-year-olds death remained mostly on paper.																								Pasricha today dwelt on these points and said the Pune firm had flouted basic norms because the driver had a history of crime and was also suspected of raping a minor.																								Pune has around 1,500 cars of about 50 service providers that ferry these employees to and from work every day.																								The traffic police will now send a circular to IT and BPO firms like Wipro, Convergys, EDS, Infosys and EXL and collect the names, addresses and registration numbers of drivers and the service providers.																								The compiled data will be loaded on the computer system at the traffic police headquarters, said Pune SP (rural) Vishwas Nagre-Patil. Forty per cent of the executives working night shifts in call centres are women. We have decided to issue orders making it compulsory for every unit to depute security personnel in each cab, he added.

				 Minister name in rival murder plot
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 		FatmiPatna, Oct. 16: The name of Union minister Mohammed Ali Ashraf Fatmi has cropped up during the interrogation of six persons arrested for conspiring to murder deputy mayor Bobby Khan, Darbhanga police today said. 																								No FIR has been registered against the junior human resource development minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal MP from Darbhanga. But a police team will soon travel to New Delhi to question him.																								We arrested six persons, all with criminal antecedents, with arms during a raid today, said Pervez Khan, deputy superintendent of police, Darbhanga town. One of the accused, Allan Khan, named Fatmi in a conspiracy to kill Bobby Khan soon after the municipal elections a few months ago. 																								Allan Khan, who faces two murder charges, told the police in the presence of the districts executive magistrate that Fatmi, along with some other leaders, held a meeting to discuss ways to eliminate Bobby Khan, who could create problems in future polls. 																								Fatmi was not available for comment. 																								The deputy mayor has been provided with an armed security guard since October 11 following a request from him and an intelligence report, the DSP said. 																								A formal case of threat and conspiracy would be lodged against the minister only if the police are convinced that the allegation has merit, the officer added.																								Our team might ask the minister if any such meeting with the other people mentioned during interrogation actually took place. If he admits to conducting such a meeting, we would like to know when and where.																								Darbhanga police have intensified security in the town to pre-empt clashes between Fatmis supporters and those loyal to Bobby Khan. 																								The deputy mayor said the alleged plot was a political conspiracy by Fatmi. 																								So far, Darbhanga has been synonymous with Fatmi. Now that I am creating political space for myself, the MP is envious of my popularity and wants to eliminate me, he said. 																								Its not up to any individual to finish me off, he added.																								Its God or the public who can either take me up to great heights or throw me into deep valleys.

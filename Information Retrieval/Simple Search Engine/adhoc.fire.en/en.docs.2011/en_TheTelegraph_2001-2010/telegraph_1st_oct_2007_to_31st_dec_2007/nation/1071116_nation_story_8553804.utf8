				 Graft case jitters for CM
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Chauhan																								Bhopal, Nov. 15: Shivraj Singh Chauhan and his cabinet went into a panic huddle today after a case against the chief minister and his wife over the purchase of four heavy vehicles left the BJP governments survival in doubt.																								Lokayukta superintendent of police K.K. Lohani registered the case after Bhopal district judge R.K. Bhave yesterday directed the anti-corruption body to book the Madhya Pradesh leader, his wife Sadhna and four others under the Criminal Procedure Code.																								The scandal has come at a time the central BJP leadership had cleared Chauhan to lead the BJP in next years Assembly polls.																								Chauhan summoned an emergency meeting of his cabinet, which expressed full faith in him.																								State BJP chief Narendra Tomar said the Congress was desperate to bring down an elected government. They (the Congress) have been losing all by-elections and are rattled by the all-round development in the state. Now they are seeking the chief ministers resignation without any basis or substance.																								The Congress said Chauhan should resign on moral grounds.																								The chief minister must step down immediately, former chief minister Digvijay Singh said. We do not expect a free and fair probe as long as Chauhan is chief minister.																								The order for the probe came after Ramesh Sahu, a social worker, urged the Lokayukta to register a case against Chauhan, his wife and the others for extending undue favours to cement company JP Associates in Rewa district by allotting prime land.																								The petitioner alleged that in return for the favour, the four dumpers  each costs about Rs 50 lakh  were bought in Sadhnas name.																								As the controversy broke, registration details of the vehicles were mysteriously removed from the website of the state transport department.																								There were more discrepancies. Sadhnas address in the registration papers has been given as J.P. Nagar Plant, Rewa district, but a check revealed that no person by that name stayed at the address.																								Neither Chauhan nor his wife is from Rewa. Moreover, purchase of these vehicles did not figure on the affidavit Chauhan had filed at the time of contesting the Budhini Assembly bypoll in April 2006. 																								When the scandal broke, Chauhan had first chosen to ignore it but later admitted that his wife had purchased the vehicles, which were later sold to the cement company.

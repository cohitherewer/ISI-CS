				 Sangh not for Modi, cadres free to be
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 File picture of an RSS rally in Delhi																								Ahmedabad, Dec. 3: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has decided to remain neutral in the Gujarat elections. This means its workers are free to work for whichever party or candidate they like as long as they are not anti-Hindu.																								Narendra Modi will especially be banking on the Sangh workers because Vishwa Hindu Parishad president Ashok Singhals indirect go-ahead to his organisation to work for the chief minister has not galvanised its workers.																								In 2005, at a meeting in Chitrakoot, the RSS decided it would not take part in any election. That position remains firm today, in Gujarat and other places. But a swayamsevak (Sangh volunteer) is independent  he can take part in any activity, said Pradip Jain, the Sanghs authorised spokesperson in Gujarat.																								In 2002, the Sangh had held several Hindu jagran (awakening) meetings in the run-up to the elections. Its pracharaks (propagandists) canvassed for the BJP in public forums without the candidates being present to retain the appearance of neutrality.																								This time there would be no jagran meetings, said Jain, a managing trustee of the Vishwa Samvad Kendra, the Sanghs publicity front.																								He refused to say whether the Sangh was keeping away from the polls because of its reported problems with Modi.																								The Gujarat BJP is still assessing the possible fallout of the Sanghs refusal to participate. Sources said it could hit the party hard in the Saurashtra region, which has 58 Assembly seats and where Modi is grappling with infighting and rebellion.																								They added that since the Sangh had left poll participation to the conscience of the swayamsevaks, Modi had injected large doses of Hindutva into his campaign. He wants to assure the Sangh that he has not deviated from its ideology.																								As for the Parishads lukewarmness, its local chief, Kaushik Mehta, was unavailable for comments. But Parishad sources said that in Gujarat, only one person mattered and he was Praveen Togadia, the general secretary.																								Togadia fell out with Modi long ago and is believed to be backing the Patel dissidents and the loyalists of former chief minister Keshubhai Patel.																								Just as Uma Bhartis conciliatory gesture (towards Modi) had no effect on her party here, Singhals appeal is a call to the deaf. If it had come from Togadia, it would have meant something else, a source said.																								Jain, asked if the Sanghs decision could hurt the BJPs prospects, said: The RSS is not a political organisation; it is a social organisation. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh has more members than the BJP, and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (the Sanghs student arm) is the largest union in India. Yet the BJP gets the media attention because its a political party.																								He said that the 2005 decision was taken keeping in mind the overall national situation.																								The Sangh will not make an exception for Gujarat. It does not function in that manner, Jain added.																								Elections are one part of democracy but the national consciousness is driven and shaped by a host of other factors. Politics will get the importance it deserves from the Sangh but we also have the nation to think of.

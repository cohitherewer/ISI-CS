				 To Janpath and then to Prithviraj

 RASHEED KIDWAI
				 	 Sonia, Mamata, Advani				 
																								New Delhi, Dec. 7: Mamata Banerjee today stepped into 10 Janpath after six years but before the buzz about a realignment could gather momentum, she was knocking at 30 Prithviraj Road, L.K. Advanis home.
																								Mamata had called on Sonia Gandhi to discuss Nandigram. Sources said she had an advice for the Congress president: stay away from the CPM.
																								The news of Mamatas visit led to a short spell of animated chatter with some Congress leaders wondering if the Trinamul Congress chief was contemplating a mahajot or a homecoming. Her meeting with the BJP leader brought all the excitement to a sudden end.
																								Mamata urged Sonia to disregard political compulsions and visit Nandigram. The Trinamul leader claimed that the Congress president shared her concerns over the developments in East Midnapores troubled zone.
																								I requested her to send a UPA team to Nandigram. I can understand her political compulsions but this is a matter of human rights, Mamata said.
																								Congress leaders from Bengal said the Trinamul president may have a habit of flaunting her proximity to Sonia, but the two were far from close.
																								Sonia is believed to have made it clear that all future ties with Mamata would depend on her distance from the BJP. That is, as long as Mamata insists on taking the BJP along in her campaign to oust the Left, the Congress would not join it.
																								In recent weeks, the Congress leadership has been looking at future ties with Mamata with some hope. The party reckons that either the nuclear-deal standoff or the outcome of the Gujarat polls will force the two sides to come closer.
																								But in both scenarios, the Congress would want Mamata to leave the BJP. Congress leaders from Bengal are meeting here tomorrow for a political assessment of the situation in their state. Sources said Mamata would not be discussed.

				 Jaya admits setu U-turn
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Oct. 17: Jayalalithaa today said the Sethusamudram ship channel project would be a disaster. 																								Responding to chief minister M. Karunanidhis statement that the ADMK, too, had committed itself to the project in its election manifesto, she said the party had revised its stand.																								The ADMKs support in the past for the project to dredge a navigable canal to link the Gulf of Mannar with the Palk Strait was based on the information available then, she said. 																								Evidence that the project was not viable had come up since, Jayalalithaa (in picture) added. Depending on the new information made available by scientists and others, you have to change your viewpoint, the ADMK chief said. 																								Jayalalithaa argued that the canal would not be economically viable and would destroy the ecosystem of the Gulf of Mannar Marine Park, besides ruining the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. It would also be a security threat, she said.																								With the canal depth at 12 metres, most international bulk carriers would not be able to pass through and it would be a net loss for the Centre, she said.																								She added that Axis Bank, a key financier, had backed out after the project cost shot up from Rs 2,427 crore to Rs 4,000 crore. This could not be independently confirmed.																								Intruder scare																								Jayalalithaa said an intruder entered her house and walked up to the library on the first floor yesterday. She blamed the state government for the grave security lapse. 																								My sister Sassikala spotted the intruder and raised the alarm, she said, adding that the trespass could not be taken lightly as she faced threats from the LTTE and other extremist groups. 																								There are just three constables at any point of time guarding my house, she said.

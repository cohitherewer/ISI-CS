				 Human bombs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Oct. 5: Hyderabad police have announced a red alert following an intelligence warning and a terror suspects claim that four human bombs are waiting to strike during Ramazan. 																								City police commissioner Balwinder Singh, who met senior officials of his force today, directed security at all temples and mosques to be tightened with the deployment of the Rapid Action Force and the CRPF till Ramazan ends on October 14. 																								Four Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (Huji) operatives arrived from Calcutta last week and have taken shelter in either Nalgonda or Mahboobnagar, an intelligence source said, quoting Majid, 21, the brother of Huji chief Shahid Bilal, operating from Saudi Arabia. 																								Majid has been in police custody since September 10, when he was picked up with three others.																								He has told the police the four militants arrived in September from Calcutta via Chennai, the source said. The target is to create violence either at a temple or a mosque in Hyderabad or in the neighbouring districts during Id-ul Fitr prayers or Dussehra, he was quoted as saying.																								While the police are not sure how authentic Majids claim is, they are not willing to take any chances, especially after the central intelligence agencies warned last week of a possible terrorist attack in Hyderabad. 																								Reports of a large haul of RDX in the state, which is yet to be traced by the police, have increased their worries. 																								Rizwan Gazi, the suspected Bangladeshi activist thought to be close to Shahed, and his sister Shafi Rafsanjani, a suspected carrier of explosives, are still in custody. 																								Police officials say they will soon move court to subject Rizwan, Shafi and Majid to narco-analysis tests to gathermore information on the operations of Huji in Andhra Pradesh and other south Indian cities. 																								Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy reviewed the situation with the home minister after the alerts and directed officials to step up security at all vulnerable locations in the state.

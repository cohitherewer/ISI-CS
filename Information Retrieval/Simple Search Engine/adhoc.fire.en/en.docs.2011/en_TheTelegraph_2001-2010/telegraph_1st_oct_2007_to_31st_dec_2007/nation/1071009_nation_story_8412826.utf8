				 Shoot parent, snatch land slice
 							 - Family violence on rise as kin turns against kin for property ANANYA SENGUPTA				 	 An old house in Mumbai: Bone of contention																								Mumbai, Oct. 8: Bhausaheb Jakhere was livid. His father was refusing to divide the family land and give him his share.																								Last Tuesday, the Nashik farmer picked up a grass-cutter and hacked the old man to death.																								Ganesh Bandekar had been raging for a long time. His mother, the Juhu auto-rickshaw driver felt, was acting like a miser with the family flat.																								Last month, he shot her.																								Sixty-two-year-old Vasundhara survived because the gun misfired.																								On September 8, three days before Ganesh went berserk, hotelier Mohan Shetty, 32, shot and critically wounded his elder brother Manohar, 34, in the presence of their mother.																								The brothers had long been fighting over the considerable property their father Jaya Shetty, the founder of the hotel Golden Crown, had left behind.																								Call it the economics of family violence, but the trend, sociologists warn, is catching on with disputes  earlier settled within the four walls of the house  increasingly turning ugly.																								Mumbai high court lawyer Amit Karkhanis agrees that the signs are dangerous, but not entirely unexpected. 																								Property prices are at an all-time high in Mumbai. Hutments in Cuffe Parade are being bought by builders for anything between Rs 80 lakh and a crore. Theres a huge demand for properties in prime locations. Even slums and semi-slums are now worth a mind-boggling amount, he says.																								This generation doesnt want to spend their lives using common toilets in rundown shanties. They want to sell their properties and move to a place that costs half the amount and invest the rest in fixed deposits and live on the interest.																								But what if the parents come in the way? Eliminate them, simple.																								Thats what Jakhere did. He wanted his share of the land his father and his younger siblings worked on. But his 65-year-old father wasnt agreeing.																								Vasundhara cant believe her elder son tried to shoot her for a share of the Rs 1.5-crore flat she owns in the city.																								I never thought he would attack me for the property, though he was very arrogant and rude with me, she says. 																								The Bandekars and the Shettys werent the only families that shocked Mumbaikars over the past month.																								Premlata Chavan got back her home in Mulund from her son and daughter-in-law after a nine-year battle in court. The court made the couple sign a bond and promise to treat their mother well.																								Barely a month later, the 80-year-old was back in court.																								After the courts verdict I got entry into the house, but my life became miserable as they stopped giving me food and also stopped me from entering the kitchen to prepare food for myself. They also harassed me mentally and physically, she says.																								Sociologists say the middle classes, for long the keepers of morality in Indian society, are giving up their value systems.																								They are now aping the upper class. Because of their exposure to the western way of living, their value systems are no longer strong enough. They now no longer want to inherit, they want to grab, says Myrtle Barse, a professor of sociology at a Mumbai college.																								As Karkhanis puts it, theres a lot of economics involved in this trend.																								Experts say the trend can be curbed if Indian parents leave watertight wills that cannot be challenged in court.																								Barse, however, doesnt see that happening, at least not in the near future.																								Indian parents are highly emotional, says the professor. Its going to take a number of years for them to do such a thing. As is the case now, they would rather give their wealth to a wayward child than give it to a cat.																								Or a dog, for that matter, as Leona Helmsley did.																								The US hotel empress, who died in August, left her dog, Trouble, $12 million but disinherited two of her grandchildren.

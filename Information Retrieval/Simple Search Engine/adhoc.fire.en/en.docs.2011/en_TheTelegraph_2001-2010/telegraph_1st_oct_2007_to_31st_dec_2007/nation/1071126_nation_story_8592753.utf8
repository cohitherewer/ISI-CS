				 Spanish facelift for Varanasi
 MANDIRA NAYAR																								New Delhi, Nov. 25: Blast-scarred Varanasi is set to get a Spanish makeover.																								Impressed by the handling of the March 2006 blasts at the Sankatmochan temple, officials in Andalusia in southern Spain have decided to help Varanasi, where three bomb blasts killed 11 persons on Friday, restore its glory.																								The Andalusian government will fund the project and Unesco, through its network of Indian Cities of Living Heritage, will provide technical support.																								Andalusia has always been interested in cross-cultural dialogue. Like Varanasi, it has a rich history and many influences, said a Unesco spokesperson. These two places have a lot in common. 																								The Andalusian government will also lend expertise on monuments and management and prepare a master plan for the restoration. 																								We have provided technical help to Morocco and Ecuador before, said Gaspar Zarrias, the vice-president of the regional government of Andalusia, who was in Delhi to sign the agreement. 																								The first step will be a heritage house in Varanasi, a popular concept in Europe and some Asian countries. It will become a cultural hub. It is not just a physical property, said a Unesco official. 																								Officials have narrowed down on a building on the ghats that is likely to be converted into a heritage house. 																								People who have old houses and dont know what to do with them will be able to take advice and expert help to restore them, Zarris said. 																								The Andalusian government will also help create an electronic database of buildings in Varanasi. 																								If Varanasi ever wants to pitch itself as a world heritage city, Andalusia has experts who can help. As they have done it before, they know how to draw up plans, said a Unesco official. 																								One of the cities to be revived under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Varanasi is also getting help from the French Rhone River Centre. 																								The centre is engaged in developing the social and cultural value of the Rhone and territories bordering it.

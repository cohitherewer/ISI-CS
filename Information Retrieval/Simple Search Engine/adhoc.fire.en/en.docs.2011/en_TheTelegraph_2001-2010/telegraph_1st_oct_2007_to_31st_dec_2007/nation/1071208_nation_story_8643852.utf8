				 Sohrab brother at SC door

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT
																								New Delhi, Dec. 7: Sohrabuddins brother Rubabuddin filed a fresh petition in the Supreme Court today, asking for a CBI probe into Narendra Modis role in the death of his brother in a fake encounter in 2005.
																								The petition said the chief ministers speech at an election rally on Monday, in which he almost justified Sohrabuddins killing, clearly showed that he was at the centre of the fake encounter. 
																								It would be appropriate that a fresh FIR be registered against him and an investigation be conducted by an impartial investigating agency, it added.
																								The petition will be heard on Monday.
																								Rubabuddin alleged that Modi had covertly instructed the government to make it appear as if it was trying to prosecute the case, while it should actually do everything possible to let the accused get away scot-free. 
																								He also sought a transfer of the investigation and the trial to some other state. 
																								Rubabuddin urged action against Modi for contempt of court. While the state had admitted to the fake encounter in the apex court, the chief minister shamelessly glorified his killing, he said.
																								New counsel
																								Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar is being considered as one of the probables to replace the states special counsel in the Supreme Court, K.T.S. Tulsi, who has threatened to resign if Modi does not apologise for his comments on Sohrabuddin.

				 Dumped Godhra MLA gives Modi a scare
 BASANT RAWAT			Patel after filing his nomination papers. (PTI)			Ahmedabad, Nov. 28: A seemingly confident Narendra Modi today filed his nomination for the December 16 poll battle amid rumours that a dumped key aide had decided to take him on in revenge.																								Minutes after he signed the papers from Maninagar, Ahmedabad, the troubled chief minister asked state home minister Amit Shah to find out whether sitting Godhra MLA Haresh Bhatt would really join the fight against him.																								Bhatt, however, said he was not contesting from anywhere but would work to defeat the ruling BJP.																								The MLA  recently caught on camera saying Modi had protected the men accused of violence against Muslims during the 2002 riots  said he would tour Gujarat to campaign for 60-odd candidates fielded by BJP rebel Uma Bhartis Bharatiya Janshakti Party.																								I was kept in the dark. Until this morning, I was told the central parliamentary board was considering my name even when the party had asked Prabhatsinh Chauhan to file nomination from Godhra, said Bhatt, who was handpicked by Modi to contest from Godhra in 2002.																								They just dumped me. They treated me as if I do not exist any more.																								The angry MLA, who has challenged his party to suspend him, said he had been dropped because the chief minister wanted to appease minority sentiment.																								State Bharatiya Janshakti Party chief Chaitanya Maharaj echoed him. Modi wants Taslima Nasreen to come to Gujarat but does not want Haresh Bhatt, who has been the face of the partys Hindu ideology, Maharaj said.																								Earlier in the day, Modi, accompanied by state BJP president Purshottam Rupala, filed his nomination papers from Maninagar, where he had won last time by a huge margin.	His Congress rival, junior Union petroleum minister Dinsha Patel, also filed papers for the December 16 battle.																								Dressed in a short orange kurta, the chief minister appeared confident.																								This election is different from those held earlier. Normally, it is the political parties or the media which set the agenda. However, in Gujarat, the agenda for the elections would be set by its 5.5 crore people and not by any political party or the media, he told reporters after filing his nomination.																								People of the state want development and I will ensure that Gujarat achieves the level of development seen in developed countries, the chief minister said.																								In 2002, not many people were acquainted with me or my work. But now the people have seen my work and have no doubts about me.																								While Modi described the election as a festival of democracy, his 70-year-old rival called it a dharamyudh, a fight between truth and falsehood.																								The Congress, which last won the seat in 1985, is hoping the strong Patel vote bank and the sizeable number of Muslims and Christians in Maninagar make a winning combination.

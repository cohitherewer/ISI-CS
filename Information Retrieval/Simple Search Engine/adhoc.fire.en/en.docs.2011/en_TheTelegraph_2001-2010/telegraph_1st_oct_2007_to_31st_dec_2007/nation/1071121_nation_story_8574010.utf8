				 Bully the Kid extorts Rs 80000
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jamshedpur, Nov. 20: A Class V boy of a Jamshedpur school has allegedly extorted about Rs 80,000 from a classmate over six months by threatening to beat him up.																								Prashant (name changed) was today taken into custody by police after the grandfather of Vivek (name changed) chased and caught him from the school and filed an FIR against him.																								Sahdev Singh, a resident of Jamshedpurs Kadma locality, has given a detailed break-up of the days and the amounts Prashant allegedly extorted from Vivek since May.																								The figure amounts to Rs 80,000, the FIR said.																								Sahdev told the police he suddenly found money vanishing from his almirah in the mornings. As no outsider was in the house at that time and the gates were still locked, he suspected an insider hand in the robbery.																								I asked my wife Sharda to keep watch on the almirah between 5am and 6am. Finally, last Thursday, she caught my grandson unlocking the almirah, he said.																								Pushed to a corner, Vivek confessed to his grandparents that he had been stealing money as and when Prashant  who was older to him having failed a year  asked him to.																								He claimed Prashant had first turned on him in May, beaten him up during the school lunch-break and snatched his pocket money.																								Initially, he asked for small amounts, Vivek claimed, always threatening him with dire consequences if he failed to cough up the money.																								Then, a day before Id in mid-October, he demanded Rs 12,000. If I did not give him the money, Prashant would thrash me. Some other boys in the school would join him, Vivek alleged, adding that he did not tell his parents for fear he would be beaten up more.																								Sahdev said he had been thinking since last Thursday what could be done to extricate his grandson from the mess. Today, he decided to go to the school with one of his sons and confront Prashant.																								We went to Viveks school and managed to catch Prashant after classes gave over. He tried to flee but we caught him after a chase and handed him over to the police, he said.																								Prashant, the son of a Bihar State Road Transport Corporation employee, has apparently admitted to the police that he took money from Vivek.																								He claimed he had taken Rs 5,000 from Vivek in a friendly gesture and had no ulterior motive. He did not play such games with other classmates, he said.																								I had asked Vivek to bring money because I became a bit greedy. But I have not taken as much money as they are saying I have, Prashant claimed.																								He said he had bought a bicycle with Viveks money and had planned to buy some electronic items, too.																								School authorities said they had been unaware such a thing was going on under their noses till the police brought it to their notice this afternoon.																								I have summoned the parents of both students and will question them, the principal said.																								B.B. Tirkey, the officer in charge of Bishtupur police station where the FIR was filed, said: I will take action if the allegations against Prashant are found to be true.

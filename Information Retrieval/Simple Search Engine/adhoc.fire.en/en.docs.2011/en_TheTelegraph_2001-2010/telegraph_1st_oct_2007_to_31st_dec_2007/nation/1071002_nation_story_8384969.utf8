				 Relief for CPM duo
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Achuthanandan																								Calcutta, Oct. 1: The CPM today reinstated to the politburo Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and state party chief Pinarayi Vijayan.																								Both were suspended from the politburo after severe infighting. The re-induction will help the party in case polls are called. It will also strengthen general secretary Prakash Karats position in the politburo. 																								The effective strength of the 17-member politburo had gone down following the death of Anil Biswas and Chittabrata Mazumdar, both from Bengal. The vacant slots for Bengal are not likely to be filled till the party congress in March.

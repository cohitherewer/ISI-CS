				 Usual suspects? Not with crude bombs  -  Glare falls on small groups
 BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA																								New Delhi, Nov. 23: Todays court blasts were carried out with crude home-made bombs suggesting the job may have been outsourced to a local Indian outfit, intelligence officials said.																								These hundreds of home-grown groups, many of them based in Uttar Pradesh, had become difficult to monitor and needed better surveillance at the police station level, they added.																								In Delhi, the Union home ministry said it was too early to blame any specific militant group.																								Intelligence sources said the explosive used was ammonium nitrate. These bombs can be made at home at Rs 500 each, a senior intelligence official said. Had plastic-based explosives like RDX been used, the casualties and damage would have been heavier.																								Ammonium nitrate, however, had been used in the August twin blasts in Hyderabad that killed 40-odd people and the Malegaon bombings of September 2006 in which 31 died.

In the past few blasts in the country, the explosives were made of easily available chemicals, a source said. 																								The militants use potassium permanganate or ammonium nitrate and mix it with sugar and coffee.																								Sources said militant groups in Pakistan and Bangladesh were now training small Indian outfits to make bombs and getting them to carry out strikes.																								This is one reason why so many cases remain unsolved. The local groups are too many  maybe hundreds  and we have little intelligence on them, an official said.																								Even if one accepted that the Jaish-e-Mohammed plotted todays attacks to avenge the assault of three of its members by lawyers in Lucknow, it must have delegated the job to a local outfit, he added.																								Groups like Jaish, Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami are using local groups to trigger blasts in a matter of days. This is cause for alarm.

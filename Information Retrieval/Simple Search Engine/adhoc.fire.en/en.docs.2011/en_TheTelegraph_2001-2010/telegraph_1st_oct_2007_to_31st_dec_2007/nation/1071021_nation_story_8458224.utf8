				 Pujas in tech city
 ANIL BUDUR LULLA																								Bangalore, Oct. 20: Debojit Nanda holds up an umbrella against the rain and struggles to balance platefuls of food with the other hand.																								Its amazing, he says. I never thought you could get such authentic phuchkas and katti rolls outside Calcutta.																								His wife Tanushree ismore excited about the pandals sprouting across Bangalore.																								We have been hopping from the Ulsoor pandal (the citys most well-known one) to Koramangala, J.P. Nagar, Jayamahal and even the new pandals at Kalyan Nagar, she said, her baby cradled in her arms.																								Twenty-odd pandals have come up here this Durga Puja  reflecting the rising number of Bengalis in tech town  and Calcutta street food has taken centre-stage. Stalls selling phuchkas and rolls line almost all the pandals.																								The growing popularity of Bengali cuisine, however, has been visible these past few months.																								Calcutta Victoria Chat, a snack-bar chain, has set up seven outlets in Bangalore in the past one year. Many restaurants that serve exclusively Bengali meals, snacks and sweets, too, have come up.																								Even a year ago, Bengali food meant only K.C. Das. Now there are full-fledged restaurants where we can get the choicest fish and a good traditional meal, said Abhimanyu Das, who has been living here for many years.

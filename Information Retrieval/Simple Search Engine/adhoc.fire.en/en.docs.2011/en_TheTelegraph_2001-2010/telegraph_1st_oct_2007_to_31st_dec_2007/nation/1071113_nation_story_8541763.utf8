				 Left hints at nuclear thaw
 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES				 	 Bardhan																								Nov. 12: The nuclear frost appeared to have thawed a little today after the CPI said the Left might allow the government to negotiate India-specific safeguards with atomic watchdog IAEA, vital for activating the deal with America.																								The hint from general secretary A.B. Bardhan, however, came with a rider: the Congress-led regime cannot initial the pact before sending it to the International Atomic Energy Agency.																								Bardhan said the UPA-Left panel, set up to look into the pacts contentious aspects, might be willing to consider such a proposal.																								It is not a question of my considering it, he told a television channel. I am again repeating it, its a question of being said in the committee which has been set up and the committee coming to the finding that yes, it can be allowed, provided they (the government) come back before initialling it, before sending it to the (IAEA) board of governors.																								CPM chief Prakash Karat also expressed hope that the standoff over the deal would be resolved soon.																								The government is not adamant. We asked them not to proceed further to operationalise the deal and they did not move ahead, he said in response to a question.																								The UPA-Left committee has discussed most of the issues and the remaining aspects would be sorted out soon.																								The panel, scheduled to meet on November 16, will meet on November 20 or 21, by when the debate on the deal in Parliament is expected to be over.																								In Moscow, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh kept hopes alive, saying efforts were on to evolve a broad-based consensus with the governments Left allies.																								Bardhan, who along with Karat held talks with Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi two days ago, made it clear the government should get back to the Left at a later stage. If the Left then said no, no, nothing doing, the government should stop, he added.																								Left sources maintained that the proposal was meant to give the government and the Congress a face-saver.																								Congress sources, however, saw it differently. They claimed that a green flag waved by the Left opened up just that window of opportunity the government wanted to pursue the next steps leading to the operationalisation of the deal.																								The sources conceded they were not sure how the exercise would end. But at least we can make the point that we have not abandoned the deal in vain, said a source.																								In Moscow, the Prime Minister said the deal was a subject matter of discussion with our coalition partners and the process of evolving a broad-based consensus was still on.																								Singhs comment, asked when India would approach the IAEA for negotiations on a safeguards agreement, came at a joint news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin after talks on several issues, including nuclear cooperation.

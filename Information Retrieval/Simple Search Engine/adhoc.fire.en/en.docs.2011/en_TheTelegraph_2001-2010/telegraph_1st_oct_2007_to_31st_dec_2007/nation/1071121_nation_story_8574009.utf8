				 47-million skill bank plan
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: The government plans to invest Rs 31,000 crore under the Eleventh Five Year Plan to make India a reservoir of skilled labour that ageing economies of the developed world can tap.																								From nursing and plumbing to chartered accountancy and web-based skills, the government hopes to train millions of Indians every year under a new National Skills Development Mission.																								In an increasingly connected world, where national borders are yielding to outsourcing, within a decade we can become a global reservoir of skilled person power, the draft of the 11th plan says.																								Finalised by the Planning Commission, the draft needs to be cleared by the National Development Council, which meets next month. 																								The mission comes as India prepares to meet the greatest ever surge in employment demands over the coming decades. 																								With 51 per cent of its population under the age of 25, India is expected to see an increase in its workforce every year at least till 2040, the Planning Commission says. 																								Experts have warned that the growth in the workforce  around 12.8 million a year  could be disastrous if India fails to meet the job demands.																								The draft says the ageing economy phenomenon globally will create a skilled manpower shortage of approximately 46 million by 2020. If we can take action on skill development, we could have a skilled manpower surplus of approximately 47 million. 																								The Centre plans to expand its skill development infrastructure by at least five times. Industrial training institutes and polytechnics will be opened under public-private partnerships, officials said. 																								The first beneficiary will be Indian industry. The CII and Ficci (say) they face a shortage of skilled persons. The mission will definitely benefit them, an official said.																								Industry will be obligated to invest in a National Skills Development Fund that will be used to develop skills among the socially backward. This will be industrys contribution to affirmative action, the draft says.																								Fifty thousand centres for web-based learning  college computer labs and cyber cafes  will be identified for a virtual skill development network under the mission.

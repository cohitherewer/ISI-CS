				 Arsenic scare for babies in womb
 G.S. MUDUR				 	 Drink danger																								New Delhi, Nov. 25: Foetuses whose mothers are drinking arsenic-laced water in Bengal and Bangladesh could be born with genetic changes that may lead to cancer later in life, a new study has indicated. 																								The study by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Chulabhorn Research Institute in Thailand provides the first evidence of genome-wide changes from pre-natal exposure to an environmental contaminant. 																								The findings, published in the journal Public Library of Science Genetics, suggest that even when water supplies are cleaned or when the children move to new areas where they are no longer exposed to arsenic, they may still suffer lasting damage. 																								The MIT-Thai team studied genes of babies born to 32 women in a province of Thailand where the average level of arsenic was 503 micrograms per litre of water, attributed to tin mining. But scientists believe the findings could have implications for other parts of the world  such as Bengal and Bangladesh  where arsenic levels are comparable, and even higher. 																								The scientists found 450 genes that had become significantly more active or less active in newborns who had been exposed to arsenic through their mothers, compared to the same genes in newborns who were not exposed. 																								The relation between arsenic exposure and genetic changes was so strong that a set of 11 genes could even be used as a genetic test to determine whether newborns were exposed to arsenic. 																								Although this is the first time the effect has been seen in humans, team members said it was not unexpected. In mice, when mothers are exposed to arsenic in drinking water, their progeny, in adult life, are much more cancer-prone, said Leona Samson, the director of MITs Centre for Environmental Health Sciences. 																								Medical researchers in Calcutta tracking the health effects of arsenic said they were not surprised by the findings. This has devastating implications for Bangladesh or Bengal, where in some areas the arsenic level is comparable, said Dipankar Chakraborti, the director of the school of environmental sciences at Jadavpur University. 																								There is other evidence of the in-utero effects of arsenic, said D.N. Guha Mazumder, former head of medicine at the Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Calcutta. 																								Guha Mazumder and his colleagues studied pregnancy outcomes in 21 villages in South 24-Parganas last year, and found a six-fold increase in the risk of stillbirths where arsenic levels in water were over 200 micrograms per litre. 																								Scientists do not know how long the changes in genes will last. We will be testing if these gene expression changes have persisted in these children, said Rebecca Fry, a research scientist at MIT and lead author of the study.

				 20 women end up as designer prey
				 	 Anand Jon: Indicted																								Los Angeles, Oct. 5 (AP): Celebrity fashion designer Anand Jon has been indicted on 59 counts of sexual assault on at least 20 women.																								Prosecutors said the move would keep the alleged victims from having to testify at a preliminary hearing.																								The prosecutors had earlier charged the Indian-origin Jon on over 40 felony and misdemeanour counts involving 18 victims. They included rape, sexual battery and committing a lewd act on a child.																								He had pleaded not guilty to these charges.																								The indictment unsealed yesterday by Los Angeles county superior court judge David Wesley added two victims and said the crimes targeted women aged between 15 and 27 from November 2002 to March 2007.																								Jon, 33, has dressed celebrities like Paris Hilton, Michelle Rodriguez and Norah Jones. He was also a designer on the TV show Americas Next Top Model in 2003 and was among 20 people profiled by Newsweek as an up-and-coming player.																								He is suspected of meeting women through the Internet and assaulting them when they would visit him for modelling opportunities.																								Jons defence has claimed some women made the allegations to seek fame. Lawyer Anthony Brooklier said some victims kept contact with the designer even after the alleged crimes.																								Jon was arrested on March 13 from his Beverly Hills apartment after a woman accused him of sexual assault. 																								Seven victims are from California and the rest from eight other US states and two foreign countries, according to the indictment.																								Jon was in court yesterday when the judge ordered him held without bail pending an October 25 hearing. The prosecutors had asked for bail to be set at $5.1 million.																								On July 30, a grand jury in Houston had charged Jon with sexual assaults on teenagers. Houston police have an open warrant for his arrest. Investigations are also under way in New York and Massachusetts.																								One of the reasons for seeking the indictment is that it speeds up the process and avoids a preliminary hearing, said Jane Robison, a spokesperson for the district attorneys office. The nature of the charges allows victims not to testify twice.																								Three arrest warrants have also been issued against Jon in Dallas, Texas, where authorities said they planned to seek indictment for sexual assault and extradite Jon after his California case concludes.																								If convicted on all counts, Jon could face life in prison.

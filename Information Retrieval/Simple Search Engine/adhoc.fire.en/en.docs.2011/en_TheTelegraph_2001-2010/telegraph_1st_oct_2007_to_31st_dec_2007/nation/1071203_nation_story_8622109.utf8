				 Railway pays for ticket muddle
																								New Delhi, Dec. 2 (PTI): The Delhi consumer commission fined Northern Railway Rs 25,000 for driving a woman out of a railway coach after allotting the same seat to two passengers five years ago.																								Noting that complainant Rani Sehgal was forced out of the coach despite having a confirmed ticket, the commission held Northern Railway guilty of the grossest kind of deficiency in service.																								Because of error on the part of the railways, two different tickets were allotted for the same seat which, on the face of it, is the grossest kind of deficiency in service and negligence, the panel said.																								Sehgal, a resident of Rana Pratap Bagh here, was injured in a scuffle with the ticket-checker. 																								She also lost her purse in the struggle, the commission noted while dismissing the railways argument that the damages were too high. 																								Air Deccan fined																								A consumer court in Srinagar has asked Air Deccan to pay a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to two passengers who had undergone mental and physical agony after the carrier refused to refund them following a flight cancellation.																								In their petition, Meraj-ud-din Sofi and Khursheed-ul Islam said that despite holding e-tickets, they failed to reach their destination after the airline cancelled its Jammu-Srinagar flight on March 12, stating the plane was not in a condition to fly.																								The court ruled that in the absence of terms and conditions on the e-tickets, Air Deccan had no right to deny refund and relief to the petitioners.

				 Airport cages Dunstan
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 15: Patience and charm have worked on Delhis Dunstan after guns and bullies failed.																								The monkey that had been leading airport staff a merry dance for a month was successfully baited last night, with food placed temptingly in a shining silver cage.																								The simian had sneaked in last month through a hole in the ceiling during construction at the international departure lounge. Since then it had been scampering around overhead, in the space between the ceiling and the roof, resisting every effort by wildlife rescuers to trap it.																								We kept laying out food for the monkey in the trap without loading it, said an official from Wildlife SOS, an animal rescue organisation brought in to help catch the animal. The idea was to accustom him to getting food easily from the cage.																								The officials painted the cage silver so it would blend with the X-ray machines and other equipment the monkey must have got used to. He got overconfident and was trapped last night, the official said.																								His relief was understandable. Rescuers had brought in stun guns but the monkey would disappear through its hole so quickly they never got a chance to aim and shoot. He was using the air-conditioning ducts very effectively, the official said.																								A langur was brought in for 48 hours and posted on the roof at the other mouth of the hole, but he failed to scare off his quarry.																								The monkey will be kept under observation for 24 hours. He has been vaccinated and we will set him free soon, a Wildlife SOS official said.																								Delhi airport, however, has a lot more wildlife to contend with and has already got Wildlife SOS to prepare a report on animals found around the premises.																								Airport authorities have taken steps to reduce the bird population, the biggest animal threat to passenger safety.

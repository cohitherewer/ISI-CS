				 Buddha behind Modi in city race 
 MANDIRA NAYAR																								New Delhi, Dec. 2: Narendra Modis Gujarat is far ahead of most other states, including Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal, as far as utilising and applying for funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission goes.																								Two years after the scheme was launched in 63 cities, over 1,100 projects worth Rs 43,000 crore have been sanctioned. 																								Of these, 254 fall under infrastructure and governance, 340 under infrastructure development for small and medium towns and 206 for basic services to the urban poor.																								While Bengal has been sanctioned only 18 projects under urban infrastructure and governance, Gujarat has applied and got the nod for 44. Maharashtra has been given the go-ahead for 47, Andhra Pradesh 33 and Tamil Nadu 23.																								Gujarat, along with Maharashtra and Andhra, has one of the best records in utilising funds under the mission, which seeks to improve water supply, sewage systems and transport and bring transparency in government. The urban renewal mission is a great opportunity to fill in the gaps states may have within the system, said secretary, urban development, M. Ramachandran.																								Monitored by the urban development ministry, the mission  envisaged as a Rs 1 lakh-crore project  allows states to receive up to Rs 50,000 crore from the Centre. The rest has to be provided by the state, Ramachandran said.																								Apart from Bengal, the other laggards are Jharkhand, Goa and Pondicherry. The Northeast and Uttarakhand have also been slow in applying for projects.																								Ahmedabad has got funds for a mass rapid transport system, improved water supply, roads and storm-water drains. 																								Calcutta, however, has not utilised funds for sewage, storm-water drains and solid waste management. The only funds used are for water supply.																								So far, nine sanctioned projects have been completed, six of them in Gujarat.

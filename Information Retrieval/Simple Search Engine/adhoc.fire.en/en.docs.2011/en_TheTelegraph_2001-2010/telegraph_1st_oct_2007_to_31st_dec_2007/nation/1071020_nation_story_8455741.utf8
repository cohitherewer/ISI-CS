				 BJP questions PM balance
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Manmohan Singh																								New Delhi, Oct. 19: The BJP today questioned the Prime Ministers sense of balance, political acumen, conviction and achievements and asserted that he cannot regain lost legitimacy by diverting peoples attention. 																								Manmohan Singh had yesterday raised questions about the Gujarat riots, the Agra Summit and the Kargil war while turning down the Opposition partys demand that he step down over the nuclear deal.																								In a harsh statement issued by spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad, the BJP said: Let us accept one stark fact. Dr Manmohan Singh, who began as a teacher and then as a civil servant, is a late entrant in politics. In fact, his entry into politics itself was more by accident than by design as was his elevation to the office of Prim Minister. Conviction and commitment have never been the characteristics of his politics, which is marked more by convenience, a reality which frequently manifests itself in his career profile. 																								Responding to what it described as outrageous remarks by Singh, the BJP said: It shows how rattled he is by his own abysmal failure to look primeministerial on an issue, which until last week, he made the point of utmost prestige for his government. In fact, it clearly exemplifies the image of a much weakened Prime Minister hitting all around because of his failures in politics and governance.																								The party also attacked the Singhs track record on reforms. He claims to be the pioneer of economic reform, which, too, has become a complete casualty since he has become Prime Minister. He had staked his personal reputation on the Indo-US nuclear deal for the last two years, but had no difficulty in taking an astounding U-turn.																								Ironically, the BJP itself had changed its stand on the deal after privately supporting it initially.																								On the Agra Summit, the BJP said the Vajpayee governments uncompromising stand on cross-border terrorism and refusal to agree to Pervez Musharrafs description of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Kashmir as freedom struggle was responsible for non-issuance of a joint statement. In a single stroke of supreme diplomatic blunder, Singh completely frittered away these initiatives by describing Pakistan as a victim of terrorism, the statement said.																								By describing the summit as a fiasco, the Prime Minister has shown he has lost his sense of balance, Prasad said.																								The Congress later paid the BJP back in the same coin, asking it to advise spokespersons to maintain their balance. 																								The Prime Minister represents every citizen of the country, and any responsible person should think twice before using such language, Congress general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi said.																								The Congress has demanded an apology from the BJP.

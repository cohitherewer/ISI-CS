				 Recovery notice to car financier
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 31: The Supreme Court has issued notices to Citicorp Maruti Finance Limited, asking it to explain charges of forcibly taking possession of a car for alleged default on a loan instalment. 																								Recovery agents of the company  a Citibank and Maruti Udyog Limited joint venture that finances new and second-hand cars  had in 2003 taken forcible possession of the vehicle from Delhi resident S. Vijaylakshmi while she was taking her son to school.																								Her outstanding loan amount was only Rs 2,000. The woman has since passed away.																								We are also pained to observe that police did not register an FIR although they were approached for it, a bench of Justices P.P. Naolekar and Altamas Kabir said. 																								The bench also wanted to know why it should not step in and issue directives regarding the manner in which loan recovery by financial institutions needs to be regulated and regularised, especially when it was being done forcibly in defiance of earlier court orders. 																								The court has on several occasions held that forcible recovery of loans was illegal. But financial companies have been flouting the law, Vijaylakshmis counsel Vishnu Sharma said. 																								Almost all banks and financial institutions have codes of conduct for recovery of loans but they are never implemented, he added. 																								He alleged that at least 17 people have so far died after being harassed for loan instalments across the country  some were beaten up by recovery agents and others committed suicide. 																								Vijaylakshmi had appealed to the district consumer forum and the National Consumer Commission, and Citicorp had lost the case in both.																								The commission had even struck down the entire lease and hire agreement of the company as illegal, Sharma said.																								Citicorp moved the apex court against that order on Friday.

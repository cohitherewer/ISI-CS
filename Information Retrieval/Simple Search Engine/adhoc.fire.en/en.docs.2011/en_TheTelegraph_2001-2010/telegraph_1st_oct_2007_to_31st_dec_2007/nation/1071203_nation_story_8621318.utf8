				 Cong poll promise
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Dec. 2: The Congress today broke its poll-season silence on the 2002 riots, promising in its manifesto to bring Narendra Modi and his tainted ministers before the Nanavati- Shah Commission.																								Gujarat Congress chief Bharat Solanki said his party would ensure the riots probe panel cross-examines the chief minister. We will also ensure that the riot victims get justice and the Minority Nigam, defunct during the BJP regime, is revived.																								Neither Modi nor his former home minister Gordhan Zadaphia, accused of inciting the rioters, have deposed before the panel. 																								The Jan Sangharsh Manch, a rights group representing the victims, has urged the commission to summon the two, saying there was sufficient evidence on their involvement in the carnage.																								Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh cited the recent sting operation carried out by Tehelka to argue that the mayhem showed there was Hindu terrorism. Modi wants us to believe that there is only Muslim terrorism. We believe that there is Hindu terrorism as well. The sting operation has brought out this point very well.																								But Digvijays views were not shared by some in his own party. B.K. Hariprasad, the Congress general secretary in charge of Gujarat, made it clear he did not agree with Digvijays assessment. Digvijay Singh is our senior leader but I dont agree with him. His comment equating Hindu terror with Islamic terrorism is likely to provide ammunition to Modi, Hariprasad said.																								The Congress has steered clear of mentioning the riots in the campaign for fear of polarising voters and benefiting Modi. Even today, while its 29-page manifesto promised to bring the riots accused before the panel, it did not make any reference to the Godhra train fire.																								Among other promises, the party said complete prohibition would be enforced and the relaxation granted to special economic zones in this policy would be withdrawn.																								Fourteen hours of power for irrigation and withdrawal of criminal cases against farmers accused of stealing electricity were among the other key pledges.																								Job reservations for women and the creation of womens police and home-guards force have also been promised.																								The manifesto also speaks of yellow cards for 20 per cent of the poorest, which will enable them to get 25kg wheat, 10kg rice and 15 litres free every month. This scheme will be launched within three months of coming to power.

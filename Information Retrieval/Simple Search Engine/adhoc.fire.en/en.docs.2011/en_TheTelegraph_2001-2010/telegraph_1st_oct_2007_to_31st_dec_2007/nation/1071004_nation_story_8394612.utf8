				 Revealed: Fashion kings Gandhi secret
 AMIT ROY 			Tom Tar Singh		London, Oct. 3: In true Gandhian style, UK fashion king Tom Tar Singh, 58, was maintaining a day of silence today about why he had bought a bunch of the Mahatmas letters and other hand-written manuscripts from Sothebys in July for 45,600 and gifted them to the Indian nation. 																								Nor is the reclusive Singh likely to break his vow of silence any time soon. 																								He does not give press interviews and he is not going to do so now, his adviser and spokesperson, Simon Bloomfield, told The Telegraph, adding to the air of mystery surrounding one of Britains most successful entrepreneurs in the world of ladies fashion. 																								In July when it was reported that the Gandhi papers at Sothebys had been saved for the nation, shortly after another set of Gandhi memorabilia was withdrawn from auction at Christies, Singhs identity was kept secret at his request. 																								Its an NRI businessman, was all an India House spokesperson would say at the time. 																								A check of all the usual suspects, including Sir Gulam Noon and Nat Puri who have bought Gandhi papers on behalf of India in the past, drew blanks. 																								But yesterday on the occasion of the Mahatmas 138th birth anniversary, India House revealed what had been a well-kept secret  the buyer was an unlikely figure: Mr Tom Tar Singh OBE, a distinguished entrepreneur of Indian origin residing in the United Kingdom. 																								These manuscripts, dating from the 1920s to the 1940s and acquired earlier this year at a public auction conducted at Sothebys in London, include a draft with revisions of a series of articles for Young India discussing a range of political and cultural subjects, said an announcement from India House.																								Also included is hand-written correspondence between Gandhi and others including Badrul Hasan (about Gandhis campaigns) and Jafar Hasan (about the Urdu and Hindi languages). 																								There was an explanation for the purchase though it is possible that India House had drawn Singhs attention to the auction: The ideals and values of Mahatma Gandhi have inspired generations of Indians including Mr Singhs grandfather, Shri Pakhar Singh, in whose memory Mr Singh has donated the manuscripts. 																								Through India House, Singh himself issued a statement: My grandfather lived his life following Gandhis principles of non-violence, truth and justice. He believed in a community based on fair play and self-sustainability. These principles have been an inspiration to me and I believe there is scope to apply them more widely in modern India. 																								Singh is expected to be present when the official handover ceremony takes place in India later this year, probably at Rashtrapati Bhavan. 																								Despite his low profile and modest ways, something is known about Singh and his family. For example, his youngest brother, Simon Singh, 43, is a brilliant physicist and author who is more than happy to talk at any time of day or night  but about the Big Bang and the origin of the universe on which he has written extensively and also lectured in India. 																								Singh himself, who is today worth hundreds of millions of pounds, founded and built up a fashion company called New Look which he has now sold though he remains a significant shareholder and non-executive director. 																								With the help of Bloomfield, The Telegraph is able to build up a quaint and endearing portrait of Singhs grandfather, Pakhar Singh, who arrived in England in 1932 and made his way to Somerset which was then even more of an Indian-free zone. But he knew of another Indian there. 																								Wearing a turban, Pakhar got on his bike, with a small case in front and another at the back, and cut an intriguing figure as he pedalled from village to village selling his wares. In time he must have returned to India but Tom, who was born in Thakarki in 1949, arrived in Somerset with his father the following year. And it was in Somerset that the family put down roots. 																								The young Tom helped his father who ran a market stall. While Simon went to public school and Cambridge, Tom went to the University of Wales, Aberystwyth where he studied international politics and geography before starting his own business with a 5,000 loan from his parents. 																								The rest is history, said Bloomfield, thus compressing a tale which took Singh to the heights of the British fashion industry with his company valued at the time of the sale at 700 million. 																								In 1982 he merged his stores with those of his parents to form New Look Retailers, a group of around 20 stores. He turned it into a chain of 25 shops by 1986. By 1996 New Look was such a success that Singh collected 170 million when he sold a 75 per cent stake in his company to the City. It was successfully floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1998. By 2000, the company was trading from over 500 stores with a turnover of 418 million. 																								Singh took it private again in 2004 through a takeover bid backed by private equity houses Apax and Permira. 																								Last year, Singh was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) by the Queen for services to the fashion industry. Unlike other Indian millionaires in Britain, he has not been one to flaunt his dizzy rise and rise, preferring to keep his silence, at least where the media are concerned. 																								Now that he has made more money than he can ever spend, Singh, possibly like his grandfather before him, appears suddenly to be experiencing the call of Mother India. 																								He is thinking in terms of sustainable projects in India, disclosed Bloomfield.

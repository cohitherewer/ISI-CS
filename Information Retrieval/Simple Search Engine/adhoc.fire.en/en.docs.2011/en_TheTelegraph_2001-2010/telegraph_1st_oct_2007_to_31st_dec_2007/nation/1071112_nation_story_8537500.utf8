				 Delhi eye on Nandigram and N-deal  - Singh calls Buddha
 JYOTI MALHOTRA				 	 CRPF personnel on way to Nandigram from Howrah. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Moscow, Nov. 11: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is taking direct interest in the situation in Nandigram and the Centre has sent a senior officer to monitor events unfolding in the Bengal district.																								National security adviser M.K. Narayanan, speaking to journalists on board the Prime Ministers special flight to Moscow this afternoon, said the situation in the violence-racked region was very dicey.																								Far too sensitive not an easy situation, he repeated, to underscore the gravity of events unfolding there. Delhi is concerned, Calcutta is very concerned, he added.																								Narayanan said Singh was in regular touch with home minister Shivraj Patil who, in turn, has spoken to the Bengal government more than once.																								Late tonight, a spokesman for the Prime Ministers Office said Singh has spoken to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								The Prime Minister is monitoring the situation and has also spoken to the chief minister of West Bengal, the spokesman added.																								Narayanan wouldnt comment on the actions of the Bhattacharjee government or on governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis criticism of CPM party cadres in Nandigram. Instead, he tried to strike a middle path, saying the Centre believed that people should be allowed to return to their homes in Nandigram and that more lives should not be lost.																								Narayanan said Maoists could have taken advantage of the fragile situation and that the violence in one small area could be attributed to them. He added that a senior officer has been sent to Nandigram to report back, which will help the Centre decide what steps to take next.																								Although Narayanan denied any link, it is beginning to seem that the CPMs embarrassment over Nandigram could come in handy when the government seeks the Lefts permission to allow the Indo-US nuclear deal to go to the IAEA.																								This is where yesterdays lunch meeting between Singh and the Left parties acquires significance. Not only did both sides discuss the deal and the hope that there will be a debate in Parliament, the government leaders reiterated their plea that the Left allow it to take the next step by taking the pact to the nuclear watchdog.																								The government hopes to create a national consensus on foreign policy during the debate. Sources said while foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee was talking to the Left, Narayanan and atomic energy commission chief Anil Kakodkar had met the BJP leadership last week.																								They said Mukherjee has already told the Left parties that if they let the government complete the process, that is take the next steps on the deal, the government would sign the 123 Agreement at the very end if the Left parties approve of it then.																								The sources said this was a huge negotiating concession on its part and hoped that once the IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group cleared the deal, the Left would come round and see that it did not mean a pact only with America.																								Narayanan said he and Kakodkar had met BJP leaders L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh to clear their concerns on the independence of Indias strategic programme. 																								He said the BJP leaders seemed satisfied, but admitted that their basic problem was more political.

				 BBC job cut in Britain, party in India 
 AMIT ROY 																								London, Oct. 11: The BBC management in London has shrugged off criticism that it has hosted a lavish reception in India for visiting director-general Mark Thompson while he is finalising plans to sack up to 2,800 staff back in Britain. 																								Thompson is the first director-general to visit India where the BBCs three arms  BBC World Service radio, BBC World television and its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, which is in the business of selling programmes and DVDs  are intensifying and widening their operations. 																								Yesterday, BBC Worldwide formally opened its Mumbai headquarters, after which a dinner was hosted for the citys cultural, political and business leaders by John Smith, chief executive of BBC Worldwide, with Thompson as chief guest. 																								Back in Britain, though, there has been some carping at the cost of the festivities which has been put at 12,000. 																								But a BBC insider told The Telegraph: India is increasingly important to the BBC. 																								The BBC has changed in one sense probably in an attempt to appear less elitist: once upon a time only people who sounded like Mark Tully would be allowed near the microphone. Today, a variety of Indian (and Pakistani) voices proliferate from the region, some barely decipherable, with anyone who sounds like Tully almost encouraged to keep away from the microphone. 																								Thompson, who has gone to India with three fellow executives, will give details next week of the job cuts which he says are needed to bring down costs. Morale is said to be low among some staff who fear the worst though in India the BBC hopes to make money in the years to come. 																								A BBC spokesperson said: This trip was arranged six months ago. The director-general visits different countries in the course of a year, and India is a very important and growing market for the BBCs international activities. 																								She confirmed: It does happen to be the first time a BBC director-general has visited India. As well as meeting BBC staff, he will be meeting cultural and political figures  because he is editor-in-chief and likes to keep himself well informed about the countries that the BBC reports on. In addition, the BBC has outsourced some of its finance functions to India, and so Mark will be visiting some of the operations there.																								The BBCs raft of television programmes to mark 60 years of Independence has had a mixed reception from Indian viewers in the UK. 																								Those who are British born were moderately amused by the attempts of Asian celebrities, such as the comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar, to give their personalised takes on India. Others were irritated by his lack of knowledge and considered this to be more a case of the blind leading the ignorant. 																								However, a documentary series on the Ganga has been widely praised. 																								A statement from BBC Worldwide said its Indian production office will be headed up by Saul Nass, who will be responsible for bringing the enormous production expertise of the BBC to the Indian market, working with local talent throughout India to produce and deliver world class television. 																								The Indian office, which will trade as BBC Worldwide Productions India, is BBC Worldwides third local production base.																								It will complement BBC Worldwides successful Los Angeles production studio  which currently works with all the major US networks and is responsible for producing the record-breaking Dancing with the Stars on ABC  and its production company in Australia, a joint venture with Freehand, the statement went on.

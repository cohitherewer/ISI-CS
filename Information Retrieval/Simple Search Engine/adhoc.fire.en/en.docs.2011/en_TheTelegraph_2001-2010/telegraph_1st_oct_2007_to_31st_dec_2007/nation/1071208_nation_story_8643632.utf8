				 School offers molest bribe

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA
																								Hyderabad, Dec. 7: A six-year-old girl was violently molested by her schoolbus attendant here yesterday, after which the private school allegedly tried to buy her parents silence with money.
																								The Class I students mother then appeared on local TV and, in a flash of anger, said the bus hand and the school management deserved to be stoned as in the middle ages.
																								Within hours, the Telengana Rashtra Samitis student wing had stormed the school, smashed furniture and sent frightened students and teachers running before police quelled the violence. The school was closed today.
																								The mother, a bank official, said the 18-year-old bus attendant, K. Saidulu, had touched her daughter 10 days ago and that she had complained to the school. But they had done nothing.
																								Yesterday, after her daughter complained of pain, she found scratch marks and other injuries on the childs groin.
																								The furious parents  the father is an official at the state secretariat  approached a lawyer instead of directly going to the police in order to protect their identity.
																								We brought this atrocity to the notice of the school management on Thursday itself, said the lawyer, G. Vishnuvardhan Reddy. But two management representatives came to us offering to remove Saidulu from service and pay us compensation.
																								The school has been operating for just two years and has yet to be recognised by the state government.
																								The mother said the hush money offered was Rs 20,000  the same as the donation the parents had paid to get the child admitted. Is this an issue that can be resolved with compensation?
																								She said she was so angry that she rushed to a TV channel, which blurred her face and didnt reveal her name.
																								Saidulu, arrested this evening, is charged with using criminal force to outrage a womans modesty; insulting a womans modesty by word, gesture, etc.; and cheating. 
																								A case of negligence has been registered against the school management but no one has been arrested.

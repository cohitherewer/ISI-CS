				 Lover kills models mom
 OUR BUREAU																								Nov. 23: The jilted boyfriend of an aspiring Calcutta model barged into her Andheri flat last night possibly to kill her, but shot dead her mother and maternal uncle as she was not in.																								Avinash Bhupen Patnaik, from Angul district in Orissa, later shot himself in the head after a male friend of his former girlfriend, Moon Das, locked him up on their return to the ninth-floor flat.																								The 23-year-old model had met Avinash, 22, during a ramp show in Orissa on New Years Eve last December. They are believed to have had an affair till Moon broke up with him in August.																								Moon was aghast when she entered her Yamunanagar flat around 10.10pm and found Avinash standing in a pool of blood near the bodies of her mother, Kannan, and uncle, Vikas Chandra Sarkar. Kannan had come to Mumbai for an operation.																								Her friend managed to lock up Avinash before the duo set out to inform police. When the cops came, they found that Avinash had shot himself with a country-made revolver.																								An officer of Oshiwara police station, where a case has been registered, said Moon had providentially escaped Avinashs murderous rage.																								Avinash was armed with a country-made pistol and had gone with the intention of killing Moon. On not finding her, he shot her mother and uncle, he said.																								Minati Patnaik, Avinashs aunt, refused to accept that he could do such a thing. Its a conspiracy against the boy, she said in Angul.																								His parents have left for Mumbai and apparently know nothing about Moon. Avinash owned a rice mill in Orissa and would go to Mumbai on business.																								This is the third incident this year of a spurned lover trying to kill a former girlfriend. All three males have been from educated middle-class families.																								In May, Manish Thakur, a married naval officer, had shot his girlfriend, Koushambi Layek, from point-blank range for breaking up with him on her parents advice.																								In June, Sushma Nikams boyfriend Prashant Pawar stabbed her 22 times in the face and neck after an argument in her office. He then stabbed himself and fled.																								Experts said men between 22 and 35 years generally resorted to such extreme measures when they were ditched. Many used harassment tactics like threat calls and assault, but most of these went unreported, they said.																								Psychiatrists said youngsters these days were more impatient, self-centred and impulsive, and unable to handle rejection. Once they were jilted, they felt angry and ashamed and turned hostile.																								If a person is in love, he wants to get the girl at all costs. Rejection means failure. Failure generates anger that makes them ready to kill, Dr Ajit Dandekar said.																								He said the definition of love had changed over the years. 																								Its all about instant gratification. This generation hasnt heard no from their families  they arent exposed to rejection, so they cant handle it. The classical idea of love, of finding glory in sacrifice, no longer exists.

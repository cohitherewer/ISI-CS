																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 21: Three early morning loots on Utkal University premises triggered angry protests by students, who locked up the universitys main gates for more than three hours demanding immediate action. 
																								Two men intercepted Braja Swain, a sixth-year economics student, while he was on his way to tuition classes around 6am. The two searched his pockets and fled with his watch and Rs 50 he had in his wallet, but before that they injured Swain with a bhujali (knife). 
																								A little later, a milk vendor was attacked in a similar fashion and Rs 1,000 was snatched from him. This time, too, the the men attacked the man with a bhujali. Similarly, another commuter walking through the campus was attacked and his money was snatched from him. 
																								While the injured were taken to the hospital, students went on a rampage locking the main gates and barring everyone from entering the campus. They also burnt tyres and blocked the roads. 
																								They alleged that such cases were on a rise and they gave several examples to prove their allegation before the authorities. Students, while talking to the authorities, blamed men and boys residing at the nearby Patharbandha slum and sought the immediate removal of the illegal encroachment from the campus area. This particular slum contains 150-odd families. 
																								We demand that our boundary wall be made stronger and stricter security, including an alert police outpost, in the campus. The present personnel are hopeless their presence makes no difference, said Manoj Biswal, a student leader. 
																								Three back-to-back incidents of crime in less than two hours is just too much. We have aired our grievances before the university authorities and will wait to see if they fulfil their commitments. Otherwise, we would be forced to act, said one of the union leaders. 
																								In the afternoon, the students had a meeting with the post-graduate teaching council chairman, P.K. Sahoo. The vice-chancellor is out of station. Once he is back, we will discuss and sort out the matter, said Sahoo. 
																								A formal complaint has been lodged at Saheed Nagar police station. The investigation is on. However, no one has been arrested so far. The situation at is under control now, said Jugal Kishor Das, the Sahidnagar inspector.

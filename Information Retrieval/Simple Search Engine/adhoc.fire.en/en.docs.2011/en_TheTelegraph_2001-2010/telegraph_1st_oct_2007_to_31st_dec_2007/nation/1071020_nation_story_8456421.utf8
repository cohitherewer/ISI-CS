 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																John scores in IIT fan rush				 																																																										Pushed to choose, many would find it hard to pick one of the two  play football with John Abraham or express solidarity with victims of human rights abuse with Nandita Das.				 																																																										A 10-metre-wide road on the IIT Delhi campus recently became the focus of this debate, with students at the institutes annual festival effectively forced to make the choice.				 																																																										On one side of the road blared loud music amid the relentless chatter of a popular video jockey exhorting students to participate in a series of games he had concocted to win a chance to play football with the Bollywood hunk.				 																																																										Just across the road, though, activists of Amnesty International busily put up posters, handed out leaflets and prepared puppets, as they waited for Nandita, who was late by over an hour.				 																																																										When the dusky beauty did arrive, her presence, and the wit of the puppets, helped draw some attention to the cause. But if the number of onlookers is a measure of popularity, John had literally stolen a march over Nandita. 				 																Slim wear for dandiya belles				 																																																										Dances this Navratri will give Mumbaikars a shape of things to come.				 																																																										City belles have a special reason to smile. As they prepare to set the dandiya floors on fire in their cholis, they can look forward to innerwear that will make them look slimmer.				 																																																										Some boutiques have been retailing the wonder wear, appropriately called Miraclesuit Shapewear. The big names behind it claim the clothes flatten tummy and waist, perk up the bottom and tone thighs. The effect is to make a person look at least 4kg lighter.				 																																																										The contemporary corsets from Boudoir London, one of the makers, are priced between Rs 1,600 and Rs 3,000. With Mumbai dieticians charging Rs 1,000 to help you lose a kg, the Miraclesuit appears a better fit for the purse, too.				 																In the name of the lord				 																																																										The tussle over the Sethusamudram project has brought out names of Ram not many were familiar with, some of them coined by Muslim spiritual figures. 				 																																																										One of those doing the rounds is Imam-e-Hind, which was penned and eventually made popular by Sufi poet Iqbal. 				 																																																										The titles have suddenly made their way into the raging debate on the project off Rameshwaram.				 																																																										Subramanian Swamy made it a point to mention Imam-e-Hind in the Supreme Court affidavit hed filed to prevent the government from starting dredging in the Adams Bridge area  the part of the sea where the chain of islets believed to be built by Rams army is located.				 																																																										Swamy also thanked some Hurriyat leaders who have spoken in favour of the movement to protect the setu. He plans to go to Kashmir to express his gratitude.				 																																																										The campaign has won Swamy plaudits from the shankaracharya of Kanchi mutt, Jayendra Saraswati, who honoured him for his historic contribution.				 																Light-up gift				 																																																										Elections are year away but Delhiites have a pre-poll gift that promises to light up their lives.				 																																																										The government has slashed tariffs by Re 1 for domestic consumers using up to 150 units of power in a month. 				 																																																										The cut will cost the exchequer Rs 110 crore but will make this years Diwali special.				 																																																										A new slab of 0-150 units will be created and the regulatory commission that approves tariffs will be asked to clear the move as soon as possible.				 																																																	Delhi: Relive one of medieval Indias most poignant phases, when Dara Shikoh, the peace-loving eldest son of Shah Jahan, was betrayed by brother Aurangzeb in his lust for the Mughal throne. Directed by theatre legend M.S. Sathyu, Dara Shikoh starts at 7pm this Sunday at the India Habitat Centre.

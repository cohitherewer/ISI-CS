				 CPM fires Iran gun at nuke deal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Yechury: Renewed attack																								New Delhi, Dec. 3: The CPM today renewed its aggression a day before the Rajya Sabha debates the nuclear deal, accusing the Centre of a foreign policy shift and blaming this on the larger agenda of the 123 Agreement.																								The policy shift had begun showing in Delhis ties with Tehran, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said, referring to the Centres decision to skip a scheduled meeting with Iran and Pakistan on the gas pipeline project.																								(The) day-to-day developments reconfirm our fears that the US wants to convert India into its subordinate ally in South Asia even before the Indo-US nuclear deal has come into effect. This is a very ominous development, the Rajya Sabha MP told reporters.																								The attack coincides with the start of a two-day CPM politburo meeting to discuss a draft political resolution, the 123 Agreement and the fallout of the Nandigram and Taslima Nasreen controversies.																								Yechury said that in the Rajya Sabha tomorrow, the Centre would have to answer several serious questions about kow-towing to the US.																								The Lok Sabha debate had gone the Centres way with the Left holding its fire, the Samajwadi Party offering qualified backing, the Telugu Desam abstaining, ally DMK offering full support and the Opposition Biju Janata Dal divided.																								Like the nuclear deal, the gas from Iran is very important for managing Indias energy security, Yechury said.																								Not going for the gas pipeline project or delaying it is not in Indias interest. It shows India has started succumbing to US pressures.																								The MP alleged that the State Bank of India had suddenly prohibited extending its line of credit to Iranian firms, hitting Indian exports to that country. 																								India has to comply with any sanction imposed by the United Nations. But there is no legal requirement for it to comply with unilateral US sanctions, Yechury said.																								The CPM leader re-affirmed the Lefts position that the 123 Agreement was firmly anchored in the Hyde Act, which provides for a halt to US cooperation if India conducts a nuclear test. He said the deal had fallen short not just of our objections but of the assurances of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself.																								The fresh attack comes shortly after the CPM had made a concession on the nuclear deal, allowing the government to start talks with atomic energy watchdog IAEA for India-specific safeguards.																								The CPM leader claimed that US pressure was working on Indian companies as well. He said the Essar Groups plans for joint-venture refinery in Iran were shelved after its partner firm in the US was arm-twisted into asking the parent company to call off the deal.																								The deal is a lot more than only nuclear cooperation. It has a larger agenda to convert India into a subordinate ally of the US in South Asia, Yechury said.

				 Housing hope for road
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Alex Hayim, Reit India director																								Calcutta, Nov. 2: The developers of Calcuttas largest housing project with foreign investment have offered to invest in improving a key arterial road running through the area.																								Eden Group, promoted by the UKs Reit Asset Management and NRI Bengali entrepreneur Indrajit De, has voiced interest in a plan to widen the stretch of the Budge Budge Trunk Road between Brace Bridge flyover and Maheshtala.																								If the government provides us land, we will widen the road at our own cost, managing director Sachchidananda Rai said after launching the project. The complex will have 2,188 flats, to be built over 22 acres.																								Two large townships, Eden City and Calcutta Riverside, coming up in the area could put a lot of pressure on the single-lane road from Brace Bridge to Budge Budge. Rai claimed that the developer of Calcutta Riverside had also agreed to improve the road. If land acquisition is a problem, we can build a flyover. But this has to be built on a build-operate-transfer basis, Rai said. Widening the road to four lanes will cost around Rs 100 crore. The flyover will require Rs 300 crore.																								There is also a proposal to build a Rs 600-crore mono-rail link, and Rai said Eden was willing to contribute to the plan. 																								One of the three options should work out. We are in talks with the state government, he added.																								Eden plans to build a larger project, over 50 acres, adjacent to the one launched today, in alliance with Maheshtala municipality. 																								Eden also plans to work with the Asansol-Durgapur municipality to build an IT SEZ in the steel town.

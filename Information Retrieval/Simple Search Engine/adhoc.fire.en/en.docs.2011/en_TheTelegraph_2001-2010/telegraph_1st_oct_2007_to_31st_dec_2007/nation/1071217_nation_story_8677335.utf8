				 Child held for fees

																								Kanpur, Dec. 16 (PTI): A six-year-old girl, who stays in the hostel of a private school, was allegedly barred from going home for the winter vacations because her parents had not paid her fees in full.
																								Nirmal, the father of Class I student Alisha, claimed the school had initially not allowed him to take his daughter home as he had paid only Rs 1,480 of her total fees of Rs 2,480.
																								Nirmal, who works as a driver, said his daughter was also made to sit in school for four hours after classes gave over.
																								She was later allowed to go home after her father assured the school authorities that he would deposit the remaining amount after the vacations.
																								The school authorities have refused comment. District magistrate Alok Kumar said the matter was being investigated.

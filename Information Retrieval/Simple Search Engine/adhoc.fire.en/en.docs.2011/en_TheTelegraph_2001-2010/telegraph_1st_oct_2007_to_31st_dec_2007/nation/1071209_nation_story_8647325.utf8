				 Threat to Indians

																								Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 8 (PTI): Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has warned the countrys ethnic Indians that they could be held under the Internal Security Act (ISA) if their actions threatened national interest and asked police to monitor their movements. 
																								Abdullahs warning came following allegations by authorities that members of the Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) have links with terrorist groups, including the LTTE. Hindraf is spearheading the anti-government agitation against the alleged marginalisation of ethnic Indians.
																								My instructions to the police are that the group should be monitored. ISA is an option. I will decide when the time is right. If they are deemed (a threat to national security) we will know what to do, The New Straits Times quoted Abdullah as saying. 
																								The ISA allows for years of detention without trial. Abdullah, who is also the internal security minister, said he was aware of Hindraf canvassing help from terrorist groups and gangsters.

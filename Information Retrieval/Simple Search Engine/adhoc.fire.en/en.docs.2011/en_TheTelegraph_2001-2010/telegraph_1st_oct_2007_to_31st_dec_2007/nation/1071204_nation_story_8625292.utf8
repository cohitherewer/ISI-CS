				 BJP shadow on Darjeeling bill
 							 - Party bid to derail Left timetable OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 A protest meet against the special status in Kalimpong. (Chinlop Fudong Lepcha)																								New Delhi, Dec. 3: The BJP has threatened to oppose a bill that promises more leeway but not statehood to Darjeeling, if the legislation is not referred to a standing committee. 																								The condition has put the Centre in a spot as the Left parties want the bill to be passed in the winter session itself. If a bill is referred to such a committee, a delay of several months is almost certain.																								The BJP decision, which followed a meeting with Darjeeling-based opponents of the bill last month, is being seen also as a move to embarrass the Bengal government, especially after Nandigram. 																								Since the bill is a Constitution amendment legislation, it cannot be passed without the BJPs support.																								The bill will place the hills under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which will offer greater judicial and financial powers to the proposed Gorkha Hill Council. 																								BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said it was an established parliamentary convention to refer a new bill to the standing committee. In this case, Sushma added, it was all the more desirable as it was a Constitution amendment bill. 																								Sushma alleged that there were misgivings about the bill in Darjeeling and many outfits were disturbed about it. The opinion of all parties should have been taken into account before the bill was drawn up, she added.																								L.K. Advani conveyed the BJP decision to Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister Shivraj Patil.																								An amendment bill has to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting, which should not be less than half of the total membership of the Lok Sabha. This majority cannot be mustered without the support of the BJP. 																								In Darjeeling, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, formed by an erstwhile supporter of GNLF leader Subash Ghisingh, is banking on the BJP to get the bill shelved. Last month, representatives of the party met BJP leaders, including Sushma, in Delhi.																								The demand for special status was the brainchild of Ghisingh, who had started the agitation for Gorkhaland in the eighties. The hill Opposition parties allege that Ghisingh compromised statehood for Sixth Schedule status.

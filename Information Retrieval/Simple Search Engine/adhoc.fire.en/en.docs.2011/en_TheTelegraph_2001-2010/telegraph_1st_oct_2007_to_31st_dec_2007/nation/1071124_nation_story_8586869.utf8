				 Cautious hope in Kampala 
 MANINI CHATTERJEE 																								Kampala, Nov. 23: India today expressed cautious optimism about securing the election of Kamlesh Sharma as the first Indian secretary-general of the Commonwealth. 																								The election or selection will take place tomorrow following informal consultations among the Commonwealth heads of government after they go into several rounds of retreat at the picturesque Munyono Commonwealth Resort in this east African country.																								India has high stakes in the election of Sharma  a career diplomat and currently high commissioner to the UK  especially after last years fiasco when India officially sponsored Shashi Tharoor for the post of UN secretary-general and lost. 																								Talking to journalists this evening, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said he was cautiously optimistic about Sharmas chances. We are contacting our friends and telling everyone why he is a good candidate, Menon said. 																								But with Michael Friendo, the foreign minister of the Republic of Malta, also in the fray, Sharma is not yet home and dry, sources said. Although belonging to a small country, Friendo has been active in the Commonwealth since Malta hosted the last CHOGM summit in 2005. 																								The third candidate in the running is Srinagar-born NRI Mohan Kaul who is the director-general of the Commonwealth Business Council. He is an independent candidate.

				 Killings rap on Mahanta 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Guwahati, Nov. 15: A commission indicted Prafulla Kumar Mahanta in the secret killings on a day an earlier report acquitting him was made public.																								Constituted in 2005, the K.N. Saikia Commission held Mahanta responsible for the extra-judicial killings between 1998 and 2001, when he was chief minister and in charge of the home department. Most victims were family members or friends of Ulfa militants.																								Justice (retired) Saikia said the killings were the outcome of a nexus between police and surrendered Ulfa members, referred to as Sulfa.																								An earlier inquiry, which the Congress government rejected in August 2005 and never made public, had given Mahanta and the police a clean chit. The J.N. Sarma Commission, however, pointed to a conspiracy and cited revenge as the motive for the killings. 																								The Sarma report would not have been made public had Gauhati High Court not intervened on Tuesday. Hearing a plea filed by Mahanta, the court said both reports must be placed in the Assembly.																								While the Sarma commission spoke of a conspiracy but did not identify the guilty, the Saikia panel said there is enough evidence to show that the then home minister was at the helm of these extra-constitutional killings.

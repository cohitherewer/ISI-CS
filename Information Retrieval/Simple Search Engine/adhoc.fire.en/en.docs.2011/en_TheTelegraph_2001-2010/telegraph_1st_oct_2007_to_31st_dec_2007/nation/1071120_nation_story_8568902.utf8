 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Nov. 19: A birthday bash with sex workers as guests has led to the suspension of two key aides of Digvijay Singh and Arjun Singh.																								Bedia sex workers were reportedly brought to the Madhya Pradesh Congress office from Sironj town, 35km from here, on November 12 for state party general secretary Govind Goyals birthday. 																								Goyal is a close associate of Digvijay, an AICC general secretary.																								The booking for the Bedia women  in the trade for generations  was allegedly done by a local Congress leader against an advance of Rs 2,000.																								In 1990, a Gwalior High Court bench had directed the state government to put an end to traditional prostitution. Since then, successive governments, including Digvijays, have launched schemes to weed out caste-based sex trade.																								AICC general secretary V. Narayanswami today suspended Goyal and J.P. Dhanopia  the Congress state units legal cell convener who is close to Union home minister Arjun Singh.The two were caught on camera appreciating the dancers.																								Prima facie they are guilty of indiscipline and unbecoming behaviour. An AICC team will visit Bhopal shortly to investigate. If found guilty, they could be expelled for six years, Narayanswami said in a statement.																								Dhanopia claimed he was only making a routine visit to the party office. When I went there, I came to know that it was Govind Goyals birthday. I merely garlanded him.

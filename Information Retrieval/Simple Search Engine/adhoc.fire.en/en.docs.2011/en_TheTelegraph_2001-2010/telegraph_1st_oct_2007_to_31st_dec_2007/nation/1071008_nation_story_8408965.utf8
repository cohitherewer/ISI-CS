				 Goof-up rap on post, interest for family 
																								Mumbai, Oct. 7 (PTI): The postal departments demand that a Mumbai family return the interest paid to them on three joint accounts has been overruled by a consumer court that also directed payment of compensation to the investors.																								Ascharya and Lajwanti Sadana had invested Rs 4,08,000 under the six-year monthly instalment scheme of the postal department on April 15, 1998. 																								Then Lajwanti and another member of the Sadana family, Aseem, invested the same amount in a second joint account. 																								A third account, investing the same sum, was opened by Ascharya and another family member, Anshul, two days later.																								According to the postal department rules, however, Ascharya and Lajwanti could not jointly invest over Rs 4,08,000. Realising the mistake, the Sadanas approached the department in May 1998 to correct it. 																								The names of the account holders were changed, so that one account was held by Ascharya and Nand Sadana, the second by Anshul and Lajwanti and the third by Aseem and Sejal.																								The department paid interest to the Sadanas for four years but trouble started when they wanted to transfer their accounts from Chembur to Andheri.																								The department said the accounts should have been closed in May 1998 as the rules do not allow names of account holders to be changed.																								It also demanded return of the Rs 1,03,870 paid as interest to the account holders.																								The Consumer Disputes and Redressal Commission, however, held that the postal department had itself regularised the mistake. Their subsequent stand is contrary to their own act of rectification, it said.																								The panel said the account holders were entitled to interest for the next two years. It also directed the department to pay the family Rs 10,000 as compensation, Rs 2,000 as cost of litigation and the bonus under the six-year scheme.

 Girl dies after spilling beans

 MUZAFFAR RAINA 
 Srinagar, Dec. 19: A week ago, a girl had walked into a seminar organised to spread awareness about social evils and narrated how a woman held her hostage in a house where she was subjected to repeated sexual abuse. The next day, the girl was dead.
 A year after a sex scam involving politicians, police officers and bureaucrats rocked the Valley, the girl appears to have been a victim of another such racket.
 Police have arrested the accused woman, Sahiba alias Gypsy. She is in our custody and has been booked under the Prevention of Immoral Activities Act, the Narcotics Drugs and the Psychotropic Substance Act, and for wrongful confinement, Subhan Lone, DIG, central Kashmir, said. 
 Lone said the girl died in her home in the Soura locality on December 11, but we do not know how. 
 A day before that, she had approached the Forum Against Social Evils. 
 We were in a seminar organised by the High Court Bar Association on the premises of the Srinagar district court when she walked in. She was accompanied by her parents and another girl called Sony, who had helped her break free from Sahibas clutches, the forums general secretary Parvez Maqbool Shah said. 
 She told us she had been illegally confined by Sahiba in a house at Lal Bazar and that she was sexually exploited under the influence of drugs. She also told us that she was about to be sold for Rs 50,000 to a lady who runs a brothel at Lajpat Nagar in Delhi.
 After the girl spoke about her plight, forum members took her to a room. Fifteen minutes later, she had disappeared. The organisation alleged that she had been dragged out by some unidentified people. 
 We were looking for our legal adviser to record her statement before a judge. In the meantime, she was whisked away, Shah said. 
 The next morning, forum members went to the girls house and found her dead. The family told us that her death was natural, but we believe there is some deep conspiracy, he said.

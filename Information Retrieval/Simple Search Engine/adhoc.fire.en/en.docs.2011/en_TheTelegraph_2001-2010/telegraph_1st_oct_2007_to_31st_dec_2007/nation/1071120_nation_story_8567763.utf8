				 Double ditch derails BJP south debut
 							 - Gowda backtracks again, this time before vote  OUR BUREAU																								Bangalore/New Delhi, Nov. 19: The BJPs first government in the south collapsed within a week of its birth after now-on, now-off ally Janata Dal (Secular) ditched it just before a trust vote today.																								Chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa then walked out of the Karnataka Assembly minutes before voting was to begin and put in his papers.																								Dal(S) national president H.D. Deve Gowda later headed for Delhi but the Congress dismissed talks of an alliance with his party. The Speaker has adjourned the House sine die and central government sources said the state would be placed under Presidents rule.																								Gowdas party, which had in October refused to honour a 20-month-old coalition pact to hand over power to the BJP, had recently done an about-turn and offered to prop up a BJP government.																								But minutes before the Assembly was to begin this morning, it issued a whip to its MLAs not to vote for the government.																								Still, Yeddyurappa moved the confidence motion while small groups of MLAs tried to salvage the alliance through parallel meetings. But Gowda refused to budge and the chief minister left the House for Raj Bhavan, announcing that he was going to resign.																								Sources said the Dal(S) was upset because the BJP would not sign a new coalition deal on stamp paper or hand over the urban and mines portfolios. Nor would it keep out of the cabinet former minister B. Sriramulu, who had filed a murder case against Gowdas son and the previous chief minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy.																								Yeddyurappa, looking relieved at being rid of a troublesome ally, said his party was ready for polls, which it would fight alone.																								I had earlier, too, said we were ready for the polls but the Dal(S) approached us and extended unconditional support for the next 19 months. They even signed individual affidavits. It is sad they have betrayed us now.																								His party, which had cried betrayal after the October rebuff only to grab at its chance later, again put up a display of injured innocence. Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad described Gowdas move as a patent breach of trust.																								Insisting on fresh conditions that were not there when Kumaraswamy was the chief minister was totally wrong, he said.																								We are confident of winning 150 seats on our own. I request the Congress to learn its lesson from us and not align with Deve Gowda, Yeddyurappa said.																								Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi spoke of a possible alliance with Gowda as hypothetical but government sources ruled the possibility out.																								The Congress feels that both the Dal(S) and the BJP stand thoroughly exposed and associating with Gowda makes no political sense.																								Dal(S) and BJP sources said Gowdas ego had been hurt after the BJPs national leaders rejected his demands. He was upset that (senior BJP leader) Yashwant Sinha, who was in Bangalore yesterday and today, did not meet him personally and discuss these issues, a Dal(S) leader said.

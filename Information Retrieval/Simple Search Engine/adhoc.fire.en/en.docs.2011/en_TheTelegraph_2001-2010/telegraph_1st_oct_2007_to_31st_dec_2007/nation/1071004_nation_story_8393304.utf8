				 Congress spits fire, Karat to Sonia aid
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Oct. 3: The roles have reversed: the Congress is talking tough and the Left is practising restraint on the nuclear deal.																								The Congress today asserted that it would not capitulate. There is no question of capitulating before anybody. We are hopeful that we will be able to convince our allies and supporters of the importance of the nuclear deal for our country, especially in terms of civilian energy, party spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan said.																								A cabinet minister later clarified that on our part, we dont want to intensify the acrimony.																								We respect the ethics of coalition and would rather wait until October 5 (when the UPA-Left nuclear coordination panel meets) to see how things play out, the minister added.																								The CPM indicated it would reciprocate the sentiment. General secretary Prakash Karat said in Bhopal that efforts were on to reach a consensus with the UPA government when the panel meets for the next two rounds of talks.																								He also obliquely contradicted his politburo colleague M.K. Pandhes interpretation of the Congress presidents comment in New York where she said the Lefts concerns on the deal were not a cause for alarm.																								While Pandhe saw it as an expression of the UPAs intent to go ahead with operationalising the deal, Karats take was: She has said nothing wrong. She said there are issues on which discussions are going on. We have to respect different views....																								Karat has been observing restraint in public since last weeks confabulations of his party in Calcutta, where the Bengal unit is learnt to have advised caution on forcing early polls.																								Congress sources, however, said they were circumspect about Karats statements and will not get swayed by them.																								The Lefts base line remains the same although we cant understand why the leaders keep changing the goalpost. One day they talk of moving a no-trust vote against the government in the winter session (of Parliament) and then they say they want a debate. We hope they make up their mind before Friday, a cabinet minister said.																								The sources said the Congress has dug its heels in for three reasons:																								 The initial confusion and shock has given way to a sense of resolve about facing early elections.																								 Rahul Gandhis induction as a general secretary had galvanised the party apparatus enough to start the race, said a functionary. The rest can follow. No one is saying its going to be a cakewalk. Who knows price rise may be the main issue. But elections have to be fought and we are ready.																								 It will be a huge disaster to freeze or dump the deal. Willy-nilly, it has become a national issue. I have been clarifying doubts and answering questions endlessly on it and my feedback is positive, said a Lok Sabha MP from the capital.																								 If the Congress and this government have any credibility left, what remains will be totally destroyed if they backtrack, he added.																								 It is pointless to run a government hanging on the Lefts leash. We dont want a lame-duck government, said a minister.

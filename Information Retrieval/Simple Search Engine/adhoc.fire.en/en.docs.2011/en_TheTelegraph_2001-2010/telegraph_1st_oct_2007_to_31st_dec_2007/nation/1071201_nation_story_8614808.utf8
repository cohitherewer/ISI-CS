				 AIIMS director shown door
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 30: The Centre dismissed All India Institute of Medical Sciences director P. Venugopal this evening, hours after President Pratibha Patil signed an amendment to the AIIMS Act that cleared the decks for his removal.																								The cardiac surgeon, however, has decided to fight the dismissal in the Supreme Court, which will hear his appeal against the changes to the law on Monday. Anti-reservation doctors backing Venugopal said they would not call a strike, at least for now.																								The amended law says any AIIMS director must step down after he turns 65 or completes five years in the post, whichever is earlier. Venugopal, handed the dismissal order signed by health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, vacated his office this evening.																								The Centre has appointed Dr Tirath Das Dogra, head of forensic medicine, as his replacement, a decision that surprised some at the institute.																								Many of the charges of caste discrimination against Venugopal were also found against Dogra by the Thorat committee, a senior doctor in the gastro-enterology department said. UGC chairman Sukhdeo Thorat headed a three-member panel set up by the government to probe alleged discrimination against reserved category students at the institute, first reported by The Telegraph in July 2006.																								Health ministry officials, however, said their hands were tied by the AIIMS Act, under which the senior-most faculty member must be appointed as a stopgap replacement for a dismissed director.																								Dogras appointment letter mentions a one-month term that can be curtailed by further orders, sources said.																								The AIIMS governing body meets on December 7, when crucial decisions about the institutes future are expected.

				 Rs 14,000 offload rap on Air India
																								New Delhi, Oct. 22 (PTI): The Delhi consumer commission has directed Air India to pay compensation to a person who was offloaded from a flight six years ago despite having a confirmed ticket.																								Once an airline issues a confirmed ticket, it has no business to offload a passenger, the commission said.																								The commission described as highly frivolous and unacceptable Air Indias plea that because a number of passengers do not turn up for flights, the practice of overbooking is adopted all over the world to avoid wastage of food and seats.																								In no eventuality can any passenger with confirmed ticket be put into jeopardy by offloading him after he reaches the airport in time. The mental agony and the trauma suffered by such passengers are immense, the panel said, asking the carrier to pay Rs 14,400 as damages to Rajasthan resident Babubhai Chandel.

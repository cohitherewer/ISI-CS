				 Militants declare Id ceasefire in Valley
 MUZAFFAR RAINA																								Srinagar, Oct. 8: Militants in Jammu and Kashmir have declared a three-day unilateral ceasefire ahead of Id-ul-Fitr.																								Syed Sadaqat Hussein, a spokesperson for the United Jihad Council (UJC), today said the ceasefire would come into effect from Friday. The council is a Muzaffarabad-based alliance of 13 militant groups headed by Hizb-ul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin.																								An extraordinary meeting of the UJC under the chairmanship of Syed Salahuddin today decided to observe a three-day ceasefire to provide respite to the people of Jammu and Kashmir on the occasion of Id, Hussein said in a statement from Muzaffarabad. 																								Observing the ceasefire is mandatory for all mujahideen (rebel) groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir. The mujahideen have been told to honour the call.																								The spokesperson said the meeting also discussed the continuing repressive operations by Indian forces during the holy month of Ramazan and the futility of India-Pakistan talks, which have not yielded anything for Kashmir. 																								Instead of wasting time on the dialogue process with India, it would be prudent to focus on our basic demands on the diplomatic, political and militant fronts to realise our goal, Hussein quoted Salahuddin as saying.																								Defence spokesperson Lt Col A.K. Mathur said it was for the government to respond to the ceasefire. We have to act whenever and wherever we find a gun-wielding person, he said. 																								The UJC decision comes two days after army chief General Deepak Kapoor said violence in the Valley had gone up. Nine militants and two army majors were killed on Wednesday in one of the fiercest gun battles in Kashmir, which was followed by another bloody day on Saturday when eight militants and three soldiers died. 																								Several politicians had earlier urged New Delhi to declare a ceasefire during Ramazan, but the Centre turned down the request.																								The UJC ceasefire has come seven years after the Hizb-ul Mujahideens then operational chief, Abdul Majid Dar, announced a truce on July 24, 2000. A day later, it was endorsed by Hizb supreme commander Syed Salahuddin and was followed by talks between representatives of the militant group and a high-level team of the central government.																								Salahuddin, however, called off the ceasefire two weeks later, leading to a split in the Hizb command. Dar, who was in favour of continuing the ceasefire, and some of his associates later fell to the bullets of Hizb militants.

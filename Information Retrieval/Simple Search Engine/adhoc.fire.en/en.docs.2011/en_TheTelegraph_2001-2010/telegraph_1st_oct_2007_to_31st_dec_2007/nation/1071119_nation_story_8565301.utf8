				 Rebel raid on panchayat
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, Nov. 18: Suspected Maoists ransacked a village panchayat office in West Midnapore, destroying furniture and burning documents in their second strike in the district in the past 24 hours.																								The incident took place in Baita village in the Lalgarh area, 170km from Calcutta, in the wee hours of Sunday.																								The strikes were in protest against the armed attack by CPM cadres in Nandigram.																								The rebels have also called a 48-hour bandh in south Bengal districts from Monday morning against the deployment of the CRPF in Nandigram.																								The eight Maoists raided the panchayat office around 2am today, beat up security guard Manick Kalindi and tied him up. 																								The group then broke open the lock of the room where the papers were kept, piled them in a heap and set them ablaze along with the smashed furniture and a computer. 																								The group exploded two bombs and chanted Maoist slogans before escaping. We found a lot of Maoist pamphlets from the spot, said deputy superintendent of police K.P. Barui.																								Late tonight, the police quoted villagers in the Lalgarh area as saying they had heard a loud explosion inside the Jhitka forest.																								On Saturday, an armed group of suspected Maoists had carried out an explosion in the Bhulabheda panchayat office in the Belpahari police station area. The guerrillas triggered the explosion with a detonator.

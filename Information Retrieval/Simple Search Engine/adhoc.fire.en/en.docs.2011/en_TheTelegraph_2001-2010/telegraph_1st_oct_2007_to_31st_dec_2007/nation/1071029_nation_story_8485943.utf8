				 Maya annoys, Mulayam angles
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Samajwadi Party has softened its stand on the UPA government with senior leaders saying the outfit was not thinking of bringing in a no-confidence motion in Parliament on the nuclear deal.																								According to the leaders, instead of intensifying hostilities with the government, the party would prefer to tread cautiously in view of the imminent souring of ties between the Congress and BSP president Mayavati.																								The Samajwadi Partys assessment is that Mayavatis political ambition both inside and outside Uttar Pradesh would directly hit the Congresss prospects, thus putting the two at loggerheads sooner than later.																								The moment that happens, an objective condition will be created for the SP and the Congress to come closer, a senior Samajwadi leader said, preferring anonymity. 																								The ice seems to be already melting. While Congress leader Salman Khursheed has stopped attacking Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, general secretary Amar Singh has returned the favour by halting his tirade against Sonia Gandhi, the leader added. 																								Sources said middle-rank leaders from the two parties have started talking of focusing on new political realities instead of clinging on to bitter memories of the past.																								The Samajwadi leader said though the party considered the Indo-US nuclear deal a sell-out to American imperialism and anti-Muslim, and would oppose it both inside and outside Parliament, it did not want to be seen in the forefront of toppling the Congress-led government.																								Mayavati shares a good rapport with the UPA government and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The BSP boss had sided with the UPA in both the presidential and vice-presidential elections. 																								But the BSP chiefs attempts to repeat her states social engineering success in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Gujarat have rattled the Congress more than any other party. In Uttar Pradesh, too, her Dalit-Brahmin-Bania equation has endangered the prospect of all other parties.

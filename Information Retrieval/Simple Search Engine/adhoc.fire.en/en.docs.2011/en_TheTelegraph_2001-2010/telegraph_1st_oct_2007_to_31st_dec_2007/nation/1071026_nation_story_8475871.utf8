				 Wrestling bout with bad mouth
																								Ludhiana, Oct. 25 (PTI): A Russian wrestler called Indians chicken and ugly people, infuriated by the postponement of a tournament in Punjab.																								Canada-based Universal Wrestling Organisation had brought in over a dozen wrestlers from different countries for the competition scheduled to kick off in Jalandhar today.																								But the event, titled India versus rest of the world  war of legends, was deferred because of unexplained technical problems.																								The wrestlers flew off the handle when told of the postponement. This is not a joke, we have taken 16-hour flights to reach here and the event has been put off. I am here to kill somebody, who wants to die today? You ugly people, I am here to kill somebody. You chicken Indians, come fight with me, Niketa, a Russian wrestler, growled.																								He also took off his shirt and flexed his muscles. Several other foreign wrestlers joined Niketa who threw a table at reporters covering a media conference on the event.																								The journalists ran for cover, some falling over the others and injuring themselves. NRI wrestler Tiger Jeet Singh later apologised for the behaviour of the foreign wrestlers.																								Some technical problems led us to take the extreme step of postponing the event, a spokesperson for the organiser said. Those who had purchased tickets will get their money back.																								The reporters have filed a complaint with police. We think the matter will be settled mutually. However, if the journalists want, we will register a case, Ludhiana police chief R.K. Jaiswal said.

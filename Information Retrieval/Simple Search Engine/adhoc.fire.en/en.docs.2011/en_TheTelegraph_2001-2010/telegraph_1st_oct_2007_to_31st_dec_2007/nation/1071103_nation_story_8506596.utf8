NATION BRIEFS																																												New Delhi, Nov. 2: High aviation fuel prices will not burn a hole in Haj pilgrims pockets.																																												The cabinet tonight decided to keep the fare for the round trip to Jeddah and Medina at Rs 12,000, the decision coming just two months before elections in Gujarat.																																												The full cost of the ticket is Rs 32,000 for an individual but the government will pay the airlines the difference (Rs 20,000), information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said after the cabinet meeting. 																																												The price includes the airport tax of 50 Saudi riyals. The subsidy bill for the government will be Rs 368 crore, which is an increase of Rs 25 crore over last year. Airlines often impose a surcharge when fuel prices shoot up. Crude nudged past $95 a barrel in London on Friday. 																																												The move is seen as one of the policies aimed at benefiting the minority community, whose welfare has been one of the priority areas of the government.

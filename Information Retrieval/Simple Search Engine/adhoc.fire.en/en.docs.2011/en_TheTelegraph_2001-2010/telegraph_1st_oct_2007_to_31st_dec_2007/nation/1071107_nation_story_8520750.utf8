 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Walkathon as an eye-opener				 																																																										This could well be an eye-opener on the perils that line the streets of the capital. 				 																																																										White walking sticks in their hands, over 30 blind men and women walked through the busy streets of south Delhi recently to raise awareness about the problems blind pedestrians face.				 																																																										The volunteers, members of the All India Confederation for the Blind, walked a distance of more than 3km in the afternoon, from South Extension to Andrews Ganj flyover, and back down the other side of the road. 				 																																																										Its about time those of us fortunate to have vision realise that travelling on city roads through traffic is an extremely high-risk proposition for the blind, a volunteer with Swayam, an NGO backing the walkathon, said. 				 																																																										Activists say the street infrastructure in Indian cities makes walking even on the sidewalk a hazardous task.				 																																																										The height of sidewalks has been increased in Delhi to prevent cars from using them as parking slots. This, activists for the physically challenged say, is unfriendly to the disabled and those who are visually impaired. 				 																Noisy builder in net				 																																																										A construction supervisor was arrested, not on the usual charges of using substandard material, but for noise nuisance.				 																																																										Residents of Parijat Garden in Thane, Mumbais satellite town, had complained about the problem and the builders were asked to stop work by 10pm. Normally, such problems are sorted out with a warning.				 																																																										But in this case, a case was filed under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. Offences under this law arent bailable and can be punished with up to five years in jail.				 																																																										These people were constructing a mall-cum-residential complex. In the beginning, work used to take place during the day. Later, work went on till 4am. The noise created by the machinery and movement of trucks robbed us of our sleep, said a resident of the area. 				 																Belief binds rainmakers				 																																																										A Tamil Nadu village believes in an unusual way of appeasing rain gods  wives walking away into the jungles and husbands following them with pleas to come back.				 																																																										The seemingly bizarre ritual is enacted every time a village near Dharmapuram, in Erode, is parched to the bone with little hope of rain clouds appearing on the horizon.				 																																																										The spectacle was replayed recently when over 150 women from the village, Madathupalayam, first gathered before the neighbourhood Ganesh temple to offer prayers. Later, they went from house to house begging and screaming Pancham Vanthudichhu (the famine is back). 				 																																																										Having collected what they could, the group went back to the temple and vowed to walk away into the nearby forest from where they wouldnt return till rain arrived.				 																																																										As the trek to the jungle began, their husbands followed, imploring the women to come back. In line with the ritual, the ladies did come back. But the rains didnt. Over generations, we re-enact this ritual whenever there is no rain, said a villager. The myth lives on.				 																Pill probe				 																																																										The civic body is getting taste of its own medicine, literally.				 																																																										The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has agreed to call in the CBI to probe a procurement scandal around ayurvedic medicines bought for its hospitals in recent months. 				 																																																										Mayor Arti Mehra accepted the councillors demand that the probe by the civic bodys vigilance wing wasnt enough. Some medicines purchased werent needed at all, suggesting the deal was made only to benefit the officials.				 																																																	Delhi: National Museum is hosting the first-ever exhibition of pre-Hispanic figures from Oaxaxa, Mexico, this week. The art objects, spanning the period from 9th century BC to 10th century AD, are from the National Institute of Anthropology and History. Time 10am to 5pm.

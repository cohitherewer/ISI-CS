				 Dump liars who divide: PM

																								Surat, Dec. 7: Gujaratis, dump those who lie to you to divide you. Return to the mainstream.
																								That was the message here today from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as he subtly linked economic progress, peace and secularism before a gathering of around 10,000 people.
																								He said the Constitution treats everyone equally but in Gujarat, if you are in favour of the administration then you are secure, but if you are against the government then only God can help you.
																								Singh gave the voter a choice between two ideas: that of equal respect for all religions in a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society, and that of a divided society. Today there is a clash between two thoughts. Gujarat should return to mainstream polity.
																								Division of people is a big handicap for the state. Gujarat cannot maintain status quo and it has to march forward. This government thinks on narrow lines.
																								Constantly referring to chief minister Narendra Modi as some people but not once naming him, Singh said Gujaratis had been misled on issues like terrorism. He urged voters to throw out the jhoote log(people who lie).
																								Is this the way of the law? Do we want to end legal rights in India? Could this prevent the Akshardham incident or Jammus Raghunath temple incident or attacks in Kargil? the Prime Minister asked.
																								My message to the people of Gujarat is that India is on the move in many ways and the world respects us as a country where one billion people live in peace and harmony. That in India, despite our poverty, the rule of law has prevailed, he said at the news conference that followed.
																								Singh did not want to comment on Modis controversial claim that fake-encounter victim Sohrabuddin Sheikh deserved his fate  a statement that has brought the chief minister a poll panel notice. He merely described the remark as unfortunate and added that the matter was sub judice.
																								Singh was asked about Modis recent switch from the development plank to the Hindutva card.
																								He said it was not a good sign if a party tried to divide people on communal lines. This is a sign of weakness and not of strength.
																								On Modis charge that the Congress was anti-Hindu, the Prime Minister said the fact that somebody is now trying to paint the Congress party in (the) wrong colours is a measure of the fear and the uncertain future that haunts them.
																								Singh described Gujarat as the land of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and the birthplace of ahimsa. However, people who do not believe in non-violence are capitalising on the names of Bapu and Sardar, he said.
																								Aware that he was addressing a largely urban audience in this hub of the textile and diamond industries, Singh denied that Gujarat was witnessing an economic boom because of the Modi governments efforts. Economic reforms began here in the 1960s under Congress rule, he said.
																								I now see the winds of change blowing here.

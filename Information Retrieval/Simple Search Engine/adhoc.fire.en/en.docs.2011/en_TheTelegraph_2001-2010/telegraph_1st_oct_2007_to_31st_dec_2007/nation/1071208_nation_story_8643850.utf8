				 Home for all in BJP manifesto

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 
																								Ahmedabad, Dec. 7: The BJP today released its election manifesto  four days before the first phase of polling  promising a safe, secure, prosperous and poverty-free Gujarat.
																								A week after the Congress manifesto pledged free ration, the BJP said it would provide a home for every homeless family. 
																								The chief minister, in a spot over his statement on the fake-encounter victim, Sohrabuddin Sheikh, was not present when his partys manifesto was released. 
																								However, the manifesto carried a letter from the chief minister, listing his commitments to my dear citizens of Gujarat. They included 12 per cent growth, doubling the GDP, zero dropout rate in primary schools, drinking water to every home, roads and womens empowerment. 
																								The manifesto has something for every other section of society  OBCs, tribals and the poor  but is silent on the minorities. 
																								Arun Jaitley, one of the BJP leaders who released the manifesto, said the promises were for all the 5.5 crore residents of Gujarat and there was no need to appease any particular community. 
																								On the delay in releasing the document, manifesto committee chairman Vajubhai Vala said an elaborate exercise had to be carried out before making any promises.
																								As for the Congress coming out with its manifesto earlier, it (the hurry) is not going to cost them anything. They know they are not coming to power, he said. But we have to behave responsibly and make only genuine promises.

				 Left awaits nuclear last word
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Oct. 12: The Left was guarded in its response to Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhis statements today suggesting the government would last its full term.																								The parties indicated the remarks by the UPA Big Two werent the last word on the nuclear deal and they would wait for a formal communication on or before October 22, when the UPA-Left panel meets in an effort to end the stalemate.																								The government will proceed only after the committee formed to consider the ramifications of the deal gives its opinion. On the basis of the agreement between the Left and the government, we will deliberate on October 22, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said. 																								CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan insisted the deal had never been the end-all for the government, though that was the idea propagated in recent weeks. I have always been saying, why do you want to sacrifice your own government at the altar of this nuclear deal?

				 Govt shies off Tehelka debate
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 An anti-Modi march after the Tehelka revelations																								New Delhi, Nov. 14: The government is ready for a debate on the nuclear deal, is neutral on Nandigram but wary of the Tehelka expose on the Gujarat riots.																								On the eve of the winter session, the Congresss main worry is that a discussion on Gujarat would resurrect the secular-communal divide, force the party to restate its secular credentials and, perhaps, regroup the Hindu votes in the state where polls are less than a month away.																								Sources in the Congress and the government said the Left and the Rashtriya Janata Dal had been told not to press for a discussion on the Tehelka expose. The Left leaders have been urged to persuade the Samajwadi Party and the Telugu Desam not to insist on such a debate either.																								CPI national secretary D. Raja confirmed that the Congress was not keen on the discussion. 																								But how can we avoid discussing Gujarat when we take up issues like the Sachar committee report? They are linked to the rights and interests of minorities, the Rajya Sabha MP said.																								Rupchand Pal, the CPMs chief whip in the Lok Sabha, said for the Left, the Tehelka expose and the nuclear deal were both top-priority issues that required a debate. The Left parties will meet tomorrow, before the session opens, to finalise their stand on the riot disclosures.																								Sources indicated that at best, the communists might not insist on a separate discussion on the Tehelka revelations but could club it with the larger debate on minorities.																								The Congresss feedback is that the Tehelka expose was consolidating Hindu votes in Narendra Modis favour. 																								The business advisory committees of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha will finalise their legislative business tomorrow. The two Houses will be adjourned after the customary obituary references to two members who passed away recently  K. Jana Krishnamurthy and V.K. Khandelwal, both from the BJP.																								Government sources said they were still assessing if Nandigram, technically a state subject, could be brought to Parliaments table. 																								Now that the CRPF has moved in, it could be argued that the issue has acquired national dimensions, a source said. The BJP has said it would bring an adjournment motion on Nandigram.																								The Congresss problem is that after reaching a truce of sorts with the Left on the nuclear agreement, it cannot afford to go ballistic on the violence in Bengal. 																								If there is a debate, sources said, the big leaders from the state, like Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, are unlikely to speak because they are engaged in official negotiations with the communists at various levels  Mukherjee is convener of the UPA-Left nuclear panel. The only speaker they could think of was Berhampore MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, but he is abroad.

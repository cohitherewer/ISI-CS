				 Sensex points add up for Modi
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Modi																								Gandhinagar, Nov. 11: If the sensex is rising, full marks to Narendra Modi; if it is falling, it must be the Congress.																								This is the wisdom of Karmabhai Rabari  a man on the street in Gujarat, which holds 25 per cent share in the stock market.																								In his faux Armani T-shirt and faded blue jeans, the 24-year-old looks an unlikely candidate to comment on sensex swings. 																								A Dalit with a Below Poverty Line (BPL) card, he gave up studies after high school to go into dairy farming like most of his caste. 																								But the resident of Jhankur in rural Gandhinagar says he watches the news only to monitor the stock market. Every time there is political toofan (tumult) in Delhi, it is shaky. If only Modi ruled at the Centre.																								A beneficiary of the milk revolution, Karmabhai invests surplus earnings in stocks on the advice and guidance of a local portfolio manager.																								An industrialist who did not want to be named said: There was a time when Gujaratis believed only in saving money. Today, the buzzword for the young is multiplier effect. They are looking at opportunities to multiply their earnings. Thats why portfolio managers have fanned out in large parts of rural Gujarat.																								After gushing over Modi for ushering in an era of prosperity and stability which Gujarat lacked, Karmabhai offers another reason for wanting the chief minister back after the December elections.																								Modi has promised to build a toilet for every BPL home in his next tenure. Individuals who own land, a motor vehicle or a business cannot figure on the BPL list. But Karmabhai remains on the list although he can afford to invest in stocks and his family owns two houses. Most of the modestly sized homes  some are double-storeyed  in this village with cemented roads and electricity lack toilets, he says.																								If the Congress is banking on the urban-rural divide and the Gujarat Shining versus Gujarat in Darkness line to dent the BJP, political observers believe it might not work to the extent the party wants. Except perhaps in Saurashtra, where the dominant Patels of the BJP are up in arms against Modi. 																								Human rights activist Mukul Sinha, who has floated the new National Socialist Movement party, said: Patels are the dominant caste and class and it is important to recognise the co-mingling of the two to understand their so-called rebellion against Modi.																								For years, even after getting economic clout thanks to land reforms brought in by the Congress, the community lacked social recognition. Although the Patels form 28 per cent of the population, political power eluded them until the RSS and the VHP made them their vehicles of mass mobilisation. 																								After the VHP handed over the reins to Patels like Gordhan Zadaphia, Praveen Togadia and Jaideep Patel, it was a common sight to see a Brahmin touching their feet after the de-stigmatisation.																								If Gujarat was untouched by Mandalisation, it was because the Patels  counterparts of Yadavs and Kurmis  were loath to be labelled a backward caste.																								The community might not, therefore, want to snap ties easily with the Sangh parivar, of which the BJP is a part.																								Sinha believes Patels outside Saurashtra have not really revolted against Modi. The chief minister has managed to split the communitys entrepreneurs and farmers, he said. The farmers dominate in Saurashtra.																								 The younger Patels understand that they cant expand their capital through agriculture, so they have moved to stocks, shares and mutual funds, Sinha said. 																								J.J. Patel, a young Ahmedabad lawyer, said: The older Patel leaders, including Keshubhai (the former chief minister) are out of step with the times. We have accepted Narendrabhai although hes not a Patel. What matters is he is dynamic, honest and transparent.

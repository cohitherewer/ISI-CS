				 Samjhauta Express back on track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
 New Delhi, Dec. 30: India today restarted the Samjhauta Express train service two days after it was suspended in the wake of Benazir Bhuttos assassination. 
																								A railway official said the suspension was lifted to help Pakistanis who were stranded in India after the service was brought to an abrupt halt. But within the Indian government, some believe the halting of the train was a knee-jerk reaction after suspicions that militants would attack it. The train was firebombed last year. 
																								An official said the security fears were also prompted by the Pakistan Railway Boards response to inquiries in which it said it might not be able to accommodate its side of the train at the Lahore terminal. 
																								Pakistans fears of more terrorist attacks after Bhuttos killing had led to suspension of flights to and from Karachi on Friday. Indias foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was standing by to attend Bhuttos funeral, was advised against making the visit. 
																								Asked if other communication services would also be resumed, a foreign ministry official said shortly. There was no confirmation on whether the Thar Express, suspended yesterday, would restart immediately. 
																								The Delhi-Lahore bus service was also likely to be resumed after a two-day suspension, a foreign ministry official said. 
																								The Samjhauta Express runs from Attari near Amritsar to Lahore every Monday and Thursday and from Lahore every Tuesday and Friday. The train has connecting services to and from Delhi.

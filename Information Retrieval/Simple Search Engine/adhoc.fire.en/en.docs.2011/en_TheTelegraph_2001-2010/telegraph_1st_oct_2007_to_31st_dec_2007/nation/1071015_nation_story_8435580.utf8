				 Education rap on east zone
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 																								New Delhi, Oct. 14: The east and the Northeast have the poorest standards of higher education in India, but central  not state-funded universities  are responsible, the University Grants Commissions latest quality check on varsities has revealed. 																								Only two universities  Calcutta University and Jadavpur University  from the east rank among the top 44 A-grade universities recognised by the UGC from across India. 																								In comparison, the north, south and the west have far more universities offering top-quality education, the study conducted by the UGCs National Accreditation and Assessment Council (Naac) has said.																								The eastern universities appear to lack the motivation to improve quality on their own, professor Mariamma Verghese, senior education consultant to the Naac, and one of the authors of the study, told The Telegraph. 																								Over 180 universities accredited with the UGC were evaluated in terms of seven parameters. Teaching standards and the quality of evaluation were given the highest weightage  45 per cent. 																								Curriculum, research, infrastructure, student support for the administration, organisation and management, and innovation were the other six criteria. The east fared worse than the north, south and the west in each criterion. 																								The report will be the single largest factor that will decide the funds universities will receive under the Eleventh Five Year Plan, and is likely to be used as a stick to beat poor performers who demand autonomy, UGC sources said. 																								If you dont perform well to start with, you cant blame state control. We are clear. First improve yourself, then seek autonomy. It is sad that even Bengal, which has historically been a centre of learning, is struggling today, a senior UGC official said. 																								The eastern and Northeast universities funded by the Centre through the UGC are doing far worse than varsities run by state governments, the study has shown. 																								Both CU and JU are funded by the state government. 																								Bengals only central university, Visva-Bharati, languishes as a second grade institute, 86 years after Rabindranath Tagore set it up. 																								The Northeast fares even worse. 																								Six of the countrys 21 central universities are in the region  the universities of Assam, Tezpur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Manipur and the North-Eastern Hill University  and all fall in the B category. 																								The Northeast universities are struggling because of the problems of connectivity and lack of good faculty and infrastructure among other indices, Verghese said. 																								The east, though, cannot complain of these problems, UGC officials said.

				 Criminals halt SSA school work 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Patna, Dec. 28: Construction of a primary-school building at a village in Supaul district has been stopped due to extortion threats by criminals. 
																								Kishanpur police said two unidentified and armed criminals, riding a motorcycle, visited the Chilwa Primary School construction site on December 26 and threatened and successfully halted construction. 
																								The construction engineer and workers have been demanding police cover to resume work at the school. 
																								The two-room primary school is being constructed under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA). The nation-wide campaign envisages enrolling all children up to 14 years of age in to schools by the year 2010. 
																								The primary school at Chilwa in Kosi, some 250km from here, is being constructed by the village school construction committee, a sub-committee of the school education committee. 
																								Debasis, a resident told The Telegraph: The school committee members met the Supaul district magistrate yesterday to demand high security at the school site before resuming construction. 
																								The new school building is supposed to have two classrooms, a kitchen shade, two toilets, a swing and a playground. 
																								At present, the school is run in two make-shift thatched rooms, which makes it an inadequate shelter in the recent cold wave. The district administration recently ordered the closure of all schools for three days, starting from today, because of the cold spell. 
																								Supaul district magistrate Mohamed Sharif Alam said: I have received a complaint from the villagers of Supal and have asked the Kisanganj police to look in to the matter. 
																								Under the SSA campaign, Bihar government bears 20 per cent cost of school construction, while the Centre bears 80 per cent of all costs. In Bihar, the SSA schools are managed by Bihar Siksha Pariyojna. 
																								But it seems that such threats are not new for the officials. 
																								An additional district project coordinator said: We face such threats at regular intervals. 
																								But, as there is 100 per cent community involvement in the SSA schools, threats are dealt with help from police and the public.

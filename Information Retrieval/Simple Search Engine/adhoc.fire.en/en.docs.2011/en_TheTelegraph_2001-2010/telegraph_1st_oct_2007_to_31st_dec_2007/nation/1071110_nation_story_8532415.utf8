				 BJP nuke spanner spoils Burnss Diwali 
 K. P. NAYAR 				 	 Nicholas Burns																								Washington, Nov. 9: Diwali wasnt good for R. Nicholas Burns, who has spent scores of hours in the last two years negotiating the Indo-US nuclear deal with successive Indian foreign secretaries, foreign ministers and even Opposition leaders.																								Even as he was confidently asserting in the White House complex on Wednesday his continued belief in the deal, back home in India, the agreement was being effectively mothballed.																								The occasion for the speech by Burns was the annual Diwali celebration in the Indian Treaty Room in the Eisenhower Executive Building of the White House. I believe in the civil nuclear deal and I hope we will see it completed very soon, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs told a cross-section of Indian Americans who attended the celebration. 																								But Burns did not know at that time that the BJP had already issued an unequivocal statement in Delhi that the deal was a significant strategic blunder and that it must be renegotiated.																								The BJP statement effectively meant that the deal has no majority backing in Parliament and is now unlikely to be operationalised. Unaware of the latest developments, Burns soldiered on: We are working on civil nuclear cooperation, as I am sure you are aware, and all of us in government are deeply grateful for the strong support the Indian-American community has shown for this initiative.																								He said: President (George W.) Bush and Prime Minister (Manmohan) Singh have redoubled their predecessors efforts on what our two countries can achieve together. 																								All of which had a touch of unreality, especially with reports that an Indo-Russian nuclear agreement would forge ahead while the deal with Washington languishes. There was much talk in the run-up to Wednesdays celebration about who would be the chief guest in view of the coincidence that every previous chief guest for Diwali at the White House had left their jobs without completing their full tenure.																								Treasury secretary Henry Paulson, who just returned from a very successful trip to India, as Burns put it, agreed to attend, unmindful of all the cocktail circuit talk about the coincidence.																								Paulson is working on a major infrastructure initiative that would harness the private sectors in India and the US to help build what India needs, Burns noted.																								Bush, like in previous years, did not attend, but sent signed letters to invitees conveying his greetings on the occasion.																								The White House event took place only days after the US House of Representatives unanimously approved a resolution recognising the importance of Diwali. 																								At another event here on Wednesday, the first Asian American elected to the US House of Representatives 51 years ago was honoured when a portrait of the late Dalip Singh Saund was unveiled on Capitol Hill. 																								House speaker Nancy Pelosi and several members of the Congress were in attendance when six-year-old Melina Van Fleet, great grand-daughter of Saund, unveiled the portrait. Saund, born in Chhajulwadi in Punjab, immigrated to the US and became a farmer after obtaining a PhD from the University of California.

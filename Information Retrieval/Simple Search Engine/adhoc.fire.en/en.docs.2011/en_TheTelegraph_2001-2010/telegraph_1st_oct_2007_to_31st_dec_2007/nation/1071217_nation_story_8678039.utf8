 The
 Buzz in Big Cities 

				 																Raise the bar to win over tourists
				 																																																										Some in Tamil Nadu want to raise the bar to ensure that the state gives Bangalore a run for its money as a tourist destination and free-living paradise.
				 																																																										Hoteliers at a recent brainstorming session urged the authorities to allow the citys bars to remain open beyond 11pm. 
				 																																																										Keeping them open much later into the night would prove a big draw for the tourists who might have been put off by the conservative closing hours, they argued.
				 																																																										Those pushing the idea pointed to Bangalore, which despite its growing infrastructure problems, remained attractive as a destination because of its liberal rules for hangout zones.
				 																																																										The hoteliers said Chennai, which had relatively fewer of those urban bottlenecks, could become a sought-after tourist hub if only the citys culture cops loosened up a bit.
				 																																																										So far, though, there is little evidence to suggest that the citys guardians are listening. Weeks after the idea was floated, the manager of a three-star hotel was arrested because he shut down the bar moments after 11pm.
				 																Mosquito nets to save cattle
Mosquito nets are out in coastal Andhra  not for malaria-stalked people alone but for buffaloes and cows, too.
				 																																																										Such is the sting squadrons menace that farmers have pulled out the nets to ensure their livestock are not affected. 
				 																																																										The protective gear is particularly helpful in Nellore, Guntur and Prakasham districts, where many cowsheds have gone beyond the nets to large mosquito curtains.
				 																																																										Mosquitoes are reducing the yield of milk among cows and buffaloes and causing weight loss among goats and sheep, said Mallukarjun, a farmer in Nellores Alluru who has struggled to keep the swarms at bay.
				 																																																										The malaria alarm is not exaggerated. The disease has claimed several lives in Adilabad and Vizianagaram. Most of the victims were believed to be tribals who were ill-informed about the ways to prevent the outbreak.
				 																Metro fast forward
The tracks for the Mumbai Metro will be cleared soon with Vilrasrao Deshmukh taking the initiative to remove hurdles.
				 																																																										A committee of top officials, including Maharashtra chief secretary Johny Joseph, will try to resolve problems in land acquisition in the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar corridor of the rapid-transport project.
				 																																																										The chief minister announced the panel last week after a meeting on the difficulties faced in acquiring land on this Metro route. The Metro could decongest roads in one of the citys busiest areas.
				 																																																										There have been difficulties in acquiring land in some areas like Wadala, Marol in Andheri (East), Golibar Road, Saki Naka and Subhash Nagar, Deshmukh said.
				 																																																										He expressed hope that the glitches would be ironed out but stressed that construction must start. If people are taken into confidence, it will pave the way for land acquisition.
				 																																																										The panel will study all issues and difficulties in the way of the acquisition, the chief minister said.
				 																Freedom trot
Tibet tremors coursed through the Garden City last week.
				 																																																										About 150 Buddhist monks, nuns and youths began a 365km march to Chennai to raise awareness among people about the independence of Tibet.
				 																																																										The marchers, led by members of the Tibetan Youth Congress, will pass through Chittor, Palamner, Ranipet, Vellore and Kanchipuram before reaching Chennai on December 31.
				 																																																										Ours is a walkathon for 21 days to press for the freedom of Tibet, Lhakpa Tsering, the cultural secretary of the group, said.

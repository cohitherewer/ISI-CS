				 Stung parties swipe at PM
 DHIRENDRA K. JHA																								New Delhi, Nov. 6: Regional parties do not share Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs view that political considerations based on regional or sectional loyalties hamper national vision.																								While UPA allies said they do not agree with Singh, those in the NDA and the UNPA have gone to the extent of suggesting that the root cause of interruptions in the national vision lies with the Congress, whose failure led to the rise of regional parties.																								Regional parties are in no way hampering national vision. The emphasis of these parties on development of the states they represent does not make them less sensitive to national development. The two are not contradictory. The combining of regional interest with national interest only promotes national integration, RJD leader Ramdev Bhandari said today.																								A similar rebuttal came from the DMK, another UPA ally. Regional parties have helped deepen democracy and make national development more inclusive. These parties have, therefore, played a key role in promoting national integration, a DMK leader said.																								The Prime Ministers comment came while he was inaugurating an international conference on federalism yesterday. Sometimes... narrow political considerations, based on regional and sectional loyalties and ideologies, can distort the national vision and sense of collective purpose, he had said.																								Singh had earlier expressed disappointment with the way UPA allies like the DMK, RJD and the NCP had failed to give their wholehearted support to the government in its fight against the Left over the Indo-US nuclear deal.																								But while the allies remained guarded in their reaction to Singhs comment yesterday, the regional parties belonging to the NDA and the UNPA went hammer and tongs at the Prime Minister and the Congress.																								It was the lopsided development of different regions and sections during the first four decades of Congress rule that led to the growth of regional and sectional political considerations and, therefore, the parties representing them. All this is a direct fallout of Congress policies, Janata Dal (United) general secretary Shambhu Srivastava said.																								Doctor (Manmohan Singh) heal thyself rather than preach to us, he added caustically.																								Telugu Desam Party leader Yerran Naidu called the remark unethical as it came from a person who is Prime Minister because of regional parties. Singh should learn to respect democracy and the people who collectively form it, Naidu said.																								Samajwadi Party leader Mohan Singh alleged that the Prime Minister made the remark because he was not at all aware of ground realities.

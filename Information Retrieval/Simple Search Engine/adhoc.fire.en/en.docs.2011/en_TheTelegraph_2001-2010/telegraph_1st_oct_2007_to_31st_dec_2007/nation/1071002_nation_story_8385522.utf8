				 Wagah porter to excess baggage
 GAJINDER SINGH				 	 A truck waits at the Wagah border before entering Pakistan on Monday. (PTI)																								Chandigarh, Oct. 1: They prided themselves on keeping trade with Pakistan alive. But today, porters at the Attari-Wagah checkpost became excess baggage as the border opened up for trucks from both sides.																								For the last 60 years, the porters had been transporting parcels from the customs office to Radcliffe Line, nearly a kilometre away, and passing them on to their Pakistani counterparts.																								The practice was brought to a halt today as trucks rolled across the border carrying tomatoes.																								But the porters would not take it lying down. Around 300 of them gathered at the customs office and threw stones at the trucks before they could start, damaging windowpanes. They also raised slogans against the Punjab government, forcing police to wield the baton. Ten porters were injured and many rounded up.																								There are over 1,300 registered porters at the Attari checkpost.																								What can we do? We were the only ones involved in people-to-people contact since Partition. We are poor people who have no other means of livelihood. We have been the only ones keeping trade between the two countries alive. With trucks crossing the border, where will we go now? Who will look after our children? We were barely managing to survive. We will starve now, Ajit Singh, who heads the porters union, said.																								The porters would charge Rs 10 for carrying a packet. They will now have to count on towing the luggage of the few tourists who cross over.																								Not many people cross the border. Tomorrow, they may even have a special van to tow peoples luggage, Singh smirked, brushing off assurances from Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal that porters would not be jobless.																								Badal flagged off two trucks carrying tomato today. Trucks carrying dry fruit from Pakistan, however, could not make it to the Indian side.																								India exports vegetables, livestock and meat to Pakistan and imports fruits. The bulk of the trade is through the Attari-Lahore rail route.																								The decision to allow trucks to go to the customs terminal on either side was taken at a meeting between the customs authorities of the two countries at Wagah.																								In the first phase, up to ten-wheelers would be allowed. Both countries have agreed to do away with the need for passports, visas and international driving licences for the drivers. Instead, computerised single-entry permits will be issued.

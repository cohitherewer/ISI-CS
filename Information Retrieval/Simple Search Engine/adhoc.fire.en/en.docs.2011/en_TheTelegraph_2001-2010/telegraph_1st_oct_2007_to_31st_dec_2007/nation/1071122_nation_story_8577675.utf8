				 Tired Biman in Taslima flip-flop
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Taslima, Biman																								Calcutta, Nov. 21: Biman Bose today appeared to have asked Taslima Nasreen to quit Calcutta in the interest of peace but later insisted that he had not meant it that way.																								If her presence here causes a breach of peace, then she should leave, the CPM state secretary said in the evening. But he later said he was tired while he spoke and did not mean to show the Bangladeshi author the door.																								The flip-flop could be an escape hatch that Bose is keeping open for his party. A section of the intelligentsia has prodded the state not to go back on its decision to shelter Taslima in spite of todays flare-up.																								The CPM, however, sought to downplay its role in facilitating Taslimas stay in the city. Minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar said Bengal had nothing to do with her visa extension as it was the Centre that took a call on such issues.																								He said the state had recently banned a Bengali magazine that published objectionable material in the name of defending Taslima. We have not only banned the magazine but also confiscated it.																								In its initial reactions to the violence, the CPM had said it was unfortunate that a section of minority youths had gone on the rampage. But in the evening, after Bose visited the trouble spots, the party changed stance and came down on the Trinamul Congress and the Congress.																								The way our party office was attacked and vandalised in Beniapukur, Tantibagan and other places, it is clear that Trinamul and Congress supporters participated in the violence, Bose said.																								The Congress cannot deny its involvement because the organiser of todays agitation, Idris Ali, is a leader of the partys minority cell. He gave the call for the chakka jam, but the violence was unleashed jointly by Trinamul and Congress workers in a pre-planned manner.																								Asked if there had been an intelligence failure, Bose said the state government had no full knowledge of the blueprint of the agitation.																								But he had a kind word to say about the governor, the first since his condemnation of the Nandigram recapture. He appreciated Gopalkrishna Gandhis appeal to all to maintain peace and calm.																								Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, too, asked the people to maintain peace and urged the administration to exercise restraint.																								The issue over which the protest was launched is genuine. We support it. But we should maintain peace and communal harmony. Nobody should take the law in their hands, she said.																								However, the protest was carried out by non-political bodies and we have no connection with them.

				 CM meets governor
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Parbati Ash at Adhikarypara in Nandigram. All her family members, Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee supporters, have fled the village. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Nov. 13: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee rushed to apprise governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi of the situation in Nandigram minutes after endorsing the recapture by CPM cadres.																								During the 45-minute meeting from 6pm, Bhattacharjee discussed with Gandhi the developments in Nandigram between November 1 and 12.																								Raj Bhavan sources said the chief minister did not make any reference to the governors criticism of the manner in which the CPM recaptured Nandigram.																								The chief secretary, the home secretary and the director-general of police had met the governor in the morning and submitted a report on Nandigram.																								The governor also met BJP leader L.K. Advani, who led a nine-member NDA delegation to the Raj Bhavan. 																								 We requested the governor to send a detailed report to the Centre urging imposition of Article 355 and a direction to the state government to take proper action in Nandigram. If the directions were not abided by, apply Article 356 to dismiss Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government, Advani said.																								 The BJP leader lauded the governor for coming out with a justified statement indicting the state government for mishandling the Nandigram situation. 																								After visiting Nandigram villages earlier in the day, Advani described the violence there as shocking and horrible and said he would raise the issue in Parliament during the winter session.

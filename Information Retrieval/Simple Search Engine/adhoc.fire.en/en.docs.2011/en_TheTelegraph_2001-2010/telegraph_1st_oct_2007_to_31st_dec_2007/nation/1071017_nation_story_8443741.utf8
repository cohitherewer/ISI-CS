				 Rajnath reveals revolt dilemma
 SANJAY K. JHA 				 	 Rajnath Singh																								New Delhi, Oct. 16: The BJPs dilemma over the rebellion in Gujarat was revealed today when party president Rajnath Singh refused to commit that action would be taken against dissidents. 																								Senior party leaders are openly negotiating with the Congress, but Rajnath described the crisis as a normal thing in big parties.																								There is no serious problem, he said, asked why the central leadership had failed to convince the rebels. 																								Two former chief ministers  Keshubhai Patel and Suresh Mehta  are leading the rebellion by a large number of party leaders, including MLAs and MPs. The rebels have not only appealed to voters to support the Congress but have also held several rounds of formal talks with the Opposition party for an alliance. 																								Some dissident leaders might join the Congress while others could campaign for it while remaining in the BJP, sources said. 																								To specific queries whether the rebels had crossed the limit by openly talking to the Congress, Rajnath evaded a direct reply. Instead, he argued that dissidence in the BJP was being unnecessarily hyped up. 																								The BJP is a disciplined party while the Congress had suffered several splits, he told reporters, adding that a decision on action would be taken only after the Gujarat unit sent its report.																								But there is a growing impression in the party that Rajnath has failed to curb dissidence in states, with Gujarat and Rajasthan being prime examples. 																								The Gujarat leadership is in favour of strong action, with chief minister Narendra Modi unwilling to compromise with the rebels.																								Modis supporters have been alleging that Rajnath had not taken the rebellion seriously because he did not want to give the chief minister a free hand. 																								But Rajnaths supporters argue that many rebels had already been punished and further action could precipitate a larger crisis. 																								Some in the party say all efforts should be made to pacify Keshubhai. 																								Acting against more dissidents could push him further away and antagonise the influential Patel community, they say. 																								Although there are reports that Keshubhai will field his son as an Independent to send a message to voters, these leaders argue that nothing should be done to force him to join the rebel ranks openly. 																								Another section in the party favours giving a free hand to Modi. 																								Arun Jaitley, the general secretary in charge of the state who is known to be close to the chief minister, wants the rebels to be shown no sympathy.

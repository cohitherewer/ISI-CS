				 Cong claims Taslima credit
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Congress today moved to prevent the BJP from cornering all the mileage from the Taslima Nasreen controversy, citing how the Centre was protecting the author and criticising Bengal for forcibly evicting her.																								Worried at the BJP painting itself as the sole champion of persecuted liberal Muslims, the Congress stressed that it was the UPA government that had granted Taslima asylum and had now given her shelter in Delhi.																								The BJP has been alleging that the Centre is not keen on Taslima staying in India, and that she had been told she should move out for the time being.																								This is the peak of hypocrisy, misinformation and falsehood for the BJP to criticise the Congress on the Taslima issue, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said. Taslima is in India only because of the UPA governments decision.																								The Centre, which administers law and order in the capital, today took over Taslimas security at the Rajasthan government guesthouse. Congress sources said the Centre would be fully responsible for the authors security and well-being.																								The Congress also said Bengal did not have the authority to relocate Taslima and brushed away suggestions that Delhi had stuffed her down the states throat. Biman Bose had recently dropped such a hint.																								Once Taslima had been granted a visa, it was entirely her choice where in the country she would stay, Singhvi said.																								She cannot be forcibly shunted or relocated. Those who are shunting her out of West Bengal and Rajasthan, they have the audacity to tell us about our conduct?																								The Dalai Lama, for instance, (chose to live) in Dharamshala, a party source said. There are Tibetan refugees in Karnataka. In this we have an understanding with the states.																								The Centre has two main considerations relating to any asylum seeker, the sources said. One, a grant of visa would not impair Delhis relations with the exiles country of origin. Two, the exile would not do or say anything that might disturb peace in India.																								Congress sources admitted to being extremely embarrassed by Taslimas forced exit from Calcutta and wondered why the Bengal government had made an issue of a non-issue.																								The party is also shocked at the cat-and-mouse game allegedly played by the Rajasthan government to keep the Centre in the dark about Taslimas whereabouts for most of Friday.																								First, the Centre was told she was headed for Delhi after which the cabinet committee on security affairs met and assessed her security needs. A little later, it was told she was being taken back to Jaipur. Late in the evening came the information that Taslima was being driven to Delhi, after all.

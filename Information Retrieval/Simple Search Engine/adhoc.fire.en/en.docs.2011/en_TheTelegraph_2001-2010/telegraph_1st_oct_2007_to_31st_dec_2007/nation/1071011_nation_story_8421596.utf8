				 Tech city pays for coalition break-up
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Oct. 10: The political uncertainty in Karnataka may further stall redress of Bangalores infrastructure problems and thus drive investment away, business leaders say.																								The citys IT companies want the state to immediately address their concerns over land, power, water, roads and metro rail.																								It has not helped that successive governments were not serious about any of these problems. There have been announcements but none has come to anything, an IT executive said.																								This is one reason why IT companies, including those that started off from here, are looking at the governments of other states, such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra and even West Bengal.																								Karnataka has come under Presidents rule after the alliance between ruling partners Janata Dal (Secular) and BJP broke up.																								A Japanese trade official, whose organisation facilitates Japanese investment in India, expressed frustration at the thought of the delays that will now hit decision-making at every level.																								Such gaps will not help investors, especially those from abroad. They will be put off because they must now wait for the next chief minister and start the whole process over again with a different set of officials, he said.																								Countries such as Japan, America, Britain and Sweden have set up trade offices in Bangalore, encouraged by the citys IT boom.																								One foreign official said: We are only facilitators, eventually its up to the government to move fast. Somehow, the last two governments seemed uninterested.																								These officials cited the international airport coming up at Devanahalli, 35km from the city. The airport is set to open next April but the dedicated expressway and metro rail connection have just got off the drawing board and may take two years to be completed.																								Or, take the Bidadi township project, which was awarded to DLF last week and will involve setting up Rs 66,000 crore worth of infrastructure, said a real-estate developer who was part of the proposal.																								Bidadi was to be last chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamys new Bangalore  a magnet for investors. The government has so far acquired only 3,000 acres, which is a tenth of what DLF needs, the developer said.																								DLF is now on the verge of paying a huge advance. What if the next government finds the project uneconomical and scraps it? After all, it had got the nod only because the project was in Kumaraswamys constituency.

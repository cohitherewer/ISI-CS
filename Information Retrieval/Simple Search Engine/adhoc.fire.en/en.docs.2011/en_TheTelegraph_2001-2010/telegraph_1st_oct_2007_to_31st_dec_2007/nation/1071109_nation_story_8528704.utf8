				 Tax pincer tightens on perks
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 8: The taxman has struck on Diwali eve.																								Executives in company-owned flats and bungalows in cities with a population of over 2.5 million will have to shell out more in taxes this financial year in a rule recast that raises the assumed rent used in the calculation.																								The twister has also hit companies, which will have to pay fringe benefit tax on gifts or vouchers of more than Rs 5,000. Such freebies arent unusual during festival season.																								Under the changes notified by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the rent assumed on company-owned houses would be 15 per cent of the employees salary and income tax would have to be paid on this notional perk.																								Earlier, the rent assumed was 10 per cent for metros and 7.5 per cent for cities with a population of less than a million.																								If the flat or house is on lease, the rent assumed will be 15 per cent of the employees salary, irrespective of the citys size. If the actual lease charge is lower, that will be considered.																								This new category of assumed rent (15 per cent) implies that employees in metros like Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai will have to shell out more taxes the worst part is that the move will take retrospective effect from April 1, 2006, said tax expert Ravindra Sharma.																								The changes in fringe benefit tax rules, which were announced through the same board notification, require companies to fork out the levy on gifts or vouchers worth more than Rs 5,000 handed out to employees. Even if the gift or voucher is being given on festive occasions, like on Diwali, the companys gesture will come with a fringe-tax liability, Sharma said.																								In an attempt to plug another loophole that might have been exploited so far, the notification specifies that a company will have to pay tax on tour and accommodation expenses if a family member accompanies an employee or if official trips are turned into a vacation.																								Keen to ward off criticism that it was squeezing the salaried and the corporate sector on perks, the tax board, part of P. Chidambarams finance ministry, sought to offer comfort by suggesting that the system of tax refunds had been improved with the dues being paid back faster. 																								The income tax department has issued over 30 lakh refunds, worth Rs 18,448 crore, in the first seven months of this financial year. Personal income tax refunds are 47.16 per cent higher compared with the same time last year, a tax board official said.

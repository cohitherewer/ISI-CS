				 Action timeline troubles allies
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mukherjees room at Lalbazar being emptied on Wednesday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya																								Calcutta, Oct. 17: The CPMs allies added to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees embarrassment today by accusing the government of messing up the situation and inviting the high court order for CBI inquiry into Rizwanur Rahmans death. 																								The chief minister clarified that he had taken a political decision to remove the police officers much before the court order but the allies remained restive. 																								The chief minister looked tense and he was smoking one cigarette after another. But he himself raised the issue before we could accuse him of indecision, an ally leader said.																								He claimed that the chief minister sought four more days for taking action, citing security requirements during the Pujas. 																								In the afternoon, while addressing reporters at Writers Buildings, Bhattacharjee initially said all the five officers would be removed at the earliest but made it clear within a few minutes that they have been transferred.																								Sources had told The Telegraph as early as October 7 that the chief minister had made up his mind to act against the four officers before the Pujas and the commissioner before or after the festival season.																								The sources said Bhattacharjee had communicated his plan to senior party leaders also. An element of confusion, however, crept in after Jyoti Basu made cryptic statements to the media about the governments move. 																								According to the sources, while Bhattacharjee waited for the CID report, Basus remarks gave the impression that no action would be taken until the judicial commission submitted its finding to the government in another three months.																								Part of the confusion was also because of the home secretarys repeated statements that the government would take action against the officers even without the CID report. 																								The chief ministers announcement of the action today was true to his own script, but he and his government had to pay for the confusion.																								At the Left Front meeting today, smaller parties like the Forward Bloc (Marxist) joined the RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI  the usual ginger group  to demand the immediate removal of the officers.																								Bhattacharjee told the allies that he had decided not to appeal against the order keeping in mind the political fallout. We have to accept it since public sentiment is in its favour. So we will extend all support to the CBI, though we have raised questions about the constitutional propriety of the high courts order of CBI probe without the states concurrence, a partner quoted Bhattacharjee as telling the meeting. 																								When some allies complained that the governments inaction paved the way for the courts intervention, Bhattacharjee defended himself by saying legal advice stood in the way of rapid action.																								Legal advisers told me that the governments position would be compromised in the high court if we take action before it decides, he said.																								He did not reply when the allies asked why the government did not take action before Rizwanurs family moved the court.																								The CPM sought to distance itself from the controversy. We dont run the government. We have also recommended appropriate penal action against the officers indicted by the court. In no way should the government shield them. IPS officers cant be spared if they have committed a crime, state secretary Biman Bose said.																								You better ask the chief minister, Bose added, asked why the government waited to take action till the court intervened.

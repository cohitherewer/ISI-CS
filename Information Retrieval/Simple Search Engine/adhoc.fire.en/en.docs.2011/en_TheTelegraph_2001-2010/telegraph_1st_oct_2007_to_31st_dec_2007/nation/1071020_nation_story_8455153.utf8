				 Left shrugs off deal hope
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Calcutta, Oct. 19: The Left believes that the recent statements of hope for the nuclear deal coming from the Prime Minister and the Congress are only an attempt to save face before the voters.																								Left leaders are convinced that the Congress has once and for all chosen to save the government than the deal, and that there has been no shift from the position.																								CPM veteran Jyoti Basu spelt this out in Calcutta, saying the government was about to fall over the nuclear standoff but had now accepted the Left stand to put the deal on hold.																								On Wednesday, Manmohan Singh had spoken of efforts to evolve a consensus and yesterday said he had not given up hope on the deal. Congress spokesperson Veerappa Moily, too, has said the 123 Agreement is alive and not on life support.																								Their (Congress leaders) mind is made up and whatever they say about evolving a consensus is for the consumption of their supporters, a senior Left leader said in Delhi.																								He said these statements were unlikely to impact the next meeting of the UPA-Left panel on the nuclear deal on Sunday.																								Moily today claimed the Congress managed the ruling coalition from a position of strength and not weakness.																								Coalition politics does not mean compromising on everything. It also means negotiating from a position of strength. If we had not done that, the nuclear panel would not have come about, he said.																								Left leaders said they would not seek a clarification on these statements, nor did they intend to ask the Congress if it planned to keep to a timeline that would suit the US for operationalising the deal.																								We have been assured no further steps would be taken as long as the panel keeps meeting and we are going by that. We know nothing can be done surreptitiously, so we are fine with the public statements, the Delhi Left leader said.																								Basu said: The Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi have accepted the Left views. I am happy. We dont want a mid-term election.

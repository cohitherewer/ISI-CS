				 Sanjay to spend Dussehra at home
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 20: Sanjay Dutt today went back to his Pali Hill residence with a smile on his face  a minor reprieve meant that he would be able to spend Dussehra with his nine-day-old nephew Sumair. 																								The actor has been summoned to court again on Monday, and is likely to be handed a copy of the judgment that day. 																								Monday could also be D-day for Kersi Adajania, Russi Mulla and Yusuf Nullwala, who are likely to get their copies of the 1993 blasts verdict along with Sanjay. All of them will have to surrender immediately after getting their copies.																								On Tuesday, convicted members of the Memon family, former additional customs collector Somnath Thapa and some women convicts are among those likely to get their copies.																								Sanjay appeared in court today with brother-in-law Owen Roncon and friend Apoorva Lakhia. He looked relaxed as he strode into the special anti-terror court premises, wearing a striped blue and white shirt. He even managed to smile at the policeman who frisked him at the gate.																								Perhaps the actor knew that it was not time for him to return to jail.																								Copies of the judgment, which runs into 4,340 pages, was handed to 13 convicts today  10 who have been sentenced to death and three who were given life terms. 																								Asgar Yusuf Mukadam, Shoaib Ghansar, Abdul Gani Turk, Parvez Shaikh, Mushtaq Tarani, Shahnawaz Qureshi, Abdul Akhtar Khan, Farooq Pawle, Zakir Hussain and Feroz Malik have been given death sentences. The three who were given life terms are Salim Rahim Shaikh, Nasim Barmare and Bashir Khairullah.																								Sanjay, convicted under the Arms Act, was sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment on July 31.																								The Supreme Court had granted him bail on August 20 till he got a copy of the judgment. Sanjay had to spend a few weeks in Punes Yerwada jail before being granted the interim bail. 																								He is most likely to spend some more time in jail after he gets his copy of the judgment while his lawyers apply for fresh bail.																								The procedure of acquiring bail will take some time. He will have to spend about seven days in jail. I wouldnt like to comment on which jail he will be sent to as this decision lies with the jail authorities, said his lawyer Farhana Shah.																								Sanjay, who started shooting for Popkorn Entertainments Easy Monthly Installment (EMI) on October 13, will now shoot in fits and starts, given his uncertain future. The film is about the pros and cons of taking loans.

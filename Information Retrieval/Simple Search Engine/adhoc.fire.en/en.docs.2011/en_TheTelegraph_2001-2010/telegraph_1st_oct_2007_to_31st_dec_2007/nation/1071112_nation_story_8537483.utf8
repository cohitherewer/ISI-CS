				 Nuclear reactor deal off PMs Russia plate
 JYOTI MALHOTRA				 	 Singh in Moscow. (AFP)																								Moscow, Nov. 11: Unwilling to upset the passage of the nuclear deal with the US, India will not sign an agreement with Russia on the sale of four nuclear reactors for Kudankulam when Manmohan Singh meets Vladimir Putin here tomorrow.																								The intergovernmental agreement was to have been the centrepiece of Singhs 30-hour visit, the shortest ever by an Indian Prime Minister to Russia. 																								It is not clear whether Delhi lost nerve or whether the Americans put pressure on India not to go ahead with the Russian reactor deal, at least not at this stage.																								What is clear is that India has decided to wait until the Americans help push the nuclear deal through, both at the IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), before it can take advantage of any Russian offer. That way, any chance of offending the Americans will not arise.																								Till November 7, incidentally the 90th anniversary of the October revolution, India and Russia were on the same page. Both sides had agreed to hark back to a 1989 Soviet pact on nuclear co-operation so as to sell the new reactors for the Kudankulam site in Tamil Nadu.																								That agreement will not take place now. Interestingly, the chairman of the department of atomic energy, Anil Kakodkar, is part of the Prime Ministers delegation to Moscow, indicating that Delhi hasnt given up hope the deal may still come through.																								On board the special flight this afternoon, the Prime Minister did not talk to the media and sent national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon instead.																								Both officials waxed eloquent about the special, strategic relationship between India and Russia, with Menon warning that it was pointless to take a kabariwallah approach to bilateral ties in terms of the amount of time spent in Moscow, whether the Prime Minister was being served lunch or dinner at the Kremlin and how many meetings Singh was going to have.																								The fact that this visit is so short shows the quality of the relationship, this is the second time in a year that we are having a summit, said Menon. You cant do this by weight or by dates I dont think you can take a kabariwallah approach.																								Narayanan was emphatic. We must set the ghosts to rest, that there is a chill in the relationship. I can tell you there is so much activity, it is sometimes so warm that its hot. But asked if India and Russia were going ahead with the reactor deal, Narayanan said no.																								It is not possible to grandfather (the sale). We have attempted it but it is not possible, Narayanan added.																								The national security adviser was referring to the 1989 pact between Rajiv Gandhi and Mikhail Gorbachev  which predated the fall of the Soviet Union  when Russia was not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Moscow had proposed that the reactors be considered a supplement to the 1989 pact, thereby bypassing current NSG strictures.																								Narayanan said both India and Russia had looked at the old agreement and come to the conclusion that it did not provide for more than the two reactors already in Kudankulam.

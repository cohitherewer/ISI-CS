				 Left finds a new weapon: price rise
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Oct. 16: The nuclear deal in a freeze, the Left has picked inflation to target the government with the CPI threatening a review of support.																								The nuclear deal might have been pushed back, but the danger to the government remains. The unprecedented price rise has made the life of common people miserable. If adequate steps are not taken to check inflation, we might have to reconsider our support to the UPA, general secretary A.B. Bardhan said today.																								Bardhan said the Lefts support to the government was based on the common minimum programme, which promises to streamline the public distribution system and keep prices in check. 																								But the programme is not being followed, Bardhan, who was addressing a protest meeting on the issue of high prices, said.																								The rate of inflation climbed to 3.42 per cent during the week that ended on September 22 from 3.23 per cent in the previous week, the marginal increase caused by rising prices of some food items, including the politically sensitive onions.																								Bardhans inflation offensive came days after a similar tirade that had drawn a reaction from the Congress. Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the Centre alone could not be blamed and states, too, needed to take steps to check rising prices.																								Bardhan had argued that freezing the price of LPG and kerosene had not solved the problem.

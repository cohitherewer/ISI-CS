				 Delhi swift but milder than America
 OUR BUREAU 																								New Delhi, Nov. 3: India reacted with swiftness to the imposition of emergency in Pakistan, suggesting that Delhi has begun to wonder whether General Pervez Musharraf is fast losing control of the political situation there.																								We regret the difficult times that Pakistan is passing through. We trust that conditions of normality will soon return, permitting Pakistans transition to stability and democracy to continue, a foreign office statement said. 																								The Indian reaction was milder than that of America, Musharrafs closest ally. Still, todays response was swifter than usual as Delhi had been cautious while making comments on Musharraf, privately saying he was a better bet than the radical elements there. 																								National security adviser M.K. Narayanan, who believed Musharraf remained in control when former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was packed off from Islamabad airport on September 4, said on television today he regretted the imposition of the emergency.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a meeting with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee to discuss the situation in the neighbouring country. 																								The most significant aspect of Musharrafs declaration of the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) is that it is more martial law than emergency without saying so.																								Sources pointed out that it was Musharraf, in his capacity as army chief, who had issued the order, signifying that the army was in complete control of the situation. 																								The sources said the PCO amounted to a virtual coup, and was very similar to the order that was issued by Musharraf on October 12, 1999, when he toppled then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a coup. 																								It was ironical, the sources said, that Musharraf as army chief had issued the martial law-like order against himself and his own system. 																								Under emergency measures, several provisions such as human rights, freedom of speech and expression of the 1973 Constitution can be held in abeyance. However, under martial law, the entire Constitution is put aside and the army exercises complete authority  which is what Musharraf did today, though he chose to call it emergency.																								Analysts said that in the past, martial law in Pakistan meant that army officers were posted in every government department and ministries in the country. But that has not happened till late tonight.																								For the last many months, even as lawyers led a public campaign against Musharraf and despite the Supreme Courts refusal to get cowed down by him, India has believed that Musharraf would live to fight another day. 																								But now all eyes are on whether Musharrafs corps commanders are with him or not. Musharraf is seeking to assert the pre-eminence of the army in Pakistan society, the sources said, which is the basis of the emergency order.

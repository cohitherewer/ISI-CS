				 New status symbol: A Sanjay cane chair
														 - Star's jail work to be auctioned 				 	 Fruits of labour				 																								If your neighbour is showing off his new LCD television or La-Z-Boy sofas, heres your chance to go one up. Buy one of the cane chairs Sanjay Dutt helped make in Yerwada jail.																								It will burn a hole in your pocket for sure  the jail authorities plan to auction the eight chairs and have sought permission from the government.																								The chairs have been made by a star. Who wouldnt want to own one? a prison official said.																								Strictly speaking, Sanjay didnt make the chairs but merely knitted the cane for them. He has been a quick learner, though, jail officials said.																								After working on four chairs during his first stint of 24 days at the jail, the actor has helped make four more in the 16 days since he returned after his bail ended.																								Not a paise from the auction will go to Sanjay, who will have to make do with his daily wage of Rs 17.50 as a semi-skilled worker.																								The money can be used for prisoners welfare, said jail superintendent Rajendra Dhamne. I am in the process of seeking permission for the auction.																								If made by an ordinary prisoner, the chairs would have sold for around Rs 1,500 each, an official said.																								Yerwada inmates churn out over 70 kinds of products in what is an in-house industry. The Udyog Karagruha, which supports the Pune jail, earned Rs 5.50 crore in 2006-07 by selling the goods made by the prisoners at a huge showroom near the jail.																								The products include terracotta, yarn, saris, bedsheets, wooden and metal furniture, notebooks, files, biscuits and bakery products.																								Munnabhai has stolen a march over the Mahatma, though. If the auction happens, it will be a first for the jail where Gandhi also had been a prisoner, spinning yarn on his charkha. The venue of the auction hasnt been decided.																								The Karagruha showrooms glass panel displays finely woven cane chairs and intricately designed wooden study tables. The chairs are mainly of two kinds  revolving ones and simple wooden chairs.																								Social activists who work closely with the prisoners welcomed the jails move. The auction is a great idea. Lets begin with Sanjays chairs and move on to stuff made by the other prisoners, too, said Asim Sarode of the Sahyog Trust.																								In some countries, the money from goods made by prisoners is handed over to the victims families. In Tihar, 25 per cent of the convicts earnings go to the victims families, he added.																								But in Maharashtra, the entire amount goes to the prison. If the sales from the auction go to the prisoners welfare fund, its great.																								Sanjay had a day off work today, thanks to Diwali. There were no celebrations with diyas or crackers for him, though. His only Diwali delicacy was a sweet served with his lunch. 						OUR CORRESPONDENT IN MUMBAI

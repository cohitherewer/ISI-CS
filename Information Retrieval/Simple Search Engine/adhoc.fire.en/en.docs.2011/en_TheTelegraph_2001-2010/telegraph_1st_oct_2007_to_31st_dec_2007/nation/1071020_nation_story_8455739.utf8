				 Ganesh crores go to the poor
 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI				 	 The Lalbagcha Raja auction. (Fotocorp file picture)																								Mumbai, Oct. 19: The God of Good Fortune has left behind hope of a better life for many in Mumbai who saw the dazzling Ganesh Chaturthi from the fringes.																								Many Ganesh Mandals, the Mumbai equivalent of Calcuttas Puja organisers, make millions during the festival and spend almost all of it on charity.																								Lalbagcha Raja, arguably the best known Mandal in Mumbai that earned over Rs 5 crore from peoples offerings this year, is setting up an MRI centre for the poor in Lower Parel, home to thousands of retrenched mill workers. 																								A Ganpati festival does not only mean big-time spending and fun and frolic for the fortunate. It brings hope to many, said Sunil Ahir, one of the organisers of Lalbagcha Raja.																								Gold and silver make favourite gifts to Ganesh whose blessings, Mumbaikars feel, bring wealth. The offerings range from a simple gold or silver chain to heavy jewellery, besides cash and silk. At Lalbagcha Raja, the gold and silver offerings added up to about Rs 3 crore this year. We auctioned all the stuff and got nearly Rs 5 crore, said Ahir.																								The most expensive item sold at the auction was a 32-tola gold necklace: for Rs 4,15,000. A silver mouse sold for Rs 2,85,000. 																								The cash donation amounted to over Rs 1 crore. 																								But unlike in Calcutta, where most of the cash and jewellery earned by Puja organisers is stashed away, the Mumbai money does not go into the kitty of the next organising committee.																								Most Mandals this year have reported an almost 90 per cent jump over last years offerings and big plans are afoot. 																								A suburban Ganesh Mandal at Santacruz is using Rs 3 crore to organise a medical camp. It will be for the slum-dwellers of Kalina. Around 5,000 people would be checked, said Manoj Parte, the chairman of the Shree Sai Ganesh Mitr Mandal of Santacruz (East). 																								The Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav Mandal of Yeshwant Nagar is using its money to fund the education of about 100 underprivileged children. 																								Ironically, these Mandals are in some of the poorest localities of Mumbai and are run by people who have to work hard to make ends meet. 																								The offerings they receive, though, are from the richest in the town - from those who dont bat an eyelid while offering millions to Gods, but are indifferent to the poor on the pavements of the city of riches.

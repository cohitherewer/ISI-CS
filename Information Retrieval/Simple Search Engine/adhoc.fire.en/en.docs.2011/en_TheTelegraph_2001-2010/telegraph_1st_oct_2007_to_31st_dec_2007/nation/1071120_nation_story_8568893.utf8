				 Channels pad up for league fight
 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI																								Mumbai, Nov. 19: The television rights for the Indian Premier League is hotting up competition between Sony, ESPN-Star Sports and Nimbus.																								At a hush-hush meeting, the Board of Control for Cricket in India organised initial presentations by the big three sports broadcasters this weekend on the sidelines of the Jaipur one-dayer.																								The tenders will be floated on November 24 and opened on December 7, when the rights will be granted.																								It (the presentation by the broadcasters) was a highly confidential affair. Experience has taught us that leak of information about such presentations leads to unnecessary complications, a senior BCCI official said in a backhanded reference to the boards ugly row with the Zee group that led to the breakaway Indian Cricket League.																								Two years ago, the BCCI had made Zee Group owner Subhash Chandra angry when newspaper reports revealed that his top bid of $306 million for the TV rights had been rejected in favour of Nimbus Communications. The board officials had felt that Zee did not have the necessary broadcasting experience.																								This time, no board official was willing to give any details of the presentation even on the condition of anonymity. Even the channels, which made their presentations separately, remained tight-lipped.																								The confidentiality angle is really serious. We dont want to botch up anything, a senior ESPN-Star Sports official said.																								Board sources said top channel bosses had attended the presentation.																								Presentation for TV rights apart, IPL honcho Lalit Modi said BCCI sources also met actor Shah Rukh Khan on the sidelines of the Jaipur match to discuss the Bollywood stars desire to own an IPL team.																								Nothing has been finalised yet, but the talks are in an advanced stage. But the issue of franchising of teams was not discussed at the BCCI meeting on Saturday at Jaipur as the sole agenda was television rights, a board source said.																								We are looking for a basic price of $50 million from which we will start the bids for ownership of teams.																								The returns for the buyer of any one of the eight IPL teams will include a share of gate receipts and stadium advertising.

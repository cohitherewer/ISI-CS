				 CPI toys with deputy post
 DHIRENDRA K. JHA																								New Delhi, Nov. 4: The CPI is likely to revive the post of deputy general secretary  not to help octogenarian general secretary A.B. Bardhan cope with work pressure but to prevent a succession battle in the party.																								The idea has begun to gain ground in the CPI  which is gearing up for the 20th party congress next March  with several leaders making a determined bid for Bardhans chair after he expressed the desire to retire from active politics. Sources said the post would be revived if the tussle for the top slot became imminent.																								Among the front-runners to succeed Bardhan are party secretaries Sudhakar Reddy and D. Raja. Aituc general secretary Gurudas Dasgupta, who is a parliamentary party leader and a secretariat member, is also being seen by many as a possible contender for the post.																								If the national council to be elected by the next party congress finds it difficult to choose a consensus general secretary, Bardhan may be asked to continue for a year or so, and one of the three (Reddy, Raja and Dasgupta) may be elevated to the post of deputy general secretary, a source said.																								There are only two instances of the CPI having a deputy general secretary, but in neither case was the post created to avoid a succession battle. Bardhan himself had held the post in 1995.																								Among the three caught in the battle to succeed Bardhan, Reddy, who heads the partys crucial organisation department, is being rated as way ahead of the other two. 																								Reddy is widely seen as a man of organisation. He has not only successfully strengthened the Andhra Pradesh party but his suggestions in organisation-related matters are valued in most states, a CPI leader said. 																								Raja is seen more as the partys Dalit face rather than a man of organisation. That he, too, was in the reckoning became clear when he presented the political resolution at the recently held CPI national council  a prerogative of the party general secretary. It left party leaders guessing whether Bardhans blessings were with Raja.																								Dasguptas claim to the top slot is based on the fact that Bardhan and his predecessor, Indrajit Gupta, had first headed Aituc before taking over the CPIs reins.

				 Ad break with a difference, courtesy rate war
 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI																								Mumbai, Oct. 15: Tomorrow, TV could look a bit different. You may miss many of the familiar shampoo, soft drinks, car or sportswear ads whose jingles you have almost got by heart.																								The Indian Broadcasting Federation, the apex body of broadcasters in the country, says that from tomorrow, it will stop airing commercials of clients who refuse to pay a new, 25 per cent surcharge on ad rates.																								The deadline for a commitment to pay the surcharge passed at 6pm today but industry sources said hardly any of the advertisers had signed up.																								Realising such a possibility, the federation had at the last moment announced a one-month waiver for those who would sign today.																								Those who accept will receive a surcharge waiver for the first month  October 16 to November 15, 2007. These advertisers will continue to enjoy a surcharge-free status right through Ramazan, Dussehra and Diwali, an IBF release said.																								The federation represents virtually all the major channels shown in north India including the STAR, Sony, Zee, NDTV and Sahara networks. They are all expected to join the blackout. The IBF had cited increased input costs while proposing the surcharge earlier this month.																								Our deliveries have gone up, values have gone down, while the ad rates have remained static. This correction in prices was long overdue, said federation office-bearer Paritosh Joshi, president, advertising sales amp; distribution, STAR India Pvt Ltd.																								The number of cable and satellite homes has gone up from 42 million to around 70 million in the past three years, but with more and more channels coming up, ad rates have fallen by 20-30 per cent in the same period.																								Indian TV ad rates, mind you, are the lowest in the region. The ad rates in China, which has only state-run channels, are five times higher, Joshi said.																								Television rakes in close to Rs 6,000 crore a year through advertising, of which general entertainment channels such as STAR, Sony and Zee contribute Rs 2,000 crore. A 10-second spot on one of these channels may cost between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh.																								Media buyers, through whom most big advertisers buy TV slots, are against the surcharge.																								We understand their problem. We have been negotiating with individual channels from time to time and making price corrections based on bilateral negotiations. But we are against the unilateral decision of the IBF through cartelisation to levy a surcharge, said Shyam Shankar, the president of India Media Exchange, a media-buying arm of Publicis Group Media. 																								If necessary, going to court will be an option.																								The broadcasters, in turn, accuse the media buyers of forming cartels.																								The monopolistic media buyers have made it almost impossible for small players to survive if they do not agree to their unreasonable demands. It was a free-for-all out there which we are trying to change, Joshi said.																								Group M and Madison between them control 80 per cent of the media-buying industry. 																								The IBF will issue a separate advisory for south India-based channels. They will get a month more to enforce the surcharge, sources said.

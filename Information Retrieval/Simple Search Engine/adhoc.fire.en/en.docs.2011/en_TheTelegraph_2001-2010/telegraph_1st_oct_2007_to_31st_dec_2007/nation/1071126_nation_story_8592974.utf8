				 Army tries to clear Pak spillover cloud
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 A soldier at a ceremony in Srinagar on Saturday to commemorate those killed in action in Kashmir. (AFP)																								Awantipora, Nov. 25: The army has allayed fears of a jihadi spillover into Kashmir following the emergency in Pakistan.																								I do not see any impact of the imposition of emergency in Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir, said Lt General A.S. Sekhon, the General Officer Commanding of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps.																								The infiltration bids from across the border were normal this year and the graph of violence, including grenade-throwing, IED blasts and civilian killings, have come down to a large extent, he told reporters at Awantipora in south Kashmir on the sidelines of a surrender ceremony last week. 																								Six militants, including two Harkat Jehad-e-Islami commanders, laid down arms.																								The armys assessment has come amid increased fears of a jihadi spillover from Pakistan into the state, which was accentuated by deadly encounters over the last few weeks.																								Four encounters in the last fortnight left around 30 people, including security personnel, dead. Militants also gunned down National Conference councillor Ghulam Nabi Wani and Peoples Democratic Party workers over the last few days, signalling the resumption of political killings in the state.																								Sekhon, however, said the recent encounters at Sopore, Pattan and Tangmarg in north Kashmir were normal incidents of violence and could not be linked to the emergency in Pakistan. 																								These incidents have no no direct link with the imposition of emergency in Pakistan. These encounters were the result of the usual anti-insurgency operations.																								The forces have eliminated 140 militants in Kashmir, including 95 on the Line of Control, in three months, Sekhon said. He attributed the success to better coordination and good intelligence sharing between security agencies. 																								With the November 30 deadline set by the defence minister for vacating government buildings occupied by the forces nearing, Sekhon said all schools and hospitals used by the army had been vacated. The only exception was a school in Budgam district.																								The school building was not in use and the campus is being used by the army as a helipad. This has not affected the education of students as a new building for them was constructed nearby, Sekhon said.																								The deadline was set to assuage the growing demand by pro-India political parties for reduction of troops, he said.

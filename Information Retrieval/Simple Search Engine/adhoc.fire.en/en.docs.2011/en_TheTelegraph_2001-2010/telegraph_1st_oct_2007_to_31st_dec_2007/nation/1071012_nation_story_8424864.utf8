				 Stephens row
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 11: The countrys apex body for minority education today asked Delhi University and the University Grants Commission (UGC) to investigate allegations that top administrators at St Stephens College are not qualified for their posts.																								The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions issued notices to the university and the UGC, besides the colleges governing and supreme councils.																								Valson Thampu, who holds the post of principal, doesnt have a doctorate, the minimum qualification for holding the position under the colleges rules, a petitioner has argued before the minority education commission.																								Thampu had to resign as member of the education commission in September after he failed to inform the body that he had taken up another post  as acting principal of St Stephens.																								The petitioner, a lawyer, has argued that since Thampus appointment was illegal, others he has appointed as office bearers at the college should also be asked to quit. 																								M.S. Frank, the college vice-principal, and N. Raghunathan, the bursar, should vacate their posts, the petitioner has said.

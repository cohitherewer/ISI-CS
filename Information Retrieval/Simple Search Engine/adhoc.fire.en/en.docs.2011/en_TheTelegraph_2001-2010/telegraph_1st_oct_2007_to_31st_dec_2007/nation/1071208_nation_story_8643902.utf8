				 Fight over, friend left to die

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Lucknow, Dec. 7: A teenage student smashed anothers head with a concrete slab outside their packed Kanpur coaching centre but all their mates fled the building to avoid trouble, leaving the victim to die.
																								The 15-20-minute delay in police being informed while Class XII boy Biswajit Gupta lay bleeding on the street could have been crucial, said Atul Saxena, superintendent of police, Kanpur city.
																								Biswajit, 18, and first-year BCom student Yashveer Singh, 19, had begun fighting in their classroom yesterday afternoon over a girl they both loved. She was said to be sitting beside Biswajit at Kanpurs Rajneesh coaching centre, which apparently made the older boy jealous.
																								The rivals were turned out of class. But they continued to scuffle on the street. I am surprised that none of the other students stepped out to stop the fight, Saxena said.
																								For half an hour, the two boys continued to hit each other. Then Yashveer spotted a pile of concrete at a nearby construction site, said inspector Suresh Dixit of Chakeri police station.
																								Biswajit had taken a tumble a moment ago and was trying to get on his feet. Yashveer brought a concrete slab down on his opponents head and, seeing him lose consciousness, fled the scene.
																								The rest of the 50-odd students, watching from their classrooms, quietly trooped out without informing the police or taking the boy to hospital. Officers said the boys and girls apparently wanted to avoid getting involved. A teacher later informed the police.
																								When the police reached the spot around 4.30pm, the boy was perhaps already dead, city police chief Saxena said. Biswajit, a Kendriya Vidyalaya student, was declared dead on arrival at the Kanpur district hospital.
																								A murder case has been registered and the police are looking for Yashveer, a businessmans son.
																								I cant imagine how my son could die in a fight. He was scared even of a cockroach, said Biswajits father Vinod, a central government employee.
																								The victims sister, Rashmi, told officers the two boys had been friends but had fallen out after both developed a crush on the same girl.
																								Around 3pm yesterday, some students told officers, Yashveer began taunting and abusing Biswajit during the interval between two classes. It started the fight.
																								We might have to question the girl (whom the boys fancied). She is a student of Class XI, an officer said.

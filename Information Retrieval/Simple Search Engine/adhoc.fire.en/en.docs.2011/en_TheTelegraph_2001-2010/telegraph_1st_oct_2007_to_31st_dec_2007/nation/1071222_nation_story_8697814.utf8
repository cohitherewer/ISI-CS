				 Tata Nepal dealer shut by Maoists

																								Kathmandu, Dec. 21 (PTI): The sole dealer of Tata vehicles in Nepal has been shut down by a Maoist union demanding the reinstatement of two workers sacked for alleged poor performance.
																								Sipradi Trading, the authorised distributor of Tata vehicles in the country, has not been able to do business since December 5. 
																								The Maoist-affiliated All Nepal Auto Mechanic Workers Union has padlocked its offices in different parts of the country.
																								The company, owned by King Gyanendra before being transferred to private investors following the seizure of royal assets, had dismissed Dipendra Regmi and Rajan Lama a month ago because of unsatisfactory performance.
																								The union has demanded their reinstatement before starting talks with the management.
																								The company is said to be running up a loss of Rs 5 lakh a day.

				 Cops free Patna trader

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
																								Patna, Dec. 20: Businessman Naresh Shrivastava, who was abducted from the busy Exhibition Road here yesterday, was rescued from Paliganj, 30km from here, today morning. 
																								A Patna police team headed by superintendent Anwar Hussein raided the suspected hideout based on a tip-off and freed him. We have detained four persons for interrogation, Hussein said. 
																								Shrivastava runs a construction company  Moonlite Construction Limited  in Patna. Hussein said Shrivastava used to set up towers for cellular phone operators on buildings here. Some building owners were allegedly angry with the trader, as he had failed to pay up the agreed amount for successive months. The angry owners, Hussein said, barged into Shrivastavas office yesterday. Two of them took him on their motorcycle. His wife later lodged an FIR with the Gandhi Maidan police station reporting the kidnap.

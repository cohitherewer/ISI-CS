				 Advani trains N-gun on PM
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 13: The BJP today again dubbed Manmohan Singh Indias weakest Prime Minister as it continued to accuse the Centre of having done a U-turn on the nuclear deal.																								L.K. Advani alleged that the Centre had lost credibility and sought an explanation from Singh and Sonia Gandhi for what he described as a virtual paralysis of governance for the past three months.																								The Left and the Centre have been locked in a standoff over the Indo-US 123 Agreement for the past two months, but yesterday Singh and Sonia suggested the government would not immediately risk survival by pressing ahead with the deal. 																								In a statement, Advani said that after keeping the nation on tenterhooks for over three months and precipitating the worst political crisis for his government through his stand on the deal, Singh had suddenly done a U-turn.																								The episode also confirms our partys evaluation that Manmohan Singh is the weakest Prime Minister India has had, the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha said.																								He said the ineptitude, arrogance, immaturity and lack of conviction exhibited by Sonia and Singh had shown the UPA up as the opportunistic alliance it was. He said the UPA, which now was at its weakest since its inception, was unfit to govern the country.																								Advani claimed that Sonia had, at a rally in Haryana on October 7, described the opponents of the deal as enemies of the nations development.																								When I now hear Manmohan Singh say if the nuclear deal does not come through, it will not be the end of life, all I can say is that this is certainly the end of whatever little legitimacy he had in the high office he occupies.

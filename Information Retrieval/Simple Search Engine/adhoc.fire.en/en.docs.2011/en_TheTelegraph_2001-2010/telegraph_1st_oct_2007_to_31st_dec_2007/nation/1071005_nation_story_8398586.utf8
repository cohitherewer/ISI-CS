				 Wary MP stings fake sting mastermind
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 4: The suspected mastermind of a fake sting operation has been arrested in the capital.																								Sanjay Tiwari, who runs a media consultancy that allegedly supplies videos of sting operations to TV channels, was arrested yesterday after a Jharkhand MP complained against him.																								Tiwari and his three-member gang had approached MP Rameshwar Oraon pretending to be personnel from the ministry of tribal affairs and proposed a Rs 18-crore development project for his constituency, sources said. 																								They offered him a 5 per cent cut for the project and had hidden cameras to film him signing the deal. 																								On September 6, I got a call from some kid who claimed that he was S.S. Rawat, the personal secretary of the minister for tribal affairs, said Oraon. 																								He said he would do all the paperwork for the project. I just had to sign. 																								Getting a little suspicious, Oraon called up the ministry to learn that while Rawat did exist, no such scheme was planned. 																								The MP reported the matter to police. I asked the imposters to come on Sunday to discuss the deal in detail, he said. 																								Over a cup of tea, the men promised Oraon the Rs 18-crore development deal and whispered that Rs 90 lakh would be his. 																								They were all set to capture this act of corruption on hidden cameras when the police arrived and took the three accomplices  Pankaj Gupta, Ratandeep Gupta and Rajeev Patel  away. They were arrested on September 10. But Tiwari escaped. 																								Apart from Oraon, Tiwari is also said to have approached two other Jharkhand MPs, Sushila Kerketta and Eklal Mahto. 																								These men had allegedly conducted sting operations on 17 MPs earlier, Oraon said.

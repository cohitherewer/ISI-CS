				 Rahuls recipe: work or quit 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rahul Gandhi at the Congress headquarters in Lucknow. (PTI)																								Lucknow, Nov. 12: Rahul Gandhi today stepped into his partys Uttar Pradesh headquarters for the first time with a warning for state leaders  get rid of the enemy within, work hard or be prepared to get the boot.																								The stern message came at a coordination committee meeting where the young MP called for tough actions to reverse the rot in the heartland, where the Congress has been out of power for the last 18 years.																								Our struggle is not against any of the Opposition parties, the struggle is against ourselves, our inability to represent every segment of the people of the state. Our focus should be to connect with the poor, Rahul told reporters after the meeting.																								Another shortcoming, he underlined, was the state units inability to inject fresh blood.																								We failed to attract the youth. I will try to induct youths in the organisation, the newly appointed general secretary said, promising to play a more active role in organisational matters.																								His prescription was unambiguous: connect with the poor and the youth and bring back discipline to recover our lost ground.																								He also called for weeding out sycophants. No one can get anywhere near me with this (the culture of servile flattery), he said. I would like to end this immediately.																								The Amethi MP, who sat through the four-hour interface with state Congress leaders and listened to all the 30 other members of the revamped coordination panel, later met delegations of the partys frontal organisations to take stock of the situation in the heartland.																								Rahul, who had blamed the partys organisational weakness for the Assembly poll debacle earlier this year that led to Salman Khursheeds removal as state chief, emphasised that he wanted more commitment from leaders and made it clear he meant business.																								He said leaders whom probe reports had indicted for anti-party activities should be expelled. State party chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi confirmed that steps had been taken against such leaders.																								Punished also were district Congress chiefs who got less than 5,000 votes in the last polls. They have been stripped of their posts and told to work hard like ordinary leaders.																								This is the time for action, said former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh, the man in charge of party affairs in Uttar Pradesh.																								Todays meeting will be followed by conferences and public rallies in each division addressed by Rahul Gandhi himself, he added.																								To promote Gandhian values, Rahul expressed his fondness for khadi.																								I wear khadi every day. I find khadi comfortable, he said. 																								Rahuls presence drew thousands, who thronged arterial roads leading to the party headquarters and jostled with police for a better view.																								The young leader recommended party programmes in Bundelkhand. The state unit has decided to work among drought affected people of the region.																								The work would involve mobilising grassroots workers and lead to the coordination panels second meeting scheduled in Jhansi, Bundelkhands most important city, on January 19.

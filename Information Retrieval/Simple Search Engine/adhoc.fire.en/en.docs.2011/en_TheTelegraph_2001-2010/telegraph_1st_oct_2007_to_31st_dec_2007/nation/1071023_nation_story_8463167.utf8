				 Kashmiri shawls, cuisine catch Pak bus
 MUZAFFAR RAINA				 	 ready for the trip?																								Srinagar, Oct. 22: From next spring, Kashmirs famous saffron, handicrafts, apples and wazwan meat delicacies will be sold in Pakistani markets.																								India and Pakistan have finalised an initial list of nine items to be traded from Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan across the Line of Control after two years of talks.																								The goods mostly include handicrafts (shawls, embroidery, carpets, chain stitch and wall hangings) and horticulture (fruits and flowers), which form the backbone of Kashmirs economy. The combined exports in these two sectors are currently worth over Rs 4,000 crore a year.																								The other items include tinned wazwan, black mushroom and moongi (moong dal), furniture and furniture items, silk and silk products and aromatic and fruit-bearing plants.																								These are the items agreed to between India and Pakistan for trade (from Kashmir) across the LoC, Union minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh said.																								The state government had proposed 25 items nearly two years ago, but the Centre pruned that list to 14 before handing it over to Pakistan. Islamabad rejected five: leather and leather products; juice, jam, honey and pickles; packed and tinned food (except wazwan); copper and silver products; and gold jewellery.																								Ramesh said the foreign ministry had requested Pakistan to send a technical delegation to sign an agreement.																								We will have an active trade by the first half of next year, Ramesh said. We are waiting for their intimation. They (Pakistan) are busy with their elections and I believe the trade will be a matter of weeks away once the meeting takes place.																								The export agreement will be one more dividend of the Indo-Pak thaw for Kashmir two years after the 183km Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road was thrown open to traffic.																								The peace bus was inaugurated on April 7, 2005, decades after the highway was closed following Partition. The Poonch-Rawalkote road in Jammu was opened in 2006.																								The two countries also took a huge step towards cross-border trade by starting a truck service through Attari.																								Kashmirs fledgling business community welcomed the latest decision.																								We are expecting to double the sales of horticulture products, and our handicrafts sales will go up by 30 to 50 per cent, said Mubeen Shah, president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries. The trade will be duty-free and our main items have been included. Its great.																								The Centre is willing to hold Kashmir expos in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi. The state government should come forward with a proposal. We are more than happy to support it, Ramesh said.

				 Sunita escape spurs students
 ANANYA SENGUPTA				 	 Sunita Williams speaks to Simran Bhonsle at IIT Powai on Saturday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Oct. 6: At 12, schoolgirl Simran Bhonsle already knows what she must do to become an astronaut like Sunita Williams. She must emigrate to America.																								Ayanangshu Dey, 19, a second-year aerospace engineering student, thinks there is little hope of him ever becoming a space researcher in India. He wants to move to the US and not even think of coming back till he is 45.																								As school and college students today packed into the IIT Powai convocation hall to listen to Sunita, there was little doubt about what she represented for the young Indian: escape from the country.																								Simran, breathless after having received a hug and a kiss from her idol before her schoolmates, said: Ill go abroad and study hard just like her. She told me she would be waiting for me when I come home from space.																								The education we get here doesnt match Americas MS degree, said Ayanangshu. I will probably go abroad for my MS, take up a job and stay on till I am 45.																								The Ohio-born Sunita was perhaps taken aback at being seen primarily as someone who had been lucky enough to get away.																								When the astronaut said she was inspired by Tom Cruises role in Top Gun to start dreaming of flying, the students asked if she could have realised her ambition had her parents not emigrated to the US.																								Sunita evaded an answer but the audience at the IITs Annual Aviation Fest did not need one.																								Rajat Chakraborty, who shares Ayanangshus dream, said: If you want to do research, going abroad is the thing to do. Research in aerospace engineering needs a lot of investment. India lacks the infrastructure and the funds to entice us to stay on.																								Most of the budding IITian space scientists are not willing to wait till the aviation boom improves the Indian job scene. They are also disappointed that the private sector does not promote research in a bigger way.																								How much can a government job pay me? asked Ayanangshu, who is from Durgapur, Bengal. Besides, whether it is Isro (Indian Space Research Organisation) or the DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation), you are promoted not because of your talent but because of your age.																								Only those who dont have to worry about financial security will opt for these government jobs, said Bharat Jakarti, 19.																								Then there are people like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who have a vision for India. How many like them will you find in this country?																								Sunita did sound a bit like the former President when she exhorted the students: We have created political borders. They are all in the mind. Dont let anyone stop you from getting what you want.																								As her young audience listened rapt, they were perhaps interpreting borders much more literally.

				 Glucose test strips recalled

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
																								New Delhi, Dec 28: A US-based company today announced that it was recalling a single lot of its blood glucose testing strips in India because some of them were yielding higher than actual readings. 
																								LifeScan Inc, a manufacturer of blood glucose monitoring systems, said it was recalling lot number 2679712 after an internal investigation showed that strips from this lot could result in inaccurately high blood glucose results. 
																								Diabetes patients who use test strips to monitor their glucose levels should check whether they have any strips from this lot and get them replaced for free, the company said. Patients can continue using the strips if they do not belong to this lot, it said. 
																								A company spokesperson told The Telegraph that 20,000 packages, each containing 25 test strips, were released in the Indian market from April 2007. 
																								Inaccurate high readings could prompt doctors to change drug or insulin therapy and cause a drop in glucose levels, said Anoop Misra, director of the diabetes division at the Fortis Hospital, New Delhi. 
																								The LifeScan strips were manufactured outside India and were part of a lot distributed to several countries. Since around July this year, weve received some complaints from patients, said Anil Nayak, spokesman for Johnson and Johnson which owns LifeScan. 
																								A team has been formed to find out why complaints were received from India, Nayak said. The strips from this lot have either been sold or are with retailers. 
																								Its important for patients to frequently validate their blood glucose readings with laboratory tests, Misra said.

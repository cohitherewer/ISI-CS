				 Ladies at helm in Haryana village
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 																								Neemkhera (Haryana), Nov. 11: Deep in the interiors of Haryana, a group of nine is charting a course hitherto unknown to any woman in this conservative state.																								They are members of the states first all-woman panchayat and, in a reversal of traditional roles, are issuing diktats and forming policies for Neemkhera village and its men.																								Its a fantastic opportunity for us women after decades of being under the thumb of others. But its also a big challenge, says Asu Bi, 37, the sarpanch.																								From female foeticide and the states abysmally lop-sided sex ratio to child marriage and education, nothing escapes the attention of these women in the predominantly Muslim village.																								Yet, every time they need to put any of their policies or diktats down in writing, the women need men. For, none of the members of the panchayat knows how to read and write.																								Sab angootha chaap hain (they are all illiterate), says Mushtaq Khan, Asus brother-in-law who transcribes for her on most occasions.																								However, the women of Neemkhera are determined their successors should not face their handicap.																								Asus panchayat  held up by the panchayati raj ministry as a model  has already issued an order that no girl in the village should be sitting at home, away from school. 																								The village, which had just one school for boys before the all-woman panchayat came into being, now has two for girls.																								Boys, too, have had something to cheer about  their middle school has been upgraded to Class XII. The girls can study in the village till middle school. 																								We need a senior secondary school for girls. The nearest school right now is eight kilometres away, Asu says.																								The men in the village, some 150km west of Delhi, say they respect the panchayat leaders.																								But 54-year-old Mehboob Mian offers a different perspective. It is true that even the men have been happy after the women took over. But that is primarily because the governments  both the Centre and Haryana  are pumping in funds and paying plenty of attention to the village, he quips, a twinkle in his eye.																								Zubina Bi laughs off Mehboobs explanation. 																								Even if it is true, it doesnt matter to us. We want to improve the conditions of women. Why the men support us is not that important, says the panchayat member.																								She prefers to focus on the task at hand. Everyone in the village now knows about the problems of female foeticide, the low sex ratio and child marriages, she says. 																								In the last national census of 2001, Haryana had just 816 women per 1,000 men. 																								Traditionally, girls here get married at 12, but live with their parents till they turn 18 to dodge the law against child marriage. 																								We go from house to house telling people if we find out that they are carrying out the girls nikaah (marriage) before 18, we will get them arrested, Zubina says. 																								In 2005, the government had declared Neemkhera a reserved seat for a woman sarpanch. 																								The men say that once they realised a woman would be heading the panchayat, they decided that the remaining posts in the local body should also go to women. 																								The nine women in the panchayat were unanimously elected in May 2005.

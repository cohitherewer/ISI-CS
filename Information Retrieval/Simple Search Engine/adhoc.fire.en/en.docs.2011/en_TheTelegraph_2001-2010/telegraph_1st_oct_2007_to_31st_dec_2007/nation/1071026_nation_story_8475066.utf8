				 Late for school, boy made to run to death
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 Milan Tanna																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 25: A 16-year-old student, told to run five times around his school ground for being late, collapsed after completing three rounds and died this morning before he could be taken to hospital.																								Milan Tanna, usually punctual, had reached Narayan Guru School 15 minutes late and was ordered to do the rounds as part of what principal Taruna Ben claimed was routine punishment to maintain discipline.																								It proved fatal as the Class XI student didnt regain consciousness after he collapsed. By the time he was rushed to a hospital, he was dead.																								Dr Vinay Bhomia of Sanjiveni Hospital, where Milan was taken, said the boy died 15 minutes before he was brought in. 																								Around 7.45am, the school authorities informed Milans father Jasubhai Tanna in Deesa, Palanpur, about 150km from Ahmedabad, that his son had lost consciousness after falling off a cycle.																								But the boys maternal uncle Shantibhai Thakkar, with whom Milan had been staying since he shifted to Ahmedabad six months ago to study science, said his nephew was physically fit and had not been suffering from any ailment.																								Thakkar also said the school authorities were slow in calling for medical help. He later filed a police complaint against the teacher.																								But the principal said it was routine punishment. Whoever comes late, we ask him to run the rounds. The rule is meant to maintain discipline, not to harm students.																								Jayantbhai Charal, the teacher alleged to have punished Milan, however, claimed that the boy decided on his own to do the rounds.																								Milan ran just 30 to 40 metres and fell down. Some other boy gave his name to me. I did not punish him. He went to take the rounds on his own and collapsed after a few metres, Charal said.																								But Milans friends contradicted the teachers claim, saying it was Charal who had ordered him to run the five rounds.																								After news of the boys death spread, parents of other students gathered at the school and demanded action against the teacher.																								We have registered a case of accidental death. There was no intention to kill the student, said deputy commissioner A.K. Jadeja.																								Milans elder sister Kruti, an MBBS student in VS Hospital where his body was taken for post-mortem, was too shocked to speak. His mother Chandrika hasnt stopped crying.																								DCP Jadeja said the police would take action against the teacher after getting the post-mortem report.

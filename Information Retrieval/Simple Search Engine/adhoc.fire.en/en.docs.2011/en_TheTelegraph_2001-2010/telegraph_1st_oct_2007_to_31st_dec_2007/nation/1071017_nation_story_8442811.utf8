				 CID turns to Todi 
 							 - Investigators see proof of suicide abetment against Priyankas father and uncle  A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A candlelight vigil for Rizwanur outside St Xaviers College. Picture by Amit Dutta																								Calcutta, Oct. 16: The CID report to be submitted to the state government describes Rizwanur Rahmans death as suicide and says his father-in-law Ashok Todi and his relative Anil Saraogi can be charged with abetment.																								The investigators claimed to have collected evidence that they say is enough to prosecute Todi and Saraogi.																								We have examined 80 people and recorded their statements. We found out what happened with Rizwanur and his wife Priyanka after the Todi family came to know about their marriage. There are a number of factors which forced the youth to commit suicide, an official working on the case said. 																								Rizwanurs family and friends say he could not have committed suicide because he was preparing for a legal battle to bring Priyanka home. They insist he was murdered.																								Calcutta High Court today described the CID probe as faulty.																								The viscera report that reached the CIDs Bhabani Bhavan headquarters today suggested that Rizwanur was not drugged or poisoned, sources said. Although the autopsy surgeon is yet to give us his final opinion, circumstantial evidence suggests that the 30-year-old youth committed suicide, the official said.																								The CID drew the conclusion yesterday after a Class XI student Rizwanur used to tutor told them he had called her on September 21, the day he died, to say he would not be teaching her from the next day, the sources said.																								We had a little doubt whether our probe was heading in the right direction. The girls statement confirmed this was a case of suicide, an official said. 																								When we started working on the abetment aspect, Todis name appeared. If the investigating agency wants, they (Todi and Saraogi) can be booked on charges of abetting and breach of trust. They had promised they would allow Priyanka to go back to Rizwanur after seven days.																								Priyanka left for her familys Salt Lake home on September 8 after Saraogi, her uncle, signed an agreement at Lalbazar that she would be allowed to return in seven days. Todi had earlier tried to force her to leave Rizwanur but failed.																								The CID sources said four police officers  deputy commissioners Gyanwant Singh and Ajoy Kumar, sub-inspector Krishnendu Das and assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty  had intervened in the marriage in the name of counselling the couple. 																								The officers are accused of trying to break up the marriage at the Todis behest.																								Now it depends on the government how it will react to our report, a CID officer said.

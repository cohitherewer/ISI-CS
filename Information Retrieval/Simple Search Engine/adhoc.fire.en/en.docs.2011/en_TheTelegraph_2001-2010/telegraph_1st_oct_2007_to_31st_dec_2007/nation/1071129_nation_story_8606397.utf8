				 Troops vacate tourist haunt
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Srinagar, Nov. 28: CRPF troops today vacated a decades-old lakeside club, once a favourite haunt of foreigners and movie stars, in a move to build bridges with residents who had been clamouring against the presence of security forces.																								The move to vacate Nagin Club, the first tourist hub to be cleared of security forces, came ahead of a November 30 deadline for the army set by the defence ministry.																								The deadline for moving out of government buildings is not binding on the paramilitary CRPF but the central force still went ahead, keeping in mind the sentiments of residents and political groups.																								Our men from 137 battalion vacated the club today, CRPF spokesperson Prabhakar Tripathy said. 																								Local residents welcomed the move.																								The club was a favourite destination of foreign visitors before Partition. Even after 1947, it continued to be a prime facility, said Mohammad Azim Tuman, the president of a house owners association.																								Tuman said the CRPFs decision to move out would bring in more tourists. Their (CRPF) presence would hamper tourism. Now, we expect more tourists, he added.																								Security forces have been occupying Kashmirs tourist resorts, guest houses and hotels since militancy erupted in the Valley. Several of these facilities were burnt down by the militants, apparently to deny accommodation to the forces.																								Nagin Club, which overlooks the Nagin Lake, also came under attack and its original wooden structure was set on fire in the early nineties. Security forces later moved into other parts of the club which were under construction when militancy started.																								An official in the tourism department said the club would be renovated before being thrown open to visitors. We are also developing an annexe adjoining the club as a heritage site, the official added.																								More than 180 houseboats operate on the Nagin Lake.																								The CRPF, which took over the Valleys security from the Border Security Force last year, has also removed several bunkers and barricades at other places to address the concerns of residents.																								Last week, the army said it had vacated hospitals and all government schools except one in the Valley. 																								Official sources, however, said several schools and government buildings were still being occupied by the army.																								Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad had announced last month that Verinag, a south Kashmir tourist resort, would also be cleared of security forces. 																								But sources said the forces had not moved out yet.

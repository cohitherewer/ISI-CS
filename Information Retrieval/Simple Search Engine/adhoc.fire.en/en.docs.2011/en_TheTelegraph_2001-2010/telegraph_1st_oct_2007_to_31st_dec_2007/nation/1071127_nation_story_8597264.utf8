 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Litter cops train their cameras				 																																																										The guns can take some rest, the brooms are out. 				 																																																										The Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has hit upon the idea of drafting in litter cops with the help of the Territorial Army to sweep the city clean of garbage-dumpers and nuisance-makers in public places.				 																																																										Armed with cameras, the cops are expected to take guard by the end of this year. 				 																																																										We are in the process of drafting a law to implement the programme. It will be in place as early as possible, municipality commissioner K. Subramanya said.				 																																																										The Territorial Army authorities have agreed to lend their men to the municipality. A 60-member team will keep a vigil in the areas under the municipality.				 																																																										Offenders will have to cough up hefty fines. Fines ranging from Rs 100 to Rs 5,000 will be slapped on those flouting rules and spot fines will be collected. Anybody refusing to pay will be served notices and the case will be pursued till its logical end, Subramanya said.				 																																																										The municipality will, of course, help people to refrain from erring. Dustbins will be placed at all arterial roads.				 																																																										A part of the proceeds collected from fines will be paid as remuneration to the litter cops, the commissioner said.				 																Couch comfort in cinema				 																																																										Push-back seats in cinemas? Yawn! A theatre in Chennai is giving you sofas to let you lie back and enjoy the movie. 				 																																																										A press of a button turns the seat into a cosy couch at the 22-seater Abhirami Cinema Complex. Ample leg space turns up the luxury quotient.				 																																																										The comfort comes at a price though  Rs 120 will be charged for the seat alone. 				 																																																										The tastefully done-up mini-theatre is guaranteed to draw lovers looking for a nook away from prying eyes. The theatre owners are also banking on VIPs whod rather not brush shoulders with hoi polloi when watching a film. 				 																Phone lost and found				 																																																										Sasidhar Nandigam had better rush back to the Siddhivinayak temple and thank God. 				 																																																										The second-year MBA student got his mobile phone back within half an hour of leaving it behind in a taxi.				 																																																										Sasidhar had gone to the temple with his family on a Sunday evening. Minutes after reaching home in Ghatkopar, the 26-year-old realised he had forgotten his Rs 13,500 phone in the taxi. 				 																																																										My immediate reaction was to call up the number, but nobody answered. I thought the driver must have found the phone and was deliberately not answering, Sasidhar said, adding that he later remembered he had kept the phone on silent mode while entering the temple.				 																																																										His brother then set out in search of the taxi, but to no avail. 				 																																																										Sasidhar then decided to call the number one last time and got lucky. The driver told Sasidhar that he was on his way back to Ghatkopar from Sion to return the phone. 				 																																																										Minutes later, the driver was outside his home. Sasidhar gave him Rs 100, but he refused to take it. I am just doing what is expected of any decent human being, the driver said. 				 																Tips from London				 																																																										If Mumbai listens to London, it might soon have an executive authority to look after infrastructure and the modernisation of the transport system.				 																																																										You need a person of authority, someone who is politically responsible for the city, who can get funding from the national government, as often it is someone with political clout who can get it done, Peter Hendey, the London commissioner of transport, told reporters during a recent visit to Mumbai.				 																																																	Delhi: The jewels of the Nizam of Hyderabad are on display at the National Museum after six years. Feast your eyes on the 173 pieces of jewellery, whose collective worth is estimated at over Rs 2,000 crore. No wonder CISF commandos will be guarding them. The exhibition is open from 10am to 6pm.

																								London, Nov. 18 (PTI): Oxford University has launched a research project on the life and times of famous Indian students and migrants to the UK such as Rabindranath Tagore and Jawaharlal Nehru.																								Titled Making Britain: Visions of Home and Abroad, the project will look at migrants from the subcontinent as far back as 1870 and their work as writers, political activists and artists, a university spokesperson said today.																								The project will examine how the visitors saw themselves in terms of race, class and nation and the links they formed. It will then chronicle the contribution made by South Asians to British cultural and political life from the late 19th century.																								There is a perception that Britain as a multiracial and multicultural society is a product of the Second World War. This research will challenge that view, said Elleke Boehmer, a professor of world literature in English. Studying this period also shows us that the aspects of multiculturalism that attract interest today  from innovative literature to the fear of terrorism  were with us a century ago.

				 Arunachal is ours: Jairam
 NISHIT DHOLABHAI 																								Tawang, Nov. 23: Arunachal Pradesh belongs to India and its residents are Indians, Union minister Jairam Ramesh said today, prompted by the chief minister.																								The statement came in Tawang, the part of the state that China has long claimed as its own, weeks after Congress president Sonia Gandhi visited Beijing.																								Relations (with China) are getting better but be that as it may, I will urge the chief minister that he should remove the fear and suspicion from his mind. Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India and people of Arunachal Pradesh are Indians, Ramesh said in Hindi, the language best understood by people here next to their mother tongues. 																								Last year, Chinese envoy San Yuxi had caused an uproar when he said that not just Tawang, all of Arunachal was Chinas. Beijing even denied visas to some officers from Arunachal, saying they were Chinese citizens and did not need visas. The states MPs were up in arms but then chief minister Gegong Apang left it to foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee to do the talking.																								Chief minister Dorjee Khandu said the people of Arunachal did have relations earlier with Tibet, but have had nothing to do with China.

				 PM raises Cong N-hopes
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Singh in Pretoria. (AP)																								New Delhi, Oct. 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, asked about the Indo-US nuclear deal today, said the process of evolving a meaningful consensus is still on.																								Singh was addressing a news conference in Pretoria at the end of the India-Brazil-South Africa summit.																								Back home, the Congress has been in a bit of a fix after the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi suggested last week that they would not rush the nuclear deal or work according to a timeline. 																								The flexibility implicit in their statements pushed the party to re-craft its political response, which will now stress on consensus and inclusiveness but not give the impression that the deal, showcased as a high point of the Manmohan government, had been junked or even put on hold. 																								Nothing will be done without getting the Left and the UPA on board, a cabinet minister said. 																								The Congresss strategy will essentially build on what the Prime Minister said today. Singhs statement in Pretoria raised the hopes of Congress leaders who had despaired of explaining to their middle-class voters, sold on the American dream, and party workers why they had decided to go slow on the deal after raising the pitch on its virtues to dizzy heights. 																								The change in mood was reflected in spokesperson Shakeel Ahmeds statement: It is not right to say that the deal is in cold storage. We are trying our best to narrow down our differences. Thats why we are meeting the Left (on October 22) and if need be, we will have many more meetings. After all, we are in a coalition government and when we are negotiating something, we have to listen to every point of view.																								After the Prime Minister said last week that if the deal failed it would not be the end of life, and informed the US President of certain difficulties in operationalising it, many in the Congress had thought it was the end of the road.

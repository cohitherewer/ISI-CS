				 Rebels ruled this, Raman ready for polls next year

																								Raipur, Dec. 30 (PTI): Chhattisgarh continues to be in the war zone of the Maoists as they kill security personnel at will and free their comrades from jails.
																								On March 15, about 700 Maoists raided the Rani Bodli police station in Bijapur district and when policemen came out of their rooms for safety, the rebels killed them with axe and other traditional weapons and then blasted landmines leaving 55 security men dead.
																								On December 16, in connivance with jail officials, 300 inmates, including 105 Maoists, escaped with six rifles and one police wireless set from the Dantewada district jail.
																								The rebels also damaged power transmission towers in Narayanpur district on June 1, pushing 27 lakh people of Bastar region into darkness for 12 days. The government has so far incurred a loss of Rs 2,000 crore on account of such attacks. 
																								The state government has been seen as a mute spectator to the violence on most occasions. As the state goes to the polls next year, the faction-ridden BJP government headed by chief minister Raman Singh tried to initiate several social welfare schemes.
																								The chief minister has personally drafted a policy providing for Rs 3 per kg rice to the poor. This covers 65 per cent of the total population of the state. This is in addition to the governments scheme of providing 25 paise per kg iodised salt, free shoes to tendu leave pluckers and free cows and bulls to the tribals.
																								The Naxalite attacks came as at least 200 villagers died this year of water-borne diseases and in the absence of any government-sponsored healthcare in the villages. The government was shown in poor light when 400 people were found hidden in a container vehicle in what appeared to be a human trafficking racket. The government admitted that the incident showed that the rural employment guarantee scheme was not functioning properly.
																								The scale of Maoist violence also proved that the rebels have become more violent after the start of salwa judum or anti-Naxalite campaign launched in June 2005.
																								In the last three years, 1,000 people have been killed, including 200 security forces. Over 600 villages have been deserted and about 60,000 people of those places have taken shelter in state government run camps.
																								On the political front, the year started with the resignation of Amar Agrawal as the finance minister from cabinet in January. A couple of months later, an honest but ambitious tribal leader Nanki Ram Kanwar was removed from the cabinet hitting the BJPs image.
																								There was every reason for Amit Jogi, son of senior congress leader Ajit Jogi, to smile as 19 out of 31 accused got life imprisonment in the Jaggi murder case of June 4, 2003. 
																								The CBI had made the junior Jogi as the main accused. Special judge B.L. Tidke, convicted 28 others, including four congressmen, and three police officers. 
																								The judge said since the involvement of Amit was not proved, he was declared not guilty.

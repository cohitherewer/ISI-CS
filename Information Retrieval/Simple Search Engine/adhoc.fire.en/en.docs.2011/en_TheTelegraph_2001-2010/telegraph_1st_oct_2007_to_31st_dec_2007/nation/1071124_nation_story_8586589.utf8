				 Unfit Todi skips lie test
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 23: Ashok Todi, the main accused in the death of his son-in-law Rizwanur Rahman, could not be put through a lie-detector test by the CBI today because he was found to be medically unfit.																								The CBI interrogated him for the second day on the pressure the businessman had brought upon Rizwanur to separate from wife Priyanka. He was questioned for over an hour. Todi was later allowed to fly back to Calcutta.																								The businessman who owns the Rs 200-crore Lux Hosiery Industries was today taken for a medical examination mandatory before the test, and found unfit.																								He is a diabetic and a heart patient. He had hypertension in the morning and could not be taken for the lie-detector test, a CBI official said.																								A family friend of the Todis said: Ashok Todi was questioned for close to four hours on Thursday. He was asked some basic questions about the night of August 31 (which he spent at the Rahman home to coax his daughter back) and the incidents thereafter. 																								At the end of it, Ashok Todi was asked if he was willing to sit for a lie-detector test on Friday morning. Todi said he was willing and signed a consent form to undergo the test. He was also asked to submit his medical details, including a list of the medication he was on. 																								This morning, the friend added, CBI officials said it would not be possible for Todi to sit for the test because of his medical history.																								But they requested him to sit at the machine once to confirm his condition. When the machine confirmed that he was medically unfit to sit for the lie-detector test, he was allowed to leave.																								Todis brother Pradip, relative Anil Saraogi and Pappu, whom they had allegedly paid to break up the marriage, will be questioned before the agency wraps up its investigation.																								CBI director Vijay Shanker said the agency would complete the investigation very soon. 																								Sources said the case was looking like suicide, but the CBI believes pressure mounted by Priyankas family drove the 30-year-old to take his life.																								The murder case against Todi is likely to be changed to abetment of suicide, the sources added.																								Rizwanur, who had complained of threats from Todi, was found dead on September 21, a month after his marriage.

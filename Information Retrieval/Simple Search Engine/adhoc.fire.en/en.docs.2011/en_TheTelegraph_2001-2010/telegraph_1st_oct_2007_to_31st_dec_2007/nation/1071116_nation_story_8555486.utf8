 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Mayhem darshan for governor				 																																																										The first-hand accounts the governor wanted to hear were overwhelmed by third-rate crowd management plans.				 																																																										A death, a suicide and a near stampede is what Rameshwar Thakur witnessed at his version of the janata darshan in his first week as Karnatakas administrator. 				 																																																										With the state under Presidents rule then, Thakur wanted to hear peoples grievances first hand. All went well till the second round began at the banquet hall of the stately Vidhan Soudha, home to the Assembly and other offices.				 																																																										First, news trickled in that a woman who was waiting for hours to meet him collapsed. Though she was taken to a nearby hospital, she was declared brought dead. 				 																																																										Before he could recover from the shock, a youth from Mandya swallowed pesticide in front of Thakur. When the governor told his staff he had enough for the day and wanted to leave, a sudden surge of humanity threatened to push the governor and his entourage into a corner. Sanity was restored after the police brought in order. Thakur will not have more of these darshans now. 				 																Fast forward to airport				 																																																										The ride to the airport from one of the capitals fastest-growing townships promises to be almost a breeze.				 																																																										The Delhi government last week approved a plan to construct a 3.5km underground tunnel for the Metro from Dwarka, in the citys west, to Indira Gandhi Airport.				 																																																										The line between Dwarka Sector-21 and IGI airport will be laid completely underground and no additional station will be required, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said after the cabinet meeting where the decision was taken.				 																																																										Services are already running on the Indraprastha-Connaught Place-Dwarka (Sector 9) corridor. Work on the extension from Sector-9 to Sector-21 is in progress, she said.				 																																																										The airport link, estimated to cost Rs 793 crore, will help reduce commuting time and road congestion which, in turn, will go a long way in cutting pollution levels.				 																Guess game on Thai trip				 																																																										A DMK scions visit to Bangkok whipped up more waves in Chennai than on the beaches of the tourist paradise.				 																																																										M.K. Stalin, chief minister M. Karunanidhis son, left for the Thai capital recently but the timing of his departure left the grapevine buzzing about the cause of the sojourn.				 																																																										One theory suggested Stalin was upset with the decision to drop a key supporter, health minister K. Ramachandran, from the cabinet. Another indicated that he was unhappy at the way supporters of elder brother M.K. Azhagiri and step-sister Kanimozhi were being given bigger roles in the DMKs affairs.				 																																																										What fuelled rumours about the soured ties was that Stalin had taken the flight out at a time when his father and elder brother were paying homage to Muthuramalinga Thevar, a colleague of Subhas Chandra Bose, on his birth centenary programmes in Sivaganga.				 																																																										But some of the theories were swept away when a Tamil weekly splashed pictures of Stalin, strolling in casuals on a Thai beach, but with a new hairdo.				 																Beyond Blueline				 																																																										The road ahead for the private buses that will replace Delhis Bluelines has been mapped out.				 																																																										The Delhi government last week cleared the set of rules under which privately owned stage-carriage buses would run.				 																																																										The norms have been suggested by the Delhi Integrated Multi-modal Transit System. 				 																																																										The new rules aim to ensure safety, availability of service on all routes, cost effectiveness, punctuality and passenger comfort, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said after the cabinet meeting where the blueprint was approved. 				 																																																	Delhi: Black or white, yellow or brown, empty or full? Mithu Sen answers these questions with her photo-collage exhibition this Friday. The event will be held at the Gallery Nature Morte at A-1 Neeti Bagh, near Siri Fort auditorium. Time: Between 11am and 7pm.

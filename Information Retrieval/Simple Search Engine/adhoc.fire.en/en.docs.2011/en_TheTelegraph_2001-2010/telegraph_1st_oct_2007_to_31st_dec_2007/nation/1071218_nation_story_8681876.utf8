				 Ghisingh fires a warning at Buddha

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Siliguri, Dec. 17: Subash Ghisingh has warned Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of outbursts of frustration if the bill to confer special status on Darjeeling is not passed in Parliaments budget session. 
																								Ghisingh, who heads the Gorkha National Liberation Front, said if there was a delay in passing the Sixth Schedule amendment bill, it would be difficult for him to restrain his party supporters, some of whom were already harping on a Gorkhaland state. 
																								I have apprised him of the situation in the hills, the GNLF chief said at the circuit house here after a 45-minute one-to-one with the Bengal chief minister. If the bill is further delayed, there can be outbursts of frustration.
																								The two met at 5.30 this evening after Bhattacharjee returned from a public meeting at Mainaguri, 65km away. 
																								As a political party, we favour the Sixth Schedule. But a party is made up of human beings who, when frustrated, can damage their own homes or beat their wives, Ghisingh said.
																								Should there be unrest in the hills, the responsibility would not be his alone, the GNLF leader said. The onus would then be on those because of whom the process of conferring the Sixth Schedule status suffered a setback.
																								The chief minister, Ghisingh said, had assured him of help. I understand that the state government can do nothing other than build pressure on the Centre. 
																								Most of the Opposition parties in the hills are against special status and have been clamouring for statehood.

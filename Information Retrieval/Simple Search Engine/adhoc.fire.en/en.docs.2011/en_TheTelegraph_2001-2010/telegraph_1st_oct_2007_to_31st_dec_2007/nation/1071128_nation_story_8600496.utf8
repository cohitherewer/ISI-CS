				 For Brits, match made on telly
 AMIT ROY 																								London, Nov. 27: While Indians are increasingly going in for love marriages Western-style  often with disastrous consequences  Brits are being encouraged in a reality television show to consider arranged marriages Indian-style. 																								This is the basic philosophy underlying BBC televisions new five-part Arrange Me a Marriage, which is being presented by Aneela Rahman, a happily married Asian woman of 39 with a husband of 15 years, Maqsood, that her parents found for her in the traditional way. 																								Rahman has received generally good reviews for her first programme which attracted a respectable audience of 1.8 million last week on BBC2, a channel aimed at the more discerning British viewer. 																								Her central point seems to be that Westerners often rush into a marriage on the basis of initial physical attraction only to find the relationship does not last in the long run. 																								Lots of people in Britain hook up in a bar or a club, but you wouldnt buy a house or car drunk, so why would you expect to find a life partner that way? asks Rahman, the mother of two children and a successful businesswoman. Then people wake up 20 years later and wonder why they havent found someone to settle down with. 																								She argues  as Indians have done for centuries and the British, too, did in Victorian England  that education, class and family background are important factors that help to ensure greater compatibility. Hence, family and friends should assist in identifying partners for men and women who find it hard to do so on their own. 																								Asian marriages in Britain have attracted unfavourable publicity in recent years because underage or very young girls, mainly but not always Muslim, have been dragged by ultra-orthodox parents usually to Pakistan to be forced into marriage with much older male relatives. 																								People react badly to the words arranged marriage, but there is a huge difference between something being arranged and something being forced, says Rahman, who was born in Glasgow of parents who came from Pakistan. 																								The men and women brave or foolish enough to have consented to appear on Arrange Me a Marriage all appear to have good careers but suffer emptiness in their personal lives. 																								In last weeks opening episode, viewers met Lexi Proud, 33, the director of cabin crew for a private aviation firm. 																								Others who will appear in the weeks to come include Sally Cox, a 40-year-old senior civil servant from Croydon, South London; and Trevor Stewart, 42, a management consultant from Reading. 																								Rahman will be pleased with some of the responses to her show. 																								Simon Hoggart wrote in The Spectator magazine: You cannot trust a single frame of any reality television show. 																								But he conceded: Arrange Me a Marriage was more engaging than most in the genre, mainly because nobody was strung out to dry. The notion is that arranged marriages often work in the subcontinent, so it was worth getting a marriage-fixer  a ScotsIndian woman called Aneela  to work her art on Westerners. She seemed a sensible person. Her subject, a 33-year-old unmarried executive called Lexi, insisted that she didnt mind what social class her groom came from. Aneela quickly set her right on that  class background was vital. Most unwed people have a fantasy about the exact partner they want; she knew that nobody meets all our requirements, and if they did wed be disappointed anyway. As my friend the Texan gossip columnist Betsy Parish said when a friend asked why shed never married, Because all the men here are married, gay, or pond scum. 																								The word from the BBC is that Lexi, who been introduced by Rahman to a man called Nick, is that they are still together and thinking of moving in together and that marriage may not be far off.

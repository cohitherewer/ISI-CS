 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Taste of India for chip-maker				 																																																										He heads the worlds biggest chip-maker. But Craig Barrett would not have been received like a pop star too often.				 																																																										A reception in September at Tindivanam, 130km from Chennai, left Barrett and wife Barbara overwhelmed. 				 																																																										More than anything else, the felicitation showed the way computers have come to rule minds in small-town India.				 																																																	he Barretts had travelled to Tindivanam, Union health minister Anbumani Ramadosss constituency, to inaugurate a some e-health projects. At a girls school in the town, the Barretts were treated to an unusual sight: the students lined up to form a pattern that resembled a chip.				 																																																										Ramadoss played host with elan, lavishing attention on the couple and thanking them for having come to a place that might have seemed a backwater to the globetrotters.				 																																																										But it was the ministers glowing introduction of Barbara that made her suddenly feel like a celebrity. 				 																																																										Mrs Barbara is a pilot, she has flown an F-18 Hornet and has run for the post of the Arkansas governor, Ramadoss said at the gathering as the lady blushed.				 																Cops for forgotten zone				 																																																										Outer Delhi, one of the capitals largest, most spread-out and densely populated zones that has turned into its underbelly over the past decade, will finally have its own police team. 				 																																																										Residents often refer to the district as the out-of-mind Delhi, in a reference to the perception that its localities, spread on all sides of the capital, often receive stepmotherly treatment from the law-enforcers and crime-fighters. 				 																																																										The area, whose population was put at 3.5 million in the last census, will have 10 police stations.				 																																																										The zone has seen the fastest growth in size as people migrating to the capital have increasingly settled here. 				 																																																										But basic infrastructure, including police facilities, has not kept pace with the population and the expansion in the area.				 																After jinx, text barbs				 																																																										Come to Hyderabad, see Lumbini Park, eat at Gokul Chat and take the Punjagutta flyover. If you are still alive, go back home before you end up in a massive traffic jam or an open manhole. This SMS has been flying around the city over the past few weeks.				 																																																										The sarcasm in the message has grown with each calamity that has struck Hyderabad since May, when the Mecca Masjid explosions triggered what now seems to many like a never-receding wave of misfortune. 				 																																																										The barbs might give those behind it the sense that their campaign will jolt the authorities into action. But the probe into the August 25 twin blasts has not made much headway.				 																																																										But the messages, which some believe are the handiwork of dissident Congress MLAs and Opposition, could do more harm than good. Tourism in Hyderabad, a big money-spinner, could take a hit. Already, the number of visitors has dwindled. The citys famed IT strength could also take a beating. 				 																Shock value				 																																																										Delhis private power companies have not stopped shocking customers and the government with their practices.				 																																																										Power minister A.K. Walia was upset after being told recently that longer spells of loadshedding were ordered in areas where there were more complaints of thefts.				 																																																										The government believes such measures amounted to penalising the majority of customers who were honest and were paying their bills on time. Walia suggested an amnesty scheme for those slapped with hefty bills for using power without meters.				 																																																	Delhi: Under a 185-year-old British law, repealed in 1979, a suspect could be held in UK police custody for 24 hours without being charged. Dont miss Barrie Keeffes SUS, a thriller that follows the interrogation of a yet-to-be-accused, this Sunday at India Habitat Centre. Time: 7.30pm. Tickets Rs 50 to Rs 200.

				 Simpler way to get UK visas
																								New Delhi, Oct. 22 (PTI): Britain has simplified its visa application procedure that will come into effect from October 29.																								The move is aimed at encouraging tourists, students and key workers to go to the UK.																								Those who wish to apply for UK visas or entry clearances should apply using the new application forms, the British high commission said in a statement here today.																								The forms can be acquired from the high commission, the visa departments of deputy high commissions or local visa application centres. They can also be downloaded from www.ukvisas.gov.uk.																								We want to encourage tourists, students and key workers to apply for visas to go to the UK, director for UK visas, Mark Sedwill, said.																								We have redesigned our visa applications to make them as straightforward and as simple as possible, Sedwill added.																								He said this would help maintain and enhance our position as the destination of choice for our high-value travellers in what is an increasingly competitive world.

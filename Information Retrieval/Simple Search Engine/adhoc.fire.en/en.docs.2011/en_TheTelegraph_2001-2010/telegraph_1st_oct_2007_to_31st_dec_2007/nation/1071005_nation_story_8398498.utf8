				 48-hour southern suspense
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Deve Gowda in Bangalore. (PTI)																								Bangalore, Oct. 4: Janata Dal (Secular) chief H.D. Deve Gowda today said the fate of the ruling coalition in Karnataka would become crystal clear in the next 48 hours. 																								Not long before he set the time frame, his chief minister son H.D. Kumaraswamy dropped hints that he could renege on the promise to transfer power to warring partner BJP. 																								We will go back to the peoples court, Kumaraswamy said, sending a veiled threat that he was prepared for elections.																								Tomorrow, the power tussle will shift to Delhi, where Gowda is expected to meet BJP leaders after a meeting of the JD(S) parliamentary affairs committee.																								Gowda said he was ready to talk to BJP chief Rajnath Singh but wanted a guarantee that the partys actions after the power transfer would not affect the JD(S).																								In the next 48 hours, the issue will become crystal clear. If there is an understanding with the BJP leaders, it will be good. If there isnt, both parties have the right to decide, he said.																								Most JD(S) legislators were said to be in favour of power transfer. They felt it was better to hand over the reins to the BJP and expose the party over the next 20 months than harm itself by reneging on its promise.																								Despite all the apparent acrimony, Kumaraswamy insisted the coalition was alive. Sources said the chief minister had called a cabinet meeting tomorrow morning. The BJP ministers who quit on Tuesday will not attend the meeting.																								Sources said calling a special session of the Assembly for a floor test would be one of the options discussed. 																								Some JD(S) leaders were of the view that Kumaraswamy might be able to scrape through with outside support from the Congress. 																								Kumaraswamy said the saffronisation of Karnataka was a worry. He cited last years communal violence in Mangalore, the attack on the house of M. Karunanidhis daughter and the burning of a bus to protest the DMK chiefs remarks against Ram as examples of the threat. Two passengers were burnt alive in the bus arson.																								Kumaraswamy said these acts were more dangerous than the corruption and murder charges levelled against him by some disgruntled BJP legislators, including a minister.																								If this is how they behave in government, who will provide security to the people if they rake up communal issues when they are in power? he asked.

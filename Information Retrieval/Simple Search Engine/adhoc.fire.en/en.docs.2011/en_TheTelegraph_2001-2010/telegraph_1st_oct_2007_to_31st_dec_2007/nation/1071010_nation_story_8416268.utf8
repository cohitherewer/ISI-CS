				 Blot on cop, before Rizwanur 
 							 - SP Gyanwant worked as CPM hatchet man, said poll observer  NALIN VERMA AND OUR BUREAU																								Patna/Calcutta, Oct. 9: Gyanwant Singh, one of the Lalbazar bosses questioned over Rizwanur Rahmans death, did not always behave like a man supposed to work as upholder of the law, an Election Commission observer wrote during the 2004 Lok Sabha polls.																								Special observer Afzal Amanullahs report said Gyanwant, then Murshidabad superintendent of police, had asked his men to help the CPM rig the vote and had cooked up cases against a Congress candidate.																								The officer worked like the CPMs hatchet man rather than (the) Murshidabad SP and a man in uniform supposed to work as upholder of the law, wrote Amanullah, who is now principal secretary (home), Bihar.																								That question over his style of functioning has returned to haunt Gyanwant, now Calcutta polices deputy commissioner (headquarters), amid allegations that he had bullied Rizwanur to get him to separate from wife Priyanka at her rich fathers bidding.																								Amanullah had recommended that the poll panel take appropriate action against Gyanwant.																								Sources said Pranab Mukherjee and Adhir Chowdhury, both Congress candidates from Murshidabad constituencies, had complained to the poll commission that Gyanwant was filing false cases against Congress workers and helping the CPM grab booths.																								The commission sent Amanullah to the district where he spoke to voters, Congress workers and CPM cadres. His conclusion: Gyanwant had cooked up and fabricated cases against Adhir and arrested many of his supporters.																								CPM sources said the officer was transferred from South Dinajpur, where too he was the district police chief, to Murshidabad in late 2003 to counter the rising threat from Adhir and the Congress.																								They added that Gyanwant was close to former CPM state secretary Anil Biswas and former party MLA Rabin Deb.																								Adhir, now Behrampore MP, alleged that Gyanwant had hurled a cellphone at the then inspector in charge of Behrampore police station after being told the CPM would not do well in an upcoming civic poll.																								Amanullahs report says the SP asked his forces to work with the CPM cadres and manage sumptuous voting in the CPMs favour even in Congress-dominated pockets.																								The observer even found the officer canvassing votes for the CPM by describing the Congress as a party of imperialists and capitalists.																								The sources said Amanullah gave Gyanwant a tongue-lashing, telling him: You are a representative of the law and not of a party. Mend your ways and do the work expected of you during the polls.																								Gyanwant, they said, then got his friends and well-wishers in the police and bureaucracy to put in a few words in his favour before Amanullah.																								The observers stinging report, however, didnt lead to any action from the poll panel.																								Basudeb Banerjee, who was then the states chief electoral officer, admitted receiving a host of complaints from Adhir with the request that the SP be transferred out of Murshidabad.																								I summoned him (Gyanwant) and inquired about the allegations and found that there were not enough grounds to remove him from the district, Banerjee said. I informed the Election Commission accordingly and it accepted my suggestion.

																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: Four days after it bit the dust in Gujarat, the Congresss travails travelled north-westwards  it lost Himachal Pradesh to the BJP.
																								For the record, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh put on a brave face and maintained that the results were on expected lines. Himachal swings between the BJP and the Congress in election after election, he said. 
																								Anand Sharma, the deputy foreign minister, who was minding the state for the Congress, said the anti-incumbency factor had worked against the government despite the fact that it was not short on development.
																								The Congress was expected to do an introspection to find out what went wrong. But sources said their initial assessment was the party blew a chance to retain Himachal. They said the party should have played on the contradictions between the BJPs Big Two in the state, Prem Kumar Dhumal and Shanta Kumar.
																								The Dhumal-Shanta rivalry was rooted in personality and caste factors. Dhumal was originally Shantas protege when the latter ruled the state in the early 90s. 
																								However, in the next election, Dhumal, backed by his good friend Narendra Modi who was the BJP general secretary in charge of Himachal, turfed out Shanta to claim the chief ministers post. Dhumal got his comeuppance in the 2003 election when Shanta and his loyalists worked hard to defeat the BJP.
																								This time, the BJP neutralised the Shanta factor by giving tickets to many of his nominees.
																								Between them, Dhumal and Shanta belong to two influential castes, the Rajputs and the Brahmins. The caste division had worked against the BJP in 2003. But the Congress failed to exploit the fissures in the communities.
																								There was a feeling that the Congress invested far too much energy, time and resources in Gujarat and gave Himachal a wide berth. Apart from a few meetings addressed by the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi and a road show by Rahul Gandhi, none of the central leaders went to the hill state.
																								However, the Congresss bigger worry was not so much the loss of Himachal as the fact that the BJP was pocketing one state after another in the west and the north. With Himachal, the BJP-NDA rules 10 states, one short of the Congress, from Gujarat in the west to Punjab, Himachal, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh in the north and north-central, Bihar in the east and Nagaland and Mizoram in the North-east.
																								In the north, the Congress-UPA has only three small states: Haryana, Jharkhand and Delhi.

				 Burning a prank, says Stephens
 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 																								New Delhi, Oct. 30: St Stephens College has submitted a report to Delhi University calling the incident where a fresher suffered burns at the hands of his seniors a mere prank, not a case of ragging. 																								The Telegraph had first reported the incident on October 4. The victim, a Calcutta boy who had earlier studied at St Xaviers school, suffered burns on his knee and hand.																								Following the report, the University Grants Commission had asked the university to seek an explanation from the college. 																								Under Supreme Court guidelines against ragging, the UGC is supposed to examine all alleged cases. 																								In its report, signed by principal Valson Thampu, the college said the prank accidentally led to the fresher suffering burns. The students had sprayed the junior with deodorant before throwing a lighted matchstick at him. The four students were intoxicated, and not in their senses, the college said, adding that the inquiry showed no deliberate intent to hurt the junior. 																								Officials on the Supreme Court-appointed committee against ragging differed with the colleges understanding of the episode. Even if they had no intent to set him on fire, the entire episode occurred only because the junior was compelled to go along with whatever his seniors were doing. The incident occurred in the room of a senior. The fresher is clearly a victim. The college ought not hush it up, a member of the committee said. 																								Rajendra Prasad, a professor who is also a member of the committee, had said on October 4 that the St Stephens incident amounted to a severe case of ragging.

				 Off with beards, BJP tells Bhopal prisoners
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Ok in Pune, not in MP: Sanjay Dutt outside Yerwada Jail after his release																								Bhopal, Nov. 12: Make a clean chin of it, prisoners, your BJP rulers are wary of any unnecessary hair.																								And no skullcaps, please  they dont like them either.																								BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh has banned prisoners from sporting beards and wearing skullcaps because they make identification of criminals difficult.																								The move has enraged both the Muslim and Hindu clergy, who are asking why similar bans havent been slapped on passport and driving-licence holders.																								In another directive, the Shivraj Singh Chauhan regime has also banned buffalo fights, saying they are cruel to the animals, though some residents insist they cant abandon the age-old post-Diwali tradition.																								But its the ban on beards in jail that has angered many.																								Muslim clerics in Bhopal mosques have slammed the move as a humiliation for prisoners. In fact, the city is abuzz with rumours that beards of some Muslim prisoners have been forcibly shaved.																								Bhopal Central Jail superintendent P.D. Somkunwar confirmed that beards of a few undertrials were shaved off after they were sent to the jail so that the identity of these criminals could be tallied with pictures in police records.																								The state minorities commission headed by BJP leader Anwar Mohammad Khan, however, said all those responsible for discrimination would be penalised. A buffalo fight in progress. The fights are organised two days after Diwali on Govardhan puja as a tribute to Krishna																								Anwar said the matter would be investigated for further action. We will send a team inside the jail to get a first-hand account and then act upon it.																								City qazi Abdul Latif said the ban went against religious freedom. It is also against the established norms of civility and decency, he said, adding that a delegation of Muslims would call on governor Balram Jakhar to seek redress.																								A prominent citizen, Pandit Vinod Gautam, called the jail diktat erroneous. He said according to Hindu shastras, even emperors and kings couldnt force anyone to shave their beard. This measure will have to be withdrawn, he added.																								The Congress, the main opposition party, remained mum, but Samajwadi Party leader Rajesh Chanal said he would launch a movement to protest against the treatment meted out to prisoners in the Central Jail.																								The ban on buffalo fights couldnt stop thousands from turning up at a local ground in Kaetha village.																								Shyam Lal Yadav, a resident, made light of the government order. This is part of our festivities and we enjoy it. Maybe its wrong, but since its an age-old tradition, we cant abandon it, he said.																								Ujjain collector Shiv Shankar Shukla said such fights were illegal under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.																								The fights, two days after Diwali, are held to mark Govardhan puja as a tribute to Krishna.																								According to legend, Krishna lifted Mount Govardhan on this day. So people make cow dung replicas of the fabled mound, decorate it with flower petals and offer prayers.																								In cities like Bhopal, Ujjain, Gwalior and Jabalpur, decked-up buffaloes, with painted horns and feathers, are pitted against each other. The buffalo that manages to send its rival out of a marked area is declared the winner and its owner is given a cash prize, which ranges between Rs 10,000 and Rs 1 lakh.																								Milk traders, who organise these fights, said the buffaloes are given rich food, lots of butter, milk and sometimes alcohol to enrage them. They are also fed dry fruits and nuts before they are led to the ring.

 The Buzz in Big Cities 
				 																Wear formals or quit test midway				 																																																										As far as dressing-downs go, this one could rank among the harshest.				 																																																										Students of a private technical institute were recently asked to leave their examination papers midway because they werent attired in formal clothes. In protest, those who were dressed right joined the group of 150 ordered out of the examination hall at KJ Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology.				 																																																										College authorities claimed the students had been told a week in advance to wear formals for the exam, a mid-term test whose scores will influence the annual grades.				 																																																										But some pupils said T-shirts were worn on the first day of the exams but no action was taken. We wore T-shirts as it is more convenient, said Deepa, a second-year student.				 																																																										Kiran, who also had to leave her papers unfinished, said the order was unfair. How can the college debar students from an exam because they wore T-shirts? Principal R. K. Parmar denied the crackdown, and claimed no exams were being held. He did say, though, students were being asked not to wear skin-tight clothes. 				 																TV off, paintings on				 																																																										The cold, steel television set that occupies your living space can now turn into a piece of art  it can pass off as a painting during the time when it is switched off.				 																																																										Japanese electronics giant Hitachi recently held a unique exhibition in the capital, where works of renowned painters were displayed on high-resolution TV screens. 				 																																																										Niren Sengupta, for instance, presented his Chromatic Splendour series, while Manav Gupta showcased paintings from his Metaphor of Dreams collection. The televisions work like any other TV when they are being used.				 																																																										Once the TV is switched off, the screen of the plasma and LCD televisions coalesce into paintings. Users can select from a wide range of collections. To top it all, they have the pleasure of being able to upload their own artwork.				 																Irrigation plans adrift				 																																																										The Andhra governments multi-crore irrigation projects are in choppy waters with little of the promised gains likely to flow anytime over the next three to five years.				 																																																										The Jalaygnam scheme, meant to benefit 12 lakh acres at a cost of Rs 24,000 crore, has reached only 8 lakh acres so far  but has already soaked up Rs 32,000 crore. The bulk of that money has been paid to contractors.				 																																																										Irrigation minister Ponnala Lakshmaiah has defended the delays and extra costs by arguing that such problems arent unusual in big plans. The scheme is to be completed before 2009, when the YSR regimes term ends.				 																																																										Mega irrigation projects around the world are completed in five to 10 years. The medium ones take over three to five. Projects of such massive nature have costs shooting up by up to 200 per cent, the minister said.				 																																																										But officials in the irrigation department said only 20 of the 51 projects taken up under Jalayagnam were near completion. That would mean a figure of 40 per cent.				 																Rule respite				 																																																										Two basic amenities will reach many in the capital more easily.				 																																																										The Delhi government, with an eye on next years polls, has done away with the need for income certificates to get a ration card and for admission in its schools. 				 																																																										A self-certified income statement, attested by a notary of a court within the city, will be enough for the twin purposes. The rules have been relaxed to ensure that the benefits of government schemes reach most people.				 																																																	Delhi: Take a look at some of the finest upcoming theatre artistes at the annual Rajpal Memorial series at St Stephens College. The festival will consist of a competition between teams from colleges across the country. The college is on Mall Road, not far from the metro station.

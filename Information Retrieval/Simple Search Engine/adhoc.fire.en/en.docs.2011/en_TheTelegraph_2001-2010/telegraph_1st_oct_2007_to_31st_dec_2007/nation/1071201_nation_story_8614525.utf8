				 Woman abuse finger at father
 MUZAFFAR RAINA																								Srinagar, Nov. 30: A former Miss Jammu has had her father arrested on the charge of sexually harassing her.																								The woman had won the crown in 2005, four years after Anara Gupta  the beauty queen who was drawn into a porn film controversy before being cleared by forensic experts.																								BSF constable Vinod Kumar had two years ago lodged a complaint saying his daughter had gone missing.																								She was found on Monday by police at a house in Delhi but has told a Jammu court she was married to a man in the capital.																								Her statement was recorded in the court in which she alleged sexual harassment by her father. The court directed us to arrest him and he has been lodged at Domanna police station, Jammu police chief Parminder Singh said.																								The woman said she had left for Delhi to pursue a career in modelling after winning the pageant, and her father had accompanied her. We had relatives in Delhi but he booked a room in a hotel, she said.																								I was shocked when one day my father tried to make advances. I resisted but could not tell anyone because of the stigma. He was adamant (about maintaining) a relationship, threatening he would tell people that I was involved in (the) flesh trade. Later, she moved in with her relatives while Kumar returned to Jammu and filed the complaint.

				 Fever scare in Digha
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, Dec. 3: The next time in Digha, you may find yourself gazing at the night sea through a mosquito net.																								An outbreak of chikungunya in the villages adjoining the beach town has sent hotel owners into a tizzy ahead of the winter rush.																								The administration has said there is no need for panic, but the local hoteliers association has asked owners to take immediate steps  check mosquito breeding on hotel premises and ensure guests use mosquito nets or repellents. 																								The Aedes aegypti mosquito spreads chikungunya. Its symptoms include high fever and incapacitating joint pain. 																								We have instructed every hotel to maintain cleanliness strictly and prevent accumulation of water. All guests should use mosquito nets or repellents, said Girish Raut of the Digha Hoteliers Association.																								About 100 cases with symptoms similar to chikungunyas have been found in the past fortnight in a dozen villages under three panchayats  Padima I, Padima II and Basantapur. Digha falls under Padima I, 250km from Calcutta.																								The assistant chief medical officer of Contai, R.N. Misra, said 29 blood samples were tested for chikungunya at the School of Tropical Medicine. Five tested positive. We have sent more samples to the STM and are awaiting reports.

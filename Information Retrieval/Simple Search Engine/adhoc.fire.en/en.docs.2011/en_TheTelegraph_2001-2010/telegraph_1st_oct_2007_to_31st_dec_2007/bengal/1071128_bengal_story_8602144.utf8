				 Police, people end hill bandh
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 celebrating: A bazaar in Kurseong on Tuesday. Picture by Vivek Singh																								Darjeeling, Nov. 27: The GNLF has decided to end its indefinite shutdown tomorrow, five days after crippling the hills. 																								A police case against Bimal Gurung, who broke away from the GNLF to launch his own outfit, in connection with the attack on a GNLF leader on Friday and the arrest of some of his men was the official reason for the decision.																								Seventeen people have been arrested. A case has been registered against Bimal Gurung. That is why we withdrew the strike, said A.R. Dewan, the general secretary of the GNLFs Darjeeling branch committee. 																								Sensing the peoples res- entment against bandhs, the GNLF announced a six-hour breather yesterday for people to buy daily necessities. But no vehicles were allowed to ply.																								More than 1,000 Darjeeling residents took to the streets in a silent procession today with a cry for peace.																								Many of them turned up spontaneously as only two posters announcing the event had been put up in town last evening.																								No one gets a gallantry award for threatening people, said one placard.																								The students of North Po- int School were part of the rally, as were some leaders from the GNLF and the Morcha. 																								One of the main organisers of the rally, lawyer B.K. Pradhan, said: On Friday, I was trying to go to an Internet cafe and see whether my sons Delhi-Bagdogra ticket had been confirmed. Suddenly everything shut down and things were in disarray. 																								The bandh was called after about 25 people allegedly owing allegiance to the new Gorkha Janmukti Morcha attacked Kul Bahadur Gurung with khukuris on Friday.																								Roshan Kant Ghisingh, a businessman, said: We thought something had to be done to stop this senselessness. 																								Rajiv Thapa, a Class X student who walked from Chowrastha to Chowk Bazaar with his family, said he was excited to be part of the march. Who wants violence? We saw many people joining the rally today and came out on the streets.

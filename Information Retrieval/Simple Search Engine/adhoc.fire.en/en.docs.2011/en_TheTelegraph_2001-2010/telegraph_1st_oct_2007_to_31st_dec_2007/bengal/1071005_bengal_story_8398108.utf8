				 Constables caught with pants down
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 4: Two constables allegedly tried to rape a 35-year-old housewife in South 24-Parganas late last night while she was asleep with her three children.																								Her husband, a fisherman, was away when the cops landed up at her home in Kultalis Paschimgachhtala, 90km from here, around 11pm and said they wanted to carry out a search. 																								They barged in when she opened the door and attacked her.																								The woman raised the alarm, waking up her children  aged between two and 6  who began screaming in horror. Their neighbours came rushing and chased the constables out of the house. 																								The two ran to the nearby Shikarihat police camp, with the villagers, armed with lathis and iron rods, at their heels.																								The villagers gheraoed the police camp, about 4km from Kultali police station, demanding that the constables be arrested immediately. The gherao continued till this evening, when a large police contingent went to the camp and rescued the duo.																								The constables have been suspended from Kultali police station till the inquiry is over.																								Local legislator Joykrishna Haldar of the SUCI said strict action should be taken against the constables. 																								The villagers were justified in demanding their arrest. I think if proper steps are taken against the two, then policemen will not dare commit such crimes in future.																								The police have brought the woman to MR Bangur Hospital in Calcutta for medical examination.

Nijjar that the apex court had on September 12 held that the Punjab government had no right to acquire agricultural land on the plea that private industries would be set up in public interest.																								Nijjar said he was not aware of the ruling. 																								As the judgment is yet to be delivered, we could request for permission to move a fresh application, Ray said.

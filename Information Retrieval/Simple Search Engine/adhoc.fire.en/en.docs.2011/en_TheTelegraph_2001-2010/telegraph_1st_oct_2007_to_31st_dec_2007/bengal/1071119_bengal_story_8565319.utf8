				 Mamata wants a govt led by RSP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 18: Mamata Banerjee today called on the RSP to form a government in Bengal minus the killer CPM and received a snub from the Left Front partner. 																								We have no problem if the RSP forms the government here, keeping the killer CPM out. We are ready to collaborate with the Left Front constituent on all matters, the Trinamul Congress chief told a rally in Tollygunge tonight. 																								The RSP, which has 20 legislators in the 294-member Assembly, said her remarks have no relevance for us.																								Trinamul is a Rightist force and we cannot have any links with Mamatas party. That is why her observations have no relevance for us, PWD minister and RSP leader Kshiti Goswami said.																								Goswami, however, stuck to his decision to resign from the cabinet in protest against the CPMs armed recapture of Nandigram villages.																								His party will discuss the resignation at a state committee meeting on November 29. 																								Goswami, who has begun a move to build public opinion against the CPM over Nandigram, was today cold-shouldered by poet-scholar Sankha Ghosh, whom he requested to speak at a rally.																								Ghosh had joined the peoples march last week against the violence.																								Accompanied by fellow party leader Manoj Bhattacharya, the minister called on Ghosh this morning on behalf of the Sanskriti Parishad. 																								We requested him to speak from our platform. He declined, Goswami said. 																								Ghosh tonight said it was not possible, without clarifying further.

				 Subject focus in SSC revision
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 5: Marks distribution in the school service examination is being revised with the focus more on the subject which a candidate wants to teach.																								Candidates will have to answer questions for 60 marks in the subject. The full marks for this paper was 40 till last year, said Ranajit Basu, the chairman of the West Bengal School Service Commission.																								All the changes, the first since the commission was established in 1998, will come into effect this year. 																								Basu today announced the date for the 2007 test December 23. 																								Nearly 10,000 teachers for over 14,000 state-aided Madhyamik schools will be recruited. 																								The marks for general knowledge in the written paper have been halved from 20. 																								Many candidates were clearing the exam by scoring a full 20 in GK. These candidates often did not turn out to be good teachers, said Basu.																								The value of academic scores  a candidates performance in the school-leaving, graduation and post-graduation examinations  is also being reduced from 30 to 25.																								The written test is aimed at examining the candidates depth of knowledge in the subject they want to teach. We also examine their ability to teach the subject during the interview. So, less weightage can be given to results, Basu said.																								A candidate who has a first class in masters will be awarded an additional five marks. Similarly, an extra six will be given to candidates with first-class marks in graduation.

				 Ration check
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 18: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta today said the food department would issue a notification after the Pujas for periodic inspection of ration shops to ensure regular supply of foodgrain.																								A directive will be issued for spot inspection of ration shops on a regular basis so that rice and wheat can be made available to the people. The Centre has drastically reduced the supply of foodgrain but our government is trying its best to strengthen the public distribution system. There is a need to instil confidence in the public that the government wants ration shops to deliver, Dasgupta said after a meeting with food minister Paresh Adhikary at Writers Buildings.																								Food inspectors will be asked to take along block development officers or panchayat representatives. This system of inspecting ration shops is needed to prevent hoarding and check prices of grains in the open market. Transport will be provided to the food inspectors, the minister said.																								There are about 60 ration shops in each of the 341 blocks across the state. 																								The government directive comes in the wake of attacks on ration dealers over the past month for allegedly selling grains in the black market.

				 Lawyers put Biman in dock
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 22: Biman Bose is likely to be charged in yet another contempt case for criticising judges of Calcutta High Court after the Nandigram ruling.																								Addressing a rally last week, the Left Front chairman had said that judges seemed to be ruling the country. In that case, raising judges salaries would ensure the functioning of democracy, he had fumed after the high court termed the March 14 firing in Nandigram unconstitutional. 																								The court has agreed to hear a petition filed by the Bar Association and all bodies of high court lawyers on Monday.																								The petition also names Boses party colleague Benoy Konar.																								Two leaders had attacked the judiciary and judges of this court in a public meeting and used abusive and filthy language about judges. The lawyers of this court are feeling insulted. They want the accused leaders to be issued with contempt notices, advocate Shaktinath Mukherjee said.																								The advocate added that television clips and newspaper reports would be produced as documentary evidence. The media would be made parties to the case, Mukherjee said.																								Before this, the Left Front chairman had twice incurred the wrath of the judiciary. Calcutta High Court had awarded him three months in jail and fined him Rs 2,000 for slamming Justice Amitava Lala after he imposed restrictions on weekday rallies in 2003. Boses appeal is pending in the Supreme Court.																								In 2000, the front boss had said in a public meeting that judgments could be bought with suitcases full of money. He was fined by the metropolitan magistrates court.

				 City dealers under glare
 BARUN GHOSH																								Calcutta, Oct. 5: Stung in the districts, the government has launched a crackdown on corrupt ration dealers in Calcutta.																								The licences of 38 who have shops in and around the city have been suspended in the past few days. Seven licences were cancelled and security deposits of nine forfeited.																								Biswambhar Basu, the general secretary of the All India Fair Price Shop Dealers Federation, who led a delegation to the food minister yesterday protesting against the attack on dealers in the districts, was among those suspended.																								They were accused of selling foodgrain meant for public distribution in the black market. A probe is on, director of rationing Dipak Ghosh told The Telegraph.																								Food inspectors detected various irregularities during raids conducted in the past fortnight. Basu was charged with fudging the number of cardholders. About 11,000 people collect foodgrain from his three shops at Baishakhi, CK Market and Nayapatti in Salt Lake, a food department official said.																								The shop owners cannot run their business during suspension. We are yet to get replies to the showcause notices served on them. If we arent satisfied with the replies, criminal cases might be started against them, Ghosh said.																								Ration dealers have been reminded that there should not be any discrepancy between the stock in hand and the display boards. They should also be open on all days but Monday.

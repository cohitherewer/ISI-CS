				 Hills shut, school parents in trouble
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 A girl waits for her school bus with her mother in Darjeeling town. Telegraph picture																								Darjeeling, Nov. 25: The GNLF has refused to end its indefinite bandh in the hills, putting in despair, among others, parents of children in residential schools who return home for a long winter vacation this time of the year.																								We will carry on with our shutdown unless Bimal Gurung and those involved in Fridays khukri attack on (GNLF leader) Kul Bahadur Gurung are held, said the partys Darjeeling branch president, Deepak Gurung. 																								Expelled GNLF leader Bimal Gurung, who had floated the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha last month, has denied any role by his party in the attack. 																								Praveen Choudary of Kakkarvitta, a border town in Nepal, was on his way to Darjeeling to take his son home from Mount Hermon School.																								GNLF supporters stopped his hired van at Dilaram, around 10km from Kurseong, and damaged it. 																								I had heard that schoolchildren and their parents would be left out of the purview of the bandh. Now I dont know what to do, Choudary said over the phone from Dilaram.																								In the afternoon, he was told to return to Siliguri without his son. 																								Nearly 200 guardians from various places were stuck at Kurseong motor stand till late in the afternoon. 																								Police hired four vehicles to send around 40 of them (some with their children) to Siliguri. A few others started walking downhill. 																								There are around 15 residential schools in Kurseong  some of which are still holding their annual exams  with no less than 2,000 boarders. 																								Unlike in Kurseong, most students are still taking their tests in Darjeeling. Many schools have put off exams.																								Some, like Victoria Boys School, Kurseong, finished early. Its principal, Jayanta Pal, said six of the 200-odd boarders were yet to leave their hostel. We will wait for their parents till tomorrow. Then we will hold a meeting with the district administration and GNLF leaders, he said.																								In Darjeeling, Deepak Gurung refused to leave schools out of the purview of the general strike. 																								The stand-off between the GNLF and the Janmukti Morcha was expected after the bill on Darjeelings Sixth Schedule status was included in Parliaments winter list of business. The Morcha is against the special status, a GNLF trump card, and has been trying to garner support for a separate Gorkhaland.																								The unrest has hit tourism hard. There is not a single tourist in our hotel today. Bookings for December have been cancelled, said a hotel owner.																								Several hundred tourists have been escorted to Siliguri from Sikkim and the Darjeeling hills in the past few days.

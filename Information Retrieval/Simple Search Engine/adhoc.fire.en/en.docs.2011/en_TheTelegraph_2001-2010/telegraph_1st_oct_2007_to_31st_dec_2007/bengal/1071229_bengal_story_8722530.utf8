				 Sorry and sweets after slap in face

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Krishnagar, Dec. 28: An official who had asked war hero Atul Haldar to get out went to his house today with an apology. 
																								Block development officer Dilip Ghosh brought the 78-year-old man to his office, offered him a seat, sweets and the life certificate that the babu had denied him earlier.
																								The Telegraph reported the old mans humiliation two days ago.
																								I apologise. I should not have misbehaved when you had dropped in at my office for the certificate last week. I was preoccupied with other work, Ghosh told Haldar with folded hands this morning.
																								The certificate of being alive was a must for Haldar to get the war heros pension of Rs 100 a month. For the former fisherman who lives in penury even that paltry sum means a lot.
																								Nadia district magistrate Onkar Singh Meena said: I had asked the Krishnagunj BDO to visit Haldars house and apologise for his behaviour. 
																								This was Haldars second brush with insensitive government offices. His pension, which went up from Rs 15 to 100 a month over the years, was stopped earlier because he did not have a bank account. An unlettered Haldar neither had the money nor the ability to fill in forms to open the account.
																								Ghosh had asked Haldar if the old man thought he was important enough to deserve the certificate. He was told to get out when he showed the Government of India citation acknowledging his valour.
																								He had got the Shaurya Chakra for saving 150 soldiers and military equipment on the raging Ichhamati during the 1965 war with Pakistan.
																								When Ghosh folded his hands and stooped at Naghata village, about 110km from Calcutta, Haldar embraced him, tears in his eyes. 
																								He offered tea and biscuits to the BDO.
																								In the car, Ghoshbabu said sorry again and requested me to forget and forgive his rude behaviour, Haldar said today.
																								Humble after a rap from his boss, the BDO said: Alls well that ends well.

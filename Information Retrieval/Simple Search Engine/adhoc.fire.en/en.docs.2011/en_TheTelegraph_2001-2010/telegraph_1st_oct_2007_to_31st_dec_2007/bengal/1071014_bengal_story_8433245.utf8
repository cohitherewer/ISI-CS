				 Hikers feared dead
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Srinagar, Oct. 13: Three mountain hikers from Bengal who went missing during an expedition in Leh are feared dead. 																								An eight-member team from Uttar Bantra Club in Howrah was caught in a blizzard at the 18,300-feet Parang La (pass) on Tuesday. 																								Five injured hikers were rescued the day after, but not Bhaskar Banerjee, 53, of Salt Lake, and Amal Dhara, 37, and Biswanath Ghosh from Howrah. They were on their way to the Tsomori lake, which is at a higher reach.																								Leh police chief Alok Kumar said helicopters had loc- ated three bodies on the ridgeline of Parang La, where the trio had gone missing. An operation has been launched from both Leh and Khewer in Himachal Pradesh to retrieve the bodies. We cant say they are those of the missing men unless they are identified.																								It will take the Leh authorities three to four days to reach the spot, but the Himachal team might make it earlier. 																								Kumar said choppers cannot be used to retrieve the bodies for technical reasons. 																								Parang La is 120km from Karjok, from where the rescue team was dispatched. There is no road from Karjok to the pass and the team has to scale an 8km glacier en route. The trek from Himachal is relatively easy.

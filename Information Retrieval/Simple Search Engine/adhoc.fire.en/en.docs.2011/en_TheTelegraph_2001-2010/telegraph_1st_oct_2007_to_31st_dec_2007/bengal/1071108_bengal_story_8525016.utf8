				 Home lost, line for rice and dal
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Homecoming for some: CPM supporters return to Satengabari. Telegraph picture																								Nandigram, Nov. 7: About 1,000 people have taken shelter at Nandigram High School since yesterday. 																								The Pratirodh Committee has started a gruel kitchen that serves rice, dal, alur dum and boiled potatoes. 																								Standing in a serpentine queue for lunch with a plate was Anima Adak, 44, who became a refugee for the second time in a week.																								Anima fled her home in Ranichowk with her husband Chittaranjan, 55, son and daughter last week and took shelter at a camp in Brindabanchowk. The CPM attacked Brindabanchowk yesterday and they had to flee again.																								Theres so much uncertainty and confusion. We do not know whether we will return home again, she said, run- ning a dirty finger over an enamelled aluminium plate.																								Committee leaders said some 5,000 people were housed in five schools in and around Nandigram town. Weve approached our friends for donations. Many have promised foodgrain and vegetables. But for how long? asked Abu Taher.																								Mir Mahim Ali, 55, of Satengabari sat at the high school with a blank expression. His grocery and tiled house were looted yesterday.																								The CPM had attacked the village twice earlier, but couldnt capture it. We couldnt cope with the ferocity of yesterdays attack, he said.

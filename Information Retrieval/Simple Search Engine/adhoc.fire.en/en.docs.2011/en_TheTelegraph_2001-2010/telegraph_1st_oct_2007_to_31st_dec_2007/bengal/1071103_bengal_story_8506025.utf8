				 Shield, after Nithari notice
																								Behrampore/Calcutta, Nov. 2: Five police personnel were today deployed at the house of Bandana Sarkar, who had alleged that her husband, a key witness in the Nithari killings case, had been murdered.																								The police team, led by assistant sub-inspector Nityagopal Haldar, escorted Bandana, her son Sonu and his wife Champa to Delhi, where she went in connection with the case in the Supreme Court. 																								We need to be in Delhi in connection with the case, said Bandana.																								Bengal polices role came under the scanner as it refused to accept an FIR after Jatin Sarkars body was found in the Bhagirathi in Murshidabad two months ago and his wife alleged foul play. The apex court sought the state home secretarys explanation for the refusal to register the FIR.																								The FIR was registered last evening, hours after the court issued the notice on a petition from Bandana. 																								Sarkar died on September 1, days before he was to depose in court against Maninder Singh Pandher, from whose Noida house 19 skulls were found.

				 CU rethink on review bar
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 14: Calcutta University is considering a proposal to bend its review rules for students of the 2007 economics MSc Part I examinations. 																								The students have been boycotting classes and demonstrating on the universitys BT Road campus since Thursday, protesting against unexpectedly poor results.																								They want the authorities to review the answer scripts of all four papers. According to the rules, examinees can apply for review in two papers.																								Over 65 per cent of the examinees have scored below 55 per cent, which is unusual, the students said.																								The authorities are mulling a special permission to the examinees to seek the review of four papers.																								We are aware of the stud-ents grievances. But well take a decision on reviewing four papers only after they lodge a written complaint with the examination department, said .S. Adhikary, CUs controller of examinations.																								Nearly 200 students sat for the economics MSc Part I exams. 																								According to Adhikary, a preliminary probe has revealed no substantial change in this years results. However, those not happy with their marks have been told to seek the special review on Monday.																								Well have to tally this years results with the students performance in the past few years. We will take the final decision on bending the review rules temporarily for this years economics students only if we find there is a substantial difference. 																								However, a series of protests by students has left the universitys economics campus at Kantakol in north Calcutta tense. 																								We were stunned to see our marks. Most of us got less than 55 per cent. It was unexpectedly poor, said a second-year student who got 52 per cent. 																								The students said 55 per cent was an extremely low score in a subject like economics where several papers are math-centric and high scoring.																								Most economics students want to be in academics or go for teaching jobs in colleges and universities. Those who have scored less than 55 per cent marks will not be able to pursue a career in any of the above areas, a student said.																								The cut-off for tests for teaching posts and research fellowships is usually 55 per cent. In such a situation, the authorities will have to review four papers, another student said.																								The university had bowed to students pressure once in 2001 and allowed review of all four BA Part I papers. 																								Students of reputable colleges like Presidency had then complained of unexpectedly poor results in political science and history.

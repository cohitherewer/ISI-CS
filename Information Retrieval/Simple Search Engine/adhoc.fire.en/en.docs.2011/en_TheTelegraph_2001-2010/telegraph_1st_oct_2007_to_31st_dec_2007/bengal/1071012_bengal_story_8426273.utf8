				 Hiss! its a python in the kitchen 
				 	 (Top) Forest workers with a python captured from a kitchen in a Nadia village and (above) the reptile in a cage.(Telegraph pictures) 																								Kartik Sarkar, a 40-year-old farmer from Sukhpur village, about 130km from Calcutta, spotted the 12-feet python coiled around his mud oven, its head up, on Wednesday evening. 																								Alerted by his scream, neighbours rushed to his house. 																								They cordoned off the entire cluster of huts in our area and dragged people out. The villagers also began inspecting their own kitchens, Sarkar said. 																								Officials from the nearby Bethuadahari Reserve Forest were informed and they arrived a few hours later. The officials used a long nylon rope to catch the python. 																								Forest officer J.N. Mondal said the python, which weighed about 55 kg, could have slithered in from Bethuadahari along with the floodwaters. 																								The Bhagirathi river spilled its banks during the September deluge. The python most probably came with the floodwaters.																								The officials took the snake to the forest on Thursday morning and set it free. 																								Bethuadahari has about 30 pythons. But most of them are about 7 to 8 feet long, an official said.

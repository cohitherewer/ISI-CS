				 Dealers surrender licence
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 22: Hundreds of ration dealers across Bengal surrendered their licences today and many pledged to do so in the next few days if the government did not heed their demand for security. 																								The SUCI has called a 12-hour bandh on October 30 in protest against corruption in the public distribution system and to demand the immediate arrest of Rizwanur Rahmans father-in-law Ashok Todi.																								Hasanullah Laskar, the state secretary of the dealers association, said around 6,000 of the 20,370 ration shop owners in the state have surrendered their licences, protesting against the governments failure to protect them from villagers looting and burning shops.																								Despite a promise by food minister Paresh Adhikary to provide us security to run our shops at a meeting on October 5, our members continue to be attacked. We are left with no option but to surrender our licences, Laskar said. 																								The food minister has called an emergency meeting with ration dealers tomorrow. 																								Some dealers have surrendered licences, but the attacks are on the wane, said Joydeb Saha, the director of district distribution, procurement and supplies.

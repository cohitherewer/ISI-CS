				 Border clamp for polls in Bhutan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Jaigaon, Dec. 30: The India-Bhutan border was sealed for 36 hours this afternoon as preparations began for elections to Bhutans first National Council (the upper house). 
																								The gate between the towns of Phuentsholing (in Bhutan) and Jaigaon was shut at 5.30pm, cutting off vehicular traffic between the two countries. 
																								Prohibitory orders under Section 144 have been imposed in the area between Netaji Subhas Road and Shakti Range, said Jaigaon police station officer-in-charge Achinta Gupta. 
																								A national holiday has been declared in the 15 districts going to the polls tomorrow as the hill kingdom takes its first steps towards democracy.
																								In the five remaining districts of Thimphu, Haa, Gasa, Lhuntse and Trashiyangtse, the elections would be held on January 29.
																								The elections have been deferred in the five districts because they had only one nomination each, the chief election commissioner of Bhutan, Kunzang Wangdi, told The Telegraph over the phone. 
																								More candidates were expected to join the fray before January 29, Wangdi added.
																								In the first phase, 43 contestants would fight for 15 seats. The king would nominate five members of the council. 
																								The chairperson of the council would either be nominated by the king or by the elected councillors, Wangdi said.
																								Many tourists on their way to Bhutan were stranded in Jaigaon today as the border shutdown caught them by surprise.

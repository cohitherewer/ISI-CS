				 Langur slap kills 15-year-old
 OUR CORRESPONDENTKrishnagar, Oct. 31: A teenager has died of internal bleeding after being slapped by a langur (hanuman) in Nadias Krishnagunj yesterday.																								Rana Ghosh, 15, was attacked on an Arjuna tree, which he had climbed for firewood. 																								The boy jumped from the tree and tried to flee along with a friend, but the langur, about four feet tall, chased him down around 3pm.																								Sukdeb said: The monkey pounced on Rana. I saw it overpower him and slap him repeatedly from behind a tree. 																								The Class VIII boy ran to Ranas house and told his parents what had happened.																								Ranas father Brindaban, a farmer, who had returned home for lunch, found him lying unconscious, with bruises on his face and ears.																								The boy was taken to Krishnagunj hospital around 3.30. He died a few hours later, after being shifted to Shaktinagar district hospital in Krishnagar, about 30km away. 																								The apparent cause of death was internal haemorrhage, said Jayanta Saha, a doctor who attended him. 																								A forest department official said the langur must have thought Rana was about to launch an attack. He was climbing the tree with a dagger to chop a branch.																								It is not easy for the poor to buy coal or kerosene regularly. So I needed the wood, said Ranas mother Manju.																								The father and son were returning home together when Rana remembered his mother had asked for wood. Hanumans always pose a problem for children on the road, Brindaban said, sobbing.																								The one that killed my son is the gang leader. It has big claws, he said. 																								ENT surgeon A.K. Basumallick said: A slap from such a big monkey can damage the eardrum and break a chain of tiny bones in the ear. 																								The body has been sent for post-mortem. Well ask the forest department to capture the monkey, said Santanu Bose, the officer-in-charge of Krishnagunj police station.

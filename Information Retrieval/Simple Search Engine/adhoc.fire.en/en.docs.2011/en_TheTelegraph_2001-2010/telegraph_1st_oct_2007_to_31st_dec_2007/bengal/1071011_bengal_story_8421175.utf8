				 Diversion doublespeak
 SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY New Delhi, Oct. 10: The  Bengal government had told the Supreme Court that there  was no truth in the claim that grain meant for the public  distribution system (PDS) were being diverted to the open  market.																								The states of Assam and West Bengal have denied the allegations and have submitted that all possible measures have been adopted to ensure that foodgrain reach the intended beneficiaries, the apex court had said on Friday.																								The court did not say when the state government filed the affidavit but officials and the Bengal food minister have been citing hoarding meant for diversion to the black market as one of the reasons for the ration riots.																								Ration dealers accused of hoarding grain have been under attack across Bengal and the government has launched a crackdown on corrupt shop owners.																								The Supreme Court ruling came on a PIL alleging an alarming increase in the diversion of PDS grain. 																								Filed by the Uttar Pradesh Roller Flour Mills Association, the petition claimed that highly subsidised wheat supplied by the Centre was being diverted to rolling flour mills in different states. 																								The petitioners had named Bengal, Assam and the northeastern states. Citing newspaper reports, they claimed that grain worth over Rs 30,000 crore had been siphoned off from the PDS. 																								Disposing of the matter, the apex court issued several directives to ensure the grain reach the intended beneficiaries. 																								The court asked gram panchayats and local bodies to assess the need for wheat and inform the state. 																								They should also find out the quantum of wheat to be converted into flour and tell the mills which should supply to fair price shops at rates fixed by the state governments, the court said. 																								Food minister Paresh Adhikary said he would have to do detailed homework on the Supreme Court order before taking a decision on how to involve gram panchayats.

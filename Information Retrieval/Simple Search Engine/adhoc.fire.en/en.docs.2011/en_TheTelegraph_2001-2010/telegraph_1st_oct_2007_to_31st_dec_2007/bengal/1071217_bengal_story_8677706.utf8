				 Cheating rap on 103

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Calcutta, Dec. 16: The West Bengal University of Technology has barred 103 students of Kalyanis JIS College of Engineering from their exams for a year for copying during a semester test.
																								A team of university officials, on inspection duty at the private engineering college, had caught the students cheating on December 5, the first day of the exam.
																								They were not in the seats allotted by the university, the WBUT authorities said. When the WBUT team told the examinees to stop copying and sit in their allotted seats, they allegedly refused and also manhandled the officials. 
																								We are investigating how the students were allowed to indulge in such malpractice in the examination hall, said Ashok Ranjan Thakur, the WBUT vice-chancellor. 
																								The incident prompted the university to shift the exam centre from JIS College the next day. Nearly 1,400 students of the college will now have to sit the test at the State Book Board office in Salt Lake, nearly 30km from Kalyani.
																								The university is firm in its decision to run a transparent examination system. Stern action will be taken against students if they are found adopting unfair means during examinations, Thakur said.
																								The vice-chancellor, however, admitted that the students alone could not be blamed as there were loopholes in the way private engineering colleges conducted their exams.
																								We cannot deny the colleges weaknesses. We are trying our best to address the problem, he added.
																								Many of the debarred students are in their BTech final year and some are pursuing an MBA course. Most of them have already bagged high-paying jobs in companies like Infosys and TCS.
																								The examinees have apologised in writing, but sources in the university said they would still be punished.
																								Students of a private engineering college like ours are required to fork out a huge amount every year (a minimum of Rs 43,000). We understand the inconvenience caused to those debarred from sitting the examination, especially their guardians who have spent so much. But we will not support unfair practice during examinations, said Asit Guha, the principal of JIS College.

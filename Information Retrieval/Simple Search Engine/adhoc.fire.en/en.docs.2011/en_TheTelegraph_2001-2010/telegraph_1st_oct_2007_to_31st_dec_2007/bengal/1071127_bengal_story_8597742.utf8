				 CPM leaders give the slip
																								Midnapore, Nov. 26: CBI officers who came here today to question two massacre accused CPM leaders saw them groaning in pain and being taken to hospital.																								Tapan Ghosh and Sukur Ali, whom the CBI had proclaimed absconders in the Chhoto Angaria case, were caught by a Trinamul Congress mob on the night of November 10, allegedly while leaving Nandigram. 																								A CBI team led by inspector K.C. Biswal today petitioned the chief judicial magistrate here to allow it to interrogate the duo. It was 1pm by the time the CJM granted the permission.																								Tapan Ghosh started feeling pain in his chest and stomach and Sukur Ali started having breathing problems, a jail source said. 																								Selim Naskar, the dacoit believed to have been recruited by the CPM for Operation Nandigram, has been remanded in five days CID custody by a Haldia court.

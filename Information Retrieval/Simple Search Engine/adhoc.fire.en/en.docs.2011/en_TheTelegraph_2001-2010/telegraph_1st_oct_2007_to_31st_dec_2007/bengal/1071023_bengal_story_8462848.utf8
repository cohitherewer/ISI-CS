				 Rape and murder on idol route 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore Oct. 22: A 15-year-old girl who took Rs 10 from her mother to go and watch immersion processions was raped and killed on the outskirts of this town last night.																								Shilpi Sarkars body was found without clothes in a field at Banjetia. There were bruises on her forehead and chest and blood on the ground. Her underclothes were wrapped around her throat.																								It appears she was gang raped and strangled to death, said the inspector-in-charge of Behrampore police station, Dilip Ganguly.																								It could also be a murder for revenge, the police added.																								The daughter of a labourer who built pandals for the festival, Shilpi went out with sisters Ratna and Swapna last evening. The three came back after some time and my elder daughters went to the houses where they worked as maids. Shilpi took Rs 10 from me and went out to see the processions again. That is the last time I saw her, said mother Renu.																								From the brutality of the crime, it appears that someone took revenge, the inspector said.																								The police have informed Shilpis father Kalipada, who is in Hyderabad, working on a Kali Puja pandal there.

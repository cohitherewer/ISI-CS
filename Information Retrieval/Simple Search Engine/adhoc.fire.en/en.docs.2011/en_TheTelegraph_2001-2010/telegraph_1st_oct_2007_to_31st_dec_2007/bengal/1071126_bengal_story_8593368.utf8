				 Riot leader refused bail
				 	 Idris Ali on way to court. Picture by Amit Datta																								Calcutta, Nov. 25: All India Minority Forum president Idris Ali has been remanded in police custody till November 28 and 29 by two courts in connection with Wednesdays street riots here. 																								Ali, who has been expelled from the Congress in the wake of the violence and his defence of the movement, was arrested last evening on charges of attempt to murder, rioting, causing injury to police and public and damaging property. 																								He was first taken to Bankshall Court from the lock-up at the Lalbazar police headquarters and then to the Sealdah court as cases had been lodged against him at several police stations.																								Members of the Congress-backed minority forum and the Milli Ittehad Parishad, an umbrella association of 12 Muslim organisations, demonstrated outside the court premises. They shouted slogans against Taslima and demanded Alis release.																								Both courts rejected his bail pleas.																								Congress leader Somen Mitra ruled out shielding the expelled leader, but blamed CPM supporters for the rioting. Entally, which was the worst hit, is a CPM stronghold. The party has an MP, an MLA and even a councillor from there. I want the police to arrest the CPM supporters also, he said.

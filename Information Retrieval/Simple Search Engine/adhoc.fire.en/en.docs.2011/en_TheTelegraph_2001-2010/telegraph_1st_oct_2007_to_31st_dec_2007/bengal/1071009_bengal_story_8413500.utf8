				 Govt sees criminals in fury
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Police vehicles ablaze at Panchgram in Murshidabad. Telegraph picture																								Oct. 8: Police today fired at a mob in Murshidabad that torched houses belonging to a ration dealer and his family and four police vehicles. 																								Armed with sticks, swords, rods and revolvers, the Panchgram residents fought police and locked up six personnel inside ration dealer Moinuddin Mondals house before setting it on fire. The policemen fired to disperse the mob, broke open a door and fled.																								Home secretary P.R. Ray said criminals have joined villagers in the protests. We will arrange police protection for the dealers, he said at Writers Buildings after a meeting with the chief minister.																								IG (law and order) Raj Kanojia said district magistrates have been asked to ensure security for the dealers. Arrangements are being made to telecast over local cable channels the decision to arrest those attacking the dealers.																								Around 6am, hundreds of villagers marched to Moinuddins house, about 230km from Calcutta, dragged him to a kangaroo court and demanded Rs 6,000 for every cardholder. 																								A bargain was struck at Rs 2,000 for each of the 150 families in the village. Moinuddin paid Rs 1 lakh and promised to pay the rest later.																								The policemen who were locked up came from Nabagram police station, 8km away, to rescue Moinuddin.																								The police reached around 9, angering the mob further. Moinuddin, 48, and his father Mosahar, 75, were beaten up. His shop and the homes of his three brothers were looted and set on fire. 																								Police vans that brought reinforcements were also torched. Four policemen had to be hospitalised. 																								The mob dispersed after additional superintendent Debashis Bej arrived with a bigger contingent and Rapid Action Force jawans. We have arrested 30 people, Bej said.																								Shops and dealers houses were also looted at Sarkarpara and Mahisha in Nabagram. In Burdwans Musuti, suspected CPM supporters attacked people who had gheraoed a dealer.

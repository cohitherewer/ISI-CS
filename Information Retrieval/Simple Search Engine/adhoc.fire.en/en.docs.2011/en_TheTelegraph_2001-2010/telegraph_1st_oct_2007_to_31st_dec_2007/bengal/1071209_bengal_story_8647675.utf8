				 Blast probe for bone clue

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Nandigram, Dec. 8: A CID team visited Bamunchak village in Khejuri today for a probe into the bones dug out of five graves two days ago.
																								The sleuths spoke to villa-gers in general and to those who claimed that the bones belonged to their near ones. 
																								The team later went to Sherkhanchowk, where a blast killed six men on October 27. 
																								Inspector-general D.P. Tarenia, who led the 10-member team, said the cause of the blast would also be investigated. 
																								The CPM had said its supporters who were killed in the blast were buried at Bamunchak. It did not explain why they were buried in a field.
																								Many villagers said they did not know about the existence of the graves before CRPF personnel found them. 
																								Khejuri police station officer-in-charge Bidhan Bhattacharya, however, told the CID team that five of those killed in the blast had got badly burnt and were buried.
																								Sherkhanchowk, where the blast occurred, is 6km from Bamunchak, where the graves were found.
																								Bhanu Maity, 60, in whose house the blast took place, told the CID: As soon as it occurred around 11.30pm, we got scared and ran. I dont know why and how that blast took place.
																								Tipalrani Maity, who lives in the opposite house, said: In the village, we generally go to sleep early. So I have no idea how that blast took place. 
																								A portion of Maitys house was damaged in the blast. 
																								Three of the five families whose members were killed in the blast turned up at the Khejuri police station today. 
																								Prajapati Das, 30, said she saw her charred husband being buried. 
																								The widow of another blast victim, Kabita Garudas, 35, said she saw her husbands body but not the burial.
																								Sharmila Kar, 32, never saw her husband after he died.
																								Tarenia said the CID would find out if the bones had any connection with the disappearance of nine people from a Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee procession on November 10. DNA tests might be ordered if necessary.
																								Pratirodh Committee convener Abu Taher alleged that the nine people went missing after CPM supporters fired at the procession as it headed towards Maheshpur from Nandigram. CPM cadres dragged them towards Khejuri.

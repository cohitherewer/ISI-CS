				 Plea for recapture probe
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 23: An advocate today petitioned the high court for a CBI probe into the violence in Nandigram between November 5 and 12, when CPM supporters allegedly recaptured villages in Trinamul control for the past few months.																								Kalyan Banerjee also sought an order asking the state to compensate villagers whose houses were damaged after they were driven out of their homes by suspected CPM cadres.																								I will raise the matter before the court of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on Monday and request him to hear the case that day, Banerjee said.																								On November 16, soon after the chief justices division bench ordered the CBI to con- tinue its inquiry into the March 14 police firing, Banerjee requested the court to bring the November incidents in the ambit of the probe. The court turned down the plea but gave Banerjee the liberty to move a fresh petition.																								Women cops																								The government today said it will recruit about 750 women constables. The move is likely to be approved at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

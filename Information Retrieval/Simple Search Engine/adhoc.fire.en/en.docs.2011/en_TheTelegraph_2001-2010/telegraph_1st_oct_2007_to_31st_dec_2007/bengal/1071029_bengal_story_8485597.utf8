				 Police hit in ration protest turns fatal
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Alipurduar, Oct. 28: A 20-year-old man, who was allegedly hit by a police baton during a ration protest, died last night.																								Subhash Patwari, a resident of Salbari in Cooch Behar, had been caught in a crowd that was demonstrating in front of the house of Tasiruddin Mia, a ration dealer. 																								Police wielded the baton to disperse the mob of 100. 																								Subhash, who took the blow on his head, was taken to Tufangunj hospital, about 4km from Bashraja, where he died at night. 																								Forty protesters have been arrested.																								Subashs uncle Bikash Patwari claimed that there were many witnesses to the incident. 																								When we realised that the body at MJN Hospital was Subhashs, we went back to Bashraja. Many people there told us that the police had hit Subhash with a baton. The post-mortem report is yet to come.																								When Subhash did not reach home last night, his family members first enquired at the local police station and the Tufangunj hospital. 																								At the hospital, we were told that a body, which could not be identified, had been sent to Cooch Behar MJN hospital. To our dismay, we realised that the body was Subashs, said Patwari.																								The Patwaris have demanded action against the guilty policemen even as district police chief Anil Kumar denied the allegations. In a mild lathicharge, nobody is struck on the head, he said. 																								Patwari said the family will write to the human rights commission.

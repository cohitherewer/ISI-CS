				 Ragging heat on principal
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 24: The high court today dismissed an engineering college principals petition to reconsider its order to provide round-the-clock security to a ragging victim.																								The principal of Mallabhum Institute of Technology in Bishnupur, Bankura, pleaded that it was near impossible for him to ensure first-year student Soumya Roys security through the day and sought respite from the responsibility. 																								But vacation judge Justice B. Somadder would not have any of that. The administration and the judiciary should be more active in eradicating the evil of ragging, he said. 																								Soumya, from New Barrackpore, who went to study electronics at the institute, about 230km from Calcutta, had been confined to a hostel room for three days and allegedly forced to take drugs.																								Justice Somadder had passed the order on principal Sunil Kumar Roy when the boys father sought his transfer to any other engineering institute. But there is no rule allowing a students shift from one private college to another.																								The judge asked Roy to take special care to ensure that Soumya was not ragged again and added that he would be held responsible in case of a rerun of the torture.

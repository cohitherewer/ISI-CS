				 Villagers stall mine drilling
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, Nov. 20: Around 100 villagers today drove away officials of a consortium appointed by Eastern Coalfields to dig an open cast mine in Burdwans Pandaveswar. 																								The land, 220km from Calcutta, was acquired in 1988. 																								But the villagers who prevented drilling and drove away officials of the Calcutta Industrial Supply Corporation and the Coal Mines Associate Traders demanded jobs for a member of every landloser family.																								The police remained spectators when the mob under the banner of the Coalfield Villagers Committee landed there. 																								The private company got the contract to extract coal for four years by paying Rs 146.57 crore to ECL. 																								Lal Mohan Mondal, who led the mob, said: The ECL is trying to dig out coal with the help of private operators. It has to meet our demand.

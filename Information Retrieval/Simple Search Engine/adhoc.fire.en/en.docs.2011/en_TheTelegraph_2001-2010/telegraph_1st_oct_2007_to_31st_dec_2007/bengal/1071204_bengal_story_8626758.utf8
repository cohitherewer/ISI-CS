				 Mother brutalised, boy flees
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Suri, Dec. 3: A young mother returning home from her parents with her son was dragged into a forest, brutalised and killed in Birbhum last night.																								The child, six-year-old Ram, trudged some 4km through the woods to reach home and tell his father that his mother had been attacked. 																								The lone assailant, whom the boy couldnt identify, beat him up before dragging 26-year-old Sumitra Marandi deep into the forest.																								Ram sometimes walked and sometimes ran to cover the distance fast. He reached the village around 7.30pm and recounted to me how an unknown young man thrashed him before dragging his mother into the forest. I called the neighbours out and ran in search of her, said Som Marandi, a daily wager.																								Police said a group of villagers found Sumitras blood-splattered body under a sal tree near Mahammed Bazar, about 260km from Calcutta. 																								The murder was reminiscent of medieval torture. The miscreant stabbed the woman in her private parts with a branch of a sal tree after raping her, an officer said.																								Sumitra had gone to her parents at Ranipara, about 8km from her husbands house in Fulbagan, yesterday morning. She was walking back home in the evening. 																								Ashok Munda, 28, who was among those who accompanied Som, said they carried lanterns.																								The group informed the police around 9pm that it had found Sumitras body with no clothes on it in the middle of the forest. 																								Blood was still oozing out of various parts. The police first took the body to the local primary health centre to confirm the death and then to the Suri Sadar Hospital for a post-mortem. 																								The Birbhum superintendent of police said a case of rape and murder had been started though the post-mortem report was yet to come.

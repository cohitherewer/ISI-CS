				 Cold shoulder to compensation
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Tamluk, Oct. 25: The Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee today said it would not accept compensation for the March 14 firing in Nandigram unless all its demands were met.																								The government had yesterday said it would give compensation to the families of those killed in the police firing. But it did not specify the amount. The committee wants Rs 5 lakh for each victims family. 																								It has laid down four demands to restore normality in the land war zone. They are: 																								Pay compensation to the families of all those killed/injured/raped in Nandigram since January 3																								Punish the officers who ordered the firing on March 14																								Stop attacks on Nandigram villagers from Khejuri																								Free Nandigram from the Haldia Development Authoritys grip.																								We will call off our agitation only if all our demands are met. We will not accept compensation for the firing alone, said Abu Sufiyan, a convener of the committee.																								Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee described the governments decision to give compensation as ludicrous. 																								Many of these families have not yet received death certificates for those killed on March 14. So they are right in not accepting the compensation, she said.																								 Trinamul Congress MLA Shubendu Adhikary, one of the main forces behind the Pratirodh Committee, said if the government could take action against five police officers in the Rizwanur Rahman case, there is no reason why the guilty officers in Nandigram should not be punished.																								The additional police superintendent of Tamluk, Debashish Boral, who had led the police firing in Bakulnagar, was transferred yesterday. However, the SP termed it a routine transfer.

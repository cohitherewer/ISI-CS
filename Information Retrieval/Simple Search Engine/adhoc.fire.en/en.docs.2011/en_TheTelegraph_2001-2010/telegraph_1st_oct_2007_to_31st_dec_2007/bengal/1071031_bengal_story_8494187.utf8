				 Party firm in CM support
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 30: The chief minister and his party are resigned to the use of central forces in Nandigram with Mamata Banerjee refusing to talk to any of them. 																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will discuss the Nandigram situation and his decision to call for central forces at the governments core committee before or after the cabinet meeting tomorrow, sources said. 																								A section of the allies said it got the impression that the decision to deploy central forces was not ratified by the CPM state secretariat earlier. 																								Bose yesterday took pains to detail the partys failed peace bid since January to justify the partys nod to the governments call for central forces.																								The support for the chief minister was stronger today. The chief minister is the leader of the party as well as the government. There is no difference between him and the party on the issue, said secretariat member Benoy Konar. 																								He made it clear that both the party and the government were serious about deploying the CRPF. The chief minister has asked for the force not to make them sit at Writers Buildings. They will tackle the situation as it should be, but the state will decide when and how they will go to Nandigram.																								Some of the allies said the CPM did not require the CRPF to regain Keshpur, where it fought another bloody war of attrition with Trinamul in the late 90s. The party, however, highlighted the difference between the two situations. 																								In Keshpur, neither were so many killed nor raped. Roads were not dug up and bridges were not burnt. Thousands were not made homeless, said Konars secretariat colleague Shyamal Chakraborty. 																								The CPI, in a way, supported the decision to bring in the CRPF . Its too late for another political initiative to restore peace. Mamata would keep the fire burning, said Nandagopal Bhattacharya.

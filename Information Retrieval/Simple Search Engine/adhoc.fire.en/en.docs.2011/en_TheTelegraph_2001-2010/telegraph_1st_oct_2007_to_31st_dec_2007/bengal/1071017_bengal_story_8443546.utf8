				 Coalfield officer found dead in paddy field
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Durgapur Oct. 16: A missing Eastern Coalfields assistant manager was found in a muddy paddy field today with a bullet hole in his head.																								Amin Karmakar, 52, went missing on Sunday night on his way back from his fathers house at New Kenda in Asansol, only around 5km from his quarters in Andal.																								Looking for him on Sunday night, his family located his motorcycle, parked on the roadside in a forest stretch of New Kenda with a smashed headlight.																								Burdwan superintendent of police Peeyush Pandey said the death appeared mysterious. The wound on his temple appears to have been caused by a bullet, but we have not found any empty cartridge. He was probably killed somewhere else.																								Two police dogs had yesterday failed to locate the body, found 100 yards from Karmakars two-wheeler. 																								Farmers stumbled on the body around 7am and called the police. In vests and blue trousers, Karmakar was lying face down in a muddy field.																								Karmakar worked at the Bahula colliery, about 220km from Calcutta, and lived with his wife and son.																								We knew from TV that a coalfield officer was missing and called the police immediately, said Sanatan Bauri, a farm labourer.																								Karmakars family refused to speak. We are in no posi- tion to speak. Let the police do their job, said his brother Sukanta.																								Pandey said: The motive behind the murder is yet to be established.																								Police said the kidnap-and-murder theory has gained ground as the body had not decomposed as much as it should have had he died on Sunday night. If Karmakar was killed on Sunday, the body would have swollen, an officer working on the case said.																								It is possible that the kidnappers broke the headlight to mislead us, the officer said.

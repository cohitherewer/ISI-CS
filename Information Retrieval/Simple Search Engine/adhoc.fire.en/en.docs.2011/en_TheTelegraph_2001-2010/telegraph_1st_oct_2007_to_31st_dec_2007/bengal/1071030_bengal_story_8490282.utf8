				 RJ plea for advance bail rejected
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 29: The high court today rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Janardan Nitin Brady, the Delhi radio jockey accused of making derogatory remarks about Indian Idol winner Prashant Tamang and his Nepalese community.																								The vacation division bench of Justices Amit Talukdar and T.K. Giri said the allegations were serious. 																								The hills had reacted angrily to the remarks, though the FM channel claimed Nitin used some humorous phrases with the sole purpose of creating joy and happiness in the morning show.																								The army had to be deployed in Siliguri on September 28 following violence during a procession by some 5,000 people against the remarks. Siliguri police registered a case, charging the RJ with making comments that led to the violence.																								Nitins counsel Sekhar Basu told the court that the famous radio jockey had no intention of insulting Prashant. 																								There should be an investigation into the motive behind the comments. The police need him, said the counsel for the state.

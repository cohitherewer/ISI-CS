				 Scared teachers seek transfer
 ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR																								Nandigram, Nov. 19: Thirteen primary school teachers have sought transfer out of Nandigram. 																								About 50 teachers had fled their homes during the last round of violence and taken shelter in relief camps and relatives houses. 																								We have received a joint letter from 13 teachers seeking transfer. They have been asked to apply individually, East Midnapore Primary School Council chairman Narayan Chandra Mondal said.																								Brindabanchowk resident Kabita Das, who used to teach in Sonachura Primary School, said fear drove the teachers to take the step. 																								We are spending our days in fear. I fled my home with my husband on November 6 when CPM cadres took over our village. Now I am staying at a relief camp, she said. 																								Sahadeb Gayen, whose house had been ransacked and looted by CPM cadres, had tried to go to Maheshpur Primary School on Wednesday. But the CPM cadres did not let me enter and forced me to take part in one of their processions. I managed to escape back to the camp, said Sahadeb, who has taken refuge in Nandigram High School with his wife and three sons. 																								No to central rule																								Minister of state for home Sripakash Jaiswal today ruled out imposition of Presidents rule in the state. Invocation of Article 356 is not the remedy for all problems, the minister said.																								The state government should take immediate steps to restore normality there, he added.

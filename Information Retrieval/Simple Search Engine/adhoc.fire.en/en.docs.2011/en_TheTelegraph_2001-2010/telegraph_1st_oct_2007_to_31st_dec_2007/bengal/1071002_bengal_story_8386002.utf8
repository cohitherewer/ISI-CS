				 Girls stripped for homework
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Tamluk, Oct. 1: A schoolteacher in East Midnapore was picked up from class this morning for allegedly stripping three girls and confining them to a room for not doing their homework.																								Debashish Giri had allegedly picked out the Class IV students for punishment on two days.																								The parents said they realised something was wrong when their daughters refused to go to the Bhupatinagar primary school on Wednesday. The girls had been punished last Tuesday and once in the week before that.																								My daughter was stripped naked and locked up in a classroom with two of her classmates till the school gave over, said Nilkamal Maity.																								He went to Dinabandhu Mondal and Vishnu Ghorai, fathers of the two other girls, to check if what his daughter said was true. 																								All the girls were scared to go to school, Maity said.																								Headmaster Ghanshyam Santra heard out the parents but refused to take any action against Giri, 26, a resident of the area. The parents went to police yesterday. 																								A probe has begun, said Bhupatinagar officer-in-charge Shukdeb Dolui.																								Giri had got the job four years ago after his father died in harness. He is the only teacher in the school besides Santra.																								The headmaster said he was not in school on Septem- ber 21 and 25. So Im not aware of what happened.

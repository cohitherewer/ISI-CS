				 Devastation survey begins
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Nandigram, Nov. 16: East Midnapore district officials entered Nandigram for the first time in 10 months to take stock of the devastation. 																								Five teams went to Sonachura, Daudpur, Gokulnagar, Samsabad and Kendamari-Jalpai to draw up a list of houses damaged and asked villagers whether they needed utensils or other essentials to start a normal life.																								We have asked them to complete the job as early as possible. Once the list is prepared, the compensation process will begin, said district magistrate Anup Agarwal.																								The government has announced that villagers will get Rs 10,000 for fully damaged houses and Rs 5,000 for those partially damaged. Those who need utensils and other essentials will get Rs 1,000.																								In most places, a small crowd followed the officials. We showed the BDO how some of the houses were set afire, said Prabir Mondal of Sonachura. 																								The teams worked till 6pm and will return tomorrow.																								A National Human Rights Commission team also came to Nandigram. It went to the local high school, where Pratirodh Committee leaders handed over a list of 1,140 refugees.

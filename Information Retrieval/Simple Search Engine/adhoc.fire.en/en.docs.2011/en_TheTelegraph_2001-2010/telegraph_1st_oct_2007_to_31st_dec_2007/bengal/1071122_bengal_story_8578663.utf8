				 Call stumps army brass
 SUJAN DUTTA				 	 An army patrol on AJC Bose Road. (Bishwarup Dutta)																								New Delhi, Nov. 21: Defence ministry officials were taken aback by the request for troops for Calcutta this afternoon. 																								Asked if he thought it was an over-reaction, a defence ministry official said: Actually, we did not expect this (a call to move into the streets) in Calcutta. But there must have been compulsions. I suppose it is fair to be hypersensitive if an issue has potential for communal disturbances. The state government need not consult us. It needs only to inform.																								Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb phoned the armys Bengal area head, Major General A.M. Verma, at 2.10pm and requested for the troops.																								It was taken for granted that since no less an officer than the chief secretary had called, the decision had been taken at the political level and passed on.																								Although senior officers such as Major General Verma and his superior, Eastern Army commander Lt Gen A.S. Jamwal, were surprised, they did not ask if the state governments request was rational. The queries would have been raised if the request had come from an officer junior to the chief secretary. 																								Around 20 minutes after Debs call, the 5/4 Gorkha Rifles, the battalion now posted in the Eastern Command headquarters in Fort William, was readying to move out. Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray was on television confirming to the media that the request for the army had been forwarded. 																								Two columns of about 90 soldiers each were asked to escort police officers from Lalbazar who briefed two officers of the Park Circus area. 																								Two more columns of the 3 Madras, based in the Salt Lake barracks, were standing by and an additional two were asked to be ready to move out if called upon to do so. 																								The army is acutely aware that todays request from the Bengal government essentially ties it down to routine policing activity. The force wants to be back in the barracks as soon as possible.																								The brief of the army is to conduct flag marches in lo-calities around Park Circus. Although magistrates will be accompanying the columns, the army has not been tasked to conduct searches, seizures and arrests. 																								The first column was out of Fort William at 3pm, 50 minutes after the chief secretarys call, according to reports sent to army headquarters. 																								An army officer here said he was surprised that Calcutta police did not appear to have advance information that vio-lent protests would erupt on the streets today.

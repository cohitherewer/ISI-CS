				 Todi promises full support to CBI probe
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER				 	 CBI joint director Arun Kumar (right) with Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur (behind him) at the Rahmans Tiljala house on Saturday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta																								Calcutta, Oct. 20: Ashok Todi will offer the CBI full cooperation in unravelling the mystery behind Rizwanur Rahmans death, his lawyers said today.																								They said they had advised the industrialist  Rizwanurs father-in-law against whom the CBI has registered an FIR  to approach bureau officials and assure them of every assistance.																								After the investigating agency registers a case, a copy of the FIR is submitted to the local CBI court  in this case, it is the Bankshall metropolitan magistrates court. 																								The copy of the CBIs FIR against Todi is expected to reach the Bankshall court tomorrow. The court will remain open despite tomorrow being a Sunday.																								I am sure the CBI will not arrest my client at this moment. The high court had ordered the CBI to make a preliminary investigation into the unnatural death of Rizwanur Rahman and produce a report before it within two months. It has not asked the CBI to arrest Todi and others and file chargesheets against them, Todis lawyer Jaymalya Bagchi said.																								At this time, we are neither advising my client to surrender before the court nor are we moving any anticipatory bail plea on his behalf. But soon after getting a copy of the FIR, my client will declare that he will extend full support to the CBI probe, he added.Sekhar Bose, another lawyer defending Todi, said his client would move court only if the CBI oversteps its jurisdiction. The court has asked the CBI only to investigate the nature of the death  whether it was suicide, murder or accident. It is only after the CBI has determined this and submitted its findings to the high court, can it ask for the courts permission for further investigation and action, whether it be arrest or search and seizure.																								Bose said if the CBI tried to arrest Todi or carried out search and seizure operations, that will be a clear case of the CBI overstepping its jurisdiction. 																								Bagchi alleged that the CBI had committed some procedural errors. 																								The high court had merely asked the CBI to probe the unnatural death of Rizwanur, he said. So under what circumstances has it started a murder case instead of an unnatural death case? We shall point this out to the court only if any action is taken against my client by the CBI. This is certain to go in my clients favour.

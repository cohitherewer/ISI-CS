				 Cops hit cab and then the cabbie
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 13: A police team, whose Gypsy hit a taxi, beat its driver and made him do sit-ups holding his ears because he had protested.																								The men in uniform fled after harassing the taxi driver for over 10 minutes on the busy stretch between Rashbehari More and Gariahat this afternoon. 																								A Gypsy is generally allotted to an officer of assistant commissioner rank.																								The Gypsy, heading towards Gariahat from Rashbehari More, hit the taxi from behind. Its driver, Prakash Singh, stopped and protested immediately, said an officer of the Tollygunge police station, where Singh lodged a complaint against the police. 																								Two policemen got down from their vehicle and dragged him out of his car.																								An IBM employee was in the cab then. I was driving within the speed limit. The policeman failed to control his vehicle. But they hurled abuses at me and slapped me when I objected to their foul language. Sensing trouble, the IBM employee, who hires my car every day, left the spot, Singh said.																								He pledged not to give up his fight against the policemen. All of them joined in beating me up. Many pedestrians saw what was happening but did not protest because the attackers were in uniform. 																								Before the Gypsy sped away, Singh took down its number  WB02N 3657.																								We were stunned to learn what had happened with him. It was hard to believe that our colleagues had violated basic laws. If the taxi was at fault, the police should have followed procedure, said an officer of the Tollygunge police station. 																								We are trying to locate the vehicle and identify the accused, said Javed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, south.

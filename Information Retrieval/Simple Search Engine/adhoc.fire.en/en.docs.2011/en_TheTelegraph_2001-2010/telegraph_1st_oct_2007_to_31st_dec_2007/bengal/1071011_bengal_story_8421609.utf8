				 Rizwanur mother
																								Calcutta, Oct. 11: Rizwanur Rahmans mother Kishwar Jahan today said she would not meet Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								Kishwar was scheduled to meet the chief minister yesterday, but the appointment was cancelled as she was not well. 																								I do not have faith in the government anymore. The government is contesting our demand for a CBI probe in court and he (Bhattacharjee) is the head of the government. Whats the point in meeting him? she asked.																								Rizwanurs elder brother, Rukbanur, has informed CPM leaders about his mothers decision.																								I only want justice for my son and nothing else, Kishwar said.

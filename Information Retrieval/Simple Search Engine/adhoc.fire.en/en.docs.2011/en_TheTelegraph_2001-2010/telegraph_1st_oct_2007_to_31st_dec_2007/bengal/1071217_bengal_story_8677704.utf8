				 HC takes divorce case closer to wifes home

 TAPAS GHOSH
																								Calcutta, Dec. 16: Calcutta High Court has transferred the trial of a divorce case from a Barasat court to Salboni for the convenience of a homemaker. 
																								Barasat in North 24-Parganas is about 180km from Salboni in West Midnapore.
																								Husbands can go to distant places to pursue cases against their wives. But it is quite impossible for wives to go to courts far away from where they stay, Justice Indira Banerjea said on Friday. 
																								The ruling could set a precedent that would help hundreds of women fight their legal battles closer home.
																								Mouli Kar, a 27-year-old resident of Salboni, had married Surojit Kar, 32, in 2002. They stayed with Surojits parents in Barrackpore. The couple had a daughter three years ago.
																								Trouble started in May last year when Surojit allegedly asked Mouli to bring money from her widowed mother. 
																								Surojit began to torture my client both physically and mentally and the situation prompted her to leave her in-laws house in August last year. Since then, she and her daughter have been staying with her mother in Salboni, Moulis lawyer said.
																								Surojits lawyer denied the charge and said Mouli had left on her own. 
																								After Mouli went to Salboni, Surojit filed for divorce in the Barasat court. 
																								Moulis lawyer told the court that she faced a lot of hardship as she had to travel a long distance to attend court hearings. 
																								Sometimes, she had to stay in hotels. It is very difficult for a woman to stay alone in a hotel, he said.
																								The lawyer said Mouli had moved a petition in the Barasat court to shift the venue nearer Salboni. But it had sent the case to a Howrah court. 
																								For a woman, going to Howrah from Salboni is equally difficult. So I pray to you to shift the venue to a court in West Midnapore, he urged the high court.
																								Justice Banerjea said she found legitimate grounds in Moulis petition and ordered that the case would from now on be heard in Salboni.

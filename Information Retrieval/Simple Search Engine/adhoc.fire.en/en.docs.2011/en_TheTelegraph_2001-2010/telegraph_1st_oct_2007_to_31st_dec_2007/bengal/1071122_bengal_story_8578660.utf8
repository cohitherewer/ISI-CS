				 Play with lethal cocktail  - Community frowns on Nasreen amp; Nandi mix
 BISWAJIT ROYCalcutta, Nov. 21: Many in the minority community expressed shock over the clubbing of the secular issue of Nandigram with the demand for Taslima Nasreens expulsion.																								Jamait Ulema-i-Hind leader Siddiqullah Chowdhury, who has rallied a section of Muslims in Nandigram and anti-land acquisition protesters elsewhere, denied any connection with todays agitation. 																								We are opposed to the agitation and condemn the hooliganism. The unprecedented public outrage over Nandigram and Rizwanur Rahmans death had strengthened communal amity. Todays violence was an effort to break that, Chowdhury said. 																								The demand to oust Taslima is a social and religious issue for Muslims while Nandigram represents the struggle for survival of all communities. The issues cant be treated on a par, he added. 																								But the Milli Ittehad Parishad, an umbrella body of 12 organisations floated recently under the Jamait leadership, had clubbed Nandigram and Taslima at its rally last Thursday, apparently to draw a larger crowd. 																								The All India Minority Forum, led by Congress leader Idris Ali, and Toha Siddiqui, a member of the Furfura Pir clan, had called todays pro- test. Both are members of the Milli Parishad. 																								It is clear that they took the cue from Chowdhurys rally on Thursday.																								Ali denied any responsibility for the violence. We called for a peaceful agitation on the Nandigram carnage and cancellation of Taslimas visa as both were popular issues. What happened was deplorable.																								He alleged that CPM supporters had joined in the violence to malign the movement.																								However, Trinamul Congress general secretary Sultan Ahmed, who stays in the trouble zone, admitted that his boys were among the rioters.																								Chowdhury defended himself saying Taslimas ouster was one of his 12 demands and he did not allow some leaders to make it the central issue for the rally. 																								He vowed to sever ties with Ali and Siddiqui. They lost control over the mob, Chowdhury said, hinting at differences among minority leaders. 																								Forward Bloc leader and former minister Hafiz Alam Sairani said: The clubbing of issues reflects the lack of confidence of these (minority) leaders who want space both in the mainstream and community politics. 																								Trinamuls Ahmed defended the rampage as an expression of anger against the government over Taslima. 																								Why should I stop my boys. What happened today should be an eye-opener for the government  that the minority community was so unhappy with it. Muslim representatives had met the chief minister and (CPM state secretary) Biman Bose, urging them not to allow Taslima to stay on in Calcutta. They did nothing.																								Many public meetings, he added, had been held recently to prepare young men for street fights. 																								Todays agitation was initially planned on the day of Chhath Puja but we postponed it for amity. It would be wrong to call todays agitation communal since no people from other communities were attacked, Ahmed said.																								Saner voices in the community, like Qari Fazlur Rahman, who leads the Id prayer on Red Road, and Saifuddin Siddiqui, the senior most pir of the Furfura clan, and Abul Farha Siddiqui condemned the violence. 																								These leaders are stoking religious sentiments for political purposes, Rahman said.																								The Furfura pirs denied any connection of the religious clan with any violence and urged community members not to fall victim to politics.

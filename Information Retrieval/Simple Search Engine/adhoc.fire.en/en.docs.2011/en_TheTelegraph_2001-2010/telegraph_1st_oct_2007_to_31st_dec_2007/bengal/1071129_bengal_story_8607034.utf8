				 Delhi duo in CRPF net
 PRONAB MONDAL			A CRPF jawan in Nandigram: Fettered?		Nandigram, Nov. 28: CRPF jawans tonight picked up two suspected Naxalites and handed them over to police though the Hindi-speaking youths in their mid-twenties claimed they were freelance journalists from Delhi.																								CRPF deputy inspector- general Alok Raj said the two, picked up from Jambari village, were moving about suspiciously when they were stopped by the jawans.																								They identified themselves as Sunil Ganguly and Prabha Kar and claimed they were freelance journalists from Delhi. When we asked them where they had put up, they told us they were staying in the relief camp in Nandigram High School. We cross-checked and found they were staying at the relief camp for the past four days, Raj said.																								We suspect they belong to a Naxalite outfit, an East Midnapore police officer said.																								Earlier in the day, the central force claimed the district police had asked it not to arrest anyone, including those accused of murder during the land war, without a go-ahead from the cops.																								Raj said he got a message this morning from the office of the superintendent of police (S.S. Panda) that the police would first conduct a probe.																								If they find anyone guilty but absconding, they will inform us so that we can take action, he added.																								Panda denied that he had sent any such message to Raj.																								In Calcutta, inspector-general, law and order, Raj Kanojia, said he, too, did not have any such information.																								CPM state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty today met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and told him that CRPF personnel were attacking CPM men in Nandigram.																								I told him (Bhattacharjee) the CRPF jawans have overstepped their limits. How can they move into three or four villages without the local administrations permission? Chakraborty said. Three of the jawans are Trinamul supporters. They attacked our men in Satengabari, Maheshpur and Ranichowk.																								A team of 10 CBI sleuths, led by deputy inspector general Aloke Ranjan, today had their first day out in Nandigram and held meetings with Raj and other CRPF officials at the central forces Khejuri camp.																								One of the sleuths conceded it would be a tough job probing whether the March 14 police firing on land protesters was justified.																								The people who faced the police on March 14 now live at the CPMs mercy. Most have already enrolled as CPM supporters, a CBI official said.

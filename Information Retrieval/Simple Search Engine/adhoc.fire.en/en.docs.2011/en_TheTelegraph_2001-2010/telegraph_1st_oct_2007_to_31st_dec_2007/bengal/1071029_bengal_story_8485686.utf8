				 Woman thrown to death from train
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Chhabi Sharma, before she passed away. Telegraph picture																								Krishnagar, Oct. 28: A woman was accused of stealing Rs 200 and thrown out of a running train by another woman near Kalyani station last night. 																								Chhabi Sharma died around 7.30 this morning, hours after doctors had amputated her right leg and left arm. 																								But minutes before she was declared dead, the 23-year-old housewife recounted in horror how she was branded a thief by a woman whom she had offered to help. 																								The woman falsely implicated me. I did not steal Rs 200 from her purse, Chhabi told doctors at Kalyani Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital. 																								In the womens compartment of the Shantipur-bound local, Chhabi had managed a seat last evening and offered to hold the bag of Shyamali Biswas, whom she knew as a co-passenger for the past few months. 																								The train was packed and Shyamalidi was finding it tough to stand. I was sitting and told her to give the bag to me, the dying declaration said.																								Chhabi went to Madanpur  the station after Kalyani  from her Halisahar house to cook for an elderly couple every evening. 																								The police said she left her seat as the train chugged out of Kalyani around 7pm and handed over the bag to Shyamali. 																								Shyamali, returning from work at a paint shop, also inched towards the gate as she was to get down at Simurali station, which comes after Madanpur. 																								At the gate, Shyamali opened her bag and found Rs 200 missing. She accused Chhabi of stealing the money, said Amitava Ghosal, the Government Railway Police inspector at Ranaghat. 																								An altercation began and Shyamali pushed Chhabi off the train in a fit of rage, he added. 																								The other passengers raised the alarm as Chhabi disappeared in the darkness. The roar of the speeding train drowned her last scream for help. 																								Shyamali has been arrested. She has denied having pushed Chhabi, Ghosal said.																								Before the passengers could call the police, Shyamali melted in the crowd at Madanpur station. After an FIR was lodged this morning, police picked her up from the house where she lives alone. 																								Chhabi had three children aged between 3 and 6, a railway police officer said.

				 Lalu prize for paeans: a job in railways
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Lalu Prasad flags off the Calcutta-Balurghat Express. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Calcutta, Nov. 24: Want a job in the railways? Write an ode to Lalu Prasad.																								It worked for Feroz Alam, a 26-year-old cloth seller who so impressed the railway minister with his sher (couplet) that he appointed him as a Group D employee in Eastern Railway. 																								Apna Laluji ko hum hargiz bhula sakte nahin/ yeh jo railway hai, doosra koi chala sakta nahin (We cannot forget our Laluji, no one else could have run the railways), Feroz recited at a programme in Calcutta today. 																								The minister picked up the microphone and directed his officers to give the young man a job. Continue your practice. We will appoint you in the culture cell, Lalu Prasad told Feroz to a huge round of applause from the crowd.																								I am overwhelmed. I couldnt believe my ears when Laluji announced that I would get a job, said Feroz, who had to leave school after Class VIII because of financial constraints. I earn a paltry sum, just enough for my pocket money, he added.																								According to railway officials, the basic salary of a Group D employee at the time of joining is Rs 2,550. He also enjoys some benefits.																								If Feroz earned a job with his paeans, the state got trains. Lalu Prasad today announced two new long-distance trains  an air-conditioned Garib Rath between Howrah and Patna and the Hazar Duari Express that will connect Sealdah with Murshidabad.																								The minister also laid the foundation stone for a new line between Krishnagar and Charatala. He then flagged off the Calcutta-Balurghat Express and the Pratham Swatantrata Sangram Express from Barrackpore to Jhansi. 																								Forget Nandigram																								Lalu Prasad believes it is time to lay the Nandigram conflict to rest as dragging it on will invite more trouble and hamper development.																								Forget Nandigram. The issue has been dragging on for quite some time now and is not doing anyone any good, the minister said today. 																								A delegation of MPs would visit the battle zone, Lalu Prasad said. I appeal to the warring sides to stop the violence in Nandigram. Let us remain as one, he added. 																								Violence must be stopped and peace restored immediately. Everybody has forgotten Lord Buddhas teachings.																								He later called on Jyoti Basu, who had fractured his rib on Thursday after a fall.

				 Hooded hunter in net, rape cry rings again
 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Anup after his arrest. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								Nandigram, Nov. 17: The CRPF today caught a 29-year-old suspect in the alleged rape of a Satengabari resident and her two daughters as another woman accused CPM workers of raping her.																								Anup Karan alias Bachchu, believed to be one of the CPMs hooded hunters, was handed over to Nandigram police after CRPF jawans caught him moving suspiciously outside a relief camp of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee.																								The jawans  on duty at Nandigram Bazaar, yards from the police station  swooped on Anup around 10.15 this morning as he was circling the relief camp in a new motorbike that had no registration number  a trademark of the hooded hunters. 																								Anup tried to speed off. The jawans gave chase and grabbed him as he struggled to wriggle through the morning market crowd. 																								When Anup failed to produce the bikes papers, the jawans took him to the police station.																								A relative of the rape victim later came to the police station and identified Anup. The police will meet the woman, lying in a Tamluk hospital, on Sunday and ask her if she can identify him from his photograph. She and her daughters were allegedly raped on Monday.																								Anups arrest came hours before a housewife from Garupara turned up at the Nandigram School relief camp, where her husband has been staying, and alleged that she was gangraped by CPM workers twice, on Wednesday and Thursday. She was alone at home. Her three sons and two daughters are staying with relatives.																								Dressed in a crumpled yellow saree, the woman broke down when she saw her husband at the camp. 																								She alleged that three CPM workers had barged into her house on Wednesday and raped her. The next day, four others attacked her. Fearing that she was being watched, she did not dare go out of her house the next day. 																								Today, I took some grains, and on the pretext of getting it chaffed, sneaked out. I took a trekker and somehow reached my husband, who has been in the camp since Sunday, the woman said. 																								The couple do not want to return home now. The police have lodged a case and sent the woman for medical tests.

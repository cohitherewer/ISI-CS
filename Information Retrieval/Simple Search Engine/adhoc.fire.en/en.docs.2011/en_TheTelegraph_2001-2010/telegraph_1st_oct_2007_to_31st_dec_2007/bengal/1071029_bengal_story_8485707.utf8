 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 28: The CPM today received support from its allies, who had played Mamatas agony aunt after the March 14 police firing. 																								Forward Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh, whose effort to negotiate peace with Mamata had failed earlier, spoke to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM state secretary Biman Bose to urge them to bring back peace at any cost.																								Police were inactive as both sides attacked each other and ordinary people continued to suffer. The offer of compensation alone would not suffice. I have told Buddha and Bimanbabu that the government must act immediately to restore law and order. Both assured me that they were in close contact with the ground level, the veteran Left Front leader said. 																								He was evasive when asked whether the allies were prescribing a police crackdown or deployment of central forces. 																								Ghosh said he was not averse to another all-party meeting on Nandigram. 																								The CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya criticised Mamata for trying to keep the Nandigram embers glowing till the panchayat polls. 																								He will go to the troubled area tomorrow with state party secretary Manju Mazumdar. The situation is worrisome and we have to take a new initiative, the CPI leader said.

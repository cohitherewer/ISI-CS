				 Biman unity plea to partners

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Dankuni, Dec. 16: Left Front chairman Biman Bose today publicly admitted for the first time that people across the state were questioning the coalitions unity.
																								It is true that people have started questioning our unity. This should not happen when the Opposition is persistently trying to create trouble in the state. We should immediately sit together to clear such misgivings, he said.
																								None of us wants the Left Front, which has emerged through myriad struggles, to break at this juncture.
																								Bose was addressing a rally at Dankuni, about 20km from the Tata Motors small- car plant in Singur, to bring the curtains down on the CPMs Hooghly unit conference. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state secretariat member Benoy Konar were also present. 
																								Bhattacharjee made a 45-minute speech but was silent on the front fissures. Instead, he dwelt on his industrialisation drive.
																								Why there is so much controversy about Singur? Are the Tatas taking land from Singur to elsewhere? Nearly 6,000 youths will get jobs in the car plant when it gets completed, the chief minister said.
																								Industry is the need of the hour and we will have to set up industries to provide jobs to our youth, he added. 
																								Bose, however, focused on the front. He said a meeting would be shortly convened to address the problems. 
																								The Balagarh bypoll is slated for December 29. So we should all stand united to take on the Opposition, Bose said, acknowledging that the CPM, being the big partner, had a larger responsibility to keep the allies together. 
																								Bose also reminded the smaller partners about their role. Dont expect that the CPM will bear the brunt all the time for everything. Ours is a joint responsibility, he said.
																								Forward Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh, however, said his party would stick to its decision to contest next years panchayat elections alone. 
																								While Bose sounded conciliatory, Konar attacked the partners for refusing to stand by the CPM on the Nandigram controversy. The Forward Bloc, RSP and the CPI have held the CPM entirely responsible for the land war killings. 
																								They were not perturbed when hundreds of CPM supporters were driven out of their homes. Their conscience has been awakened when the homeless started returning home. They blame us entirely for the Nandigram problem. This is unfortunate, he said.

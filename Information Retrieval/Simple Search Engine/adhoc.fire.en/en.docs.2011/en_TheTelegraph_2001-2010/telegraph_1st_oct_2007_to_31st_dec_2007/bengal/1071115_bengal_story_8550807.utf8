				 I am not above party: Buddha
																								Excerpts from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees interaction with journalists at Writers Buildings on Wednesday.																								Q: Your statement yesterday about paying back in the same coin has generated a controversy.																								CM: I stick to whatever I said yesterday. I stick to it. I stick to it. I have talked to many people. They do not think that there is any controversy. By saying our people I meant everybody  meaning CPM boys and workers. Eta ki bolte pari je aami party-r urdhe? (Can I say that I am above the party?)																								Two to three days ago, the same coin had been thrown back at those who were carrying arms and weapons. But now things are improving. I want all the homeless to return, regardless of political affiliations.																								Q: That means, for you, the party is supreme?																								CM: I have to listen to everybody. Similarly, I have to listen to what my party says.																								Q: Do you want to dispel the notion that you are the chief minister of the CPM and not of Bengal?																								CM: Why should I do so? I know my responsibilities. Moreover, as I have said, I am not above the party. I am the head of the administration for both the sides. In fact, in that capacity, I had tried to hold discussions with the parties for two months. But no result could be achieved.																								Q: What are you first the chief minister or CPM leader?																								CM: I am both chief minister and CPM leader. I cannot and should not disown my political character and identity. But, by abiding by the Constitution, I have been sworn in. So, my primary responsibility is to function as the chief minister. But at the same time I am a CPM leader. 																								Q: Dont you think your statements were provocative?																								CM: Please dont say this. I know your organisation (referring to the newspaper the reporter who asked this question works for) and it has been provoking all sorts of things. I dont want to answer your question. 																								Its beneath my dignity to talk to anybody representing your organisation. Had there been any other government, it would have taken steps against your newspaper. 																								Chhuncho mere haath gondho korte chaina (I dont want to sully my hands by killing a mole). 																								(The chief minister later said the comment was meant only for a particular newspaper and not the media in general).																								Q: Will this coin payback happen if the government machinery fails elsewhere?																								CM: Nandigram is an abnormal and exceptional case. I dont think such a situation would arise in other places.																								Q: So you accept that the administration had failed to restore normality in Nandigram and it was the CPM and its armed cadres who did the governments job?																								CM: I am not accepting the point that armed CPM men had entered Nandigram. But I would like to assert that no outsider would be allowed to stay in Nandigram. That is what the party has decided. 																								Q: Will you visit Nandigram?																								CM: This is not the time to deliver political speeches. Let peace prevail in Nandigram now. Then I will go.																								Q: Is Priya Ranjan Das Munshi responsible for the delay in the CRPFs arrival as he had written to Shivraj Patil not to send central forces?																								CM: The Union home minister has sent the CRPF. So you can understand the status of the person you referred to. He is a nobody.																								Q: Do you think there is any possibility of further trouble in Nandigram?																								CM: I think peace will prevail in entire Nandigram. But we should not be complacent. The sun is rising in Nandigram. It will take some time for the warmth to spread. 																								Q: What is your reaction to reports that Kshiti Goswami may resign?																								CM: Oh! What a fall!																								Q: Are you perturbed at the growing protests?																								CM: I have been in politics for several years and Im a pretty aged person. We are tied to the roots and we know Bengal well. We dont float in the air. I have seen many ups and downs. But I would like to build, not destroy.

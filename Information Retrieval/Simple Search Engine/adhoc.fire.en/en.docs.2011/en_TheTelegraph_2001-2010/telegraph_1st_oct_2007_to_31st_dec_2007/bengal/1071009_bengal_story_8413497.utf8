				 CPM leader gunned down in Khejuri
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Nandigram, Oct. 8: A CPM leader was shot dead and four persons, including a schoolboy, were injured in shootouts and explosions in Nandigram and neighbouring Khejuri today.																								The violence that broke after a months lull yesterday resumed around 8.30am. CPM and Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee supporters exchanged fire at Ranichak, Baharganj, Satengabari, Keyakhali and Bhangabera, about 175km from Calcutta, as police remained spectators. 																								Manas Mondal, 49, a CPM local committee member, took a hit in the throat and was killed on the spot. Baharganj Madhyamik Shikshakendra, where he taught, was declared closed at 1pm, minutes after committee supporters stormed the area and sprayed it with bullets and hurled bombs.																								The CPM had snatched control of committee stronghold Tekhali Bazar for a brief period yesterday. The assault was to avenge that.																								CPM supporter Ramkumar Mondal, 50, was injured. Both sides claimed a supporter was missing.																								The clashes continued till 5pm, East Midnapore police chief G.A. Srinivas said.																								Around 9.30am, 16-year-old Ajoy Das, son of a committee supporter, was hit by a bullet in the leg in Ranichak while returning home from school. I heard gunshots nearby and suddenly felt a shooting pain. I fell down, he said at Tamluk district hospital. 																								The CPM supporters at Baharganj withdrew in the face of a fierce assault, but regrouped within an hour and retaliated, pushing the attackers back to Ranichak. 																								Committee members Kamal Shith, 28, and Sambhu Pal, 26, were shifted to Calcutta tonight with bullet injuries in the head.																								Their comrades gheraoed the Tekhali police camp in protest against police inaction yesterday. They also placed concrete electricity poles on roads, blocking the approach to the area, apparently to prevent a CPM attack. 																								Additional superintendent Debashis Boral camped in the area for two hours and left though gunshots could still be heard.																								Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee visited the wounded in hospital. The CPM has called a 12-hour Khejuri bandh tomorrow.

				 Search on for Infy land 
																								Calcutta, Nov. 30: The process to identify land for Infosys is on and a plot in Salt Lake is on the radar, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said today.																								The government is looking for land near Calcutta. We are also thinking whether land in Sector V in Salt Lake can be offered for the project and talks (with Infosys) are on, Deb said, explaining the delay in allotting land to the company.																								T.V. Mohandas Pai, the human resource director of Infosys, yesterday said the company had not heard from the government in the past six months. 																								Asked if the IT company can be offered a plot in Kalyani, 80km away, Deb said: They (Infosys) dont want to go to faraway places.																								Commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said it was not the governments slow movement but unavailability of appropriate land that was delaying the arrival of Infosys in Bengal.																								Infosys is important to us. We respect them and want them to come to our state, Sen said.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 5: The government wants to begin land acquisition for industry in Purulia, Bankura and Burdwan at the earliest.

The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation has proposed industrial estates spread over 7,000 acres at Bud Bud in Burdwan and Saltora in Bankura.

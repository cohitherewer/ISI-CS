				 CPM fumes at CBI leak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
																								New Delhi, Dec. 20: The CPM today vented its anger at the selective leak of the CBI report on Nandigram, saying its leaders could take the matter up with the Centre. 
																								The party sees a political conspiracy to malign it by letting out the investigative agencys damning findings.
																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the state could raise the issue in Delhi. We may think of taking it up with the Centre, the chief minister said at the CPMs two-day central committee meeting that began today.
																								Politburo member Sitaram Yechury said it was a clear case of selective leak but did not elaborate. The matter is sub judice and it is wrong to pre-empt anything. 
																								Yechury skirted questions on whether another political party could have had a hand in the leak, saying it was for the media to interpret. 
																								Other leaders were less guarded. They hinted at the involvement of Congress leaders and described the leak as a design to malign the CPM.
																								The issue was discussed at the CPM central committee meeting as part of a larger debate on how the violence in Nandigram had harmed the partys image. 
																								The CBI report was to reach Calcutta High Court in a sealed envelope but found its way to a section of the media. The report said CPM cadres were involved in the killings along with police. Party leaders have dismissed the findings. 
																								Retail heat
																								The CPM-run state co-ordination committee for government employees has said it is strongly opposed to allowing corporate groups in retail, a day after the government voiced support for a controlled entry.

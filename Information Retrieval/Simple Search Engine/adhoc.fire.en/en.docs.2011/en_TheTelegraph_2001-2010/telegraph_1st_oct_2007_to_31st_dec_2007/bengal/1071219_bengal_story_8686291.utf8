 BRIEFS

				 																																	Calcutta, Dec. 18: The CPI(ML) Liberation today asked the CPMs partners to leave the Left Front instead of crying themselves hoarse about the Big Brother. 
				 																																	We appeal to those protesting from inside the front to come out if they feel that the CPM alone was responsible for what happened (in Nandigram), the general secretary of the outfit, Dipankar Bhattacharya, told a rally. 
				 																																	Tamluk: A teacher was arrested on Tuesday night after a raid by police and CRPF personnel on his Nandigram house yielded nine bombs. Abhoy Jana, 40, a phy-sical education teacher of Takapura Adarsha Vidyapith, was said to be a CPM supporter.
				 																																	Krishnagar: An HS school was shut down on Tuesday to allow revision of electoral rolls. Suvro Biswas, the headmaster of United Academy at Badkulla, 70km from Calcutta, said five of the 12 rooms had been taken over. A probe has been ordered.
				 																																	Calcutta: Riju Mahato, 20, a resident of Ultadanga, was run over by a bus on Mahatma Gandhi Road on Tuesday night. The bus hit his motor-cycle from behind.

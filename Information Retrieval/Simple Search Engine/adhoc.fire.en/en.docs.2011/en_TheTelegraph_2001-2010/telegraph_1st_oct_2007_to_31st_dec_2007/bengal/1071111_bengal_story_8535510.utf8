				 CRPF on way, after governors alert
 BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA				 	 A CRPF jawan in Kashmir																								New Delhi, Nov. 10: A 1,000-strong CRPF battalion will finally march into Nandigram  but it has taken the governors Diwali fireworks to do what the chief ministers request couldnt.																								The Union government today decided to send the contingent after Gopalkrishna Gandhis statement yesterday where he quoted the state home secretary to describe the region as a war zone.																								The first batch of central paramilitary should be in the state by tomorrow.																								The decision, pending with the Prime Ministers Office since Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asked for the force about a fortnight back, came days after sources in the Union home ministry said minister Shivraj Patil had expressed his inability to spare any CRPF battalion.																								Not only were all 191 battalions committed, the situation in Nandigram did not warrant a deployment, they had added.																								Union minister P.R. Das Munshi had written to Patil, saying there was no need for central forces in Nandigram.																								This morning, Patil spoke to Bhattacharjee and urged him to take immediate steps to restore normality in the area. He also asked the chief minister to ensure that people displaced from their homes could return and peace was restored.																								Sources said Patil had conveyed the contents of the governors report to the PMO and got the go-ahead to send the battalion.																								They said the Centre had been keeping a close watch on the situation and had earlier desisted from sending in forces because of the sensitivity of the situation.																								When ruling party cadres are creating unrest, it is somewhat awkward for a central force to go and enforce peace. But the situation has gone out of hand and it is time for the CRPF to step in. The Centre gave the state government ample opportunity to maintain law and order on its own, a home ministry official said.																								Patil urged the Bengal government to make optimum use of state security forces as they were familiar with the language and the terrain.																								Local police always have an advantage. They can help restore peace and normality in the area much faster if they want, the home ministry official said.																								The sources said the CRPF was withdrawing companies  each has about 125 personnel  from states like Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Jharkhand. They are drawing from various states so that deployment in one place does not get substantially depleted, the official added.

				 Plan to court minorities 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Calcutta, Dec. 7: The CPM is stepping up its offensive against the BJP while sidestepping issues that could upset some minority leaders, fuelling speculation that the party is trying to undo the perceived adverse fallout of Nandigram on Muslims.
																								The strategy took a more cogent shape a day after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee echoed Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi and sought historical proof of Rams birth.
																								Bhattacharjees comments, made during a speech on the 15th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition, drew sharp responses from the central BJP leadership today.
																								L.K. Advani said Bhattacharjees comments were highly objectionable not only politically but also legally as it was an offence to hurt the religious sentiment of any community. 
																								His party colleague Sushma Swaraj said Ram is the soul of India and no Indian can question his existence.
																								That the CPM has decided on the strategy became more or less clear today when state secretary Biman Bose said: We will discuss the threat of communalism to the country as well as the state in our party conference. 
																								Bose was referring to the CPM Calcutta district committee conference that began later in the day.
																								However, Bose parried questions about whether the party would discuss the dangers posed by the forces that had mobilised a section of minority youths for street riots demanding Taslima Nasreens ouster.
																								The CPM city units draft organisational report reveals that the party is worried about losing the support of the post-Babri minority population.
																								The party also fears growing alienation of Muslims following the Nandigram flare-up. The grievances have increased after the Sachar Committee revealed the poor condition of Muslims in Bengal.

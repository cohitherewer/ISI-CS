				 Politburo prepares balm for partners
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT			Party chief Prakash Karat heads for the politburo meeting. (Prem Singh) New Delhi, Nov. 11: A two-day CPM politburo meeting began here today with efforts to mollify Left Front partners Forward Bloc and the RSP, which have resented the way party cadres bulldozed their way into Nandigram.																								The CPMs Bengal secretary, Biman Bose, presented a report on Nandigram to the politburo but a source said a discussion on its findings would be held after a briefing on the nuclear deal and a draft political resolution to be adopted at the CPM congress, slated for March, in Coimbatore. 																								Politburo member Sitaram Yechury claimed there was no sign of a crack in the front even as central leaders of the Bloc and the RSP were getting increasingly vocal in expressing dismay at the administrations handling of Nandigram. Where are the cracks you are talking about? Theres no divide (in the front), Yechury said.																								Bose said he told the leaders about the events that have taken place over the past 11 months. I gave a presentation to the politburo recalling the incidents since January this year. Hundreds of families were forced to leave their homes in Nandigram and take refuge in camps. 																								Asked about governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis description of Nandigram as a war zone, the CPM state secretary said: It can then be deduced that what he wants to say is that capturing of the villages in the first place by the Maoists and others was legal and acceptable. Yechury steered clear of the governors statements. 																								The contents of Boses report were not made public but the state unit of the party is said to have briefed the central leadership recently on the involvement of Maoist cadres. 																								In a statement put out last week, the politburo had alleged that the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee and Trinamul had ganged up with Maoists to drive away CPM supporters from Nandigram.																								The statement also accused the Maoists of having sent armed squads from outside Bengal. One of them was led by Ranjit Pal, who was involved in the killing of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MP Sunil Mahato. Mahato was killed by the rebels near Jamshedpur in March.																								But even as the CPM brass was meeting, the Bloc and the RSP were speaking out against the state governments handling of the problem. Their leaders described the developments as unfortunate. 																								The Bloc central secretariat has called a meeting on November 20. The state leadership of the RSP, whose minister Kshiti Goswami has offered to resign, will meet on Tuesday. 																								Jyoti Basu has been saying all along that all Left Front allies should be taken into confidence (by the state government). But we see little sign of that happening with the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, a Bloc leader said. 																								Former Prime Minister V.P. Singh called for Basus intervention. He demanded punishment to those who had allegedly attacked Medha Patkar on Thursday and asked for measures to assuage the farmers. Basu can play a very important role in this (effort). There should be no hurdle in the path of people who want to establish peace, Singh added.																								Bhattacharjee did not attend the politburo meeting, also expected to discuss the campaign for next months elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh and the factionalism in the partys Kerala unit.

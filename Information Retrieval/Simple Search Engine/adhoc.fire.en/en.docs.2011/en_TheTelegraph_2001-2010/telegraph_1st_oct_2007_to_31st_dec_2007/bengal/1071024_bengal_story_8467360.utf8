				 Techie assault inside airport
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 23: A software engineer returning to his workplace after the Puja break was allegedly assaulted by a CISF official at Calcutta airport this morning for protesting against his wifes harassment.																								Jyotirendra Ghosh, 33, and Ananya were scheduled to take a Kingfisher Airlines flight to Hyderabad. They collected the boarding pass and mistakenly left the luggage trolley near the check-in counter when a jawan allegedly told Ananya: Tumhara baap ka naukar hoon kya ke idhar trolley rakh diya? (Am I your fathers servant that you have left the trolley here?)																								When Ananya protested, he abused her. The jawan screamed at my husband when he told the man to behave, Ananya said. 																								Hearing the clamour, CISF official Shanti Swaroop emerged from a glass cubicle, allegedly caught hold of Jyotirendras collar and dragged him in. Ananya said he locked the door from inside and hit him with three others. 																								Swaroop was accused of hitting Jyotirendra in the stomach with a rifle butt.																								CISF commandant K.N. Tripathi said the allegations were baseless.																								Ananya said she was weeping while her husband was being assaulted. Other passengers in the lounge came to my aid and started banging on the glass door. It was flung open and Swaroop told Jyotirendra to leave, she added from Hyderabad tonight.																								The couple went to the police in Hyderabad, but were told to lodge a complaint at Calcutta airport. Ananyas brother Atindra Chatterjee has lodged a general diary.

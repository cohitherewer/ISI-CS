Moving the petition before the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Pinaki Ghosh, advocate Kalyan Banerjee said that in its November 13 judgment, the court had allowed the CBI to continue its probe into the March 14 police firing.

He alleged that many were raped and beaten up by CPM goons. These incidents should also come under the purview of the CBI probe and the court should direct the government to give adequate compensation to the homeless.

				 Basu falls, cracks a rib
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jyoti Basu																								Calcutta, Nov. 22: Jyoti Basu suffered a crack in his rib yesterday morning when he slipped and fell in the toilet at his Salt Lake home. 																								Doctors today said the condition of the CPM patriarch, who turned 93 in July, was stable. An X-ray has revealed that the crack is in the seventh rib on his right side. 																								He has been advised complete bed rest. It will take around six weeks for the crack to heal, a doctor said. 																								Basu has been given an antibiotic and a painkiller and asked to wear a rib guard. 																								The rib is a spongy bone rich in blood supply and so there is not much problem in getting it rejoined, orthopaedic surgeon Buddhadeb Chatterjee said, adding that fractures in legs, where bones are hard, take more time to heal.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee paid Basu a visit this evening. I know that he is keeping well now, Bhattacharjee said.																								Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi went to Indira Bhavan in the afternoon. In spite of his crack, Basu has been in a cheerful mood through the day, Gandhi said. 																								Left Front chairman Biman Bose was at Basus house when the governor came calling.																								This is the second time the veteran leader has fallen and hurt himself. In August, he had slipped while trying to switch off the ceiling fan in his bedroom and injured his right hip and elbow.

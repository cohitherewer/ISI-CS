				 Murder cuffs after 4 years
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, Oct. 2: Two ration dealers have been arrested in Nadia in connection with the death of a youth who had allegedly threatened to blow the lid off their corruption.																								Bapan Mondal, 25, was killed four years ago. Before dying, he told relatives he had been run over.																								The case was reopened last year following an order by a Nadia court. Nitai Biswas and his cousin Nisith of Hogolberia, about 190km from Calcutta, were held on Sunday for allegedly plotting the murder. 																								Police said Bapan, a poor farmers son, had a relationship with Nitais daughter. When he persistently opposed their marriage plans, Bapan allegedly threatened to expose his corrupt practices.																								The resident of Mollahat was found in a pool of blood, about 5km from his house, one night in February 2004. 																								The post-mortem report confirmed that he was run over and the police submitted a final report before the court last year, saying there was no evidence to prove Bapan was murdered. The case was closed.																								Bapans father Bibhuti and the residents of Mollahat petitioned the district court in Krishnagar urging it to reopen the case. My son wanted to marry the girl. But her father and uncle refused. I firmly believe they killed my son, said Bibhuti. 																								The villagers had in one voice told us that the Bapans road mishap was engineered, said Tehatta subdivional police officer Dilip Roy. 																								Nitai and Nitish were the ones who broke the news of Bapans death to the villagers. But when they rushed to the spot, they found Bapan was alive. They took him to hospital, where he died.																								Investigations have revealed that Bapan had once fled with the girl he loved but returned after Nitai assured him that he had no problems with their marriage.																								When Nitai went back on his word, Bapan threatened to expose Nitais corrupt practices. He hoards foodgrain and sells them in the market, alleged Ranjit Mandol, a villager.

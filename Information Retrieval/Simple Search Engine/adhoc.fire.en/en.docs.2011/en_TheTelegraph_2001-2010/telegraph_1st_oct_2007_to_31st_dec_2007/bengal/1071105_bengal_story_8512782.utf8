				 Dealer suicide and flight 
 OUR BUREAU																								Nov. 4: A ration dealer described as honest by neighbours in a Burdwan village hanged himself last night. Another dealer, a woman, fled home with her family.																								Balai Banerjee, 68, of Faridpur, on the outskirts of Burdwan town, used to be depressed of late with the ration rage refusing to die down.																								His wife Tilottama had gone to their daughter yesterday. When I returned at night, he was hanging from the ceiling. He was depressed at the way ration dealers were being being beaten up and their shops set afire, she said.																								The people of Faridpur, 112km from Calcutta, had no grievance against Banerjee. We never received any complaint against him, said the inspector-in-charge of Burdwan police station.																								Mamata Ghosh left her house-cum-shop in Mustafapur to live with her husband and sons in a rented house in Katwa town.																								On October 17, villagers looted her house and shop and demanded Rs 65,000. I could not pay the money. So they attacked my house again. The police did nothing, she said. 																								The Katwa subdivisional officer today said he had instructed the police to take all necessary steps.

				 Party scurries to wash hands of dealer taint
 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE AMP; SOUMI BHATTACHARYA 				 	 A CPM rally at Nababhat in Burdwan to protest against the assault on its leaders. (Dipankar Chatterjee)																								Oct. 7: The CPM has suddenly woken up to the fact that many ration dealers, under attack for alleged corruption, are party members and decided to distance itself from them. 																								Unfortunately, some ration shop dealers have become our party members. We have decided not to allow any ration dealers in the party. Moreover, no donations will be accepted from them, Bankura CPM secretary Amiya Patra said. 																								Those already enrolled as party members have two months to choose between membership and dealership. They have to do away with either the dealership or the party membership within two months or we shall throw them out, the CPM leader said.																								Patra said 24 of the 1,245 dealers in the district are party members. What he did not say was that most of them were its supporters and donors.																								Narayan Dutta, a ration dealer who had fired at a mob demanding wheat and rice in front of his house at Kotalpukur, about 200km from Calcutta, has been expelled from the party.																								Dutta, now in jail, had been a party member since 2000. 																								In Birbhum, 10-12 dealers out of 976 are CPM members, said district party secretary Dilip Ganguly. 																								We are probing if those associated with our party are involved in corrupt practices, he added. 																								In Birbhum, as well as Burdwan, hundreds of ration dealers owe allegiance to the CPM, though only a few are its members.																								It is our partys decision not to give any membership to ration dealers. Some of those who have already managed to get it will be thrown out, Burdwan CPM secretary Amal Haldar said.																								A party source said most local leaders were aware of what the ration dealers had been doing. 																								Ours is the ruling party with a strong organisation down to the grassroots level. So, the leadership was very much aware that ration dealers sell foodgrain meant for public distribution in the black market. It is not possible for ration dealers to carry on the illegal business without backing from sections of the party.																								Those at the helm are now trying to put the entire blame on the dealers after being caught on the wrong foot in the wake of the spiralling protests across districts, a party leader said.																								A ration dealer of Sonamukhi, Bankura, who has been accused of hoarding foodgrain, admitted funding party programmes. It would have been impossible to run my business without the partys help, he said.

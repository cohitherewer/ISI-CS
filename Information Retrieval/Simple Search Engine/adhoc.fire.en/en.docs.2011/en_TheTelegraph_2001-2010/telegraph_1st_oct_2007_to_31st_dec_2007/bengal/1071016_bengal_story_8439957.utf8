				 GSI needs 3 months for Nayachar study
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 15: The Geological Survey of India will take three months to complete its techno-scientific study of Nayachar, the proposed site for the chemical hub to be developed by Salim Group.																								The agencys experts told commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen today that they would not be able to begin work before December, which means the report on the feasibility of the river island as the hub site will not be available before March 2008.																								The agency will drill the soil to study its topography and structure. It has sought drilling equipment from the state, but has not spelled out its fee for the job.																								The Union ministry of science and technology has to clear the terms of reference for the survey.																								Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb has called a meeting of the land, fisheries and industries departments as well as the Calcutta Port Trust and the Haldia Development Authority tomorrow. It will work out the modalities of handing over the island, most of which is now with the fisheries department, to industries.																								Around 10,000 acres will be required for the hub, said an official.																								The port trust and the Haldia Development Authority also possess land there, though not as much as the fisheries department. The government has asked them to relinquish their lease hold.																								However, fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda has demanded Rs 28 crore, which he claims his department invested in developing a fishery project and basic infrastructure on the island, about 3km off Haldia.																								The fisheries department and the agencies will be asked tomorrow how much money they want to vacate the island and how soon they can do so, a senior government official said.

				 Varsity plans north campus

 MITA MUKHERJEE
																								Calcutta, Dec. 8: North Bengal is set to get an institution exclusively for fine arts, drama and music. 
																								Rabindra Bharati University has decided to set up a campus in the region offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses in painting, sculpture, classical music, drama and Rabindrasangeet. 
																								Vice-chancellor Karuna Sindhu Das said: The new campus is among our expansion plans for the next few years. We have set 2011 as the target for implementing all the projects. 
																								The university will celebrate its golden jubilee that year. 
																								The proposal for the new campus is now with the government. We can take the final decision on setting up our north Bengal campus only after getting the nod from the higher authorities, Das said.
																								Higher education sources said the urban development department had already started looking for land on the outskirts of Siliguri.
																								Rabindranath Tagore had a close association with the hills of north Bengal. Opening a new campus there will be the best way to pay homage to the poet when the university celebrates its 50th year, a higher education official said.
																								The institution will not only be one of its kind in north Bengal but in the entire Northeast.
																								According to the universitys estimates, nearly Rs 10 crore would be required to start the new campus. The state government has apparently agreed to fund a major portion of the project. 
																								The university will also approach the University Grants Commission, the Union human resource development ministry and the Gorkha Hill Council for funds.
																								North Bengal students who aspire to study fine arts and performing arts now have to travel to Santiniketan or Calcutta or further. The state government is seriously considering RBUs proposal, a senior official said.
																								The syllabi and examination pattern for the courses to be offered by the new institution will be exactly the same as that followed by the university in Calcutta.
																								In addition to the new campus, the university plans to open a study centre at Mongpu, 60km uphill from Kalimpong, where Tagore had spent several days. This proposal is also with the government.

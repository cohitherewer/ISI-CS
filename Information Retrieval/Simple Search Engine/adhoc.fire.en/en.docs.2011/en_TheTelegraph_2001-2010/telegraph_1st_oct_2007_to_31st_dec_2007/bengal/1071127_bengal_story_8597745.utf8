				 Teachers with fake marks
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, Nov. 26: Six primary school teachers who had submitted fake or forged Madhyamik mark sheets to get jobs have been sacked in Nadia.																								The primary school council had sent copies of their mark sheets to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education for verification. The board has said they were either false or had been tampered with.																								Out of the six mark sheets, four had been tampered with. The two other teachers never sat for the secondary examination, said the chairman of the Nadia primary school council, Bibhash Biswas. 																								The teachers were called to the council office and given the sack letters. Some of them broke down and wanted to resign, pleading with us to not to lodge police complaints against them, Biswas said. 																								The council has lodged FIRs. The teachers  from schools in Itaberia, Hanskhali, Ranaghat, Krishnagar, and Chapra  apparently cleared Madhyamik between 1985 and 89. 																								After the shocking revelation, Biswas said, the council has decided to send mark sheets of about nine lakh primary teachers in the district for verification. It will take a few years but we will do it. 																								A senior education official expressed surprise about how two men who had not even passed their secondary exam could impress an interview board. The interviews were held in 1999 and 2001.																								Among those who tampered with their marks, one increased his total to 638 from 438. 																								We have asked the police to take action, said Biswas. Additional superintendent of police Subrata Mitra said an inquiry has been ordered. 																								We will carry out a fresh investigation. There might be a mark sheet racket here, Mitra said.

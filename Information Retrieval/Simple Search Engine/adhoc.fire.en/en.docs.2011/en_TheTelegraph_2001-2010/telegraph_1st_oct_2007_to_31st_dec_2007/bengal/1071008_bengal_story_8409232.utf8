				 State flouts backward quota rule
 BARUN GHOSH 																								Calcutta, Oct. 7: The school education department has been accused of blatantly flouting reservation rules by not recruiting a single backward class teacher for over 50,000 primary institutions under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan project.																								Backward classes welfare secretary Swami Singh said the department blatantly violated the norms while appointing parateachers for primary schools in the last three years.																								This will have a far-rea-ching effect, he told The Telegraph.																								Under the West Bengal Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of vacancies in services and posts) Act, 1976, 22 per cent of the vacancies have to be filled by Sche- duled Caste candidates and 6 per cent by those from the Scheduled Tribes.																								But officials said not a single SC/ST candidate figured among the 52,000 parateachers recruited for over 50,000 low- er and upper primary schools between 2005 and 2007 under the universal education programme. 																								Gopal Debnath, the secretary of the state parateachers association, confirmed that the reservation rules were not followed while recruiting the teachers.																								Sources said the matter came to light last month when chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, who chairs a committee that oversees whether reservation rules are being implemented, asked for the file on appointment of parateachers.																								I have sent the file to the chief secretary with my obs-ervations about how the SSA (Sarva Siksha Abhiyan) had flouted the reservation rules, Singh said. Now it is up to the government to decide on the matter.																								Backward classes welfare minister Jogesh Burman admitted that the school education department had overlooked the rules. 																								The reservation rules should have been followed while recruiting parateachers. Although it is contractual service, they are being paid from the governments exchequer, he said.																								School education minister Partha De, however, claimed that lack of SC/ST candidates in villages came in the way of implementing the rules. I have heard about the controversy and will discuss it with Jogesh Burman to resolve the matter, he added.																								But a senior official in the backward classes welfare dep-artment said hundreds of SC/ST candidates were denied jobs as parateachers.																								Under the SSA scheme, the recruitment of parateachers began in 2004-2005 as there were not enough teachers in lower and upper primary schools. The Centre and the state government agreed to equally share the amount needed to pay these teachers.																								Hired for six months or a year, the lower primary teachers have a monthly salary of Rs 1,500 while those teaching in upper primary classes get Rs 3,000. 																								The minimum qualification needed for a lower primary (Classes I to IV) teacher is Madhyamik. Those applying for upper primary (V-VIII) classes have to be graduates.																								State SSA director D. Nariwala refused to be dragged into the controversy, saying he had simply implemented the policy of recruiting parateachers for primary schools.																								This is a sensitive issue, he added. The minister himself is looking into it.

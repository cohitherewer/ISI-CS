				 Sonia SMS sparks tie-up buzz
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sonia, Mamata: Whats the message?				 																								Calcutta, Oct. 25: Sonia Gandhi today sent an SMS to Mamata Banerjee to convey her Bijaya greeting, raising hopes of an alliance.																								The Trinamul Congress leader, however, refused to reveal the contents of the message. 																								This is purely personal. I have good relations with some people cutting across party lines. I am not going to share this with media persons, Mamata said.																								Trinamul sources later said Mamata, who moved into the Topsia Road party office with her mother after a spat with her brothers on Monday, had replied to the Congress president. 																								State Congress leaders viewed the exchange of pleasantries as a precursor to a Congress-Trinamul Congress tie-up for possible mid-term elections.																								Mamata, however, said she had not given a thought to the matter.																								We are ready for elections and will cross the bridge when it comes, she said, adding that the party would take a decision only if the Congress keeps the CPM at bay.

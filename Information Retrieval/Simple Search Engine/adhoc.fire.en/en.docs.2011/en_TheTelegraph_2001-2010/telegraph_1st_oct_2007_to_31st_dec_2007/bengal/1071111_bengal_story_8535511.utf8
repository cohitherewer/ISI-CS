				 Back from the brink, but...
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bulu Mir at SSKM hospital. (File picture)																								Calcutta, Nov. 10: The 11-year-old boy who survived a bullet hole in his head is now fit but doesnt have a home to return to. 																								Our house has been burnt. Our relatives are staying in camps where will we go? asked Bulu Mirs parents. 																								They pleaded with the authorities of SSKM Hospital to allow the boy to stay on. But lack of beds at the head injury care unit forced him out.																								Bulu was admitted to the hospitals paediatric care unit on October 27. A bullet had gone through his forehead, leaving the pellet inside, while he was playing in the courtyard in front of his house in Satengabari.																								The pellet is still inside, but a doctor said: He has fully recovered. The infec- tion is gone and he is talking and doing other activities.																								The pellet, he added, need not be removed immediately.																								After doctors completed their discharge formalities this afternoon, Bulus father Mir Sarafat Ali requested them to allow him to stay on for a few more days. 																								A hospital official said: The pressure of patients on this unit is too much. And since he has recovered, we asked them to move out. 																								Mir, a small farmer in Nandigram, had to make arrangements at a relatives place in Metiabruz.																								It is impossible to take Bulu home now, said Syed Habibul, his uncle. 																								Habibul and the other members of the family have been living in a camp in Nandigram High School since Tuesday.																								Bulu left for Metiabruz this evening in an ambulance that brought a 35-year-old woman from Nandigram  Jhuma Das  with bullet injuries in both legs. 																								The boy spent his first two nights in the hospital on the floor as SSKM rules say a child has to be accompanied by a woman to be eligible for a bed in the paediatric ward.																								He was shifted to the head care unit after a surgery stopped the flow of cerebral fluid from the injury. The seeping fluid could have caused a severe infection.																								Bulu is not yet steady, but we hope he will recover. We hope he can return home, said his father.

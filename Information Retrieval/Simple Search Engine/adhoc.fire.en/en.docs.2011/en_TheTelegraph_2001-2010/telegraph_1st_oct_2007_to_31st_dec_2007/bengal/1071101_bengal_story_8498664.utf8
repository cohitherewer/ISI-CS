				 Party awaits Prakash before paramilitary
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 31: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did not discuss Nandigram in the cabinet meeting today, apparently because the CPM is waiting for a fi- nal nod to the deployment of central forces from the partys central leadership.																								Sources said the chief minister has to weigh the political fallout of the deployment. 																								CPM general secretary Prakash Karat will be in town tomorrow. 																								The party central committee had accused Bhattacharjee and the state CPM of making mistakes in dealing with the crisis after the March 14 police firing.																								State CPM secretary Biman Bose today indicated the partys discomfort over the dep- loyment of central forces in Nandigram. Is it the first time that the CRPF would be deployed in the state? he asked.																								Told that such forces had been used to contain violence by Maoists and Kamtapur insurgents, and asked whether he found the Nandigram situation comparable, Bose said: It matters what the chief minister thinks, not me.																								We were told a core committee meeting would be held to discuss Nandigram and the chief ministers move to call for the central force. But neither did that take place nor did the chief minister apprise us about the developments in the cabinet meeting, complained RSP leader and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami. 																								Some of the allies demanded a front meeting to discuss the deployment of the central force, but Bose ruled that out. He said there would be bilateral meetings with the partners first.																								The partners linked the reluctance to the CPMs indecision on how to tackle the situation if the central forces commit excesses in Nandigram.

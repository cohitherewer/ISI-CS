				 Bridge: for people, by people
 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 				 	 Loves labour: The bridge built by the villagers																								Khatra, Oct. 2: A cluster of Bankura villages has done what the government could not in 10 years  build a bridge that cuts the distance to the nearest town by around 30km.																								The residents of at Khatra, about 260km from Calcutta, raised Rs 20,000 and built the 53ft wooden bridge in a week. 																								Contributions ranged from Rs 2 to 10, and the money was collected in no time  to teach a lesson to officials, whose vague promises over the years had left the 5,000- odd residents frustrated. 																								The bridge was thrown open in mid-September.																								We bought logs, bamboo sticks, wires and nails and started construction. Thirty villagers who knew the job were engaged to build the bridge. Two-wheelers can also go over it, said Sukumar Das, a primary school teacher at Pirra-Bankra village, one of the eight benefiting the most because of the bridge. 																								It was primarily Dass idea that it would be better to build the bridge with local donations than to wait for the administration. I appealed to the villagers to join hands, the teacher said. The work began on September 2. 																								The bridge connects Pirra-Bankra, Nogri, Ghunudi, Dhabani, Jhamadanga, Nimdiha, Chatatala and Mukunda- pur with the road leading to Khatra subdivisional town, 22km away, and Bankura town, about 40km further. The old route ran through a 30km forest.																								In the absence of the bridge, we crossed the canal in country boats during monsoon. In other seasons, we waded through knee-deep mud, said Shyamsundar Dutta, 35, of Pirra-Bankra. 																								Carrying the sick to hospitals was a Herculean task. Critical patients had to taken in makeshift stretchers held above the shoulders, Dutta said. He was one of the 30 who built the bridge.																								Whenever we went to the panchayat samiti office with our appeal for the bridge, indifference greeted us, said Purna Ruidas, 40, a carpenter at Nimdiha. 																								To rub their snub further, the villagers called Khatra block development officer B.P. Dey to open the bridge. You have set an example for others, Dey said, probably meaning it is no use making such demands from the government.																								But some villagers are still hopeful. They should now realise our desperation and make the bridge a concrete one, said Ruidas.

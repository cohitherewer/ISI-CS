				 Naxalite talks with CPM allies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Calcutta, Dec. 17: Naxalite groups are in talks with the CPMs Left Front partners for a possible alternative Left alliance.
																								At the end of the CPI(ML) Liberation party congress in the city, general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said the outfit had held primary talks with the RSP, CPI and the Forward Bloc as well as the SUCI and some anti-CPM Left intellectuals. 
																								Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh, who had earlier announced his partys decision to contest the 2008 panchayat polls alone, confirmed the talks. Yes, we are holding talks, he said.
																								Bhattacharya called for a realignment of the Left forces after the CPMs capitulation to neo-liberal policies. 
																								He accused the CPM of double standards  supporting land acquisition for special economic zones in Bengal but opposing it elsewhere. 
																								Ghosh supported Bhattacharya. We are also opposed to inviting big capitalists in the name of industrialisation and the indifference to agriculture. All anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist Left forces should unite, he said. 
																								Bloc, CPI and RSP leaders had joined a CPI(ML) Liberation convention to criticise the CPM a few days ago. The Naxalite outfit would hold its open rally in the city tomorrow.

				 Glare back on cops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 20: The CBIs first information report spells more trouble for the five police officers who were shunted out on Wednesday.																								Other than murder and conspiracy, the charges in the FIR include criminal intimidation.																								Rizwanur Rahman had in his first person account written about how, on the basis of a false complaint, the then deputy commissioner, detective department, Ajoy Kumar, had threatened him with arrest if his wife, Priyanka Todi, did not return to her parents house for seven days.																								Sadique Hossain, a witness to the Rizwanur-Priyanka marriage, has filed a complaint with the state human rights commission, saying he was threatened with dire consequences by Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das, of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad, if he did not confess that Priyanka had been forced to marry Rizwanur.																								The Todis had met former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, deputy commissioner Gyanwant Singh and Kumar to seek their help in getting Priyanka to return home.																								There is an allegation that Rizwanur was called three times to Lalbazar and senior officials threatened him. All this happened at the police headquarters. That is why we added the charge of criminal intimidation in our FIR, said a CBI official.																								We will probe how they intervened to forcibly break up the marriage using threats and intimidation, he added. We will have to examine these officers. 																								According to CBI sources, Rizwanurs note and Hossains complaint will be treated as vital evidence to establish the criminal intimidation charge.																								Justice Bhagawati Banerjee, a former judge of Calcutta High Court, said the CBI could implicate the accused police officers under Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

				 Mamata beckons, PM amp; Sonia wait
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 12: Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi are unlikely to visit the war zone in the near future despite Mamata Banerjees requests to make the trip.																								This is not the time for visits, but for houses to be rebuilt and for victims to be compensated, information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said. 																								Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi stressed that the party, whose focus now was to ensure proper administration and the maintenance of law and order, would not get distracted by the politics of the tragedy.																								Earlier in the day, Mamata urged the UPA big two to see for themselves the terror unleashed on the villagers by the CPM. I have repeatedly asked the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi to visit Nandigram over the past 10 months. Ekhon onara eshey dekhey jaan, ekhaney shamshaner shanti biraj korchhey (they can see graveyard-like peace reigns here now), the Trinamul chief said in Tamluk.																								The request to Singh was sent to Moscow through the PMO, she said, adding another missive had been sent to the Union home secretary detailing the events in Nandigram.																								Even during the first spell of viol- ence earlier this year, the Congress did not consider visits by the Prime Minister or Sonia to Nandigram. A team led by general secretary Digvijay Singh visited the place.																								The Congress high commands neutrality has sparked concern among some leaders from Bengal that the stand will cost them politically in the state. Why did the national security adviser have to endorse the state governments stand that there were Maoists in Nandigram? one of them asked.																								They believe the CPM and its allies would overcome the setbacks but the Congress will fall between two stools: it will have the Lefts support in Delhi but the party will have to suffer in Bengal.																								A Bengal Congress leader warned of a large-scale erosion in the partys support. The search for an option has started. This time, it may not be Mamata as the victims have figured out that if she couldnt help them (fight the CPM) in the NDAs time, we, too, couldnt do a thing with our government at the Centre, he said. 																								The leaders from Bengal wanted a debate on Nandigram in Parliament but the Congress brass would prefer the Trinamul Congress or the BJP to raise such a demand. 																								The Congress, its top leaders feel, should play by the ear in the House.																								The partys dilemma was that if it overplayed its hand on Nandigram, the Left would not allow the Centre to take the nuclear deal forward. The government has already sounded the Left leaders about its eagerness to pursue negotiations with the IAEA. 																								The Left parties have also indicated that they were willing to consider the matter at the UPA-Left panels next meeting, likely to be held next week.

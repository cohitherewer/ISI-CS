				 Ransack cuffs on 2
 OUR BUREAU																								Nandigram/Calcutta, Nov. 25: Two Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee members were arrested today for allegedly ransacking the Nandigram block hospital and beating up doctors some two months ago.																								Committee treasurer Sheikh Asrafultullah and its convener, Safiur Rahman, were picked up when they were walking down a road near Nandigram police station from the relief camp in the local high school around 10am. 																								They were arrested on charges of ransacking the block hospital and beating up some doctors, said East Midnapore superintendent of police S.S. Panda.																								The two are Congress leaders.																								Five committee members have been taken into custody since the CPMs recapture of Nandigram. 																								Sheikh Sahadat was arrested three days ago for setting a police jeep ablaze on January 3. Sheikh Sahabuddin and Babul Akbar were held on November 19 for allegedly looting and destroying CPM leaders houses in the first week of January. 																								A senior officer said the police were on the lookout for about 2,000 committee members in connection with crimes committed since January.																								East Midnapore Congress president Sailoja Das accused the police of not doing anything against CPM cadres involved in violent incidents in Nandigram since January.																								We shall paralyse and cripple the district if Asrafultullah and Safiur are not released within 48 hours, Das said.																								State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said Opposition supporters were not being allowed to return home by indiscriminate arrests. As soon as the homeless are returning home, they are not only arrested by police but are being subjected to torture and humiliation by CPM activists. 																								Reacting to Mamata Banerjees call for a secular democratic front, the Congresss Somen Mitra said his party had no problem joining her.

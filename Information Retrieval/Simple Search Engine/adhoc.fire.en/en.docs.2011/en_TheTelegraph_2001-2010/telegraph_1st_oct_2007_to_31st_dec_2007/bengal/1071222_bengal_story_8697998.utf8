 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Calcutta, Dec. 21: Mamata Banerjees secular, anti-CPM front has run aground even before its formal launch with those supposed to cobble together the alliance admitting that it is easier said than done.
																								We approached the Congress and the CPI(ML) Liberation on Mamatas advice but neither of them has responded. Nor have the SUCI, Forward Bloc or the RSP, said Purnendu Bose, a key functionary of the Trinamul Congress-led Save Farmland Committee.
																								Mamata had said in Midnapore yesterday that 90 per cent of the job (of stitching up the front) was over. 
																								She said Bose and Pradip Banerjee, a convener of the committee, were in talks with like-minded parties. 
																								The Progressive Secular Democratic Front is set for a December 30 launch.
																								State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya, who had earlier sent general secretary Jayanta Bhattacharya to Mamatas programme, today made it clear that it was impossible to collaborate with Mamata until she severs ties with the BJP. 
																								Naxalite leader Kartick Pal said the CPI(ML) Liberation would not align with Mamata as her front would not be a viable alternative to the ruling coalition in Bengal. 
																								A Trinamul leader said: Only some smaller Naxalite factions and parties with no popular base will join Mamata on December 30.
																								Mamata had deferred the launch of the front by 10 days earlier this week.

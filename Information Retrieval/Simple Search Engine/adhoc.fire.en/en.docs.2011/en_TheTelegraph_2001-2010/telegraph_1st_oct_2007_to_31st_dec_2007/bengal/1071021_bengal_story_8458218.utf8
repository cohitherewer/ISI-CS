				 Team keeps out Bengal sleuths 
 BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA																								New Delhi, Oct. 20: The CBI team probing Rizwanur Rahmans mysterious death has no member from the agencys Calcutta office, courtesy an express order from director Vijay Shankar, officials said today.																								Shankar reportedly believes that the Calcutta officials are prone to leaking information.																								We faced this problem in the Singur (Tapasi Malik) case, and owing to the sensitivity of the Rizwanur probe, he asked that the Calcutta officials be kept out, a source said.																								The strength of the CBI probe team, which today began the investigation, has grown to 15.																								Bureau officials said that though no police officer had yet been named in the FIR, names could be added later as the investigations progressed. Currently, the document mentions businessman Ashok Todi and others in a case of murder, conspiracy and criminal intimidation.																								A senior CBI official said the agency would look into the criminal aspects and the administrative lapses.																								The criminal aspects cover the angles of homicide (who did it), suicide (if he was pushed to take the step and why) and accidental death.																								Although a murder case has been registered, we cannot ignore the other angles. The administrative aspect will deal with the role of the police, he said.																								An official said the probe had got somewhat delayed because of some confusion over the Calcutta High Court order for a CBI investigation.																								If a death has taken place under mysterious circumstances, the police are expected to start the inquest proceedings under a certain section of criminal law. This was done (by the Bengal CID) in the Rizwanur case. Subsequently, any other agency that took up the probe had to take that as its starting point, he explained.																								In this case, however, the high court had termed the CID investigations faulty and not in accordance with law.																								The CBI, therefore, had to ask for the original writ petition filed by Rizwanurs mother Kishwar Jahan and brother Rukbanur.																								The petition blamed Todi and we took that as the starting point for our investigations, the official added.

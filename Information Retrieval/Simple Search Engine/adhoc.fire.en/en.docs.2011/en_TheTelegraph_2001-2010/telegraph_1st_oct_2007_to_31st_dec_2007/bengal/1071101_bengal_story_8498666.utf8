				 Heat on Bloc over ration
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 31: CPM ministers today took their Forward Bloc colleague, food minister Paresh Adhikary, to task for his failure in handling the ration crisis, but the chief minister said the problem was not so acute.																								At the cabinet meeting, Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly told Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that the crisis was assuming alarming proportions in his South 24-Parganas district. In many places, the dealers are offering money in the absence of foodgrain. But this is illegal.																								The chief minister asked Ganguly to meet him in his office if he had more specific information, but appeared to be defending Adhikary when he said: I know there is a problem. But its not so acute. 																								The riots havent been that widespread, he added.																								Two men have been killed in police firing on ration protesters in Birbhum and Bankura. There has also been violence in Burdwan, Murshidabad and the two 24-Parganas. 																								At most places, villagers have accused ration dealers of not selling rice and wheat for months. 																								Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah sided with Ganguly and said block level committees set up by the food department existed only on paper.																								Most of these committees do not have food inspectors as members. In their absence, who will cancel fake ration cards? Panchayat representatives or the local MLA, who are part of the panels, are not authorised to scrap fake cards, said Mollah.																								Adhikary admitted that there were problems in the pub- lic distribution system, but said peoples lack of interest in ration shops was also to blame for the mess. 																								Most above-poverty-line card holders do not go to collect his ration regularly. Were trying to make the shops stock more merchandise to make them attractive to such people, said Adhikary.																								In his defence, Adhikary added that 189 ration dealers have been suspended and the licences of eight cancelled. 																								Ten distributors have been suspended for alleged irregularities. Thirty-seven inspectors have also been showcaused and their tour diaries seized for a probe into whether they were going on regular insepctions, said Adhikary.

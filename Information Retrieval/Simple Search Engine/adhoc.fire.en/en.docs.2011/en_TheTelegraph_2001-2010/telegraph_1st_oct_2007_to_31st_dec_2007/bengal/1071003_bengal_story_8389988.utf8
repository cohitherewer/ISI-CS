				 Protester killed in cadre fury
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 2: A man protesting against alleged lack of flood relief died today, a day after suspected CPM activists attacked the rally he was part of in a Howrah village.																								Kartick Kundu, 26, who was among 200 people from Jagadishpur demonstrating at the Bally-Jagachha block office, was hit on the head with a dagger.																								Kundu was rushed to the Jagadishpur health centre, where he was given 18 stitches. He was later shifted to SSKM Hospital, where he died this morning. 																								Five others, including his wife Tumpa, 22, were injured. They have been admitted to the district hospital. 																								The group, which included women and children from relief camps where they had been shifted after the floods, demonstrated before BDO Paromita Chandas office for about two hours. Most of the village is still under water.																								The attack was pre-planned. As we started telling her (Chanda) about our woes, about 50 armed CPM men stormed the room, Tumpa said. 																								She has not been told about her husbands death. Their six-year-old daughter is with Karticks mother Dipali. 																								The CPM men were armed with sticks and choppers. I saw one of them hit Kartick on his head, said Somnath Majhi, a rickshaw-puller.																								Chanda said she had dis- tributed whatever little she had been given and denied any knowledge about the attack. 																								Jagadishpurs Trinamul Congress panchayat chief, Gobinda Hazra, said the villagers resorted to the agitation after their appeals for relief went unheeded. The administration has given only 100kg of rice and 100 litres of kerosene to 1,000 people, Hazra said.																								Police said eight persons have been arrested. One of them is a CPM activist.																								Howrah CPM secretary Sridip Bhattacharya neither admitted nor denied supporters role in the incident. A police probe is on.

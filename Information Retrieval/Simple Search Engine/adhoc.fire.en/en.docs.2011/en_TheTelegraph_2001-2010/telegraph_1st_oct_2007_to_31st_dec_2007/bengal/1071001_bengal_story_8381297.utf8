				 Outsider hand in ration rage
 OUR BUREAU																								Suri/Durgapur, Sept. 30: The Birbhum administration today accused outsiders of fanning the ration rage, which spread further today.																								District magistrate T.K. Shome said the same people have been instigating villagers at various places. We are finding out who they are. Some of them are from the district, but some are outsiders.																								A ration dealer was arrested at Sadaipur today after irregularities were found in his stock. Ten other dealers were served showcause notices. The district food controller has lodged an FIR against Sisir Bhandari as he had kept his shop closed without a valid reason.																								Eight people were arrested last night for attacking ration dealer Uttam De. Villagers had surrounded Des house at Ahmedpur, 220km from Calcutta, and hurled stones. 																								The ration rage first erupted at Radhamohanpur in Bankura mid-September. Villagers faced with food shortage stormed a CPM rally, saying they wanted rice and not their anti-imperialism speeches.																								Over the past 48 hours, villagers have confronted ration dealers at Sainthia, Suri and Labhpur in Birbhum alleging non-availability of foodgrain. 																								At Bagdanga, villagers looted wheat and rice from a ration shop and at Gopikantapur, police had to battle a mob that pelted their jeep with stones. A ration dealer there was locked up in a room. 																								There was trouble at several places in Burdwan. At Kantabera near Durgapur, a dealer was forced to promise Rs 500 to every card holder for not being able to provide rice.																								Officials confirmed the trend to demand money from ration dealers. We are not going to tolerate such extortion, the Birbhum DM said.

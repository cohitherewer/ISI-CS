				 Nod to acquisition for Salim expressway
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, Oct. 31: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees cabinet approved land acquisition for a string of industrial and infrastructure projects on a day Mamata Banerjee paralysed Bengal.																								The chief minister announced the plan to develop two industrial parks  at Saltora in Bankura and Bud Bud in Burdwan  and his team cleared acquisition plans for Salim Groups expressway and a million-tonne steel plant. 																								Around 1,500 acres will have to be acquired at Jamuria in Burdwan for the Shyam Groups steel and 100MW captive power plant. 																								The project is expected to generate employment for about 5,000 people.																								Over 1,100 acres are needed for the Barasat-Raichak expressway.																								The land acquisition and construction will be carried out in two phases  around 400 acres in North 24-Parganas and 700 acres in South.																								Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said around 26.75km would be built in the first phase of the expressway.																								The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation had proposed the industrial parks.																								They would be for small and mid-sized steel units, heavy engineering units and those that manufacture automobile spares.																								We have a lot of companies asking for 400 to 500 acres. We plan to accommodate these projects in the industrial parks. We expect each to attract investment worth around Rs 10,000 crore, a WBIDC official said.																								The chief minister told his cabinet colleagues that there would be no land acquisition-related problem at Saltora or Bud Bud as the land there was fallow.																								Industry department officials said all major political parties had reached a consensus in favour of land acquisition for the Bankura and Burdwan projects. 																								A bridge would be built across the Damodar to ensure easy connectivity between Bankura and Burdwan, Bhattacharjee told the cabinet.																								For the expressway, the chief secretary said: A bridge would be built at Kalicharanpur (South 24-Parganas).																								The expressway is likely to reduce travelling time between the industrial hub of Haldia and Calcutta by almost half. 																								Some of the CPMs allies, like the RSP, were not happy with the approval to the Salim project. We were not told how much of the 1,168 acres would be used for the road and how much was being reserved for real estate projects, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said. 																								The Salims want to build several commercial plazas along the road.

				 Rampage in RG Kar
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 1: A clash at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital over the death of an 18-year-old girl left several people injured and sent a youth to a police lock-up.																								Shampa Das, a resident of Netaji Palli in Belgharia on the citys northern fringes, died at 8.30 last night, days after two operations for an ovarian tumour.																								Around 12.40am today, some 20 to 30 people barged into the office of the morgue ward master, blaming doctors negligence for the girls death. They ransacked the room and allegedly beat up some hospital officials.																								At least five of our employees were thrashed by the mob and one of them has critical injuries, said Krishnangshu Roy, the medical superintendent.																								However, the relatives and neighbours of the girl who died alleged that when they went to find out about the release of the body, some hospital officials attacked them unprovoked.																								They pushed us out of the office. When we protested, hospital employees beat up some of us, said a neighbour. Later, the police also refused to take down our complaint, he added.																								An official at Talla police station said a man was held after the hospital lodged a complaint.																								Shampa had been admitted to hospital on November 21. She had surgery on November 27. But doctors said some complications had developed and a second operation had to be done the next day.																								When Shampa was admitted, she was quite healthy save the tumour, which was not giving her much pain. However, after the first surgery, her condition started deteriorating and the doctors told us she would need another surgery, said Geeta, Shampas aunt.

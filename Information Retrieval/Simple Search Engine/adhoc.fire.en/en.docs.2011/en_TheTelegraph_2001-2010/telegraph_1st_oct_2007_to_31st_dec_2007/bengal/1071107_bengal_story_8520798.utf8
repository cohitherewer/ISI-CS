				 Cong joins Mamata 
																								Calcutta, Nov. 6: The Congress today attended a meeting of the Trinamul-led Save Farmland Committee and adopted a joint resolution to seek central intervention in lawless Nandigram. 																								We did not have any problem joining Mamata Banerjee as she kept the BJP away, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.																								The Congress had initially sided with Mamata over Singur, but moved away following her public meetings with BJP chief Rajnath Singh. 																								Bhattacharya today said: It was decided at a meeting in New Delhi last week that the Congress would float a secular front in Bengal with Mamata as its head if she snaps ties with the communal BJP. 																								State Congress secretaries Subhankar Sarkar and Kanak Debnath attended the meeting at the Trinamul headquarters.

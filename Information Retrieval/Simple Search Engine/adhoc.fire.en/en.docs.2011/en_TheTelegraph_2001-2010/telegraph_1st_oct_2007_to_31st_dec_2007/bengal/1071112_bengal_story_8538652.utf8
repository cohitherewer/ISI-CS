 							 - Front within front takes on CPM in Calcutta, party brass brainstorm in Delhi to cement cracks OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 CPM supporters return home to Gokulnagar in Nandigram on Sunday. Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, Nov. 11: The RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI today held the CPM entirely responsible for the continuing violence in Nandigram but didnt utter a word against the Trinamul Congress-led Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee. 																								We do not approve of the politics of violence and revenge in Nandigram and we are holding the CPM entirely responsible for the violent incidents, the junior Left Front partners said in a resolution.																								It recommended administrative efforts, coupled with sustained political and social initiatives to restore peace.																								A copy of the resolution was sent to front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose, who is in Delhi to attend the partys politburo meeting.																								Embarrassed by allies decision, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar tonight said it would only incite the Opposition parties. 																								It is not fair on the part of the smaller partners to entirely blame the CPM for the Nandigram incidents. Why are they silent on the violence unleashed by Pratirodh Committee since January? he asked. 																								The grievances should have been aired at the alliances meeting, Konar added. 																								The resolution was adopted after a two-hour meeting at the Blocs Central Avenue office. Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh, RSP secretary and former minister Debabrata Bandopadhyay and state CPI chief Manju Kumar Majumdar were among those present.																								PWD minister Khsiti Goswami, who had expressed his desire to resign from the cabinet over Nandigram, was also there. 																								Ive stopped using my office car and wont go to Writers from tomorrow, he said. 																								The resolution, however, requested Goswami to reconsider the decision to put in his papers. 																								The mini front made it clear that it would not like to face embarrassing questions from people because of the CPMs misdeeds. 																								Why should we be blamed for what the CPM has been doing? said an RSP leader.																								Asked why the Trinamul-led outfits violence was not mentioned, an alliance leader said local CPM functionaries had helped escalate the trouble by resorting to a path of revenge to recapture villages. 																								Nandagopal Bhattacharya of the CPI said the situation would not have reached such a pass had CPM tackled it earlier, both administratively and politically.

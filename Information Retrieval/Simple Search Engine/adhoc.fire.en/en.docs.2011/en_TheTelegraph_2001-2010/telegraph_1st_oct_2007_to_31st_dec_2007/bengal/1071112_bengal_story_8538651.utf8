				 Quit letter flouts norms
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 11: Speaker Somnath Chatterjee tonight said Mamata Banerjees resignation could not be accepted as it was not in keeping with the norms of the House.																								Mamata Banerjee sent in her resignation to the Prime Minister and a copy of it was despatched to me. This is not acceptable. The letter should have been addressed to me, Chatterjee told The Telegraph from Delhi.																								According to him, the Prime Minister cannot accept the resignation of a Lok Sabha member. Mamatas letter carries no importance to me since it was not addressed to me, he added. 																								The Trinamul Congress MP called a news conference yesterday to announce the resignation. She said she sent the quit letter to the Prime Minister and despatched a copy of it to the Speaker. 																								Mamata gave several reasons for the decision, including the continuing bloodshed in Nandigram. 																								The Trinamul leader had sent a similar resignation letter to deputy Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal in 2005 after she threw papers at the podium. Her resignation was not accepted.																								Bengal Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said an MLA or MP has to hand over resignation individually to the Speaker.																								The resignation letter cannot be sent to the Speaker, Halim said over the phone from Nigeria, where he has gone for a meeting. 																								He added that the Prime Minister couldnt accept a Lok Sabha members resignation.																								Trinamul sources said in Calcutta Mamata had done it deliberately to mount pressure on the Centre and carry forward her campaign against the continuing violence unleashed by the CPM. 																								A Trinamul leader, who did not want to be named, said: A long-time MP should not resort to such theatrics. It shows her in poor light.																								Another party worker said: Didi should get rid of her resignation syndrome.

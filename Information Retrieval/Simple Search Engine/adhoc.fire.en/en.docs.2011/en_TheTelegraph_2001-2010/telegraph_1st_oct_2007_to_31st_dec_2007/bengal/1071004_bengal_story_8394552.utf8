				 Gruesome murder for a mobile phone
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 3: A man was tied up, his veins above the heels were severed, his eyes were pricked, head was battered with bricks and face sprayed with acid  because he had allegedly stolen a phone.																								Bablu Mistry died.																								The punishment was meted out by four toughs at Atkrishnarampur in Diamond Harbour, about 60km from Calcutta, last night.																								Police said Bablu was a small-time supplier of building materials and had a record of petty theft. He also had business relations with the killers.																								They were having a drinking session around 2pm. Around 4, one of the youths could not find his phone and Bablu was also missing. He dialled the number and a woman picked up.																								She said a man was lying drunk at a tea stall at Dostipur in Falta, about 15km away, and that she had pulled out the phone from his pocket as it kept ringing away. 																								The caller took directions from the woman and reached Dostipur with his associates on two motorcycles around 6pm. Bablu was lying there.																								They tied him up, bundled him on a cycle van and brought him to Atkrishnarampur. The torture started around seven, a Diamond Harbour police officer said.																								Several hundred villagers witnessed the three-hour torture, but none intervened.																								We are all scared of the four. They are known rowdies. We had informed Shantiranjan Bar, a member of the CPM-led panchayat, but he did not come, said Srikanta Mistry, a carpenter.																								We have started a murder case against the four. They are missing. The gang had an old enmity with Bablu, South 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said.

				 CM finger falls on most wanted
 RANJAN DASGUPTA																								Ranchi, Nov. 13: Ranjit Pal, the Maoist Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee accused of running arms training camps in Nandigram, figures on the CBI list of the most wanted.																								The 24-year-old from Bankura in Bengal joined the rebel ranks in the late 1990s.																								The central investigation agency is looking for him in connection with the killing of Jamshedpur MP Sunil Mahto in March. Pal had allegedly led the team of guerrillas that gunned down the JMM leader and his two guards in a football ground in Ghatshila. 																								Maoists have denied their involvement in Mahtos murder, but Jharkhand police say it was Pal who pumped the bullets into Mahto. 																								Ranjit Pal is a senior member of the Bengal-Orissa-Jharkhand (BOJ) border area committee that oversees Maoist operations in parts of south Bengal (Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore), Orissa (Mayurbhanj) and Jharkhand (East Singhbhum), a senior Jharkhand police officer said.																								The East Singhbhum police suspect that Maoists from their district frequent East and West Midnapore. During a recent raid in Patamda and Ghatshila, they stumbled on at least half-a-dozen local train tickets from Ghatshila to Mecheda in East Midnapore.																								A police officer admitted the possibility of these Maoist cadres frequenting Nandigram. There are buses to Nandigram from Mecheda.																								Pal operates under various aliases  Rahulji, Rohit, Banru and Pashupati. 																								After induction, he was active in the Tamar and Chandil areas of Jharkhand. He was made a member of border area committee apparently because of his leadership qualities.

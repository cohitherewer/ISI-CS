				 CPI sticks to Big Brother for polls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Calcutta, Dec. 20: The CPI today said it could not think of contesting the panchayat polls without the CPM, thus distancing itself from the Forward Bloc which has decided to go it alone.
																								It also ruled out an alternative Left Front minus the CPM, as proposed by the CPI(ML).
																								We urge the Bloc leadership to review its decision which can only help the Opposition. An alternative to the Left Front is a better Left Front. There cant be a forum for Left unity without the CPM either at the state or at the Centre, CPI state secretary Manju Kumar Mazumdar said today.
																								However, Mazumdar criticised the CPM for taking wrong decisions ignoring the allies. He said the CPI state conference beginning on Saturday would focus on the right course of industrialisation.

				 Test for school heads

																								Calcutta, Dec. 27: The Bengal School Service Commission today decided to reintroduce tests for the recruitment of secondary and higher secondary school headmasters from 2008.
																								The commission held the written test for the first time in 1999. The system was scrapped the following year after very few applied for the test. Headmasters were recruited through an interview to test their personality since then.
																								Commission chairman Ranajit Basu said the test would help pick better headmasters in the 17,000 state-aided schools. The process would also be transparent, he added.
																								According to Basu, over 700 headmasters would be re- cruited next year. The test is likely to be held in March. 
																								Officials said it would examine the candidates knowledge of English, school administration, rules and laws related to school education, general knowledge and math. Those clearing the exam would take the personality test.
																								We need efficient headmasters for better administration of the schools, Basu said.
																								Sources in the commission said the decision followed a flurry of complaints that inefficient teachers owing allegiance to the ruling front were being inducted as school heads.Some schools have headmasters without even the basic knowledge of English and accounts, said Ashok Maity, the general secretary of the West Bengal Headmasters Association.

				 Boy thrashed for tease protest, girl mum
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Barasat, Sept. 30: A Class XII student was punched and kicked in the head, chest and abdomen for protesting when his friends were teased by a group of youths while on their way home from tuition.																								Subhendu Mukherjee is fighting for life at the Barasat district hospital. His CT scan has indicated internal haemorrhage. 																								The Rathtala Binapani Vidyamandir student was walking with three classmates around 8pm on Friday when accosted by the youths. 																								However, Sayani Dutta (name changed), the prime target of the youths, has refused to identify the culprits, all members of a local club.																								Subhendus father Subrata, a clerk in the government college at Barasat, about 20km north of Calcutta, has lodged a police complaint.																								We have received the complaint and begun an investigation, said subdivisional police officer N. Bhattacharya.																								But the girls refusal to stand witness could hamper the probe, an officer said.																								Subrata said in his complaint three girls, including Sayani, were with Subhendu on the way back from the coaching class at Banamalipur. 																								When they were walking past Nabin Sangha, some of its members passed lewd remarks at Sayani. Subhendu protested and asked them to shut up. At this, two of the youths started abusing my son saying they had every right to hurl abuses at anyone in a public place, said Subhendus mother Subhra. 																								He was thrashed after a brief altercation. They threw my son on the road, rained blows and kicks on him for 10 minutes and fled, said Subhra.																								The classmates apparently brought him home, from where he was taken to the district hospital with pain in the abdomen and head and nausea. 																								Doctors recommended a CT scan immediately.																								Shubhendus parents were shocked to hear from the police that Sayani had denied being teased. She has confirmed seeing the boy being beaten up, but she cannot remember any of the attackers, an officer said.																								Sayani declined comment.																								My brother often escorts me to my school and tutorials. If something similar happened with me, I would have stepped forward to defend him or anyone else, said Subhendus sister Sagarika, a Class XI student in the same school.																								If women behave like this, no boy will protest against teasing in the future.

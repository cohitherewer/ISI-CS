				 Literature in class, CRPF on mind
																								Time: 11.30am 																								Place: Room No. 21 on the first floor of Nandigram College																								First-year English honours students settle down on the benches  for the first time since the Puja holidays. 																								Snehasish Maity, head of the English department, knows a lot has changed. Trucks keep hurtling in and out of the college, doubling as a CRPF camp, raising red clouds of dust as gun-toting jawans move around. 																								Maity sits on his chair, before a handful of students who barely fill the first two rows. It is supposed to be a lecture on the history of English literature but that is hardly the subject on the students minds. 																								In Daudpur, Sir, the extent of violence has been terrible, one of them blurts out as others listen to him intently. Many houses have been destroyed. Things are not fine at all, he says. 																								Others nod in agreement. Maity spends some more time listening to their stories before holding forth on the golden age of literature during the Elizabethan period (Queen Elizabeth I, 1558-1603).																								Students try to concentrate but the sight of vehicles packed with the jawans steals their attention.																								As Maity begins comparing the works of two Elizabethan stalwarts, Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, the attention flags further. Maity stops, realising the class isnt yet ready to absorb the nuances of the chapter, and calls it a day. The students are relieved. 																								We couldnt concentrate at all. How can you, with jawans and their trucks around? says a student who trudged from Hajrakata, about 6km from Nandigram town.																								Maitys class was among half-a-dozen held today. Few girls turned up and, those who did, left by 3pm. 																								Its been really difficult. Many students felt the jawans would move out and normality would return (to the college). That didnt happen, but some students came on their own today. We have to hold our internal assessment exams and the forced closures are creating problems, said principal Subhankar Tripathi.																								Inside his office, which, too, opened the first time since the Pujas, some professors ask Tripathi to ensure that the CRPF jeeps and trucks are parked outside. Others suggest that water should be sprinkled on the ground to prevent the vehicles from kicking up the dust. You can see how we are trying to run the show, said Tripathi, managing a grin.																								But not everyone is wary of the central force. Outside, some students are seen striking a conversation with the jawans.					 KINSUK BASU IN NANDIGRAM

				 Party restraint on PM
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Biman Bose																								Calcutta, Nov. 20: Biman Bose today advised Manmohan Singh to behave like Prime Minister and assured him not to worry about Nandigram but the CPM leadership appears to have decided to exercise restraint.																								Told about the Prime Ministers statement, the CPM state secretary was reluctant in the afternoon to comment, saying the central leadership will react. 																								However, the CPMs central leaders, busy in the capital with backroom parleys on the Nandigram debate in Parliament, did not issue any statement contesting the Prime Ministers remarks.																								Bose, normally quick to return fire, too, did not make any reference to Singhs comments while addressing a party rally at Birlapur in South 24-Parganas this evening.																								The CPM state secretary broke his silence only when approached by journalists after the meeting. The Prime Minister should not be worried. He should behave like Prime Minister, Bose said.																								State secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty indicated that the CPM would exercise restraint as many party leaders felt that the Prime Ministers statement reflected his political compulsions following pressure from a section of the Congress and the Opposition. 																								Our party as well as the chief minister share the Prime Ministers concerns. He was right in stressing on building peoples confidence. But it cant be done overnight and it needs a conscious effort. Trinamul Congress-led forces are preventing people from leaving relief camps, Chakraborty said.																								Embarrassed by the presence of new refugees in Nandigram, Bose told the meeting that the party would sever ties with those who try to intimidate people returning home.																								CPM veteran Benoy Konar urged party workers to close ranks against a huge conspiracy to malign us and our government as it had happened during the 1962 China war. He criticised the governor, so-called intellectuals and the high court ruling on Nandigram.																								Trinamul leader Mamata Banerjee said she had heard about the Prime Ministers statement. I shall make a comment tomorrow after carefully studying it, she said.

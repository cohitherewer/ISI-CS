				 																																	Durgapur, Oct. 15: Amin Karmakar, 52, an Eastern Coalfields assistant manager, is missing since last night when he went to see his father at his ancestral home.				 																																	His motorcycle was found parked on a road with a broken headlight not far from his fathers house in New Kenda, 5km from his Andal quarters. Karmakars family members and colleagues fear that he might have been abducted but there has been no ransom call so far.				 																																	Calcutta: This Puja is likely to be free of power cuts, Mrinal Banerjee said on Monday. Improved generation and availability of dry coal have made the power minister optimistic. There has been practically no loadshedding in the past four or five days, Banerjee said.

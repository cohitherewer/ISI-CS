				 Sack CM: Mamata
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 17: Mamata Banerjee today called on governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi and urged him to sack Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government.																								We requested the governor to sack Buddhababu as he has no moral right to continue as chief minister. Central intervention is a must for Bengal at this juncture, the Trinamul Congress chief said, a day after the high court termed the March 14 police firing in Nandigram unconstitutional.																								State Congress general secretary Jayanta Bhattacharya accompanied Mamata to Raj Bhavan, where she submitted a memorandum demanding Presidents rule.																								Mamata again urged like-minded secular parties to join her in taking on the Marxists who are out to murder democracy. Addressing a rally in Bowbazar tonight, she made a special appeal to her Congress friends to rise to the occasion.

				 RSP dithers on pulling plug
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 15: The CPM may be murderous, but the RSP cannot afford to commit political suicide by quitting the government, particularly when the CPI and the Forward Bloc are not ready to jump off Big Brothers ship.																								This seemed to be the prevalent mood in the RSP as it failed to end its three-day-long debate on a pullout at a meeting today.																								The party has decided to defer its final decision to November 29, when its state committee will meet again, 																								We have not decided to pull out yet and need to debate more as this is quite a difficult decision to take, RSP state secretary Debabrata Banerjee said.																								Party veteran Kshiti Goswami, however, stuck to his guns on resigning as PWD minister. He sought the leaderships permission to stop attending office. 																								The permission has been granted to him. But other ministers of the party will continue their work. If we decide to quit, however, all ministers will resign, Banerjee added. 																								The RSP has three cabinet ministers and one minister of state in the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cabinet.																								A debate is going on in the party and we are in a difficult situation. I wanted to resign because of growing differences with the CPM, be it on the issue of special economic zones, nuclear energy, chemical hub, Singur or Nandigram, said Goswami, who had compared Bhattacharjee to Narendra Modi.																								However, on the question of pulling out of the government, he said: I will go by the partys decision.																								Asked about the chief ministers what-a-fall jibe  hurled yesterday in reaction to Goswamis threat to resign  the RSP leader brushed it off. We should not attach too much importance to what he said apparently on the spur of the moment. We have had cordial relations for long, and I believe there is scope for understanding despite our recent political differences, he said.

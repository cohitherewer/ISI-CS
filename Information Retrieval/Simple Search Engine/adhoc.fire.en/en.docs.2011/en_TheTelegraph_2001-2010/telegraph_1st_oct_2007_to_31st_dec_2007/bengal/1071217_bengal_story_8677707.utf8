				 Threat charge on civic chief

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Midnapore, Dec. 16: A Congress councillor of the Tamluk municipality today lodged a police complaint alleging that Left-backed chairman Pritwish Nandy had threatened to abduct her after she refused to vote for him or abstain in exchange of money.
																								We received a complaint from the councillor and are investigating the matter, said S. Dey, the officer in charge of Tamluk police station. 
																								The Opposition combine of the Trinamul Congress and the Congress had yesterday moved a no-confidence motion against the Left Front, which runs the board. Recent elections to the 22-seat municipality had resulted in a tie. The voting on the no-confidence motion is scheduled to take place within a fortnight.
																								Sufiya Bibi, a councillor of ward No. 3, said in her complaint that Nandy sent his aides to her Tamluk house last night with an offer of Rs.1.5 lakh to abstain from voting. She turned them down. Since then, I have been getting threat calls on my phone saying I would be kidnapped on the day of voting. I an feeling extremely insecure, she said. 
																								Nandy, an Independent backed by the Front, denied the charges. This has been done to malign my image, he said.

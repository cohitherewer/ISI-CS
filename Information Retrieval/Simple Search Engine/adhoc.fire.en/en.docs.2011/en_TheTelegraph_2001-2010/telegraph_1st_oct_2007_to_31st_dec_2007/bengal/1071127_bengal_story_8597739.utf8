				 Buddhas blessings for a Nasreen
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee blesses one of the recipients of the education loan. (Bishwarup Dutta)																								Calcutta, Nov. 26: One Nas- reen has no place in Buddha- deb Bhattacharjees Bengal, another has.																								Nasreen Nahara, an 18- year-old from South 24-Parganas, got Rs 30,000  the first instalment of an education loan  from the chief minister today to study nursing and midwifery. 																								While blessing the Nasreens of Bengal, Bhattacharjee did not mention Taslima Nasreen, the Bangladeshi writer. 																								He only warned the audience about the dangers of a communal divide.																								Over 270 Muslim boys and girls got around Rs 1.76 crore as loan at the programme organised by the West Bengal Minority Development and Finance Corporation. The loan is to be repaid without interest within six months of the completion of the courses.																								The Sachar Committee report had revealed the plight of Muslims in employment, education and other fields in Bengal among other states. 																								We (the CPM) and some other parties are being accused of appeasing minorities. If the allegations are true, why is the condition of Muslims so bad 60 years after Independence? Bhattacharjee asked. 																								He skirted the street riots in Calcutta on Wednesday demanding the writers expulsion, but expressed his worries about sectarian violence. We want the states development, so we need peace. Disturbances in the name of religion and caste would bring doom. Bengal has a different culture, he said.																								We adore (Rabindranath) Tagore and Nazrul (Islam) not because one was a Bramho and the other a Muslim, but because of their poetic genius. Thats why we ask all divisive forces to leave Bengal, to go, he added. 																								Bhattacharjee accused the Sachar panel of failing to take into account the benefits of land reforms that Muslims had also been enjoying. Many of the teachers in the 66,000 primary schools and madarsas are from the community.																								He admitted that the number of government employees from the community was still abysmally low, but denied that the report was an eye-opener for him. The government, he said, was aware of the reality.																								Bhattacharjee ruled out job reservation for Muslims. People have raised the demand here in the wake of job reservation in Kerala. But Kerala has a different social history. The courts would have blocked the move here, he said. 																								He has doubts about the reservation pill. Experience shows such a system for Scheduled Castes has benefited the creamy layer.																								Instead, he insisted on the modernisation of madarsas and introduction of vocational and technical training in tune with the job market. 																								Studying religious texts and the Arabic language alone will not bring jobs. That is why I am asking private madarsas to include science, English and other modern subjects in their curriculum.

				 CPM conquest
 SIMI KAMBOJ																								Nandigram, Oct. 30: The CPM today struck back, snatching control of two Nandigram villages from the Opposition in a gun battle that killed one and injured another. 																								Over 200 armed CPM supporters stormed Ranichowk, Satengabari and Giribazar around noon. The men from across the Talpatti canal burnt over a dozen houses. 																								Hundreds of people from the fringes of Nandigram block II, where the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee had spread its influence after the March 14 police firing, fled home.																								Gangadhar Das, 27, was shot dead at Satengabari, apparently while marching in a procession. Sheikh Farshid, 60, was hospitalised with bullets in his shoulder.																								Monijaan Biwi ran, crying: Save my kids. As she spoke, Pratirodh Committee snipers had begun to hit back from treetops.																								East Midnapore police chief G.A. Srinivas said security forces could not be deployed in Satengabari and Ranichowk because there was none to spare. We are waiting for the CRPF.																								Bhabani Das, who was hurrying out of Jambari village with a bundle on her head and a little girl on her shoulder, said: They (the CPM attackers) have burnt our house. 																								The police told MLA Partha Chatterjee, who went to Nandigram, that they wouldnt be responsible for his security if he ventured into Khejuri. What kind of an administration is this? Do I need a passport to go to Khejuri? he asked.																								But snipers from Chatterjees side mistook his convoy for the CPMs and fired. They fled realising the mistake, allowing CPM supporters to move further into Ranichowk and Satengabari.

				 At home, only with Laden
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta																								Calcutta, Oct. 23: Mamata Banerjee is missing Laden at her new home. 																								A pup she brought to her Kalighat house from the road seven years ago was named after the most-wanted man in the world. 																								It grew up circling Mamatas feet when she sat for news conferences or greeted guests, but did not find a place when she left home with her mother last night, angry with her brothers for allegedly using her name to strike deals.																								As the pain of leaving home sank in, Mamata felt Ladens absence.																								It was a painful decision to snap ties with my brothers, sisters-in-law and particularly my nephews and nieces. But I have to stay here to be close to the larger family  the people, she said at the party headquarters  her new home  this afternoon.																								Laden will soon be part of the larger family, though, with her two birds and fish. 																								I have asked Manik (Majumdar, her personal assistant) to shift them here immediately, Mamata said.																								She had bought Laden chicken biryani on Ashtami, when the rest of the family had vegetarian fare.																								Kalighat was so much sweeter, she said. My ailing mother cannot bear the stench of untreated leather in Topsia. Drinking water is scarce.																								Let them (her brothers) be happy there. I dont want to interfere in their family life. I have been thinking of leaving home for three years and have mentioned it in my book Akante, she added.																								Trinamul sources said Mamatas brothers had been pressuring her to help them gain a foothold in the real estate business. 																								A bed and utensils were bought for her mother today. I had my dinner from outside last night. Ma cooked her own food, Mamata said.																								Several family members, including her sisters-in-law, dropped in at Trinamul Bhavan to persuade Mamata to return home. Her elder brother, whose daughter is to get married in December, called her from Ghatsila.																								But I shall not return to Harish Chatterjee Street, Mamata said. A public figure should shun family life.

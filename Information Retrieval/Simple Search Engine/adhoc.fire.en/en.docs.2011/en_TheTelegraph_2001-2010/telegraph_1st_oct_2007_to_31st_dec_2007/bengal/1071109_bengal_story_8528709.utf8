				 CPM siege on roads
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Medha Patkar																								Nandigram, Nov. 8: Nearly 10 villages in their grip, CPM workers today blocked all roads to Nandigram, preventing Opposition politicians, social activists and journalists from entering the area.																								The CPM took control of Telhali Bazar and Maheshpur Bazar last night as the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee struggled to match their rivals firepower.																								The CPM today stamped its authority by staging a march along a 6km road between Maheshpur and Tekhali. We have held a procession on this stretch for the first time since January, said Himanshu Das, the secretary of the CPMs Khejuri zonal committee. 																								Trinamul Congress MP Mukul Roy and Congress leader Manas Bhuniya had to face the wrath of the CPM workers when they tried to enter Nandigram. Armed with lathis, hundreds of CPM workers banged on their cars bonnets and smashed the windshield of Roys vehicle. 																								Around 1pm, social activist Medha Patkars convoy was stopped at Kapasberia. She also alleged that CPM men had assaulted her. 																								There were CPM men carrying red flags who blocked my car and some other vehicles going to Nandigram. I was hit in the face and they tried to pull my hair and was about to drag me out of the car, Patkar said. 																								The activist and her associates later staged a demonstration on the road.																								Raj Kanojia, the inspector-general of police (law and order), said one of the vehicles in Patkars convoy was damaged.

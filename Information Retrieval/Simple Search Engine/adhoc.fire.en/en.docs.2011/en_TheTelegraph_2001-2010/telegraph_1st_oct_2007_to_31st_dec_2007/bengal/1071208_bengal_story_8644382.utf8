				 CID probe into grave bones

 OUR BUREAU
																								Calcutta/Nandigram, Dec. 7: The government has handed over the probe into the bones dug out in Khejuri to the criminal investigation department (CID) .
																								I have issued an order asking the CID to probe the discovery of the bones, home sec- retary Prasad Ranjan Ray said at Writers Buildings. 
																								The police yesterday dug five graves the CRPF had stumbled upon and found bones, many of them burnt.
																								Ray said the bones would be sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Hyderabad for tests. People who claim the bones are those of their near ones will have to undergo a DNA test to help us match them, he added.
																								CID deputy inspector-general N.N. Pande tonight said a team had left for Khejuri.
																								Trinamul Congress MLAs walked out of the Assembly after the Speaker refused to allow Saugata Ray to table an adjournment motion demanding a discussion on the bones. 
																								The Contai court asked the police to hand over to the CBI the cases against the 10 armed CPM supporters arrested from Janani brick kiln on March 17. The agency is investigating the March 14 police firing in Nandigram. 
																								The 10 were released on bail as the police could not sub-mit chargesheets in 90 days.
																								The court asked lawyer Nilotpal Jana and law clerk Abhijeet Maity, who offered surety for the 10 bail bonds, to ensure the accused are produced before CBI officers in a fortnight. 
																								Singur chargesheet
																								Singur CPM leader Suhrid Dutta and his alleged associa-te Debu Malik were today formally charged by the CBI with murder, conspiracy and destruction of evidence in the Tapasi Malik case. Their trial will begin on January 28.
																								Tapasi, 18, was raped and murdered last December. Her charred torso was found on the Tata Motors project site.

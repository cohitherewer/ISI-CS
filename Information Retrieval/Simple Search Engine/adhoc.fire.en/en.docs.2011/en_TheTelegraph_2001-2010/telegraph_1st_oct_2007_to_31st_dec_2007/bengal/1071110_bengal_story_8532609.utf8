				 Fight to rekindle everyday fire
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Manasi Burman with her baby, born in a refugee camp three months ago, after returning to Satengabari. Telegraph picture																								Nandigram, Nov. 9: The tiled roof battered, the doors torn away from their hinges and nothing left inside  that was the home Gurupada and Jyotsna Burman returned to.																								As if a cyclone has ripped through the house, said Gurupada. 																								The man in his mid-50s scavenged the rubble in the hope of seeing something familiar and only got bomb splinters. 																								The CPM supporter had fled Satengabari with a few clothes and utensils during a Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee raid in August.																								The house has to be rebuilt. Even the earthen oven has not been spared, Jyotsna said as she poured water to make a mud mound for the hearth.																								The walls, pockmarked with bullet holes, bore a grim reminder of the battle for the obscure village.																								Jyotsna lit the oven last evening to boil rice and potatoes. 																								Over 1,500 CPM supporters who returned to Satengabari, Ranichowk, Giribazar, Keyakhali, Jambari, Kamalpur, Maheshpur and Amgechhia in the past two days would have similar stories to tell.																								Most of them are farmers, sharecroppers or farm labourers who couldnt sow the winter crop, aman.																								Sunil Burman, 32, who was away from home for more than six months, wondered what he will do now.																								Before leaving the relief camp, we were given a few kilos of rice and some pulses and potatoes. This will last us a week or so. What next? 																								His wife Manasi gave birth to a girl at the camp. She is three months old now. 																								The first job will be to repair the house, or the cold will kill the baby, said the mother.																								CPM leaders have promised help. Well help our supporters repair houses and provide rice, pulses and vegetables till they are settled, said Himanshu Das, the Khejuri zonal committee secretary.

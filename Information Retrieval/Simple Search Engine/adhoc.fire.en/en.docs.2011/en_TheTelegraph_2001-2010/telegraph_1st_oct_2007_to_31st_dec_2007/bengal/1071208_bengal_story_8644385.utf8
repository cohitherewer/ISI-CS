				 Law to bar leaders from owning ration shops 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Calcutta, Dec. 7: The government will introduce a law or issue an order preventing elected peoples representatives from selling or distributing ration.
																								Food minister Paresh Adhikary told the Assembly today: I am aware of reports that there was unnecessary intervention in the functioning of several ration shops. So, our government has decided to frame a new law or issue an order denying ration distributorship or dealership to elected peoples representatives. 
																								Panchayat samiti and zil-la parishad members will also not get licences. For that, Adhikary said, the panchayat department is going to issue a notification.
																								Several pockets of south Bengal had erupted in the past few months in protest against hoarding and blackmarketing of foodgrain meant for ration shops and political patronage for dealers. CPM leaders in Bankura, Burdwan and Birbhum were beaten up and many ration dealers godowns were looted and ransacked.
																								The minister, a Forward Bloc MLA, apparently faced resistance within the government while planning the new restrictions. I had been trying to take this decision to cut down political intervention but faced several odds. It (the law) could be a small beginning (in stemming the rot), he said in the lobby later.
																								However, the new law or notification may not immediately have a provision to prevent family members of elected representatives from getting a licence, food department sources said.
																								There are about 20,000 ration dealers and 6,000 distributors in the state. According to the minister, the number of elected leaders on that list could be less than 1 per cent.
																								Those on the list will cease to be dealers or distributors once the law is enacted.

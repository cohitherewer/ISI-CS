																								Siliguri, Dec. 30: A holiday crowd and regular passengers with reserved tickets were stranded here this morning as one of the two toy trains to Darjeeling was cancelled because of a snag.
																								The cancellation of toy train 3D, which leaves Siliguri Junction at 10am, resulted in angry scenes at the station as around 50 passengers blocked the tracks and prevented 1D (departure time 9.30am) from pulling out. 
																								The other train for the day  the DHR (Darjeeling Himalayan Railway) Holiday Special that starts for the hills at 11am on weekends and holidays  was also delayed.
																								We had booked our tickets well in advance and came here to enjoy our weekend on the toy train. But instead, we were the victims of total mismanagement, said Subrata Sarkar, a resident of Hakimpara in Siliguri, who was with his wife and children.
																								The passengers were finally accommodated in two extra coaches  one added to 1D and the other to the Holiday Special. 
																								We put 48 passengers in the additional coaches, said DHR director Subrata Nath. The two trains left over an hour after their scheduled time.
																								The director said 3D was cancelled because of a technical fault, but refused to elaborate.
																								The pair of toy trains, 1D and 3D, run from Siliguri to Darjeeling daily and can accommodate around 65 people each. They reach Darjeeling in the evening. 
																								Winter weekends see many people reserve seats on the regular trains along with the Holiday Special and today being the last Sunday of 2007, there was an even bigger crowd.

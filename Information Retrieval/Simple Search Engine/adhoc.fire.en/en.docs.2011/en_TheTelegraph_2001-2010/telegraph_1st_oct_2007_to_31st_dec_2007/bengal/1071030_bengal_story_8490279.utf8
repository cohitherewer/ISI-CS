				 Leaders fight, we people die
 							 - Woman shot in her house recounts the curse of life along the canal SIMI KAMBOJ				 	 Caught in the crossfire? A woman in Nandigram. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha 																								Tamluk, Oct. 29: Golab Garu has nothing to do with either the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee or the CPM. 																								The 60-year-old woman was hit by a bullet while standing in her house on Saturday, caught in the crossfire like hundreds of ordinary villagers in the war zone  the Nandigram-Khejuri border.																								At Ranichowk, Golab could hear gunshots and small explosions. Some were loud and some not so  depending on whether they were fired from her side or Khejuri.																								I bolted the doors and sat with my husband when my sons wanted to see how far away the explosions were taking place, Golab said from her bed in Tamluk district hospital. 																								Her sons opened the door and peered out. I was behind them. Suddenly, there was a sharp pain in my leg and I collapsed, Golab said. She was shot in her right calf. 																								For the Garus and many like them, Durga Puja had brought hope of peace, though only just. 																								There was no firing during those four days, but we didnt dare go out. Living along this canal (Talpatti, which divides Nandigram and Khejuri) is a curse. The political leaders fight and common people like us die, said Golabs daughter in law Arati. 																								The young woman said the family has been living on muri (puffed rice) since the violence escalated on Thursday.																								Arati works as a maid in a doctors house in Khejuri and earns Rs 30 a day. She has not gone to work for several days now.																								Gopal Garu Das, who came home for the Puja vacation, is in hospital now after being burnt in a bomb explosion. He was walking home from Tekhali Bazar after watching a video show early on Sunday morning when the attack took place.																								There was a flash with a loud hissing sound. I must have passed out after that. I regained consciousness in hospital, he said.																								The show, in which a Bengali film was screened, had been organised for CPM supporters guarding the area against possible attacks from the other side. 																								Doctors could not say when Gopal can go back to work in a Howrah saw mill.																								His family had fled Nandigram in February.																								We took shelter at the Janani brick kiln near the canal. There are about 300 of us in that camp, he said.

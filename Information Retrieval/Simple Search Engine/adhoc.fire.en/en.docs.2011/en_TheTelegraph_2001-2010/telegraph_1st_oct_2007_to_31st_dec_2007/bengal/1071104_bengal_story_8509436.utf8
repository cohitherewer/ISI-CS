				 Bail breather for Sweety
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sweety and Rakesh after the ruling. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								Howrah, Nov. 3: Sweety Sahu got interim bail today after a Mumbai police team decided not to take the risk of making her travel to Maharashtra as she was ill.																								The police team did not seek her transit remand. 																								The police team had arrested the 20-year-old yesterday following a complaint filed by her Mumbai-based father accusing her of theft. She had fainted twice yesterday  before and after being taken to the Golabari police station.																								Sweety had married Rakesh Sahu, a resident of Abani Dutta Road in Howrah, in March this year. Their families were neighbours. 																								Her well-to-do father, Hanuman Mal Tater, did not approve of the match and began piling pressure on Rakesh, an assistant cashier, to part with Sweety.																								Tater moved to Mumbai in April as director of a financial firm. He coaxed his daughter into going with him for a few days and then barred her from returning to Calcutta.																								When she ran away from home, Tater moved a Thane court and sought her arrest on the charge of stealing money and jewellery. The court ordered police to produce her by November 17. 																								The Howrah additional chief judicial magistrate granted interim bail to Sweety on a Rs 1,000 bond, but she has to surrender before the Thane court by November 17. 																								Sweety said she was happy to get bail but was worried about going to Thane with Rakesh. My father has threatened to kill my husband if he visits Maharashtra. My father is trying to break my marriage using his political connections and money, she told reporters.

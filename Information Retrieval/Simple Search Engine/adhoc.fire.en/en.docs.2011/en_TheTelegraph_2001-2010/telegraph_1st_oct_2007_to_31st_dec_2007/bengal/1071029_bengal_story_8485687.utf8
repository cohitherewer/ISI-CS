				 When will peace come back? Mamata mum
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha																								Nandigram, Oct. 28: The old and frail Aimana Biwi stretched out a hand towards Mama-ta Banerjee today and asked: Ma, will peace not return to our place again?																								The Trinamul Congress leader walked out of the small hut in Garchakraberia, 170km from Calcutta, without uttering a word.																								The 65-year-old Aimana lost her son Kayum to a bullet yesterday. When she spoke in between wails, Aimana clutched her three grandchildren  three boys and a girl aged between 9 and 15.																								Peace will not return to Nandigram unless the people of Bengal come out on the streets in protest, Mamata told about 2,000 villagers who had gathered at Garchakraberia bazaar.																								Take to the streets and resist the CPM, she exhorted her audience.																								Mamata reached Tamluk from Calcutta around 10 last night. She started for Nandigram around 12.30 this afternoon, after having heard the news of the explosion at Sherkhanchowk and the gunfights.																								The CPM is preparing itself for a big assault. It wants to take control of Nandigram. Arms are finding their way into Khejuri from Bihar and Jharkhand, Mamata alleged.																								CPM supporters tried to block her way by placing logs across the road near Reyapara. Mamatas car came to a halt amid Go back slogans.																								But police and Rapid Action Force jawans dispersed the mob. 																								The five-car convoy reached Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee convener Sheikh Sufiyans house at Samsabad around 1.40pm. She left for Garchakraberia after a meeting with committee leaders around 2.30.																								Around 3.30pm at Garchakraberia, at least 6,000 people had assembled amid tension following reports of gun battles from Takapura, Ranichowk and Kamalpur. Mamata held a public meeting there.																								We demand the immediate intervention of the Centre and a full-fledged CBI probe into the goings-on in Nandigram. Resist the CPM with your life. This is a struggle for your life, thundered Mamata.																								Around 4.30, she heard about an exchange of fire near Tekhali and started for the spot. The cars stopped a few hundred metres ahead of the bridge on hearing gunshots. 																								Mamatas supporters spotted a bullet on the ground and the leader alleged that there was an attempt to kill her. This is nothing but an attempt to kill me.

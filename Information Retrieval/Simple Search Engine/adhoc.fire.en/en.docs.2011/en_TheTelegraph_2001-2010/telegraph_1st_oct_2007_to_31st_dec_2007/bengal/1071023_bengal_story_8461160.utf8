				 Duo on bail kill boy
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Howrah, Oct. 22: A three-year-old boy was kidnapped at gunpoint and throttled to death in a Howrah village, allegedly by a duo facing murder charge because his father and grandmother had testified against them.																								Sheikh Jahiduls body was found floating in a pond at Kashmul village around 7am yesterday.																								Police said Jane Alam Mollah and Astiar Mollah, 35, were arrested in August last year for allegedly killing Ashraf Mollah over a property dispute. 																								Jahiduls father Sheikh Jalal, a mason, and grandmother Sarbila Bibi had seen Ashraf, 35, a small businessman, being hacked to death on a village road. It was on the basis of their statements that Jane Alam, his brother Manirul and Astiar were picked up. 																								The police said Ashraf had tried to mediate in a property dispute in which Jane Alam had claimed a plot as his. 																								Jane Alam and Astiar returned to the village immediately after being bailed out on October 13 and started pressuring Sarbila and Jalal to withdraw from the case.																								Around 2am on Saturday, Jane Alam, Astiar and their associates came looking for Jalal. When his wife Amirunnisa told them he wasnt there, Jane Alam whipped out a revolver and took Jahidul away.																								They told me to produce my husband before them within two hours and threatened to kill me if I raised the alarm, said Amirunnisa.																								A preliminary investigation has revealed that the child was killed by miscreants who wanted to take revenge against Jalal and his mother as they were witness to the murder case, Howrah superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said.																								The mother and son were determined to stand witness, the police said.																								Jalal said the goons had given him two days to decide what to do. I told them that we were determined to see Ashrafs killers behind the bars.																								The father alleged that the police did not act on the abduction complaint. 																								Ive asked additional SP (rural) Dipnarayan Goswami to inquire into the allegation, Singh said.

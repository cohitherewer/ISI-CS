				 Molester in class
																								Bhagabangola, Nov. 7: A Class VIII girl of a Murshidabad school has accused her headmaster of molesting her in class and threatening her against speaking out.																								Shajahan Ali, who teaches English, apparently assigned some classwork to the students and groped the girl on the last bench. The headmaster of Bahadurpur School here, 240km from Calcutta, is also the CPM local committee secretary.																								My friends were writing with their heads down. Sir sat by my side and molested me. When I protested, he slapped me, took me to his office and told me I should not utter a word outside, the girl told police.																								Her mother said the headmaster had tried to molest her daughter before. She protested only when she became desperate.																								A CPM local committee member allegedly went to the girls house to ask her family not to lodge the complaint. We went to the police after we started getting threats, the mother said.

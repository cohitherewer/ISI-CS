				 Q: Is Brand B intact? A: Of course, it is
														 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee 
				 at Writers rsquo;. (Bishwarup Dutta)																								Excerpts from a question-answer session that followed the media briefing by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee																								Q: What do you think about police being kept idle while CPM cadres recaptured Nandigram?																								CM: The police moved into areas where it was possible. Some places were totally inaccessible to the police. Their movement was restricted to Nandigram police station and adjoining areas.																								Our men had been out of their homes for months and were desperate to return, so they used their might. I didnt want a repeat of the March 14 incident and so was not in favour of sending the police there. 																								Q: Are you justifying the action of the armed CPM cadres?																								CM: What about the role of the BUPC (Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee)? Were they unarmed? Who were the ones harassing our people over the past 11 months? Our party men were threatened, harassed and killed by their men. Our men were desperate. They have been paid back in their own coin. Ekhon oneke bolchhe shashaner shanti; gato egaro mash ki shorgiyo shanti chhilo? (Many are now saying this is the peace of the graveyard. For the last 11 months, did a heavenly peace reign)?																								Q: As chief minister, dont you think that the BUPC supporters are also to be looked after by you?																								CM: Of course. But what about the committee members you are talking about? Were the people ruling Nandigram a peaceful lot? With arms and weapons, they had attacked our men over months. Because of that, the retaliation took place.																								Q: As chief minister, you find nothing wrong with such recapture?																								CM: Legally or morally?																								Q: Both ways																								CM: I have only one answer. I wanted to avoid such an incident. I would say again that the government had always tried to avoid a situation that could have led to a repetition of the March 14 incident. But there were attacks from the other side and hence they were paid back in the same coin.																								Q: Do you think the CRPF can handle the Nandigram situation which your police couldnt?																								CM: Had the CRPF come earlier, we might have been able to avoid such a situation. The state police do not have the training the CRPF has. Their (the CRPFs) early presence was a must as the state police were not being able to counter so much weapons and gunfire from the BUPC men.																								Do you know that CRPF personnel have found two mines and some rifles in that area. In the first week of November, we had expected the arrival of about 600 CRPF personnel. We had thought that 400 Eastern Frontier Rifles personnel would work in collaboration with the CRPF and that would have restored normality in Nandigram much earlier. The Opposition also agreed to this proposal. But there was a big delay in sending the central forces.																								Q: Did the delay in the arrival of the CRPF lead to the recapture?																								CM: It is not quite like that. We were not sending our police (into Nandigram) and the homeless remained homeless. On the other hand, the CRPF was not coming. Our men could no longer tolerate being outside their homes and hence turned desperate.																								Q: Why was there a delay in CRPF deployment?																								CM: Throughout September and October, we had dialogues with the Opposition for a political solution. Before the Pujas, we had the last meeting. But after that, the eviction process began in Nandigram II block.																								So we decided to request the Centre for CRPF deployment. We gave a letter to the Union home ministry on October 27. On November 5, we got a reply stating that the Centre would not be able to send the CRPF because of the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh polls.																								Then I talked to (Union home minister) Shivraj Patil and told him that we immediately required the CRPF. I asked him why the CRPF was being held back. I also talked to Pranab Mukherjee. 																								On November 10, I was told that the Centre was sending the CRPF. Eventually, they arrived on November 12 and went to Chandipur but their movement was disrupted because of the bandh. 																								Q: Do you think Maoists are present in Nandigram?																								CM: A Maoist group came from Jharkhand. One Ranjit Pal came with a gang armed with rifles and mines and moved into Sonachura and Garchakraberia. They provided training, too. Now they cannot be traced. But they came and we have proof. The CRPF personnel have found two mines and some rifles. 																								You should realise that the dimension changes when the BUPC is joined by Naxalites. That becomes a real threat. So, I am sticking to my Maoist reports. 																								Q: Is the Nandigram crisis over?																								CM: Crisis? I think Nandigram will be normal in two or three days. Cutting across political differences, I appeal to those staying in camps to re-turn home and get engaged in normal life. All police cases will be gradually withdrawn, except murder and rape cases. 																								Q: Did you talk to the Prime Minister?																								CM: The Prime Minister is in Moscow and so I cant talk. (Manmohan Singh called the chief minister soon after the briefing.) I had a talk with the home minister. And, for your information, Advaniji went to Nandigram today and came back. I am glad that he went. But its good that he didnt undertake a rath yatra. Good there was no rath.																								Q: Are you aware that people and the Opposition are demanding your resignation?																								CM: It is my misfortune that people want me to step down.																								Q: In some quarters, you are being compared with Siddhartha Shankar Ray.																								CM: Im surprised. Maybe, they didnt know him (Ray) properly also.																								Q: Do you think the Nandigram incident is a blot on your career as chief minister?																								CM: I dont think so. Since the trouble erupted, investment proposals have been coming. Some investments were realised, while some were in the pipeline. But nobody said that we would not come to Bengal because of the trouble going on here. But in such cases, wrong messages do go to the other side. I appeal to you (the media) to ensure that no such wrong messages are sent.																								Q: Do you think Brand Buddha is intact?																								CM: Of course. My brand is intact. It cannot roll back.

				 Bomb death at SSKM
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 28: A man injured by bomb splinters in Nandigram earlier this month died in the city today. 																								On November 6, a mob allegedly attacked Sheikh Sulemans house at Sonachura. 																								They were CPM supporters who came from Khejuri, across the Talpatti canal, said his widow Halema Bibi. They were firing and then banging our door.																								The attackers allegedly burst a bomb when Suleman went to the door. He was hit in the abdomen. 																								Suleman, 50, had an infection in the wound when he came to Calcutta. We conducted an operation but the infection spread, said Ashok Ghosh, the medical superintendent of SSKM Hospital.																								My father did not belong to any political party, said his son Belal, who has been in the hospital with his mother since November 8. 																								Thirty Nandigram resi- dents have been admitted to SSKM with bullet or bomb injuries since March 14. Suleman is the first one to die.

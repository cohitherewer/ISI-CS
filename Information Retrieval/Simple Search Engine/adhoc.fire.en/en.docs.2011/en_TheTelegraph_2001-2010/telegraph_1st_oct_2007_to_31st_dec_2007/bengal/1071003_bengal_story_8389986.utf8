Pictures by Aranya Sen																								Krishnagar, Oct. 2: A Trinamul Congress panchayat chief and a panchayat samiti member in Nadia have been arrested for assaulting an elderly widow who went to the block development officer for flood relief. 																								The duo wanted the relief to be routed through them, but the woman told the officer it wont reach her during her lifetime because leaders were useless.																								Nakashipara village panchayat chief Azai Sheikh and samiti member Sukumar Modak were picked up from their houses, about 130km from Calcutta, following a complaint lodged by Rezina Bewa, 55.																								She walked into Subal Mahajans office last evening and said her hut was damaged in the floods but she had not received any help  not even a tarpaulin sheet  from the panchayat. 																								Azai and Sukumar were in Mahajans office. The BDO said they became angry at the allegations and tried to turn her out of the room hurling abuses at her. The panchayat leaders wanted the relief to be routed through them. But the woman shot back, saying they were useless. If I rely on you, I wont get it during my lifetime, Mahajan said.																								The woman was slapped in front of several officials. They beat me up and pushed me to the floor in the BDOs chamber, said Rezina. 																								I was taken aback by the way the widow was treated and called police, Mahajan said.																								Local people helped Rezina to Nakashipara police station, where she lodged a complaint. 																								The duo were held on charges of assaulting and molesting the widow, said officer-in-charge Pintu Saha. 																								Trinamul supporters led by local MLA Kallol Khan blocked National Highway 34 and gheraoed the local police station from 9pm yesterday to 3am today protesting against the arrests.

				 Jackpot for Nadia priest
 RABI BANERJEE				 	 Rabindranath Chakraborty at home before leaving for Sharjah. Telegraph picture																								Krishnagunj, Oct. 23: A village priest who never went to school flew to Sharjah to conduct the first community Durga Puja in the emirate.																								Fifty-five-year-old Rabindranath Chakrabortys family believes he has hit the jackpot. 																								The man who earned Rs 800 a month was contracted for Rs 50,000, plus the promise of clothes, tips and calls every year.																								Rabindranath, of Durgapur village in Krishnagunj, 130km from Calcutta, left for the Gulf a week before Puja because preparations had to be made for the Goddesss Gulf debut.																								This was not Chakrabortys first Durga Puja, though. With his son, he managed two near his village  for around Rs 5,000 and some rice and dal. 																								I earned Rs 800 a month performing pujas in shops and small temples. The foodgrain lasted around six months, said Chakraborty.																								A village boy who left for Dubai as a daily labourer in the early 1980s and made money in Sharjah as a contractor brought the windfall.																								During a holiday in native Durgapur, Ananda Biswas was moved by the plight of a man he once looked up to as an elder brother.																								Ananda came to me last month and could not hold back his tears. He rang up others from Bengal in Sharjah and told them he would take me there as a priest. I felt I just won a lottery, Chakraborty said.																								The farmers son lost his parents before he was 21 and inherited about an acre. He tried his hand at farming, but failed. Then he opted to become a priest. 																								Despite the lack of school education, Chakraborty could eke out a living thanks to the Sanskrit he learnt from a local pundit as a child.																								I sold my land to marry off my two daughters, said Chakraborty.																								His son Milan, 22, has studied till Class VIII. Milan helps his father, but did not get the ticket to Sharjah.																								Ananda Biswas, the president of the Puja committee in Sharjah, said: This year, we got the clearance from the local authorities to hold the Puja. We organised it in our community hall. About 1,200 Indians participated. 																								He wants Rabida there every year.

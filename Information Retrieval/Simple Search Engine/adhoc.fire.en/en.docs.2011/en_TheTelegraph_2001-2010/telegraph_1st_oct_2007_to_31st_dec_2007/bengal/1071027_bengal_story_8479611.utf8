				 Ration shop owner puts leaders in mob hands
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Oct. 26: A ration dealer scooted this morning telling villagers he had left the Rs 14 lakh they had demanded at the party office in a Burdwan village, leaving its leaders to face the wrath of the mob.																								Three CPM leaders were tied up and thrashed at Bhatakul village. One of them was forced to sign an undertaking that the party would take the responsibility of collecting Rs 14 lakh from the dealer and distribute it among villagers. 																								This is the second time in about three weeks that CPM leaders were attacked over the ration crisis in Burdwan, a party bastion. A mob had dragged MLA Pradip Tah and other leaders from a meeting at Nababhat near Burdwan town and thrashed them on October 7.																								About 1,500 people went to Asim Goswamis house last night, charged him with not supplying foodgrain for 11 months and sought Rs 14 lakh. 																								Asim Goswami admitted cheating villagers and agreed to pay Rs 11 lakh today, said Mohammad Irfan.																								When the villagers came to Asims shop around 10.30am today, he told them he had left the money with former panchayat chiefs Sukumar Mondal and Bhanuprasad Chowdhury. When villagers went looking for them, Asim closed his shop and fled.																								Eight CPM leaders, including Sukumar and Bhanuprasad, who were huddled in a house, denied receiving any money and the mob became furious. Realising the potential danger, the leaders tried to flee. But the villagers caught Sukumar, Bhanuprasad and Raju Sheikh, a DYFI leader. 																								Their hands and feet were tied before they were bundled into a room. Sukumar was made to sign the undertaking.																								The police came after the leaders had been released. 																								Mondal has been hospitalised, said the local OC.

				 CPM eyes cop action
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 6: The CID interrogation of Ajoy Kumar and Gyanwant Singh, a day after Jyoti Basus indictment of the police commissioner, brought relief to those CPM leaders who feel the government needs to act fast to douse public anger in the Rizwanur Rahman case.																								Opinion in the party is, however, divided on whether chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will take immediate action against commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. 																								Although the party leadership has been saying no one will be spared if found guilty, the CID dithered for days before interrogating the two deputy commissioners.																								I wont comment on what Jyotibabu had said. But action will be taken against all those found guilty even if they are IPS officers, state CPM secretary Biman Bose said today. Bose has asked party leaders not to make public statements on the Rizwanur case.																								Those CPM leaders who saw todays interrogation as the result of party pressure on the chief minister to act felt heads may roll within a week. 																								We feel it is possible the two IPS officers may be transferred after the chief minister gets the CID report. Some action against the commissioner is also possible, particularly in view of the defiant tone of his refusal to step down after Basus reproach, a CPM minister said. 																								I have better things to do than resign, Mukherjee was quoted as saying yesterday.																								Several party leaders saw this as an affront to Basu, who had earlier disapproved of the commissioner contesting CAB polls. Bhattacharjee had backed Mukherjee then.																								But others ruled out the immediate removal of the commissioner and the two deputy commissioners. The chief minister cant afford to remove three crucial officers just before the Pujas and Id when law and order and anti-terror vigilance are the governments main concerns, a party MP said.

 BRIEFS
				 																																	Chennai, Nov. 28: At least four tourists from Bengal were killed on their way to Rames- waram this morning.				 																																	They were part of a 36-member group trave-lling in three minibuses from Madurai. The sec- ond crashed into a tamarind tree in Ramanathapuram district, about 100km from Rameswaram. Local residents and passengers of the third bus pulled the injured out. The first bus had sped away. 				 																																	Seven people have been hospitalised. The victims could not be identified because of language problems but those who died are believed to be from Calcutta. Police said the tourists were led by Dubesh Banerjee of CR Avenue. 				 																																	Calcutta: Mamata Banerjee on Monday called for a secular democratic front after a meeting attended by a Congress leader. Our objective is to float a progressive, secular, democratic front of anti-CPM forces. All are welcome, she said. Asked if the BJP was also invited, Mamata said: The front will carry the name secular. She announced a trip to Singur on December 2 and Nandigram the day after.				 																																	Durgapur: Security guards at the state-owned Durgapur Projects Ltd shot dead a trespasser on Monday and injured his associate. The duo were allegedly part of a gang stealing coal.

				 Buddha brands Asim orthodox
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 26: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee finds his finance minister very orthodox.																								Speaking on high taxes that have troubled the hospitality industry, the chief minister told a convention of the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Association of India: I had a talk with our finance minister about your taxation. But as you know, we have a very orthodox finance minister, like most finance ministers.																								Asim Dasguptas orthodox taxation measures include a luxury tax of 10 per cent on tariff exceeding Rs 500.																								A tariff of Rs 500 cannot be categorised under the luxury bracket anymore. The tax has hit hoteliers very badly, said Rajesh Mishra, the hotel association president.																								Economist Abhirup Sarkar said: I would tend to agree (that Dasgupta has been orthodox) as we have witnessed few changes in the budget in 20 years. His every speech sings the same note  criticism of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.																								Bengal is a classic case of Laffers Curve, added Sarkar, who is with the Indian Statistical Institute. Invented by Arthur Laffer, the curve illustrates how increased tax rates lead to reduced collection.																								The luxury tax for restaurants in the state has jumped 666 per cent from Rs 300 per 10sqm to Rs 2,000 at one go.																								He (Dasgupta) keeps worrying about how to mobilise funds but I told him that it is very important to have a balanced view of sectors which have such scope for employment generation like hospitality, the chief minister said.																								Sarkar echoed the need to create more jobs in sectors like hospitality.																								Dasgupta was earlier famous for zero-deficit budgets in which expenditure and revenues match. Economists see it as a paradox in a state that has huge debts.																								Bengals ratio of tax collected to the state domestic product is one of the lowest in the country  even less than Bihars 4.46 per cent.

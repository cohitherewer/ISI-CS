																								Calcutta, Dec. 8: The Executive Recruiters Association (ERA) today brainstormed on how Indian companies could make optimum use of available human resources.
																								The recruitment industry is going through a boom where demand is higher than supply, said associate director Pramod Thilakan at a national conference organised by the ERA, the industry chamber formed five years ago in association with The Telegraph Jobs.
																								The idea of the conference was to ascertain whether we are fulfilling the requirements of this boom.
																								Patton managing director Sanjay Budhia, PricewaterhouseCoopers director Ambarish Dasgupta and the HR head of Reliance Communications, Jayanta Saha, were among those who attended the meet.
																								Headquartered in Mumbai, the ERA has chapters in Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune and Ahmedabad.

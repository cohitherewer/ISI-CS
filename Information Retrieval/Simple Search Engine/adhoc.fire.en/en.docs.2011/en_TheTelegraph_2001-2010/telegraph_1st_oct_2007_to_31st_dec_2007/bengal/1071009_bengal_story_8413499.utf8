				 Farm retail proposal
																								Calcutta, Oct. 8: The Forward Bloc-controlled agriculture marketing board proposes to do what Reliance would have done: buy farm produce directly from farmers and sell it.																								Board chairman Naren Chatterjee said he has sought Rs 100 crore from the chief minister for the project. 																								Officials said a pilot project would be launched in North 24-Parganas and in Haldibari in north Bengal. North 24-Parganas is the biggest producer of vegetables. Haldibari is prolific in tomatoes and green chillies, said agri-marketing secretary Bimal Pande.																								The Bloc is opposed to the Reliance Retail plan, though there is no law to prevent the company from doing business. The agricultural produce marketing (regulation) act doesnt allow the state board to buy from farmers. Thats why we will involve self-help groups and provide them the infrastructure, said Chatterjee.

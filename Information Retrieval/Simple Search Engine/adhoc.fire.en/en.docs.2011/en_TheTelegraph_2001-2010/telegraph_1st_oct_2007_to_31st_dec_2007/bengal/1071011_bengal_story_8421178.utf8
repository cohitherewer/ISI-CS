				 Kid dies in flood camp, blame on health team
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, Oct. 10: A three-year-old boy died in a flood relief camp yesterday allegedly because health workers did not bother to take him to hospital.																								Subhodeep Karmakar, the son of a labourer, had been suffering from severe gastro-enteritis since Sunday. 																								But paramedics  who made several trips to the relief camp set up in a school at Billogram in Nadias Nakashipara, about 120km from Calcutta  did not take notice, villagers in the camp said. 																								Block medical officer Vivek Das said the paramedics should have informed him about the boys condition. We could have arranged a vehicle to bring Subhodeep to hospital. He died apparently of acute gastro-enteritis. The child also suffered from malnutrition, Das said.																								However, the health superviser at the Billogram panchayat, Chhabi Dey, said she had called the doctor on duty at the Nakashipara block hospital and told him about the boy after visiting the relief camp. 																								But no action was taken, Dey said.																								Subhodeeps father Bablu tried to take him to the nearest hospital, 8km away, but could not arrange for transport.																								It wasnt easy as the area around the relief camp is under waist-deep water. A cycle van driver charged me Rs 150, said Bablu. 																								The labourer could not afford to pay the amount and had to watch his son die.																								District chief medical officer of health Mrinal Kanti Biswas said he has ordered a probe. Action will be taken against those found responsible.

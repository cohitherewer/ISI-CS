				 Mamata vows to settle scores
 PRONAB MONDAL																								Nandigram, Dec. 3: Mamata Banerjee swore revenge during her first visit to Nandigram since the CPMs recapture of the region last month. 																								A day will come when CPM supporters will have to hang posters on their chests saying we are not CPM supporters, she told a gathering at the Nandigram college grounds. 																								State Congress general secretary Jayanta Bhattacharya was on the dais when Mamata said: Jara nrishangsha bhaabey atyachar korchhe, aami jodi benche thaki, taader ek ek kore dekhe nebo (If I live long enough, I shall set-tle scores, one by one, with those carrying out this brutal oppression).																								The Trinamul Congress chief, however, asked supporters still staying away to ret-urn home. Dont be afraid. Im with you. Return to Khejuri and let me know the situation there. Id like to spend a few days there. 																								The wound of Nandigram will fester in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees heart, she said. The CPM has actually failed to recapture Nandigram since it could not conquer the villagers hearts with their bullets. This is a wound Buddhababu will have to carry in his chest for the rest of his life.																								Mamata will lead a procession in Delhi on Wednesday to protest against the violence. I will leave for Delhi tomorrow. We want to spread our movement against the Nandigram violence across the country, she said.																								A group of women, who lost family members when the police opened fire on March 14 and in the violence that followed, met Mamata. 																								Barnali Singh of Southkhali described how a peace rally at Maheshpur came under fire on November 10. I and my husband Balaram were in the procession. Suddenly the firing started. CPM cadres pounced on us and dragged him away. I dont know where he is, said the mother of two. 																								Mamata vowed to return on January 3, the first anniversary of the anti-acquisition movement in Nandigram.

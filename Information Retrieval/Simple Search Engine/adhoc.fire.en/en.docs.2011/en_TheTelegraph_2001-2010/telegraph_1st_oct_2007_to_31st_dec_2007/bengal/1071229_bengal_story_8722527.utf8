				 New panel for madarsa jobs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								Calcutta, Dec. 28: A school service commission is being set up to exclusively recruit madarsa teachers.
																								Teachers for the 506 state-aided madarsas in Bengal were so long recruited through one test that picked teachers for all secondary and higher secondary schools. 
																								There was no separate recruitment procedure for madarsas because these institutions were treated on a par with other schools. But the government recently granted minority status to madarsa schools. 
																								According to the law, the existing School Service Commission cannot recruit teachers for minority institutions, said minority affairs and madarsa education minister Abdus Sattar.
																								The government had tabled a bill in 2006 to include recruitment of teachers for minority schools under the purview of the West Bengal School Service Commission Act. 
																								Christian missionaries, who run 700 state-aided schools in Bengal, took to the streets in protest and forced the government to scrap the bill.
																								Sattar said the Christian schools would continue to recruit their own teachers. 
																								The government would set up a temporary committee for the recruitment of madarsa teachers in 2008. 
																								That committee would be replaced by the Madarsa Sc- hool Service Commission by the end of the year, the minister said.
																								The decision to set up the new commission, Sattar said, was taken in consultation with representatives of the community so that there was no infringement of the madarsas minority rights.
																								The number of madarsa teachers is expected to double as the government opens 500 new institutions in the next two to three years. There are about 10,000 madarsa teachers now.
																								The 2008 recruitment test for madarsa teachers would be held in February. The new committee would send admit cards to those who opted for madarsas in the School Service Commission exam.

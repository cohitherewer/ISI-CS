 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Oct. 5: The government today distanced itself from the comments made by police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee on the marriage of Rizwanur Rahman and Priyanka Todi.																								No, no, the government does not endorse the statement made by the police commissioner. There is no question of doing so, home secretary P.R. Ray said.																								Two days after Rizwanur was found dead, the police chief had called a short-lived media conference at which he described the reaction of the Todis as natural and seemed to cast doubts on the compatibility of couples with different financial and social status.																								Ray said the police commissioner would be summoned by the CID if required.																								Not just him and DC (headquarters) and DC (detective department), but DC (south) and the officer-in-charge of Karaya police station also appear to be involved in the incident. There are specific allegations against some other officers whom I dont want to name. They, too, might be summoned. If required, the two (ACP Sukanti Chakraborty and his junior Krishnendu Das) might have to be re-examined, the home secretary added.																								Ray said it was not right on the part of the police to become involved in the marriage of two individuals.																								Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee said it was clear from Jyoti Basus announcement of action against two police officers that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had little say in government affairs.																								Mamata said: Its shocking.... Since the veteran leader is not part of the government, even a lay person will understand that its the CPM and not Buddhababus administration that has taken the responsibility to decide whom to take action against. That shows how the government has been hijacked by the party.																								However, housing minister Gautam Deb said the party has given the chief min-ister a free hand to book the culprits. We have full faith in him, Deb said.

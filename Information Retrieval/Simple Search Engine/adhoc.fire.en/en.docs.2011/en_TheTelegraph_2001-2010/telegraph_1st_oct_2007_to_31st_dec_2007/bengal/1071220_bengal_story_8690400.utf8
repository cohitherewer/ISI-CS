				 Judicial activism tempers in Assembly

 A STAFF REPORTER
																								Calcutta, Dec. 19: A CPM member today sought to put on record his misgivings about judicial activism, days after the Supreme Courts remarks triggered a debate. 
																								Rabindra Nath Mondal tabled a non-official motion in the Assembly, which is moved by MLAs and not ministers. Such motions  largely symbolic gestures meant to convey messages  are a familiar feature on the last day of a session.
																								The apex court had last week said judges should not try to run governments.
																								Trinamul Congresss Saugata Roy said: The CPM is keen on the discussion as the government has got several raps from the high court of late.
																								The Speaker, Roy added, cannot allow the discussion as the case is subjudice.
																								Its not, said Mondal. The motion has to be discussed because the judiciary is interfering in the functioning of the legislature and the executive.
																								CPM leaders Biman Bose, Benoy Konar and Shyamal Chakraborty are facing contempt charges for questioning the high courts order for a CBI probe into the police firing in Nandigram. A day after the March 14 firing, it had taken suo motu cognisance of the case. 
																								The inquiry into Rizwanurs death went to the CBI from the CID because of the court. 
																								Law minister Rabilal Moitra said: Judicial activism must not become judicial adventure. Judges should not cross their limit.

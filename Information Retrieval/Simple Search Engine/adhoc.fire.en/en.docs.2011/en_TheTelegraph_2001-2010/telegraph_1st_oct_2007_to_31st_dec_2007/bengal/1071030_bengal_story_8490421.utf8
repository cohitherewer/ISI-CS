				 Unidentified object in Calcutta sky 
																								Calcutta, Oct. 29: A Calcuttan has claimed to have seen a multicoloured spherical object shining bright in the eastern sky for around three hours from 3.20am on Monday.																								Farhan Akhtar, who lives near the Eastern Bypass, captured the object on a handycam from his 10-floor flat. 																								The object, at a 30-degree angle on the horizon, changed itself from spherical to triangular to rectangular.																								It vanished when daylight appeared, Akhtar said.																								Debiprosad Duari, the director of research and academics at MP Birla Planetarium, said the object could be a remnant of a comet called Holmes that broke up on October 24. But we cant be so sure because the direction and the timing that Akhtar has mentioned does not match our calculations. If it is indeed a remnant of Holmes, it should have been seen in the western sky at the mentioned time and also 60 degrees above the northwest horizon.																								However, Duari said the matter needed to be investi- gated. If the direction that Akhtar is saying is correct, it is an object that has never been seen before.

				 A Hindu celebrates Id: after roza, before Puja 
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN				 	 Kabir Chowdhury (right) during an iftar. (Debasish Biswas)																								Behrampore, Oct. 14: Kabir Chowdhury observed roza (day-long fast) for a month, held iftars (to break the fast) and celebrated Id today. He is a Hindu.																								The owner of a humble stationery shop in this town believes Indians should learn and appreciate all customs and cultures.																								Kabir, 48, has lived up to his name. The 15th century poet-saint who bears the same name sang the ideals of humanity as one and the path of natural oneness with God.																								Kabir Chowdhury visits the local mazaar (tomb of Muslim saints) and offers flowers regularly. He also takes a leading role in organising Durga Puja in his neighbourhood, Khagra.																								For many in Behrampore town, 200km from Calcutta, he is the symbol of harmony.																								I did not observe the roza to show how secular I am. I did it because I believe in national integrity. I dont differentiate between Hindus and Muslims, he said.																								His wife Kasturi said Kabir followed the Ramazan regulations seriously.																								He woke up at 3.30am and ate before daybreak and again after sundown.																								At his shop, he wore the skullcap while breaking his fast with his employee, Wasim Parvez.																								Ive been observing the customary fast during Ramazan for seven years. I suffer from high blood pressure and a month of restrictions makes me fitter, said Kabir.																								Kasturi woke up early in the morning with Kabir and made three rotis, which he had with half-a-litre of milk.																								He was so sincere that I had to help him, she said.																								Members of Nutan Para Club, which organises the Puja, heaped praise on Kabir. 																								He loves both religions and even more the people. He observes the Ramazan rituals and helps us organise the Puja, said Puja committee secretary Amit Saha Chowdhury.																								Maulvi Obaidur Rahman appreciated Kabir for his love for Islam. Its encouraging, he added.

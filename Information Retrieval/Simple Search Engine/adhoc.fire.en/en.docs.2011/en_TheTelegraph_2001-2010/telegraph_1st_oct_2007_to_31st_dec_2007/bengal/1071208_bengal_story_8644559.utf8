				 Torture blamed for torn family

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
				 Rashi Dutta Bhatia with her daughter. (Dipankar Chatterjee)
																								Burdwan, Dec. 7: The young woman whose husband yesterday accused her father of not letting her return to him today said she used to be tortured at her in-laws place.
																								Rashi Dutta Bhatia had married medical representative Debjyoti Dutta against the wishes of her rich father two-and-a-half years ago. 
																								Today, she said: My mother-in-law did not give me proper food. My husband used to pressure me to bring money from my father. He tried to assault me once.
																								When Rashi, 22, narrated her plight in her house here, her motor parts dealer father Sushil sat by her side. I tried my best to adjust with my husband, but in vain. So, I ultimately decided to quit my in-laws home, the woman said.
																								She has lodged a complaint against her husband and his parents at the Burdwan police station. Inspector-in-charge Pranab Mitra said: We have started a case against Debjyoti, his mother Jyostna and father Pradyut. Well arrest them.
																								The torture charge against the Duttas is non-bailable.
																								In June 2006, Debjyoti, 27, allegedly forced Rashi to lodge a police complaint against her father. I can speak Bengali, but cant read or write the language. He forced me to sign the complaint without telling me it was against my father for threatening him, she said. 
																								The torture increased after their daughter was born this April, Rashi alleged. 
																								Debjyoti had said he had left his wife and daughter at his in-laws before Diwali. Rashi called it a lie. 
																								She must have been tutored by her father, the husband said today.

				 Ray pushes for Mamata tie-up
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ray with Das Munshi on Wednesday. Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, Oct. 10: Siddhartha Shankar Ray today made another attempt at uniting the Congress and Mamata Banerjee.																								I am 88 and cannot move properly. I want Priya (Priya Ranjan Das Munshi) to start a dialogue with Mamata (Banerjee) immediately to forge a Congress-Trinamul Congress tie-up to fight the ruling CPM in Bengal, the former chief minister said this morning.																								Before the 2006 Assembly elections, the Congress veteran had asked his party and Trinamul to join hands. 																								Asked to comment on Rays statement, Mamata said she was yet to be told about what Manuda has said. We are ready for elections like other parties and will take a decision on an electoral alliance when the time comes. 																								The Trinamul chief said the Congress should not surrender to the CPM to cling to power at the Centre. I dont find any reason behind the Congresss surrender to the CPM, which has no credibility. 																								Mamata had earlier said she was ready to join forces with the state Congress but only if it severed links with the CPM.

				 Teenager run over in rush for Puja funds
 							 - Extortion, allege lorry drivers OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 An artisan working on an idol in Nadia. (Amit Biswas)																								Burdwan, Oct. 15: A Puja organiser was run over today on a stretch in Burdwan where truck drivers had been speeding for the past few days to escape extortion in the name of Durga.																								Police said Sanjoy Das Thakur, 19, was killed when a group of boys tried to stop the truck on the Katwa-Bolpur road in Ketugram for subscription.																								The truck dragged him for about 200 yards, before speeding away around 11.30am. 																								Sanjoy was declared dead at the Katwa Subdivisional Hospital.																								The police located the truck at Baron in Murshidabad, about 15km away, a few hours later. We have arrested its driver, Soham Singh, said Abu Selim, the inspector in charge of Ketugram police station, about 180km from Calcutta.																								Selim admitted knowing that some youths stop trucks for Puja subscription in his area.																								Dilip Barik, an executive committee member of the Kandra Sarbojanin Puja Committee, also admitted that some of its young members asked for money from truck drivers. But we never extorted money, he said. 																								Several hundred trucks ply though the road everyday. Dipankar Mukherjee, a member of the local truck owners body, alleged that the youths were forcing each driver to pay between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. 																								Such extortion was earlier common before Kali Puja, organised by local toughs in many places.																								The CPMs Ketugram local committee secretary, Farooq Mirza, claimed that he had warned the club time and again against taking subscriptions from trucks. Sanjoys death before the festival season is unfortunate, but if he had only heeded my advice.																								The teenager was the second among three unemployed sons of Babu Das Thakur, who sells lottery tickets.

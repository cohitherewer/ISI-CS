				 CPM man smuggles ration rice
 OUR BUREAU																								Oct. 16: CPM and RSP supporters attacked police in a Nadia village around midnight yesterday when the force tried to seize rice that a CPM leader and ration dealer was trying to smuggle.																								Some residents of Kalirhat, 75km from Calcutta, had called the police to say that Dulal Ghosh was shifting rice that he had hoarded to a godown.																								Ghosh fled seeing Kotwali inspector-in-charge Sunil Guha arrive with a team. 																								But a mob surrounded the police and asked them to go back. The cornered policemen resorted to a lathicharge but were greeted by brickbats. Reinforcements from Krishnagar chased the mob away.																								Five RSP and CPM supporters were arrested. The CPM refused to admit that its cadres had tried to defend their leader, but said in the night that Ghosh has been suspended. 																								RSP district secretary Shankar Sarkar said: The police tortured our supporters, who protested against the harassment of the ration dealer.																								Nadia police chief H.K. Kusumakar said 950kg of rice has been seized. Well arrest the dealer if required.																								In Gosaba, South 24-Parganas, villagers forced two dealers to promise Rs 1,000 and free rice for at least six months to each cardholder. At Kakdwip, residents of Bapujinagar, 70km south of Calcutta, looted 1,700kg of rice from a godown. The police, however, retrieved the foodgrain with the help of local CPM supporters.																								At Writers Buildings, ration dealers threatened to go on a strike from Monday if they were not provided security.

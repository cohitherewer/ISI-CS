				 Minority civic pill
																								Calcutta, Nov 27: The municipal affairs department today said civic bodies in areas with over 25 per cent minority population must especially ensure that the communities benefit from their projects.																								Minister Asok Bhattacharya said: We have often seen that the minority population remains deprived. So we have categorically asked the municipalities with over 25 per cent minority population to prepare an action plan for this purpose.																								Several municipalities in South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Murshidabad fall in the 25 per cent bracket.																								To begin with, they have been told to pay special attention to drinking water supply, drainage and sewerage, issuing of birth and death certificates and health check-ups.																								The chief minister had asked all departments to form a task force following the Sachar Committees indictment of the government for lack of efforts in minority uplift.																								The municipal department task force met for the first time today. Review meetings will be held every three months.

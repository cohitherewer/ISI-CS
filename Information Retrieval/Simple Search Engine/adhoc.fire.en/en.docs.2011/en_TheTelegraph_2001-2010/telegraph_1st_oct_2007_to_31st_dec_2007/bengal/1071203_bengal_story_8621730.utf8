				 Suicide after kiss
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Barasat, Dec. 2: A forced kiss from a classmate apparently drove a Class IX girl to death in North 24-Parganas yesterday. 																								Fifteen-year-old Bandana Mondal hanged herself from her dupatta at her home in Beliaghata, hours after she was grabbed and kissed by a boy of her own class yesterday. 																								She was climbing the stairs to reach her first-floor class. 																								Police said Bandana had complained to headmaster Motaleb Ali about the boy, but he allegedly scolded her.																								The headmaster denied the charge.																								We have started a case against the boy after the girls uncle lodged a complaint saying she committed suicide because of the humiliation in school. The boy is missing, said a Deganga police officer.																								Bandanas father Ashok, who repairs electronics goods, said his wife and younger daughter had gone to a neighbour when Bandana hanged herself yesterday afternoon.

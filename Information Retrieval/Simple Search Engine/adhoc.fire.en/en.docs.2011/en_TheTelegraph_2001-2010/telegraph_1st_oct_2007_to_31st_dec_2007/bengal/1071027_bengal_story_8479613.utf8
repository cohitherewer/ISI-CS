				 Blast under jeep claims bus woman
																								Midnapore, Oct. 26: Suspected Maoists triggered a blast under a paramilitary jeep in Belpahari today. 																								Most jawans escaped unhurt as the explosive went off under its bonnet, but Pramila Hansda, 27, who was in a bus some 50 metres behind, was killed.																								A bullet hit her in the mouth during the gun battle that followed the explosion. She died on the way to Calcutta for treatment tonight.																								Splinters hit a man on the roof of the bus. Two others, who were inside, were hurt. 																								The West Midnapore police chief said the jeep was going to a camp near Banspahari, 220km from Calcutta. 																								The jawans had a providential escape, he added. The only jawan injured had a bullet grazing his right arm.																								The police found blank SLR cartridges, which suggested the rebels used sophisti-cated weapons. We have spotted three more improvised explosive devices on the road. The area has been cordoned off, an officer said.

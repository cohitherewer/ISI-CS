				 Land hurdle to shipyard
																								Geonkhali, Oct. 26: The Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee today reversed its stand of holding direct talks with investors to sell land and decided not to part with it, come what may.																								The government needs around 400 acres for a shipyard in which Rs 2,000 crore is to be invested in 10 years.																								We had decided to deal directly with the investors on the assumption that it would fetch us a better price. But we changed our decision realising that those who leased land for cultivation will suffer, said Satyen Maity, the convener of the committee here, 140km from Calcutta.																								Trinamul Congress MLA Subhendu Adhikary, who led a procession today, said the government could take land at Jelingham, near Nandigram, where Burn Standard Company has acquired 2,500 acres for another shipyard. 																								Govt staff on strike																								Government employees and teachers will go on strike on Tuesday. 																								They are demanding cancellation of a new pension scheme and the right to strike.

				 Dealer held, rice in hand
 OUR BUREAU																								Krishnagar/Calcutta, Oct. 15: A ration dealer was caught allegedly smuggling rice meant for the poorest of poor to a vegetable sellers godown in a Nadia village last evening.																								Ashit Biswas of Nalupur in Krishnagunj, about 120km from Calcutta, and Lakshman Ghosh, who works in his shop, have been arrested. 																								Police said they were shifting 350kg of rice to Gopal Ghoshs house in adjoining Khatura village. 																								The rice was to be distributed among below-poverty-line families under the Annapurna and Antyodaya schemes.																								Gopal, the vegetable seller, is absconding. Police have sealed his godown and seized five jute bags of wheat. 																								We detained Ashit and Lakshman yesterday but took them into custody on the charge of pilfering rice meant for public distribution today, said Santanu Ghosh, the officer in charge of Krishnagunj. 																								Kartick Haldar, who runs a vegetable store opposite the ration shop, said he had protested against what Ashit was doing. But he said do what you can. I have good contacts with the police. 																								Haldar called the Krishnagunj police. I got angry when Biswas said nobody could do anything to him, he said today. 																								The rice had been packed in 50 gunny bags and put on a rickshaw van, when the police raided the place. 																								We intercepted the van and took it back to Biswass shop where hundreds of people had gathered to protest against blackmarketing on foodgrain, a police officer said.																								At Haroa in North 24-Parganas, about 200 people stormed the block development office where a meeting was on with ration dealers and representatives of political parties. 																								The meeting ended abruptly as the villagers went on the rampage. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has called a meeting on Wednesday to work out steps to control the ration riots and spiralling prices of vegetables. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, food minister Paresh Adhikary and panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra will attend the meeting.																								RSP leader and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said there appeared to be a nexus between ration dealers and food department officials.

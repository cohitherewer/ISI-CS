				 MAOIST EXECUTION: TIED TO A TREE amp; A BOMB
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 The CPM leaders body and the improvised explosive device (circled) next to him. Picture by Pradip Mahato																								Purulia, Nov. 20: A band of Maoists called a CPM leader out of his house in Purulia last night and shot him.																								The murder is the fourth strike by the rebels in four days to protest against the CPMs Nandigram offensive. 																								The residents of Ghatbera village, who did not dare to venture out last night, found Sufal Mandis bullet-ridd-led body this morning. An improvised explosive device was tied to a tree under which it lay on a field. The IED hadnt exploded.																								Purulia superintendent of police Ashok Prasad confirmed that a gang of 20 Maoists in army fatigues had gunned down Mandi, 42, a member of the CPM local committee at Ghatbera village near Balarampur, about 370km from Calcutta.																								The rebels took Mandi to the house of Prafulla Mondal, a farmer, to ask if he had a revolver. When Prafulla said he had none, they burst bombs in front of his hut and raided the house of Ajit Mondal, the CPMs Ghatbera branch committee secretary. Ajit denied possessing arms. 																								The next destination was the house of rice mill owner Nilkamal Mondal, where his son Abani said there was no gun at home. The rebels set their ground floor ablaze. 																								Nilkamals other son, Aswani, opened fire from his licensed double-barrel gun and the Maoists fled to the house of Santosh Mondal and threatened to kill him if he did not snap ties with the CPM.																								A while later, the villagers heard gunshots at a distance.																								In Calcutta, home secretary P.R. Ray said the murder was the handiwork of a Jharkhand-based Maoist squad. 																								The assailants left behind posters decrying the Nandigram incidents. 																								A 48-hour south Bengal bandh called by Maoists to protest against the CPMs recapture of Nandigram is under way. The bandh, Ray said, was total in West Midnapore. 																								However, he denied the hand of Maoist Ranjit Paul, whom the chief minister had accused of running arms training camps in Nandigram, in Mandis murder. 																								Railway tracks were blown up in Birbhum yesterday. A panchayat office was ransacked in West Midnapore the day before and another blasted on Friday.

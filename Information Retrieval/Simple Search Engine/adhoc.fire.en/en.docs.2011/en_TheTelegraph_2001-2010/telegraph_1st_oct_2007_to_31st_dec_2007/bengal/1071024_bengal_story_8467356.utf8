				 Frame-up cry over boy body
 OUR BUREAU																								Oct. 23: Minister Rabin Ghosh today claimed the three-year-old boy believed to have been murdered in a Howrah village over the weekend had died of thalassaemia and his body was dumped in a pond.																								The accused, Jane Alam Mollah and Astiar Mollah, are supporters of the Forward Bloc, the ministers party. Ghosh is the local Uluberia MLA.																								The police, Ghosh said, were called several hours after the boy was allegedly kidnapped from his house around 2am on Sunday. It is a frame-up to malign my party, which controls the local panchayat and the Uluberia municipality.																								The minister claimed one of Sheikh Jahiduls brothers had also died of the disease. 																								Sheikh Jalal, however, denied ever losing any son before Jahidul. My son didnt have thalassaemia, he said.																								His sons alleged killers had apparently been threatening him for testifying against them in a murder case.																								Howrah police chief N.K. Singh had yesterday said Jahidul appeared to have been strangulated. Astiar has been held.

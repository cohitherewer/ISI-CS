				 Cuffs for married kids

																								Behrampore, Dec. 27: A Class VIII boy has married a Class VII girl in the same Murshidabad school where a student had stabbed a junior when she spurned his marriage proposal.
																								The newlywed children have been arrested along with the girls father Mujibar Sheikh, brother Nazir and maternal uncle Giasuddin Sheikh, who allegedly helped them get married.
																								Police said the 15-year-old boy had been courting the 13-year-old girl for over a year. They knew each other as residents of Baruipara village, about 215km from Calcutta.
																								On December 22, when Baruipara High School was shut for Id, the girl took the boy to her uncle Ramzan Sheikh and got married in front of an imam, said Dipak Das, the Hariharpara officer-in-charge. They could be jailed for up to three months. 
																								The school, 15km from Behrampore town, hit the headlines only 10 days ago when a Class XI boy stabbed a Class VII girl nine times before gulping down pesticide in an empty classroom. Both the boy and the girl survived, but the boy was booked for attempt to murder.

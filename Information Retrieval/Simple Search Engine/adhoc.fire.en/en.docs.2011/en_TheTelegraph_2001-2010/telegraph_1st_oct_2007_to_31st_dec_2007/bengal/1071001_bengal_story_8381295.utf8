				 Patience tip to Reliance
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Sept. 30: Industry has expressed concern at the possible fallout of the dismissal of Reliance retail employees on eastern Indias image and advised the company to be patient.																								Biswadip Gupta, the eastern region chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said he was baffled why the company was being singled out. Reliance is in trouble while other retailers are doing well. I really dont know why.																								He expressed concern over the fact that barring Uttar Pradesh, most instances of vandalism had been reported from states in the east. We are concerned why such outbreaks are taking place in the east. May be the people are more sensitive to the farm sector here, Gupta said. 																								The companys move also came under criticism. Term- ing the layoff unfortunate, Gupta said Reliance should not take hasty decisions. 																								Retail is a sensitive issue. People have to be patient, he said.																								German retail firm Metro Cash amp; Carrys plans in Bengal have been stuck for a while but the company has shown patience. 																								The Retail Association of India is expected to hold a meeting next week to draw up a plan to increase awareness about organised retail in the eastern states. 																								We want to help state governments formulate awareness programmes. Such problems arise primarily out of ignorance about the organised retail format and it leads to knee-jerk reactions, said Gibson Vedamani, the association president. 																								He said the association has sought appointments with the state governments.																								Saddled with the baggage of the past, eastern states needed the economic boost which organised retail could bring about by generating employment, Vedamani said. 																								The association has also decided to carry out a study of the retail format.																								Labour secretary Subesh Das said he had come to know about the Reliance move only today. We can intervene if the employees approach us, he added.

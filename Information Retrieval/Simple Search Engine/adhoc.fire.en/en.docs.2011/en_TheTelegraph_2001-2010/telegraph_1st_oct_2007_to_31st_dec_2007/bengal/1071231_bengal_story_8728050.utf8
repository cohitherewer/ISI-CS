				 Health centre open but doctor missing

																								Midnapore, Dec. 30: Residents of 20 East Midnapore villages depend on three nurses and an attendant for treatment at a health centre where the lone doctor has little time to attend to patients because of other assignments.
																								Gynaecologist S.S. Burman was posted at the six-bed Gobra Primary Health Centre at Ramnagar, about 250km from Calcutta, in June 2006. 
																								He said: I have to attend at least three camps a week to carry out ligation operations. I also have to oversee laparoscopy training programmes in several districts. So, I have little time to attend to patients at the health centre.
																								Villagers accused Burman of not mentioning his most important assignment: attending to patients in two nursing homes. The doctor denied the charge. 
																								The reality is that nearly 200 patients who visit the health centre on any given day are prescribed medicines by the nurses and sometimes even by the general duty attendant.
																								The nearest alternatives are the Digha State General Hospital, 10km away, and the Contai Subdivisional Hospital, about 30km from Gobra.
																								On November 20, Sujata Das of Gobra village was admitted to the health centre with labour pain under the care of the nurses and attendant. 
																								Her husband Sanjib said: I wasnt at home. My family members got her admitted to the health centre after the nurses promised to take care of her. 
																								After the baby was born, the attendant, Kripanath Samanta, asked for Rs 500 from the family to buy medicines. But instead of providing her with medicines, they only gave her a bottle of saline. When her condition deteriorated, the health centre employees panicked and suggested that she should be shifted to the Contai hospital, said Sanjib. Sujata, 23, died on the way to Contai.
																								Burman had apparently gone to Karimpur in Nadia to oversee a laparoscopy training programme that day.
																								The health centre should have provided the medicines to Sujata, who had suffered heavy blood loss during delivery.
																								Hundreds of people here would have similar stories to tell.
																								Purna Chandra Das of Mahajan village said a boy who was bitten by a snake was similarly referred to the Contai hospital by the nurses after his condition turned grave.
																								Taking a patient to Contai is both difficult and expensive, said Das.
																								An elderly nurse, who did not want to be named, said: We have to bear the brunt of relatives anger.
																								Rabindranath Mishra, the assistant chief medical officer of health in the district, refused to attach any importance to the complaints. The incidents you are talking about are exceptions. Nursing staff here are competent enough to handle maternity cases.
																								Mishra even stood by Burmans long absence from the health centre. The allegation about Burmans association with nursing homes is baseless. He has to attend several government-sponsored programmes. 
																								Nurse Shyamali Samanta, however, said: We can only manage minor cases. Patients suffer in the absence of a doctor. 
																								Chinmoy Patra, the local CPM panchayat chief, corroborated what many villagers said: Burman skips hospital to attend to patients at nursing homes in Bajkul and Digha.

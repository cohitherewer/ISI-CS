				 Party in control, patriarch toes line
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 9: The party appears to have spared the chief minister the dilemma over whether to order a police crackdown by snatching away much of Nandigram from Trinamul without getting the men in uniform involved. 																								If the police had gone, they would have had to open fire again, party patriarch Jyoti Basu said today after the meeting of the state secretariat. 																								The last police action in Nandigram had claimed 14 lives on March 14. 																								Basu had disapproved the firing along with the Left Front partners. He also wanted the resumption of talks with Mamata Banerjee and asked the chief minister to defer the deployment of central forces.																								Today, he sounded like accepting the partys armed offensive to reclaim Nandigram as fait accompli. There is no need for a state-level peace meeting now. Ive been told today that the police would move in and set up camps to restore peace. Im happy that peace meetings are being held at the district level and homeless people from both sides are returning. Let them pursue their political beliefs while staying together. The unused panchayat funds for development should be used now.																								The party was cautious about admitting a replay of Keshpur, where its armed squads  organised from several districts  outgunned Trinamul after an almost two-year war for supremacy.																								The partys Keshpur hero, Sushanta Ghosh, now a junior minister, was summoned to the secretariat meeting today. 																								Weve finally spoken the language they understand, said secretariat member Benoy Konar. 																								Fellow secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty insisted that the homeless people  and not the party  were compelled to take up guns after months of suffering. 																								The state party leadership, which had distanced itself from Basu after his public disapproval of central force deployment, today quoted him while saying that their treatment of the vanquished would be different from Trinamuls. 																								Jyotibabu had criticised Trinamul for forcing our supporters to join them. We wont do the same to them, Chakraborty said. 																								He admitted, though, that CPM supporters on their way home have torched some of their opponents homes. 																								RSP leader Kshiti Goswami said the CPM was imposing peace at gunpoint. 																								The Forward Blocs Ashok Ghosh felt no durable peace is possible without political consensus.																								Konar reacted by saying that the CPMs allies had been supporting the Trinamuls cause for some time.

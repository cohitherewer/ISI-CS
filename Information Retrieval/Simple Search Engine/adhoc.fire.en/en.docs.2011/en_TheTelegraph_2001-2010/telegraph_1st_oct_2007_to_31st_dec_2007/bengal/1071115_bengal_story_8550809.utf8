				 State help not enough, says CRPF
 BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA																								New Delhi, Nov. 14: The Centre is not satisfied with the state administrations level of co-operation with the CRPF, sources in the Union home ministry said today.																								The DIG who led the personnel into Nandigram could not spend the night there because of lack of arrangements and help from the local administration. He had to go back to the base headquarters 65km away, in Tamluk, and return in the morning, an official said.																								Home minister Shivraj Patil today reviewed the Nandigram situation. Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi has been keeping him updated. 																								Home secretary Madhukar Gupta, special secretary (internal security) M.L. Kumawat and additional secretary (Centre-state) Anita Chaudhary were among those who discussed the ground situation and the options before the Centre. 																								It was decided that the state has to make optimum use of the personnel at its disposal for the time being. 																								Anyway, maintaining the sensitive state-Centre equa- tion is a tightrope walk for a central force. It derives its authority from the local administration and police. The force cannot create its own security grid, the official said.

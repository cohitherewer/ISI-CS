				 Mamata to lead march from Singur
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 15: Mamata Banerjee today said she would lead a padyatra from Singur to Nandigram on December 2.																								The Trinamul Congress has also lined up nearly 1,000 rallies between November 17 and 26 across the state to expose Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Stalinist politics. 																								There will be no let-up in our movement against the chief minister who has murdered democracy in Bengal. We shall spread our agitation to other parts of the country to expose Buddhababus Stalinist politics, Mamata said after chairing a party meeting at Trinamul Bhavan this afternoon. 																								Trinamul sources said Mamata convened todays meeting to boost the morale of the party rank and file, who were demoralised after armed CPM cadres recaptured Nandigram.																								It was also decided that Trinamul leaders would visit Nandigram every alternate day with relief materials to enthuse party workers and members of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee.

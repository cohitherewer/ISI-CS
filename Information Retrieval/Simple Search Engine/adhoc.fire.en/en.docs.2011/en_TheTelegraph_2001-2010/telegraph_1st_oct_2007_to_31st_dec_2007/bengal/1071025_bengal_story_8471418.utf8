				 Image boost in family split
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT			Mamata rsquo;s paintings at the party office		Calcutta, Oct. 24: Mamata Banerjee has gained politically by snapping ties with her brothers, political circles here feel.																								The brothers were allegedly trying to strike deals using her name and looking for a foothold in the real estate business.																								Mamatas decision has indeed helped her gain a political mileage, said RSPs Kshiti Goswami. 																								Many of our leaders used to stay in party communes. If Mamata stays away from her family, it would send a good message to her supporters, he added. 																								Mamata left home with her mother on Monday night and went to the Trinamul Congress head office on Topsia Road. Several Trinamul MLAs have congratulated her since for the pragmatic decision.																								Didi has done the right thing. Her brothers were exploiting her, said a supporter from Canning, South 24-Parganas.																								One of the brothers for whom she left home, Swapan Banerjee, 32, was hospitalised today with chest pain. Swapan carries a pacemaker. 																								Mamata enquired about his health.																								Rash Behari MLA Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay said: Mamata dithered for years before leaving home. She was really disturbed there. Now she can devote more time to the party.																								Another MLA, Jyotipriya Mullick, who has been staying at the party office to express solidarity with his leader, said the decision has enhanced her clean image. 																								It is a step in the right direction, said the Congresss Somen Mitra.

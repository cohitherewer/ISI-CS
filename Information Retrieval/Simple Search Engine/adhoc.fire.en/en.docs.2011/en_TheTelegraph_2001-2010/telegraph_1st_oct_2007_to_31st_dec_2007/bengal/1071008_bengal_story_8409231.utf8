The Save Farmland Committee said the verdict at Hakimpur-Tulsicharan High School for boys, about 20km from the Tata Motors project site, was a reflection of the peoples disappro- val of the governments forcible acquisition of farmland. Some of the parents and teachers representatives had voted in the election. Singur CPM zonal secretary Srikanta Chatterjee said the cause of the defeat was being analysed.

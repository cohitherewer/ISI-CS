				 Mamata wants Buddha dismissed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT			A CPM roadblock during the Nandigram-Khejuri bandh		Nandigram, Oct. 29: Bullets rang out at Ranichowk and Takapura along the Nandigram-Khejuri border this afternoon and continued into the evening.																								The general secretary of the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind, Siddiqullah Chowdhury, finished his speech in a hurry near Ranichowk and headed elsewhere as the shooting began.																								A gathering of 3,000 people thinned in an instant after two shot were heard from Khejuri, across the Talpatti canal.																								Chowdhury went to Maheshpur, inside Nandigram, and held another meeting there.																								The CPM is attacking in a planned manner. You have to resist with all your strength, he said.																								A day after alleging that her convoy had been shot at, Mamata remained cooped up in a Contai hotel. She could not have entered Nandigram as the CPM observed a 12-hour bandh in protest against an alleged attack on its supporters on Saturday midnight. The four killed, however, were said to have been making bombs at Sherkhanchowk.																								Mamata demanded central intervention to end the violence, the chief ministers dismissal and a CBI inquiry into the firing on my convoy and the Sherkhanchowk blast.																								Nandigrams border with Khejuri should be sealed and central forces deployed, she told a news conference. 																								My convoy was fired at and the chief minister should admit it. If I was not attacked, please tell me where the bullet came from?																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee dubbed the allegation baseless. Home secretary P.R. Ray said: We are finding out whether any firing occurred at all.																								Mamata left Contai for Calcutta around 9.30 tonight.																								Houses burnt																								Pratirodh Committee convener Abdur Samads house and 10 others were allegedly set on fire near Ranichowk tonight. The CPM called the incident disgraceful.

 Friday, October 04, 2002 				 Probe sees Rajdhani sabotage 
																								New Delhi, Oct. 3 (PTI): A railway inquiry into the Rajdhani Express mishap that killed over 100 people last month has concluded that the derailment was caused by sabotage.																								The preliminary report of the commissioner of railway safety (Eastern circle), Mahesh Prasad, supports the sabotage theory floated by railway minister Nitish Kumar immediately after the derailment. 																								The claim was hotly contested. Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani had ruled out sabotage and Bihar strongman Laloo Prasad Yadav said the accident was the result of poor maintenance of tracks and the century-old bridge on river Dhawa from which five bogies fell.																								The railways had maintained that the bridge had not been identified as distressed.																								Nitish Kumar today said he had not seen the report but that he knew from the moment he went to the derailment site that it was a case of sabotage. 																								Laloo Prasad rejected the report. We still stand by our statement that negligence was responsible, he said.

 Wednesday, October 02, 2002 				 Salman fails death-ride drink test 
 															- Traces of blood in actors blood were beyond permissible limit: Police  OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Salman 																								Mumbai, Oct. 1: Three days after a man was crushed to death under Salman Khans car, it has been proved that the actor was drunk at the time of the Saturday morning crash.																								The medical test conducted on Salman almost 10 hours after the incident has revealed traces of alcohol in his blood that were beyond the permissible limit, joint commissioner of police Javed Ahmad said this evening. There were fears that the test would fail to produce any evidence of alcohol because of the time lapse.																								In his statement to Bandra police, the actor had claimed that he had not taken any alcohol that day. Salman also denied that he was driving the Toyota Land Cruiser when it rammed into a Bandra bakery and ran over five sleeping pavement-dwellers, killing one.																								Even before the alcohol test results came in, some people had given their verdict against the actor. About 50 demonstrators from various organisations protested outside Salmans Bandra Band Stand home today, calling him a murderer and a drunkard. Perched on the gates of the nine-storeyed building, demonstrators from the Nirbhay Bano Andolan shouted: Salman Khan khuni hai, Salman Khan bewra hai. Salman Khan ko attack karo. 																								The protests continued for about an hour. How can Salman Khan be only charged with reckless driving when a man has been killed? How can he be released on bail of Rs 950? How is it that almost a whole day passed after the accident before Salman turned himself in? asked Alex Demello of the Voice of the Exploited. 																								Salman should pay compensation to the families of the dead and the injured. But not even has someone from his family visited the injured in the nearby hospital, he added. 																								If it was a poor man instead of Salman Khan who had accidentally killed somebody, he would have had to face a lot more difficulty, said Sanjay Randive of the Nirbhay Bano Andolan. 																								The BJP joined the protests, with its youth wing announcing it would hold statewide demonstrations from tomorrow outside cinema halls showing films starring Salman. The party has demanded the actors arrest and dismissed as farce the probe ordered by deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal into the incident.																								BJP youth wing chief Madhu Chavan also demanded a probe into Salmans alleged links with the underworld.																								An autorickshaw driver from the area summed up the popular mood. Yeh bade log kuchh bhi kar lete hain. Lekin is baar usko chhorna nahin chahiye.

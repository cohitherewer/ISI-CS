Dr Hari Krishna also insisted that Delhi police were not threatening or harassing him.																								Questions are being raised as to why Krishna did not elaborate the statement in a TV interview he gave after the supposed encounter on November 3 involving two alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba militants.

 Monday, December 02, 2002 				 Bihar border vigil for Godda
 GAUTAM SARKAR																								Godda, Dec. 1: The district administration is determined not to let terror come in the way of elections.																								The states chief secretary, home secretary and director general of police are scheduled to arrive tomorrow to inspect the security arrangements for the upcoming poll.																								Hopefully, no party should use the gun on election day fearing retaliation, an official said. However, the very presence of strongmen like RJD legislator Sanjoy Yadav, state rural development minister Pradeep Yadav and JMM leader Suraj Mondal has made this parliamentary constituency highly volatile.																								Chief minister Babulal Marandi, reportedly influenced by BJP candidate Pradeep Yadav, directed an official at the Ranchi headquarters to gear up to face large-scale violence during polling.																								We are concentrating on the borders of Bihar as the area is considered to be the haven of criminals. We will not take any chances, district superintendent of police Baljeet Singh said. 																								Singh, who has been visiting Panchwara bridge and other areas bordering Bihar in the Mahagama segment, has deployed additional forces to prevent outsiders from creating trouble.																								It was the chief minister who asked DGP R.R. Prasad to take immediate measures to curb cross-border movement of the supporters of a powerful legislator, a senior police officer said.																								Sanjoy Yadav, RJD legislator from the Godda Assembly segment, has been virtually terrorising the entire region. He also started bringing in antisocials from Bihar. We fear a major incident may take place in the coming days, a BJP activist said, requesting anonymity. 																								When Marandi visited the constituency to campaign for the poll, BJP leaders had told him about Sanjoys power game. 																								Opposition parties, however, are accusing the BJP of playing up the issue. The ruling party wants to create terror in my name. In view of its sure defeat, it has started mobilising police forces to prevent the people from voting for me, Sanjoy said.																								Opposition leader Stephen Marandi criticised the poll arrangements saying they will spread terror in the voters mind in this peaceful constituency.

 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 CM brother gets bail
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Sept. 19: Chief minister Babulal Marandis younger brother Nunulal, who allegedly manhandled an executive engineer of the building construction department on the Giridih court campus yesterday, has obtained bail while the engineer, Roshan Lal Sharma, has proceeded on a three-day leave and left Giridih. 																								Both Nunulal and Sharma had lodged FIRs at the Town police station. The engineers report was lodged through the chief judicial magistrate.																								Reports from the chief ministers home district said a strong undercurrent of anger prevailed in Giridih town against the alleged highhandedness of Marandis brother who was seen moving around today.																								n Full report on Page 17																								While the charges pressed against Nunulal are bailable, those against the engineer are non-bailable, including an offence committed under the SC-ST atrocities Act. Nunulal has alleged that the engineer abused and demeaned him because he was an Adivasi, besides threatening to kill him. 																								Eyewitnesses, however, described Nunulals charges baseless aimed at framing the engineer in a case relating to the Atrocities Act.																								In Ranchi, the Jharkhand Engineers Association took strong exception to the alleged behaviour of the chief ministers brother. 																								Association general secretary Shivanand Rai told The Telegraph: The incident is a slap in the face of the government. The engineer was manhandled while he was doing government work. The government should address the problem. We are gathering details of the incident and we will decide our course of action. But prima facie, it is a case of a government servant being prevented from performing his duties. Sharma said.

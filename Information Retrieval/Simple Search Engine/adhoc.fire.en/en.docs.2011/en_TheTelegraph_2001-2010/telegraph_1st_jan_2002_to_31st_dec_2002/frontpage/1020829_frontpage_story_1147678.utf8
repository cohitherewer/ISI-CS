 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 Cricket council extends deadline
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Derby, Aug. 28: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has, quite sensibly, extended the deadline for complying with the Player Terms by a day at least.																								The last deadline, announced late last night, was Friday.																								Obviously, the ICC has kept India in mind. Specifically, then, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) doesnt have to name the Champions Trophy squad by August 30. It also gets an opportunity to place the cricketers views before the ICCs executive board, in Dubai on Saturday.																								Actually, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya has got the breathing time to activate his network. All along, Dalmiya was wanting something to place before the executive boards special meeting. Now, he can. In any case, the BCCIs point has consistently been that only the ICC can alter the terms.																								The Indian players, as reported, are willing to sign the terms provided they will be bound by it only during the duration of the tournament in Colombo  September 12-30. The before-and-after business, which curtails (conflicting) personal endorsements, is not acceptable.																								However, till late tonight, their willingness had not been formally conveyed to Dalmiya. Informally, though, it was made known by captain Sourav Ganguly yesterday itself. Thereafter, there has not been any communication.																								Apparently, the cricketers viewpoint is being drafted by a lawyer back in India and, so, the forwarding-process may take another day.																								According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, within the ICC, the executive board is likely to seek the opinion of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), which has the marketing/telecast rights for ICC events till the 2007 World Cup. The rights were originally awarded to World Sport Group, where, too, Murdoch had a stake, in the summer of 2000.																								One understands GCC representatives will be at hand, in Dubai, to give an immediate response to any query. One also learns the executive board meeting could become a two-day affair. After all, be it the Champions Trophy or whatever, no tournament can do without the Sachin Tendulkars and Team India.																								Significantly, its because of the terms imbroglio that the ICCs Cricket Committee (management) meeting has got shifted to Dubai. Earlier, the Thursday-Friday meeting was slated to be in Tobago. The chief executives/board secretaries of all 10 Test-playing nations are on this committee. The associate members, too, have representation.																								Where the executive board is concerned, presidents of each of the 10 Test-playing nations have a seat as director. Again, the associate members are represented.

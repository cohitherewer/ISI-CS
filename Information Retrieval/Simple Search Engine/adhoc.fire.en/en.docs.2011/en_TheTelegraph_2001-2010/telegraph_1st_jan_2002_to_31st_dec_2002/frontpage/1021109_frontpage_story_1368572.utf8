 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 8: India has asked Pakistan to take back the bodies of two militants killed in the Ansal Plaza shootout, but Islamabad has refused to accept them, saying they were not Pakistani nationals.																								In a communiqu to Pakistans charge daffaires Jaleel Abbas Jilani, the ministry of external affairs gave the Pakistan addresses of the two militants  Dawood alias Abu Anas and Ezaz Ahmad.																								According to it, Dawood, son of Ali Ahmed, belongs to Bhumba Kalan village of Kasoor district in Pakistans Punjab province while Ezaz Ahmad, son of Mohammed Azam, hails from Gali No. 16, Bazar No. 3, Nishara Road of Gujranwala, also in Punjab.																								Developments around the Sunday encounter are getting confusing by the day. Hari Krishna, the homeopath who had claimed to have witnessed the incident and said the two were unarmed and were simply shot, now faces the same question of credibility he had raised about the police operation.																								The post-mortem could clear some of the mist. The forensic department of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences is waiting for a green signal from Delhi police to do the autopsy.																								Doubts are being raised over Krishnas account of the encounter, with evidence surfacing that he is facing criminal cases in Uttar Pradesh, a charge the doctor says has been voiced to discredit him. 																								Strangely, Krishna has chosen the National Human Rights Commission for attack. He accused the commission of playing dirty tricks and labelled it an organisation of frauds while speaking to The Telegraph over phone.

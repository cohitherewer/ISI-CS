 															- Deputy PM sends emissaries for river-bank makeover OUR BUREAU 																								Oct. 6: L.K. Advani does not like Calcutta. Says who?																								Concerned at the state of Calcuttas ghats on the banks of the Hooghly, the deputy Prime Minister  still fresh from the brouhaha he sparked by his apparently innocuous I dont like Calcutta as much as Im impressed by the Metro admission while inaugurating Delhis own Metro  today took the decision to send no less than two Union ministers to the city for an on-the-spot inspection. 																								A 40-minute meeting with Trinamul Congress leader Sudip Bandopadhyay  who has just come out of a controversy sparked by the apparently innocuous tea party he hosted for central BJP leaders after his party decided to sever links with the BJP-led NDA  was all it took Advani to reach the decision at Delhi today.																								Although Bandopadhyay  all smiles after the meeting  declined to help the media read anything politically significant into the deputy Prime Ministers decision, its undeniable that Calcuttas ghats would have the two politically significant developments to thank if they receive any attention. 																								Bandopadhyays constituency (Calcutta-Northwest) covers most of the citys Hooghly bank from Cossipore Ghat in the north to Prinsep Ghat in the centre. The well known of the citys 30-odd more-frequented ghats, like Babughat, Baje Ghat, Gwalior Ghat, Nimtala Ghat, Ahiritala Ghat, Bagbazar Ghat and Sarbamangala Ghat, besides Cossipore, fall in this less-than-10-km stretch. 																								In Calcutta, Bandopadhyay had promised  after a cruise earlier this week down the portion of the Hooghly that spans his constituency  he would use his office to prod the Centre into pumping Rs 30 crore into the ill-maintained ghats and turn the stretch into something like Mumbais talked-about Marine Drive.																								Political circles  particularly those in Trinamul, a party whose leadership appeared to have little love lost for him after Bandopadhyays tea-party for the BJP leaders  immediately read into the promise a well-thought-out preparation for drifting further from the parent party. They felt that by using his new-found proximity with BJP leaders, Bandopadhyay is actually trying to prove to his party  and voters  that it is politically more beneficial to stay on with a party that is still in power at the Centre.																								Todays Advani-Bandopadhyay tte--tte, after which the former decided to depute tourism minister Jagmohan and transport minister Ved Prakash Goyal for a close look at the dirty ghats after the puja holidays, could be a confirmation of that theory.																								Bandopadhyay, however, averred that politics was the last thing on their minds when they spoke of Calcuttas ghats. The deputy Prime Minister was so concerned about the 26 ghats, each having a history of its own, that he immediately agreed to send the two ministers without waiting for a second request, he told The Telegraph.																								All the ghats now present a gloomy picture with the ill-maintained tracks of the Circular Railway running along hooch vends, unauthorised garages and construction.

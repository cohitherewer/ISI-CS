 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Dec. 14: Two bodies were found in a ditch in Phoolbagan today, sending the city police into a tizzy. The law-keepers later arrested four persons in connection with the twin murders. 																								Residents of Ghor Bibi Lane, not far from the city centre, spotted the multiple injury-inflicted bodies of Rakesh Singh, 28, and Manoj Singh, 31, cousins and employees of a local jute mill, and informed the police. 																								A police team probing a clash inside the jute mill rushed to the site around 1.30 pm and found out that the murders were related to the dispute in the factory.																								The entire incident seemed confusing at the beginning. No one seemed to have a clear idea about what had happened, said a senior officer of Phoolbagan police station. 																								After investigations, deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Soumen Mitra said the twin murders were the result of a long-standing property dispute between the two Singh families that had migrated from Bihar several years ago and set up home in Ghor Bibi Lane. 																								Rakesh and Manoj, employed in the weaving department of the jute mill, had started arguing soon after coming to work and had come to blows. Colleagues of the feuding cousins separated the two, who left for their homes around 11.30 am. 																								However, matters did not end there. Manojs brother Kedar followed Rakesh home and stabbed him to death, said deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division) Sanjay Mukherjee. 																								The body was dumped in the ditch, and Kedar left the area. As news of the murder spread, two of the victims brothers hunted down Manoj and killed him in a similar fashion, Mukherjee added. 																								A police team conducted a series of raids in Phoolbagan and arrested the three and a friend of Kedar. 																								Further investigations revealed that in March this year, Manoj and Kedar had been reported against at the Phoolbagan police station for assaulting Rakesh and Raju Singh. 																								We had even submitted a chargesheet against Manoj and Kedar in the assault case, Mukherjee said.

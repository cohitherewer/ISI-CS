 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 2: This time, a sergeant has gone beyond the call of duty. He has done what he should not have been doing.																								While Rajat Krishan was ticked off for doing his duty too well, off-duty sergeant Aniruddha Panda beat up a constable on duty near R.G. Kar hospital because he was fed up of being caught in a traffic snarl.																								Police are tight-lipped about the incident. City police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty said he was not aware of it, but would give the matter due importance once a report reached him.																								Deputy commissioner M.K. Singh said he has sought a report. I will comment only when the report reaches me. I believe there was a problem between the constable and the sergeant.																								But the deputy commissioner, eastern suburban division, Sanjoy Mukherjee, under whose jurisdiction the incident took place, said Panda, a sergeant of the reserve force of the Calcutta Police, got out of a taxi and beat up Nityananda Majhi last night. 																								I have already ordered an inquiry and will get the report by tomorrow. Only then can I determine why the sergeant beat up the constable, he said.																								Calcutta Police Association secretary Pradyut Mondal, however, said Majhi was beaten up because Panda was angry at being stuck in a traffic jam and blamed Majhi, who was on duty, for the traffic mess. Majhi is in Calcutta Police Hospital.																								Like Krishan, Majhi belongs to the Shyambazar traffic guard. He has lodged a complaint with the association. We will pursue this case till action is taken against the sergeant. Majhi has pain in his chest and is in no position to speak properly. We will take up the case once he recovers a little, Mondal said.

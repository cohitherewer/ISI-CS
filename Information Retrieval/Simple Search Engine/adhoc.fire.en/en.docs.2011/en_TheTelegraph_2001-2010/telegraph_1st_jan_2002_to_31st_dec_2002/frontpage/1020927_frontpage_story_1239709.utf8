																								Sept. 26: Left-ruled Bengal remained largely unaffected by the bandh called by the VHP, but state leaders were hard pressed to explain the impact in Burdwan town, district headquarters of the Red bastion.																								Not a single shop was open in the town and all establishments and education institutions were closed. Buses and rickshaws remained off the roads, while long-distance bus services were suspended, leaving thousands stranded.																								Apart from Burdwan town, the bandh was total in several areas of Katwa and Kalna subdivision.																								CPM leader Anil Biswas denied that the bandh was responsible for shutting down Burdwan town and put the blame on a defective railway track. He said authorities this morning had detected the fault at Golsi near Burdwan and stopped rail traffic. As a result, people could not reach Burdwan. We have no information that shops and establishments were closed. The bandh did not have any impact in the state, he said. ( )																								District magistrate Manoj Agarwal said the bandh was peaceful. He said shops and establishments were closed while attendance at government offices was 50 per cent. Train services were, however, not disrupted. )

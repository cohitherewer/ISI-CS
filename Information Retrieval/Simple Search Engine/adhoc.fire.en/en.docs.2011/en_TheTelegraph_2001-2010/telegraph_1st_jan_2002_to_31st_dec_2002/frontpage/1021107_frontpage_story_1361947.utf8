 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 India loses, so does crowd 
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 The Tricolour flutters and smoke billows at Keenan stadium in Jamshedpur. (Reuters) n See Sport																								Jamshedpur, Nov. 6: The West Indies won the opening one-dayer at the Keenan twice over. Both times, in the most dramatic of circumstances.																								First, when match referee Mike Procter abandoned the game after sections of the capacity turnout continued to rain missiles. Then, when both teams agreed to resume and Ramnaresh Sarwan smashed Ajit Agarkars knee-high full toss for that last ball boundary.																								Had the match not resumed after a 10-minute stoppage, the visitors would have been victorious by 19 runs under the Duckworth/Lewis Method.																								At the abandonment, the West Indies was 13 short of their target of 284 and in hand were six wickets and three overs. As it turned out, the one-dayer went right down to the wire. Having won quite a few close finishes, the Indians lost this one.																								Sarwan, unbeaten on 83, was appropriately adjudged Man of the Match.																								While its to be seen how the ICC reacts  it will be guided by Procters report  it wont surprise if the next game here isnt held in a hurry. What could work in Jamshedpurs favour is that the match was actually completed. Once Sourav Ganguly conveyed his teams willingness to return, Procter spoke to the visitors who, too, agreed to again take the field.																								Intriguingly, the administrations response was utterly lethargic, that, too, in Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandis presence. Worse, nobody appreciated that trouble was brewing from the morning itself when the students enclosure made Vasbert Drakes a target.																								Police hardly moved when the same section hurled missiles at Harbhajan Singh, who had an off day, in the afternoon. The police were more interested in usurping seats.																								While Sourav declined comment on the crowds behaviour, he did tell The Telegraph that the possibility of winning is what made him speak to Procter. I thought we had a chance and, so, told him we wouldnt mind returning  even though we would be fielding. Eventually, we did lose, but thats going to happen once in a while, Sourav said.

 															- rowdies win shames indias victory LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Drakes points at spectators who threw stones at him during the Rajkot match. (Reuters) n See Sport 																								Calcutta, Nov. 12: The fuse lit in Jamshedpur last week exploded in Rajkot this afternoon. And, with the West Indies refusing to continue with a losing cause, the third ODI was awarded to India on technical grounds.																								Its another matter that Sourav Gangulys team was, in any case, heading for its first win in the seven-match series. Fact is that the Madhavrao Scindia Stadium saw dubious history: Crowd trouble, not a rain interruption, forcing the Duckworth-Lewis Method to come into play.																								Chasing 301, the Indians were a prosperous 200 for one (27.1 overs) when the visitors walked off after Vasbert Drakes became the target of a sand-filled bottle. They didnt return, not even after police cleared the offending enclosure, which seated 3,500 spectators, each of whom had paid Rs 650.																								Virender Sehwag, unbeaten on a blazing 114, was adjudged Man of the Match. The D/L Method gave India a huge 81-run victory. Sourav, by the way, topped 1,000 ODI runs for the year. At 1,019, he is just a shade behind No. 1 Herschelle Gibbs 1034.																								As the cricket caravan now moves to Ahmedabad and Vadodara, a thoroughly embarrassed Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has requested Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi to specifically have three measures, including the strictest of frisking, implemented. The request was conveyed via a senior BJP leader who has ties with the BCCI.																								While West Indies manager Ricky Skerritt refused to make a statement  I will do so only after interacting with my board  its confirmed the visitors were adamant about not resuming. Moreover, they wanted the entire stadium to be emptied and an in-camera finish (on the lines of the India versus Pakistan Test at the Eden, 45 months ago) enacted.																								That wasnt practical. Indeed, once the police acted and assured there wouldnt be any repeat, the West Indies should have continued, Saurashtra Cricket Association top honcho Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph. What he left unsaid is that given the situation in Gujarat, the local administration couldnt have risked bigger trouble.																								Apparently, Match Referee Mike Procter was inclined towards abandoning the game altogether, but was reminded about two factors: That India had already faced a minimum of 25 overs and, second, the visitors simply didnt wish to again take the field. 																								Ironically, till a couple of insane elements took centrestage  Pedro Collins and Ryan Hinds were also hit, the latter by a rock, according to Skerritt  the behaviour of the capacity turnout was exemplary. Actually, its reasonable to assume the West Indies made Rajkot pay for the awful conduct at the Keenan and in Nagpur.																								Right through the many rounds of talks, the visitors kept speaking about the failed assurances in the first two ODIs. Of course, one isnt condoning what happened today, but it certainly didnt call for an extreme reaction, is how a well-placed source, who wished anonymity, put it.																								Whatever, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya was in touch with Procter and Skerritt during the crisis. 																								, key figures in the late-afternoon drama. That the West Indies still didnt resume, is indicative of how strongly they felt about the missiles.

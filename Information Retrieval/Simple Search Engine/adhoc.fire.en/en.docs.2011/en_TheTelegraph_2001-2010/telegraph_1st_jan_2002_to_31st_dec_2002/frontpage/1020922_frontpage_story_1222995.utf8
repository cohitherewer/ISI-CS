The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 Players draw battlelines for Round II
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Sept. 21: Having made the most of the presence of 12 teams in the Champions Trophy, the Barry Richards-headed Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica) is going into overdrive.																								For instance, it will formally place the jumbo misgivings over the Player Terms before the International Cricket Council (ICC), ahead of its September 30 executive board meeting in Colombo.																								As the ICC has recognised Fica by inviting joint chief executive Tim May to cricket committee (playing) meetings, spiking any representation wont quite be the seasons most sensible move. Going by what May said this afternoon, the formal representation (looking to the 2003 World Cup) will be unambiguous and strong.																								Speaking to The Telegraph from the Colombo Hilton, May cautioned the ICC against acting on a proposal (by New Zealand) to ban cricketers who make themselves unavailable on commercial (conflicting sponsorship) grounds.																								I hope better sense will prevail and the ICC wont even discuss the issue Its outrageous A ban can be thought of only if the ICCs Code of Conduct is violated Moreover, any contract signed under duress cant be enforced.																								[The controversial proposal was tabled during the boards emergent meeting in Dubai. Indeed, but for Jagmohan Dalmiyas stinging objection, it would have been passed then itself. Now, it is expected to be discussed in Colombo.]																								Though the Indians arent affiliated to Fica, the entire team, as director Richard Bevan put it, was present during Ficas interaction with around 140 players on Thursday.																								A move to either form a new body or revive the Association of Indian Cricketers is already underway. Step No. 2 will be the Fica affiliation.																								Ravi Shastri, the cricketers spokesman, has been in fairly regular contact with May and Bevan, but the two-way relationship between Fica and the Indian players actually began at that interaction. Of course, not everybody in the Indian board is going to be too delighted. 																								While only the Indian cricketers have been affected by the terms no-conflicting-endorsements clause in the ongoing tournament, May said Australians and South Africans will also be hurt during the World Cup.																								While the Indian issue is complicated, Fica is looking at the broader picture Protecting all players is our priority. At the same time, even the ICC-Global Cricket Corporation deal (till the 2007 World Cup) needs protection, he remarked.																								May added: In any case, the cricketers would definitely like to be briefed about the ICCs own contract For example, to what extent can it be flexible? The ICC hasnt really been speaking in one voice																								Significantly, Fica is willing to give a confidentiality-undertaking to the ICC.

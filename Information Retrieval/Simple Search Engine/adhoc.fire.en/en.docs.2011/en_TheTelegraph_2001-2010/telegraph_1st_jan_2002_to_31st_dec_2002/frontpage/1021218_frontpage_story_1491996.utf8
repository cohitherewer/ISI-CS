 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 Interpol alert on Quattrocchi 
																								New Delhi, Dec. 17: The Delhi Interpol today sounded an alert on the red-corner notice against Ottavio Quattrocchi over reports that he had left Malaysia for Italy, says our special correspondent.																								The CBI, facing flak for losing the court battle on the Bofors accuseds extradition to India, had requested for the alert. 																								An Interpol notice was issued a few years ago when a Delhi court had declared Quattrocchi a proclaimed offender.																								Yesterday, Malaysias highest court had ordered him to surrender his passport within 10 days.																								A CBI officer said it remains to be seen if Italy will arrest Quattrocchi now, or he returns to Malaysia on his own to surrender the passport.

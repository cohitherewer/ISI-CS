 Sunday, September 01, 2002 				 ICC stands by terms, extends deadline
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								London, Aug. 31: While rejecting the Indian cricketers offer of conditionally signing the Player Terms, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has given them a couple of days to consider making themselves available for next months Champions Trophy in Colombo.																								However, a formal deadline has not been set by the ICCs executive board, which met in Dubai today.																								Should the cricketers sign the existing terms, the ICC has committed to reviewing its contents. If the players stick to their current position, though, they risk being boycotted by ICC members who have Test and one-day status.																								The Indians, who arrived here this afternoon (from Derby), will now surely have a closed-door meeting to discuss the latest from the ICC. At this moment, its too early to say anything.... Let us first talk amongst ourselves, remarked one of the seniors, when given the Dubai-update by The Telegraph.																								Now that the ICC is committed to reviewing the terms  albeit after the Colombo tournament, by October 31 it wont surprise if our cricketers, too, relent. That is a strong possibility and will allow the BCCI to field the best team, as desired by the ICC.																								Its when the best team issue came up that BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya asked the ICC to work out ways to make it possible. Thats how the couple of days bit was arrived at.																								Being a former ICC president, Dalmiya still has considerable influence.																								The boycott-motion, however, would have been passed today, had Dalmiya not objected to its placement without the directors being given the mandatory notice:. Now, this will be taken up at the next meeting, probably immediately after the Champions Trophy, in Colombo.																								The ICC wants a boycott of all players who stay away from ICC tournaments on account of commercial considerations. Clearly, this is a pressure tactic.																								Actually, with all remaining 11 participating nations (including South Africa) declaring that their cricketers have either signed/or agreed to sign the terms, the ICC got emboldened to adopt an aggressive stance vis-a-vis India.																								So much so, one understands the players willingness to being bound by the terms during the duration of the Champions Trophy (September 12-30) only, was quickly thrown out. For now, then, no personal endorsements/advertisements (which clash with the ICCs own sponsors) will be allowed till 30 days after the final.																								Dalmiya, who leaves for home later tonight, should initiate a fresh dialogue with the cricketers within hours of landing in Calcutta. His solitary comment, from Dubai, was: The ICC has asked our players to undertake what Id suggested a fortnight back... In any case, it has now committed itself to a review... quot;

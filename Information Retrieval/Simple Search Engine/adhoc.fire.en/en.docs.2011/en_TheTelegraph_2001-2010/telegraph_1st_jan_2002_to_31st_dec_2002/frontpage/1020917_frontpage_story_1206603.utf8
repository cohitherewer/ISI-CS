The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Jagger-naut set to roll towards India
 															- Drive expected to bring Rolling Stones to Bangalore and Calcutta next year SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Mick Jagger																								Calcutta, Sept. 16: For die-hard Mick Jagger fans who (cant get no) Satisfaction listening to their favourite Stones numbers on tape, the opportunity of a lifetime could come knocking next year. Yes, rock n rolls longest-surviving act is keen to blow its Indian devotees off their feet in 2003.																								Virgin Records (India) Pvt Ltd is ready to get Mick Jagger-Keith Richards down for a couple of gigs in India as part of the rock veterans world tour.																								They have a window during their Far East leg of the global jog, February 2003 onwards, Mohan Mahapatra, managing director, Virgin Records, said on Monday.																								The Rolling Stones, after finishing the US and Canada tour on February 1 next year, will do 50 stops in 25 countries, covering Europe, China, Japan, South America, Mexico and Australia.																								We have contacted the Stones through DNA Networks of Bangalore and they are more than willing to play in India, Mahapatra added.																								While Bangalore will be an obvious stop for Mick the lick Jagger, the record label is keen to squeeze in Calcutta, the rock hub of the country.																								Anuj Talukder, manager, strategic marketing, Virgin Records, said: For us, it makes perfect sales sense to have a Stones stop in Calcutta, since no other city buys more rock music in this country.																								DNA is already in dialogue with corporates on behalf of Virgin to make the dream tour come true. We are talking in the realm of a million dollars, at a conservative estimate, and we sincerely hope the Indian corporate circuit can raise that amount to support the shows, Mahapatra said.																								The Virgin MD was in town to announce a special marketing tie-up with MusicWorld to introduce the much-awaited Stones restrospective album Forty Licks, to be released worldwide by EMI Recorded Musics Virgin Records label on September 30.																								Virgin is also talking to Richard Clayderman, Blue and Norah Jones for concerts in India. But for now, the thrust is entirely on getting Jagger and his band of evergreen rockers to Not Fade Away before a bow in Bangalore and a cry in Calcutta.

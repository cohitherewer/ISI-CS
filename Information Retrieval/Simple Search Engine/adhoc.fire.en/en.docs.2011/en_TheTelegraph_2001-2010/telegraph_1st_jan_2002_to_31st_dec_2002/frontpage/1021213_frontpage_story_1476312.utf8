 OUR BUREAU																								Dec. 12: The Dima Halam Daoga (DHD) leaderships promise to call a halt to violence rang hollow with members of the militant outfit today killing a soldier and seriously injuring nine at Eight Mile point between Umrangshu and Doyangmukh in Assams North Cachar Hills district.																								Police sources in Haflong said the militants were headed for Umrangshu to extort money from officials of the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation when they were confronted by an army team. On being asked to drop their weapons, the rebels opened fire, killing an army jawan on the spot. The slain soldier was Harsh Bahadur Thapa, a Naik in the 11 Gorkha Rifles. 																								Security personnel later apprehended a militant and recovered the body of another rebel from a nearby jungle. Both were injured during the encounter, the police said. The encounter was the fourth such incident in the hill district since Friday.																								On Monday, a surrendered militant of the DHD had shot dead a police guard and seriously injured the assistant superintendent of police (headquarters) inside his office chamber in Haflong. The injured officer, Niharendu Ranjan Seal, died today at the Silchar Medical College and Hospital.																								He was recuperating at the hospital, where he had been rushed by an IAF chopper and then operated upon by surgeons there. A bullet was extracted from his body. He breathed his last at 5.20 am.																								Seal had won laurels for his bravery. His exemplary valour was seen during an encounter with Naga rebels recently near Langting in North Cachar, where he and his troops shot dead two of Muivahs followers. Seals last rites were performed this evening at his village home in Kathigorah block of Cachar. 																								The hardline faction of the DHD is led by Jewel Gorlosa, who is close to the top brass of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah). He is believed to have softened his stand after NSCN (I-M) leaders Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah agreed to return to the country for talks with the political leadership. 																								Sources said a senior police official had established contact with Gorlosa and Dilip Nunisa, who leads another DHD faction. 																								The DHD professes to be fighting for a Dimaraji state, comprising parts of Nagaland, the N.C. Hills and adjoining Cachar, Karbi Anglong and Nagaon districts.																								Bodo killings: Militants suspected to be from the banned National Democratic Front of Boroland shot dead two youths at Subaijhar under Bengtol police outpost of Kokrajhar district last night.																								The victims have been identified as Mwgthang Basumatary and Bimal Basumatary. 																								Their bodies were recovered this morning.

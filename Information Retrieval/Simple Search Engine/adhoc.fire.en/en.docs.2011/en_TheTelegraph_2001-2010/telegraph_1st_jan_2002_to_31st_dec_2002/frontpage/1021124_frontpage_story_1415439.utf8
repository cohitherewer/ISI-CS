 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Nov. 23: A section of students at Presidency College boycotted classes and staged demonstrations on the campus in protest against the untimely transfer of Emanul Haque, a lecturer in the Bengali department. 																								Haque, who had joined the college a little over a year ago from Krishnanagore Government College, has been transferred to Chandannagar Government College. According to norms, a government college teacher can be transferred after he has served an institution for at least four years. 																								Haque said he has submitted an appeal against the transfer order to the state administrative tribunal. I think the order is vindictive and illegal, he added. 																								It is learnt that Haque, who was served the transfer order yesterday, has not been in the state governments good books for his criticism of the arrest of Kaushik Ganguly, the Rajabazar Science college teacher, and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees initial stand vis--vis madarsas. He is also believed to have earned the ruling Marxists ire by opposing the partys stand on the screening of a controversial film on Lenin. 																								The students, mostly belonging to the first-year BA and BSc. courses, boycotted classes and submitted a memorandum to principal Amitava Chatterjee, demanding immediate withdrawal of the transfer order. 																								We will not accept our teachers transfer in this way, said Abhishek Ghatak, a first-year student. The agitating students said Haque has recently introduced a string of new measures, like special tutorial classes. We are surprised that the government decided to transfer an efficient teacher like Haque ignoring our interest. He also played a major role in revamping the Bengali departments library, they said. 																								Higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty described the transfer as routine. The government can transfer an officer if it finds this necessary, he said.

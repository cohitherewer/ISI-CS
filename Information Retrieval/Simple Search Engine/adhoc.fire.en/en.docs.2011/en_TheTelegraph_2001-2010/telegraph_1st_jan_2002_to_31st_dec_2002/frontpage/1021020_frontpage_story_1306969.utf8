 Sunday, October 20, 2002 				 Workers sniff Gogoi DA plot
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Guwahati, Oct. 19: The breather on capping dearness allowance has failed to calm down the Sadou Asam Karmachari Parishad (SAKP), which today accused the Tarun Gogoi government of indirectly pressuring the Centre to freeze DA.																								 The apex body of Assam government em ployees demanded that the government come clean on the issue. SAKP secretary-general Charan Deka warned that any move to freeze DA or release only basic pay would lead to a direct confrontation with the government. 																								The government today said considering the precarious financial standing, the chief minister had urged the Centre to provide 100 per cent financial assistance for additional DA instalments, in case additional DA was given to Central government employees. Gogoi had urged the Centre not to announce any additional DA to Central government employees without conferring with the state. 																								Deka claimed that by adopting this posture, the chief minister only indicated his intention of not releasing DA. There is no justification in linking the release of DA of state government employees with that of Central government employees. In any case, we get less salary than Central government employees. On the other hand, the state government has not released the last two instalments of DA of two and six per cent as already declared by it, the SAKP leader said. 																								Yesterdays meeting between Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and chief ministers in New Delhi failed to arrive at a consensus on the proposal to freeze DA and bonus. A majority of the states  10 of which are scheduled to go to polls  opposed the proposal. 																								Highlighting the disparity in salaries of Assam employees with the employees of states which have adopted the Central payscale, Deka claimed that the basic pay of a schoolteacher of such states was higher than the basic pay of an Assam Civil Service officer. 																								Project meet																								The Assam government and the department of development of northeastern region (Doner) today held a meeting to resolve differences over sanctioning of projects and allotment of funds, says our New Delhi correspondent. Doner officials and the Assam chief minister, aided by two ministers, were present at the meet.

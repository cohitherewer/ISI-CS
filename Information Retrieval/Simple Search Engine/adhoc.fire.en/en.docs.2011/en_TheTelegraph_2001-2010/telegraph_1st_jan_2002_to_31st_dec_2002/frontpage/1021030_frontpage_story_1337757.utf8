 Wednesday, October 30, 2002 				 Jogi scores on Marandi turf
 ANUPAM SHESHANK																								Lapung (Ranchi), Oct. 29: Scoring points over his Jharkhand counterpart Babulal Marandi, who is yet to visit the neighbouring state, Congress chief minister of Chhattisgarh Ajit Jogi made his presence felt on his second trip to Jharkhand to participate in tribal leader Kartik Oraons birth anniversary celebrations today.																								After inaugurating a school at Oraons ancestral village, Jogi said he had come from Chhattisgarh with the goodwill of two crore Adivasis of his state for the three crore people of Jharkhand to ensure that all incomplete works of the legendary tribal leader were fulfilled.																								Oraon taught the Adivasis never to compromise on self-respect and showed us how a simple man could climb the stairs of success, Jogi said, addressing a large crowd at Sarsa Gardeepa village. The programme was organised by local Congress MLA Dev Kumar Dhan.																								Though Jogi refused to comment on the functioning of the Jharkhand government, he said the achievement of Chhattisgarh was that it had emerged as one of the most developed states because of good governance and infrastructure.																								The Congress leader said that in the last two years, his government had instilled confidence among the masses. Jogi said with good administration, Chhattisgarh had become the most peaceful state and people trusted it because of stability on all fronts.																								Jogi denied the charge that he was weaning industrialists away from Jharkhand. 																								I am not wooing anyone. They are coming on their own. Chhattisgarh has attracted investment over Rs 50,000 crore mainly in the power, steel and aluminium sectors. Work on those projects have started. We have prepared a very good rehabilitation package so we are not facing any problem on that front, he said.																								Jogi, however, indirectly commented on the functioning of the NDA government in Jharkhand by giving a piece of advice to the Congress MLAs.																								He narrated an incident in which a foreign journalist found Bhim Rao Ambedkar awake late at night. The curious journalist asked Ambedkar why he was awake when the rest of India was sleeping. Ambedkar said when people are awake, their leaders can sleep, but when people are asleep the leaders will have to remain awake and work harder to safeguard their interest, Jogi said.																								He asked the Congress MLAs to emulate Ambedkar and work harder to see that the people running Jharkhand discharged their duties well. Jogi asked the people to see if the objective behind the formation of new states was being fulfilled. 																								I am also accountable and the masses must see that their leaders are doing their job well, he said.

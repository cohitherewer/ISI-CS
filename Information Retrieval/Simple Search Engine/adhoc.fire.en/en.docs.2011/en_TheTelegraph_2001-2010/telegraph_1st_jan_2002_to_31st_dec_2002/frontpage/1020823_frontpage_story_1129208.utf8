 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Talks term for border scan
 PRANAY SHARMA																								Kathmandu, Aug. 22: Pakistan today indicated that it was open to various proposals for monitoring the Line of Control, including the Indian suggestion of a joint patrol, but added that talks would have to resume first. 																								Lets create a climate where the two countries are talking to each other. Such proposals can be examined once the tensions come down in both countries and they learn to trust each other, Pakistani minister of state for foreign affairs Inamul Haq said. 																								And that trust will come by talking to each other and not by turning our backs at each other.																								Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha had said yesterday that if Pakistan admits before Delhi that it was unable to control infiltration across the LoC, the two sides could sit together and work out a system to check the menace. 																								This is the first time that Pakistan has kept its options open on a joint patrol. In Almaty, when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee first made the proposal, Islamabad had rejected it within hours. 																								But Haq indicated today that though Pakistan wants an international monitoring group for the LoC, it was not averse to discussing the Indian proposal.																								The change in the Pakistani position can be interpreted as its desperation to start a dialogue with India. Delhi has so far shown no inclination to resume the talks till Pakistan ends cross-border terrorism in Kashmir. 																								In a clever formulation the Pakistani foreign minister said Islamabad was not aware of any movement across the LoC. 																								Pakistan is not allowing anyone to cross over and, therefore, we have nothing to convey to the Indian side, he said.																								Referring to Pervez Musharrafs recent remarks that some infiltration might still be taking place across the LoC, Haq argued that the Pakistani President was responding to a question on a hypothetical situation.																								He added that Pakistan should not be held for violence in Jammu and Kashmir and it does not have a role to play in the states elections. ( )																								Elections in Kashmir cannot be a substitute for a plebiscite there. This has been said in the United Nations Security Council resolutions and Pakistan bases its position on that. But we can neither persuade nor prevent the elections in Kashmir. It is for the people of Kashmir to decide whether or not they will participate in the elections, he said.																								But he added: Since the elections in Kashmir are contrary to the spirit of the UN Security Council resolutions, Pakistan cannot accept the outcome of the elections as a legitimate one.																								Haq explained that Pakistan was in favour of a neutral observer to monitor the LoC. In todays world, no country should be allowed to be the accuser as well as the judge. There should be an international mechanism to assess the Indian claim and monitor the LoC. 																								Either the United Nations Military Observers Group for India and Pakistan, already stationed on either side of the LoC in Kashmir, can be strengthened. Or some other international group can be brought in, he said. 																								On joint patrol by India and Pakistani troops, Haq said the idea might not be feasible at the moment. Contradictory statements coming out of India on the proposal had created confusion, he said. Moreover, at a time when a million-odd troops of the two countries have been deployed in an eyeball-to-eyeball position for months, they might not have the required confidence and trust in each other to monitor the LoC jointly. 																								But the Indian proposal can be considered once the two sides resume their dialogue, lower the tension in the region and restore their mutual trust and confidence, Haq added.																								If the Indian and Pakistan foreign ministers can talk to each other socially, what stops them from talking to each other at the political level, he asked. We cannot discuss proposals in thin air, we need to start a dialogue to address all outstanding issues.

 Wednesday, September 18, 2002 				 Advani does not like Calcutta
 															- Metro impressed me but not the city OUR BUREAU				 	 Advani during the trial run of the Delhi metro rail. (AFP)																								Sept. 17: Lal Krishna Advani likes whats underground in Calcutta, but not whats above it.																								Fifteen years after Rajiv Gandhi wrote it off as a dying city, the deputy Prime Minister today sprinkled some more salt, saying he liked Calcuttas Metro, but not the city itself.																								All praises for Calcuttas tube before flagging off a trial run of Delhis spanking new metro rail service, Advani said: I was impressed by the Calcutta Metro and its cleanliness, though I did not like the city as much when I visited it some years back. The situation may have improved now.																								Like Rajiv Gandhis 1987 comment, Advanis words could spark outrage in the city. The deputy Prime Minister last stopped over in Calcutta in May 2001 en route to Midnapore, where he campaigned for the Trinamul-BJP combine ahead of the Bengal elections.																								On his way back, he had put up at the Airport Hotel for about three hours before catching the Jet Airways flight to Delhi. He also addressed a news conference at the hotel. 																								Calcutta Metro officials do not recall having hosted Advani on one of their trains, but the deputy Prime Minister is likely to be familiar with the city.																								His daughter Pratibha and son-in-law Jayant lived on Mayfair Road for several years. Jayant worked as an executive in a five-star hotel.																								Speaking in Delhi during the trial run, Advani appreciated the co-operation between the Central and Delhi governments over the project execution.																								 But he added that if Delhis tube was to be a success and if cleanliness was to be maintained, co-operation between passengers and metro officials was essential.

 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Guwahati, Oct. 29: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today branded the Ulfa and the NDFB as the main hindrances to development, signalling the beginning of an all-out offensive. This has as much to do with Sundays mortar attack on the capital complex as with the two outfits repeated rejection of peace initiatives.																								Since returning to power, the Congress has been extra careful in handling the problem of militancy. The accent of its policy has been on bringing the militant leadership to the negotiation table. 																								However, there seems to be a change in tack with Ulfa militants attacking Dispur and the NDFB mowing down 21 non-tribal residents of a village in Kokrajhar district. Though there were no casualties in the attack on Dispur, it exposed loopholes in security arrangements in the states most-protected VIP zone.																								A tough-talking Gogoi hinted that heads would roll in the top echelons of the police department for the security lapses that enabled the Ulfa to launch a mortar attack. He said steps would be taken on the basis of the findings of a high-level inquiry.																								Inspector-general of police (CID) S.P. Kar has been given the responsibility of conducting the inquiry and asked to submit his report urgently. 																								The chief minister said the NDFB-executed massacre in Kokrajhar district and the Ulfas assault on Dispur were panic reactions to the loss of public support. He said both outfits were desperate because the people had begun raising their voices against them.																								The Ulfa and the NDFB are mainly responsible for Assams backwardness and the high rate of unemployment. They have lost the peoples support, which is why they are trying to create a fear psychosis, Gogoi said. 																								The chief minister said his government had been hamstrung by shortage of security forces. Even by the Centres own assessment, the state requires at least 180 companies of paramilitary forces for counter-insurgency operations. Instead, forces have been withdrawn, leaving only 121 companies at our disposal. Eleven companies are exclusively for deployment along the Assam-Nagaland border. 																								Gogoi said militant outfits with camps in Bhutan were the ones that enjoyed a greater degree of success in hit-and-run operations. He said it was unrealistic to expect security forces to stop these militants till such time that their camps in the Himalayan kingdom were dismantled.																								The chief minister reiterated his governments demand for deployment of BSF personnel along the Indo-Bhutan border.																								On security in Guwahati, Gogoi said Sundays attack on the capital complex was an eye-opener.																								 He warned of stringent action against any police official found guilty of not doing his duty properly.																								The chief minister had been informed about the mortar attack almost one-and-a-half hours after it took place. Oblivious to the presence of militants in the high-security zone, officers in charge of Gogois security had twice given the green signal to his convoy to pass through the area.

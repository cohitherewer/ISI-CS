 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 BC Roy head shifted
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept. 18: The government today transferred the superintendent of B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children, Anup Mondal, holding him primarily responsible for managerial failure in the deaths of 14 children in 48 hours earlier this month.																								Officials said the government would announce the transfer after health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra tomorrow makes public the action taken report on streamlining the only paediatric referral hospital in the state. Mondal would be relocated in Writers Buildings for now, they said. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee held a long meeting on the issue with chief secretary S.N. Roy and health secretary Asim Barman and gave his seal of approval. He, however, refused to say anything. You will get to know tomorrow what we have done, he added.																								The probe committee has held Mondal and four other staff members responsible for failing to properly treat the children and combat the situation at the emergency department on September 1 and 2, though there was no lack of infrastructure.																								Health department sources said that along with Mondal, action would be taken against a doctor and a nurse who were on duty in the emergency section. The charge against them is dereliction of duty. In most likelihood, stern measures will also be taken against the ward master and the storekeeper who are in charge of looking after the admission of patients, supply of medicine and facilities like oxygen and X-ray. 																								Sources said the probe committee headed by director of health services, Prabhakar Chatterjee, and director of medical education, C.R. Maity, had said in the ATR that Mondal be immediately brought back to the health directorate at Writers Buildings. Subsequently, he will be sent off to some far-off place, sources said.																								Mondal has been indicted for going public on the alleged lack of infrastructure at the hospital. The report also said Mondal had violated norms by allowing the media into the hospital along with a team from the Indian Medical Association, much to the discomfort of children undergoing treatment there. 																								What Mondal has done is in violation of service conduct rules. So, he will have to face the consequences, an official said.																								The report also said there was no dearth of oxygen or any other treatment facility, as reported in the media.

 Friday, September 13, 2002 				 Technical result row deepens
 SHIV CHARAN SINGH																								Ranchi, Sept. 12: In a fix about the fate of about 40 students of the Regional Institute of Technology, Adityapur, who have been failing their exams for the past three years, the Ranchi University has forwarded their case history to the chancellor for final consideration.																								Citing the statutes of technical institutes that forbid a student to take examination for a fourth time, the university had withheld the results of 38 RIT students of the 1996 batch.																								Ranchi University officiating vice-chancellor Anand Bhushan told The Telegraph: I will go by the rules which say that students should not be allowed to appear for a fourth time. But instead of unceremoniously cancelling their results, I have forwarded their case to the Governor for final consideration.																								According to norms, a student failing for three consecutive terms is not deemed fit for pursuing studies and is issued an NFTE (Not Fit for Technical Education) certificate. But RIT had readmitted 38 such students and allowed them to take this years examination.																								University sources said todays decision might add to the tension between senior and junior students on the campus. 																								Over 50 second year students of RIT had left their hostel on September 10 following a clash with their seniors. 																								Principal Akhileshwar Mishra had claimed that the fight between students of the 1996 batch and the 2000 batch had nothing to do with the withheld results of the 38 NFTE students, but insiders had suggested otherwise.																								Asked if the university would investigate why the students deserving NFTEs were re-admitted and allowed for the examination, Bhushan refused to comment.																								Sources said university authorities had summoned the RIT principal to Ranchi on Wednesday for an explanation. The principal is reported to have requested the vice-chancellor to sympathetically consider the case of the students.																								Asked why the institute re-admitted the NFTE students, Mishra said he was ignorant about their re-admission. The matter lies with the university examination board for consideration, he added. 																								Sources said the results have been withheld for the time being and the matter has been forwarded to Raj Bhavan and the university will have to wait till the chancellor sends his reply.

 Tuesday, December 24, 2002 				 Naidu wins more than he can chew
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Dec. 23: When Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi promised yesterday to stay on Andhra Pradeshs track in the run-up to National Games 2005, he could not have meant this.																								The host of the just-concluded edition of the Games and cyber CEO, Chandrababu Naidu, is believed to have run out of moolah to honour the money-for-medal promises he made to defector sportspersons.																								At the 32nd National Games that ended yesterday, 94 golds, 86 silvers and 63 bronze medals were won by the 800 players among them athletes Bhupinder Singh and Sabeen Joseph of Jharkhand which lost its bid to Assam for Games 2005  adopted by Naidu. Living on loans to begin with, he is too poor to pay up.																								Finance ministry sources said Andhra will have to cough up at least Rs 5.17 crore to pay cash rewards to the medallists alone.																								A gold comes for Rs 3 lakh, silver for Rs 2 lakh and bronze for a lakh. 																								Even the loans have dried up.

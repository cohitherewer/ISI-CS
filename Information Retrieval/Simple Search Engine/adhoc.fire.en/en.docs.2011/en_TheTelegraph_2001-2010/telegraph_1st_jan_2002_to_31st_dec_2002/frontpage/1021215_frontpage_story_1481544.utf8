 Sunday, December 15, 2002 				 Teacher gunned down in school
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jamshedpur, Dec. 14: A teacher of the Bhartiya Model Madhya Vidyalaya was shot dead by two unidentified gunmen on the school campus this morning while classes were on.																								Prem Prakash Paul, who was to have taken up additional charge as an accountant from today, reached the school office as usual and was about to start work when he was called outside. As soon as he came out, the duo pumped bullets into his chest.																								The killers fled by climbing over the gate of the school, which falls under Sakchi police station. A bleeding Paul was rushed to the Tata Main Hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.																								Police officials said there was a conspiracy angle to the killing and have named two persons as suspects, both of whom are absconding. According to them, two former employees of the Arya Samaj, which runs the school, are behind the murder. 																								The officials said the duo  Arun Kumar Singh and Ashok Kumar Singh  had last week ransacked the school office. 																								R.K. Raman, secretary, Arya Samaj, said the accused were former employees of the samaj.																								P.K. Srivastava, deputy police superintendent, city, said strained relations between the old and the new school executive committees led to the murder. Sources in the school said the committees were at war and alleged that some members of the old panel wanted to grab the school property and had even made attempts to do so by fraudulent means.																								The sources said the old committee had allegedly siphoned off Rs 13 lakh and 35-year-old Paul, who reportedly knew about the money, was murdered because of his new responsibility as accountant.																								The school staff, the sources added, has been living in fear because of the ongoing spat and that the principal, Reena Bhattacharya, has received more than 50 threat calls over the past few days.																								Raman, who also reportedly got threat calls, had been provided two armed guards, but they were withdrawn for election duty.																								The management has decided not to resume classes till the situation becomes normal.

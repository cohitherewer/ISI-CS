 Saturday, September 21, 2002 				 Black Friday in coal capital
 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA																								Dhanbad, Sept. 20: Three accidents in a row struck the coal capital today, claiming one life, injuring several people and trapping 100 in a mine that caught fire.																								A man engaged in drilling died when the roof of the Tata Steel-run Digwadih colliery caved in. Two were injured.																								A lift collapse in the Muralidih colliery, owned by BCCL, injured 19.																								Around 100 workers were inside another BCCL mine in Sudamdih when it caught fire. All the workers trapped inside were safely pulled out through different routes. 																								Senior BCCL officials are camping at the site.																								The victim of the roof fall has been identified as Subhash Bharti. Mahesh Dusadh and Rajendra Chauhan suffered severe injuries. They have been admitted to the Tisco hospital in Jamadoba, where their condition is reported to be stable.																								A spokesman said adequate compensation would be given in line with company rules. 																								The accident at Muralidih colliery occurred when the pulley carrying the workers developed technical snags.																								The workers were on their way back after finishing the second shift.																								As we stepped out and the pulley went back to fetch another group of workers waiting below, we were taken aback by the cries of our colleagues. We then realised that the pulley had collapsed, said miner loader Ram Prasad Mahato.																								The victims were then bailed out through another route.

 RUDRA BISWAS																								Ranchi, Dec. 8: A Mongolian mission carrying the prospects of Rs 500-crore investments could not meet the chief minister and the industry minister as both were busy campaigning for Thursdays Godda byelection.																								However, Tegsh Buren, lecturer at the Mongolian government-run Academy of Management in Ulan Bator, promised to come back later this month. 																								Buren flew back today to New Delhi where he is scheduled to hold talks with the Union industry ministry on December 11.																								The lecturer, who held talks with BJP leader Saryu Rai, said the deputy director of the Mongolian Academy would visit Jharkhand on December 26 and hold talks with Jharkhand officials to find out better means of co-operation between Mongolia and Jharkhand.																								Buren said his tour was intended at exploring the possibility of Mongolian government investments to the tune of Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 crore in sectors such as tourism, power, roads and information technology.																								Buren told The Telegraph that his Ranchi visit was prompted by a memorandum of understanding signed between his government and the S.N. Sinha Institute of Business Management, Ranchi, in August last year. The two sides had agreed to cooperate on programmes for exchanging faculty, scholars and students.																								Buren said that after his arrival at Ranchi, he had been hoping to meet chief minister Babulal Marandi and industry minister P.N. Singh to discuss the Mongolian proposals.																								However, with the chief minister and his colleagues busy elsewhere, they had expressed their inability to meet him.																								Though Buren failed to meet either the chief minister or the industry minister, he utilised his stay at Ranchi to visit Bodh Gaya and Khunti. Buren said that following his visits to these places, he has been convinced of the rich potential of the tourism sector in Jharkhand.																								The segment could be developed to attract Buddhist tourists from China, Korea, Russia and Japan, he said.																								The lecturer said the proximity of Mongolia to mainland China, Japan, Korea and Russia was an added advantage for his country which could help exploit the tourism potential in Jharkhand for mutual advantage.																								He added that Ranchi, Khunti, Barhi and the large forest tracts of Chatra could be developed into tourist resorts. Youth hostels and camps can also be set up to draw the Buddhist tourists.																								Buren, who also visited a number of waterfalls adjoining the state capital, stressed that all these sites could be developed as promising tourist resorts and that his government would be willing to invest here.																								Buren said his government was also interested in setting up a science house at Ranchi.

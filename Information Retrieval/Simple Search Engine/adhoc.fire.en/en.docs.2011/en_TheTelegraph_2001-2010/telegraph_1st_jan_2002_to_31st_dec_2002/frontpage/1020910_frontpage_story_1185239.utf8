 Tuesday, September 10, 2002 				 Porn case rights heat on police
 SALMAN RAVI 																								Ranchi, Sept. 9: Human rights organisations have demanded departmental proceedings against Ranchi senior superintendent of police Neeraj Sinha and deputy superintendent of police (city) Varun Mishra for their alleged role in the infamous Lalpur pornography case.																								Lalpur police had implicated a girl from Tharpakna for acting in a pornographic film and kept her in custody for three days.																								The rights bodies have expressed outrage over the way the police headquarters has been handling the case and have accused the top officers of trying to shield the guilty policemen.																								The demand comes after the government submitted its report to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which pulled up the state government for delay in submitting an inquiry report.																								Following a petition from the victim and her parents, then director-general of police T.P. Sinha had directed superintendent of police, CID, Tadasha Mishra to conduct an independent inquiry. 																								Tadasha Mishra had taken help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to establish that the victim and the girl who had acted in the pornographic film were different individuals.																								The NHRC had also directed the government to conduct another inquiry and submit a report to the rights body. But the police headquarters took considerable time in submitting the report to the government despite repeated reminders from the rights panel.																								Last week, the government had submitted a formal report negating the case lodged by the Lalpur police station against the girl.																								The report sent to the NHRC is tailor-made to shield the Ranchi SSP and the DSP (city) who were the key players in the entire episode. The lower rank officers and then SP (city) Sampat Meena have been made the scapegoats. The victim has been repeatedly pointing out that while the SSP had harassed the girl by quizzing her about the other alleged gang members, the DSP (city) had raided her house and arrested her, said Renu Diwan of the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, which has taken up the girls case. 																								The police bosses are shielding the guilty officers. After Tadasha Mishra submitted her report, it became clear that the girl was victimised by the police. Tadasha Mishra had also recommended action against other senior police officers of the district, including the SSP and the DSP (city). But the report sent by the government to NHRC praises the SSP for his role. This is something unfortunate, she added. 																								The PUCL wants the report of Tadasha Mishra be made public and action taken against the guilty policemen.

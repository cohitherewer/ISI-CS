 Monday, September 09, 2002 				 Modi rolls with mud on Sonia
 							 - Daughter of Italy targeted as Gaurav Yatra begins BASANT RAWAT 																								Phagvel, Sept. 8: After three false starts, Narendra Modis Gaurav Yatra finally rolled  not to tom-tom the pride of Gujarat but to splash scorn on the daughter of Italy.																								Virtually kickstarting the BJP campaign for possible year-end elections at the biggest BJP rally in this Kshatriya stronghold of state Congress chief Shankersinh Vaghela, Modi lashed out at Congress president Sonia Gandhi for trying to capitalise on the Godhra carnage to capture power in the state. 																								Sonia Gandhi is the daughter of Italy who does not even have knowledge of Indias history. Congress is trying to reach Gandhinagar through Godhra, a dream which will never be realised, he told the rally.																								He said Mahatma Gandhi had asked the White people to quit India and by installing Italy ki beti, the Congress people have insulted the Father of the Nation.																								Modi asked Congressmen to discard their Italian glasses to sift fact from fiction. Congressmen will never understand whats Gujarats gaurav as long as they continue to wear Italian glasses. 																								The people of Gujarat will never forgive Sonia Gandhi for calling them Godse, the chief minister said, adding that the yatra was aimed at erasing the stigma attached to the fair name of Gujarat by the Congress.																								No Central minister attended Modis yatra, but in the presence of a galaxy of state BJP leaders and some Gujarati actors, party national general secretary Rajnath Singh flagged off the chief ministers hi-tech rath, a modified vehicle painted saffron.																								Referring to Vaghelas rally here on September 3, the chief minister declared that the end of the Congress is the beginning of the BJP. A few days ago, the Congress terminated its yatra in this village, their end is our beginning. Modi chose to defer his yatra and gave his rival the right of way to avoid any confrontation with the Congress workers. 																								Today, he appealed to BJP workers not to be provoked by Congressmen as it could be a tactic to stop his rath. He thanked the Congress for giving wide publicity to the Gaurav Yatra by forcing him to postpone it thrice. ( )

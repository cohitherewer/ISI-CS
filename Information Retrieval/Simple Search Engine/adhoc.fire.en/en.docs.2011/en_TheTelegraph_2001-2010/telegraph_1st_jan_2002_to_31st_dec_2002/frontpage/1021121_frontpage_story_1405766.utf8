 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Laloo spits out bid to break a bond
 															- Khaini-chewing strongman forces government to shelve Bill TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Laloo Prasad Yadav in Patna. (PTI)																								Patna, Nov. 20: On a hot afternoon in Vaishali districts Raghogarh, a sedate village crowd has gathered around a small podium near the local school. The whir of an approaching helicopter sends a ripple of excitement.																								Through the dust kicked up by the chopper, Laloo Prasad Yadav emerges and waddles towards the podium as the crowd cheers. That was the Assembly election of 1995 and, after a split in the party, Laloo Prasad was facing a challenge from Nitish Kumar.																								On the way through the passage among the people leading up to the podium, Laloo Prasad spots a villager pressing khaini and chuna on his palm. He stops, looks at the man and stretches out his hand. The battered, lined face of the villager crinkles into a smile. 																								Bihar and its most famous political son bond over a pinch of raw tobacco. 1995 returned Laloo Prasad to power.																								Seven years later now, the health brigade is trying to break that bond: separate Bihar from khaini.																								The health ministry in Laloo Prasads own partys government tabled a Bill to ban gutkha and khaini because they cause cancer. Such a move is under way in several states.																								Health minister Shakuni Chaudhuri had not accounted for the man sitting at his favourite spot under a mango tree at wife and chief minister Rabri Devis residence at 1 Anne Marg. 																								In the middle of a chat with party workers, Laloo Prasad lunges under his chair to pull out a brass pot, spits a brownish spittle and reaches for some more khaini to shove into the snug slot between the lower row of teeth and the inside wall of the mouth. 																								Chaudhuris proposed piece of legislation is sitting as comfortably in the stack of government files, unmoving. 																								Sources said last week, Laloo Prasad and Chaudhuri had a brief exchange on the health ministers proposal which had been prepared after the department was informed of reports by its own agencies and independent organisations like the Indian Medical Association (IMA) that suggested gutkha and khaini are causing a large number of cancer cases in Bihar.																								We sensed the need to launch a campaign, said Dr Ajay Kumar, IMA president in Patna.																								Chaudhuri drew up a draft notification for the ban in June where the list of tobacco products to be prohibited was expanded to include khaini.																								Ban khaini? How can you? Laloo Prasad asked his health minister, looking at him impishly. It is a Bihari way of stimulating thought. Its a kick nothing else can match, he said.																								Ironically, when former Union health minister C.P. Thakur had moved to ban gutkha, Laloo Prasads party the RJD stood behind him against the tobacco lobby. This time, Laloo Prasad and his khaini have tied the partys hands.																								That is not the reason, though, which is being cited for shelving the Bill. Chaudhuri said his ministry is assessing if the ban will result in losses for the tobacco growers of Bihar, most of whom are from his own caste.																								His deputy, Akhilesh Singh, said tobacco is grown in at least six Bihar districts  Vaishali, Sitamarhi, Saharsha, Madhepura, Motihari and Champaran.																								It is grown near the riverine stretches of north Bihar districts normally branded fallow and unoccupied for long. Most of the cultivation is unauthorised as the land is disputed. If you snatch this from farmers, it is bound to hit the ballot box, said a senior bureaucrat. 																								Around 30 MLAs from north Bihar opposed the ban. 																								We have therefore been forced to sit on this for some time, reflect and send it to the advocate-general for an opinion on whether we could pass the Bill keeping khaini out, Singh said. 																								When the legal opinion is made available to us, we will clear the ban. But on khaini we are helpless.																								A political contemporary said: Khaini became a means for Laloo Yadav to strike a conversation with ordinary people in the mid-eighties when he was trying to get a foothold. How can he forget this?																								Taking khaini out of Bihar is like taking Bihar out of Laloo.

 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 ICC sees hope Down Under Future stays uncertain
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Rahul Dravid after his century against England on the first day of the third Test in Leeds. (Reuters)																								Leeds, Aug. 22: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is currently upbeat, buoyed by the understanding reached between the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and its players, but the interpretation of an otherwise simple word  future  could eventually make for a return of stalemate Down Under.																								It should, after all, be noted the Ricky Pontings havent actually signed. Moreover, according to The Telegraphs sources, nobody will probably do so till the ICCs Executive Board meets next Saturday in Dubai.																								For the Australian cricketers, being consulted by the ICC before future contracts is a key element of their agreement with the ACB. Indeed, the ACB has been assured a mechanism will be put in place.																								In any case, the Australians werent signing the Player Terms even though, at this point in time, there was no conflict of interest with their own sponsors.																								The future had them worried.																								Of course, just the other day, the ICC more than indicated that the terms would only be applicable for next months Champions Trophy in Colombo. Implied was a review immediately after that tournament and before the February-March World Cup.																								Yet, in welcoming todays shaking of hands between the ACB and the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA), the ICC has clarified that any consultation with the players before new commercial agreements excludes existing sponsorship arrangements till the 2007 World Cup.																								Surely, the ACA couldnt have been talking of a post-2007 scenario. Also, the ICCs clarification contradicts the assurance given to Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Tuesday.																								The future, then, is anything but clear.																								Meanwhile, with the ACB reaching an agreement with the ACA, its widely being assumed that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) will follow suit.																								Apparently, the PCAs (unofficial) stand right through has been: Whats good enough for the Australians will be good enough for us. But, then, what about Nasser Hussains bit about extending solidarity? The next few days should be interesting.																								Incidentally, one England cricketer has already signed. Only, he is understood to have done so blindly. Its only now that the player  a one-day specialist  has begun to appreciate the ramifications.																								As for the Indians, till late this evening, there was no change in their absolutely firm stand. The dialogue between the ACB and the ACA needs to be welcomed. At the same time, both the ICC and the BCCI must talk to our cricketers, emphasised Ravi Shastri, the Indians spokesman.																								Contacted in Calcutta, Dalmiya didnt say much beyond the door remains open. Its obvious that till the ICC sets a deadline for naming the squad, this door will remain open for the Sourav Gangulys.																								Today, by the way, was a big day for the Indians. Had they stumbled in the opening hours of the third Test, they would have had more to worry. As it turned out, Day-I couldnt have been better (236 for two).																								Significantly, by the ICCs own admission, the terms have been signed by players of only four Test-playing countries: Pakistan, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.																								Reuters adds: The Indian cricket board is still hopeful the players will sign the contract. I hope so, hope wisdom prevails, Niranjan Shah, secretary of the BCCI, said.																								Shah said the Indian board was still going ahead with plans to select a second string squad for the Champions Trophy from a list of 25 unnamed probables.																								Shah said the board has done its best by offering the players compensation for lost endorsement deals and support in case of legal problems from their sponsors, though he feels the BCCI is handicapped by the absence of player contracts. When we enter into contract we can have provisions for such issues, but it is not easy (to finalise), it will take time, he added.																								n See Sport

 															- Cricketers to launch association and dine for charity LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Oct. 24: The Indian Cricket Players Association (ICPA) is set for an October 29 launch, exactly a day before the third and final Test versus the West Indies at the Eden.																								While the launch itself will probably be low-key, the ICPA will really be announcing its arrival during the October 31 fund-raiser, expected to be at the citys newest five-star address: The Hyatt Regency.																								Significantly, part of the proceeds that evening will go to two Calcutta-located charities. The gesture is bound to be very well received across the board.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, the ICPA will be inviting some of the eminent citizens (and, yes, urging them to participate in the auction of memorabilia) besides appealing to city corporates for sponsoring tables.																								As the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) brass will then be in Calcutta, invitations will also be sent to the big guns. Of course, its to be seen just how warm the BCCIs response is.																								[While BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya has been calling for elected, not nominated office-bearers representing all first-class cricketers, those connected with the ICPA are firm that the body has to start with nominated, not elected office-bearers. Elections will feature in stage-II of its growth.] 																								The Indian team will, obviously, be present at the Hyatt and Carl Hoopers West Indians could well be special invitees. Incidentally, a players association is already in place in the West Indies.																								Though its not confirmed, former India captain Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi is expected to head the ICPA, with the city-based Arun Lal being its secretary.																								Lal, it may be recalled, was secretary of the Association of Indian Cricketers, which went defunct not long after being formed in late 1989.																								To start with, the ICPA will have a seven/eight-member executive committee and, sooner rather than later, a clutch of sub-committees will be formed.																								Captain Sourav Ganguly, vice-captain Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble are tipped to be on the executive committee. 																								The ICPA, one understands, will be registered under the Societies Act in Calcutta itself.																								That a players body must be in existence was informally agreed upon (by the Big Four) during the tour of England, when the ICC-drafted Terms triggered such a storm.																								More recently, the move gained momentum with the Big Four (and Lal) exchanging notes in Mumbai and Chennai, ahead of the Tests there.																								Come October 29 and there will be greater communication between the players and the BCCI. Also, when the ICPA is in place, the Souravs and Sachins wont have to worry over the contents of the Terms and so on --- the association will take care of that, explained somebody closely linked with the ICPAs formation.																								Perfectly spot-on. Only, in trying to improve the communication, a situation shouldnt arise whereby there is even less of that.

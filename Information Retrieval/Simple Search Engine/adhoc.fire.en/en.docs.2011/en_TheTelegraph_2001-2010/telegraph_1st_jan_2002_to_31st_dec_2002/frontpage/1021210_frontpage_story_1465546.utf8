 Tuesday, December 10, 2002 				 Former rebel kills cop in SPs office
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Guwahati, Dec. 9: A surrendered militant today went berserk inside the North Cachar Hills police chiefs office, killing a bodyguard after snatching his gun and seriously injuring an additional superintendent of police. 																								The incident took place around 2.30 pm, moments after the surrendered militant of the Dima Halam Daoga (DHD) had entered the SPs office in Haflong town. The assailant was a regular visitor to the office and nobody had an inkling of what was on his mind as he took a seat in additional SP (headquarters) N.R. Seals office chamber. 																								A senior official said over phone from Haflong that the former militant suddenly assaulted Seals personal security officer Samir Singh, snatched his rifle and opened fire on the duo. 																								Singh succumbed to his injuries at Haflong Civil Hospital, while Seal was shifted to the Silchar Medical College by helicopter. 																								The police pleaded ignorance about the motive behind the assault by the surrendered militant, who fled towards the hills near the SPs office after the incident. 																								Security forces deployed in Assam often involve former militants in counter-insurgency operations because they can provide information about former comrades, know their modus operandi and probable hideouts. Sources said the former DHD militant who attacked Seal and his personal security officer may have been similarly used by the police.

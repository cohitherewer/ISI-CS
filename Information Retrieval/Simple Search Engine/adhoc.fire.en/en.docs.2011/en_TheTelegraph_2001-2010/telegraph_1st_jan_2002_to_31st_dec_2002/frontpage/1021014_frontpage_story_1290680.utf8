 Monday, October 14, 2002 				 Warning to world: Bush
																								Washington, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Amid signs of an al Qaida resurgence as the US takes aim at Iraq, President George W. Bush today urged the world to confront terrorism and condemned the Bali strike as a cowardly act.																								The world must confront this global menace, terrorism, Bush said in a statement released by the White House. We must together challenge and defeat the idea that the wanton killing of innocents advances any cause or supports any aspirations. And, we must call this despicable act by its rightful name, murder.																								He offered condolences to the families of the victims and said the US had offered assistance to Indonesia to help catch those responsible. Washington has in the past been dissatisfied with what it views as inadequate cooperation from Indonesia against terrorism.

 Tuesday, December 24, 2002 				 Lawyers to gauge strike call-off mood
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 23: The state bar council has resolved to call off the 42-day-old lawyers strike but deferred an announcement till Thursday in the face of protests from a section of its members.																								The ceasework will be called off only after seeking the opinions of the bar associations across the state, the council said. Most of the 568 courts in the state will go on Christmas holidays from tomorrow.																								But the Calcutta High Court Bar Association has resolved in its individual capacity to continue the ceasework till January 3.																								The decision to withdraw the strike followed a letter from law minister Nisith Adhikary, saying that the government would reconsider the court fees under several categories.																								A group of lawyers attacked the council office on the seventh floor of the city civil court building, broke open a cash counter and asked their leaders not to call off the ceasework.																								Out of 25 executive committee members, only 13 were present in todays meeting. Eight of the attending members supported the chairmans view that the ceasework should end. 																								Accordingly, on the basis of a majority verdict, a resolution was adopted to end the ceasework.

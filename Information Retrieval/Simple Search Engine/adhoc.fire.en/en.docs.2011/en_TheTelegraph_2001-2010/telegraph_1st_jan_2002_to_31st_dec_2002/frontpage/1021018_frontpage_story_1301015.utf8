 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 Mizo CM to head back to Bangkok
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 17: Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga will soon make a second trip to Bangkok to meet the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) leadership. 																								Cashing in on Zoramthangas rapport with the NSCN (I-M), the Centre has directed the chief minister to meet the outfits leadership to carry forward the ongoing negotiations. 																								The chief minister had, in the past, proved crucial in the talks between the Centre and the NSCN (I-M). He helped save the ceasefire negotiations from falling through a few months ago.																								However, unlike on the earlier occasion when the chief ministers brief was basically to get dialogue process going, Zoramthanga will undertake this trip to cement the understanding reached by the two sides in the Thai capital last month. 																								A joint statement by the NSCN (I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah and New Delhis representative K. Padmanabhaiah issued in Bangkok said: The parties reaffirmed the political importance of the broad framework agreement as contained in the Amsterdam joint communiqu of July 11, 2002 and agreed on measures to ensure a smooth continuation of negotiations.																								Zoramthangas presence accords a political status to the long-drawn peace process, something which the NSCN(I-M) leadership had sought.

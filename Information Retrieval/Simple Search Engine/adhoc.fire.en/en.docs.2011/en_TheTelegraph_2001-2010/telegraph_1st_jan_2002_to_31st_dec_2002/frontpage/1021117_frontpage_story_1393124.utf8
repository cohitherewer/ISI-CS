 Sunday, November 17, 2002 				 Mamata on return track
 OUR BUREAU																								Nov. 16: The Trinamul Congress appeared set to return to the National Democratic Alliance, with Mamata Banerjee claiming today that the Centre has agreed to hold fresh talks on Eastern Railways bifurcation.																								Mamata added that her party will not sit in the Opposition when Parliaments winter session begins on Monday.																								She said NDA convener George Fernandes had assured her that Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee would discuss the bifurcation with her when she goes to Delhi.																								Mamata got a call from the PMO before her party was to take a final stand on the NDA. The caller, Sudheendra Kulkarni, requested her not to take a final decision. Then Fernandes called twice, Mamata said, urging her to visit Delhi and hold fresh talks on the bifurcation issue.																								The defence minister later issued a statement, which said: On the eve of the winter session of Parliament, George Fernandes has urged the leader of the Trinamul Congress to support and join the NDA government.

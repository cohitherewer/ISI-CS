 Wednesday, October 02, 2002 				 Hunt for fodder scam fugitives 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Oct. 1: At least 70 persons accused in the animal husbandry scam, many of whom are from Patna, have been dodging the CBI dragnet since cases were filed against them. CBI sources today claimed that most of the absconders have fled Patna.																								We have information that these absconding persons have shifted base to big metros. Some are living in Mumbai. We are trying for their arrest and have requested the judicial commissioner to expedite the matter for procuring warrants and orders for attachments of their properties, a senior CBI official said.																								He said the agency had begun piling pressure to make the accused surrender. Our efforts to attach the properties of D.P. Kashyap resulted in his surrender before the designated CBI court. But there is no information about some of the accused, sources said.																								They claimed success in arresting or securing the surrender of several absconding accused. A total 179 accused were either arrested or made to surrender before the designated CBI court apart from Kashyap, they said.																								Those who surrendered or were arrested include Sri Chandra Kannujia, Ravi Sinha, D.P. Kashyap, Rakesh Mehra, Phool Jha, Mohinder Singh Bedi and Vijay Kumar Mallik.																								The agency has already submitted chargesheets in 53 fodder scam cases registered in Jharkhand. There were 55 cases in all, of which one was closed due to the death of an accused and another for lack of evidence.																								The sources said that of the 20 bitumen scam cases taken up by the Jharkhand unit of the agency, chargesheets had been submitted in 15. 																								Those charged include Bihar road construction minister Illiyas Hussain and 18 officials, including some from Indian Oil Corporation. One of the key accused, Ram Avtar Khaitan, has turned approver.																								Others chargesheeted are Khaitans personal assistant Shahabuddinn Baig; a transporter D.N. Singh; director (purchase) in the roads construction department Kedar Paswan; deputy director M. Ahmed; engineer in chief Dhaneswar Baitha; IOC officials Paramhans Tiway and Tapas Roy; and another official Shobha Sinha.																								Khaitan has disclosed how he allegedly obliged the minister by paying for his trips and stay at luxurious hotels and gifting him jewellery and weapons.

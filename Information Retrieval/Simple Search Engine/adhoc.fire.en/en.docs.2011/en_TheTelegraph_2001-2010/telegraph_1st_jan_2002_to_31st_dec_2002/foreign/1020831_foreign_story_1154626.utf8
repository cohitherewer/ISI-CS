The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, August 31, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Tall tale																																	 Seoul, Aug. 30 (Reuters): A South Korean retail group said today it planned to build the worlds tallest building, a 112-storey hotel in the capital, Seoul.																																	The Lotte Group said it would apply for government approval to build the 1,820-feet tall hotel with 800 rooms, convention centres and shopping malls. We expect this will be a prominent tourism site for South Korea and contribute to tourism industry, it said. The twin Petronas Towers in Malaysia are the worlds tallest skyscrapers, at 1,483 feet each. Lotte said it would talk to defence authorities about getting a ban on high buildings overturned. 																													 																Prized jobs																																	 Hong Kong (Reuters): Hong Kong broadcaster Asia Television is offering jobs as prizes in a new programme as the territorys ranks of unemployed swell. We hope to be a conduit to find talents for all organisations and to help the unemployed find jobs, the station said. Like anyone looking for a job, hopeful participants must send in job applications and attend interviews and the station will whittle down the crowd to only three, an ATV spokeswoman said. During the show, the contestants will answer questions from the prospective employer and they must say why they are the best candidate for the job, she said. 																													 																Cow sale																																	 Istanbul (Reuters): A Turkish woman has begun selling the cows she kept in upstairs apartments in the city of Trabzon, to the relief of her neighbours. Local alderman Osman Terzi said health and safety officials had ordered the cows to be cleared out of the first and third floors of the building in the Black Sea port city. I have learned that Fatma Kocaman has started selling her cows, which is a very pleasing development, he said on Thursday. It said she had kept a large number of cows there. Its hard to believe someone would keep cows in an apartment. For years me and the locals have wondered what to do...The area has suffered a lot. Noise, smell and manure everywhere make a very ugly scene, Terzi said.

 Saturday, November 09, 2002 				 Butler unfurls flag politics
 ANDREW CAWTHORNE																								London, Nov. 8 (Reuters): To the royals discomfort and the publics titillation, Britains most famous servant kept up today his juicy tales of life as Princess Dianas butler.																								But Paul Burrells third instalment of memoirs about Lady Di  still fascinating Britons long after her 1997 death in a Paris car crash  were rather less dramatic than his opening recollections.																								Todays main revelation was that Dianas brother, Earl Spencer, had snubbed Queen Elizabeths Windsor family by stripping the royal banner from Dianas coffin and replacing it with the Spencer family flag.																								It seemed it had more to do with his Spencer vs Windsor war than doing what Diana would have wanted, Burrell told the Daily Mirror newspaper, which won a media bidding war for his story.																								The former butler was sensationally cleared last week of stealing Dianas belongings after an unprecedented intervention in a court case by the Queen at the 11th hour. 																								In todays interview, Burrell claimed removal of the royal banner from Dianas coffin was depriving the princess of her proper status in life  a status of which she was proud. 																								He added: This was the Earls final insult at the worst of times. It was inappropriate and disrespectful. In a funeral oration for his sister, Earl Spencer famously berated the royal family by implication for cold-shouldering Diana. In fact, Diana, divorced from Prince Charles, had strained relations with both the Spencers and the Windsors in her troubled final years.																								Burrell, said to have received around 300,000 for his five-part interviews with the Mirror which will end on Sunday, was apparently one of Dianas main confidants.																								He says he has broken his silence to defend her memory, but financial motives and his own reputation  tarnished during the theft trial  seem also to be behind the revelations.																								In todays Mirror, Burrell also told how he had called Dianas mobile phone on the night of her accident in Paris: But it rang and rang and rang.																								Later, Prince Charles called him on behalf of a concerned Queen. He told me: Her Majesty is very concerned about you Paul, as are William and Harry.																								Burrells revelations today were considerably lower-key than his first interview on Wednesday, in which he told of the Queens fears about unknown powers at work in this country.

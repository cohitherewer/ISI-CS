The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, December 20, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Spielberg saves Oscar																																	 Los Angeles, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Steven Spielberg has once again rescued an old Oscar from the auction block.																																	The filmmaker has purchased the Oscar statuette won by Bette Davis for the 1935 film Dangerous and plans to return it to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a spokeswoman for the group said yesterday. The spokeswoman said she did not know how much the statuette sold for at Sothebys auction house, but Army Archerd, senior columnist for Daily Variety, reported the director paid $207,500 for it.																																	Spielbergs winning bid for the trophy marks the third time in recent years that he has rescued a vintage Oscar at auction for the purpose of giving it back to the Academy to protect it from commercial exploitation. Davis won the Oscar in Dangerous for her performance as an alcoholic actress rehabilitated by Franchot Tone. Spielberg, who won Oscars for the Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List, paid $578,000 last year to buy Davis second Oscar, which she won for the 1938 film Jezebel.

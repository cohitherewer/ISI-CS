The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, November 11, 2002 				 Hawks set term for amnesty
																								Islamabad, Nov. 10 (PTI): While continuing their anti-Musharraf campaign, the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy (ARD) and a coalition of hardline religious parties have said that they are prepared to grant indemnity to all acts of the military regime in the past three years if the army gives up power and returns to the barracks.																								We are not vindictive people. Nobody will have any reservations about the indemnity, said ARD chief Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, who held extensive talks with the six-party alliance of hardline religious parties, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), on forming a coalition government.																								Stating that the ARD and the MMA stuck to their stand for the restoration of the 1973 Constitution without incorporating the controversial amendments of President Pervez Musharraf, Khan said the Musharraf regime, like the previous military regime of Zia-ul Haq certainly needed indemnity for all its acts. 																								The ARD and the MMA would be willing to agree to the same condition to facilitate the army to return to barracks, he was quoted as saying by the Dawn.

 Thursday, October 24, 2002 				 Jiang hopes for better relations with US
 ANDREW STERN				 	 Chinese President Jiang Zemin raises a toast during a dinner in Chicago on Tuesday. (AFP)																								Chicago, Oct. 23 (Reuters): Chinese President Jiang Zemin expressed hope for improving relations with the United States yesterday as he arrived for a meeting with President George W. Bush  a session likely to produce a show of unity despite hot issues ranging from nuclear arms proliferation to Iraq.																								I look forward to my visit with President Bush to exchange views on serious and important subjects ... to help move forward our cooperative relationship, the 76-year-old Jiang said during a toast at a dinner in Chicago attended by political and business leaders.																								His remarks were short on specifics but he did mention combating transnational crime, promoting global and regional economic growth and fighting terrorism  an issue which has brought Chinas support to Washington following the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.																								Jiang was greeted on arrival at OHare International Airport by a US Navy brass band and about 1,000 members of the citys Chinese community who shouted warm welcome and waved tiny red-and-gold Chinese flags.																								He stepped onto a red carpet for a handshake from Chicagos mayor, Richard Daley, Motorola Inc. chairman Christopher Galvin and other political and business leaders.																								The arrival was free of protesters, 700 of whom marched in downtown Chicago the day before to raise human rights issues. But scores of demonstrators assembled outside the downtown hotel where Jiang was staying.

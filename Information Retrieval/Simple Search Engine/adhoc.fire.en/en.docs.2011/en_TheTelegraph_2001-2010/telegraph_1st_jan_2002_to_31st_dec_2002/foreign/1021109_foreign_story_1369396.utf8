The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, November 09, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Parking woes																																	 London, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Women drivers have greater problems with parking than men, according to an analysis of accident claims by a British insurance company.																																	The findings reported in the Times newspaper on Friday will do little to bring harmony in the perennial argument over which sex makes the best drivers. A study of half-a-million claims at Admiral Insurance found that women were almost twice as likely as men to have a collision in a car park, 23 per cent more likely to hit a stationary car, and 15 per cent more likely to reverse into another vehicle.																																	But, before male drivers start congratulating themselves, the study also found that men have more serious accidents, made more costly insurance claims, and kill more pedestrians. Men were also responsible for 98 per cent of convictions for dangerous driving.																																	 Pease, the author of a book called Why Men Dont Listen and Women Cant Read Maps, told the newspaper the survey backed his belief that women are not as good at judging distances.																													 																Jesus box																																	 Toronto (Reuters): A limestone box, thought to have contained the bones of Jesus Christs brother, will get its first public showing in a Toronto museum next week even though it was found to have been cracked on its way to Canada from Israel, museum officials said on Thursday. The James Ossuary, a 2,000 year-old box believed by some experts to have held the bones of James, the brother of Jesus, arrived in Toronto in late October from Tel Aviv via New York. Upon its arrival, officials at Torontos Royal Ontario Museum found several new cracks on the back, end and front of the 50-cm-long ossuary. One of the cracks runs through an inscription on the box, which reads: Yakov (James), son of Yosef (Joseph), brother of Yeshua (Jesus). The inscription is in Aramaic, a language used some 2,000 years ago. 																													 																Apocalypse																																	 London (Reuters): Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppolas surreal account of a journey to the heart of darkness during the Vietnam War, has been voted the greatest film of the last quarter-century by British film experts. In a poll organised by the British Film Institutes Sight amp; Sound magazine, the 1979 epic beat Martin Scorseses Raging Bull into second place and Ingmar Bergmans Fanny and Alexander into third. Apocalypse Now deserves its position for being a richly complex, madcap experiment in war film-making that comes off because it never falls from the tightrope it walks between extravagance and profundity, Sight amp; Sound editor Nick James said in a statement.

 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Very enjoyable game: Lee
																								London, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Forget Dracula and Star Wars. When it comes to fun, nothing beats playing the villain in a James Bond movie. Lovingly wielding his golden gun once more at a Bond exhibition in London, 80-year-old actor Christopher Lee said yesterday: It was a joy to play  Great fun. 																								A Bond film is a game, a very enjoyable game, he said of his 1974 role as the arch baddie Francisco Scaramanga in The Man With the Golden Gun. Lee, who has since gained a new generation of movie fans with his roles in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, posed with gun in hand alongside Honor Blackman, who so memorably played Pussy Galore in Goldfinger. Lee, who rose to blood-sucking movie fame as Dracula and boasts more than 250 films to his credit, has nothing but fond memories of the Bond movies but said its cloak-and-dagger hero would never survive five minutes as a real spy.

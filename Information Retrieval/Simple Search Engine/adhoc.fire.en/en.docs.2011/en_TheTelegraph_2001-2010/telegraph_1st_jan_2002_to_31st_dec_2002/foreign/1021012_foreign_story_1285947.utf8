(AFP)																								Massaponix (Virginia), Oct. 11 (Reuters): A man was killed in a Virginia gasoline station shooting today as police desperately hunted for an elusive sniper who has killed seven people and wounded two, spreading fear in the Washington area.																								Virginia state police said the shooting happened at 9.30 am (1330 GMT) at an Exxon gasoline station off the busy I-95 highway south of Washington, DC, but that it was too early to link it to the string of sniper slayings.																								A person was shot and taken to the hospital, Virginia state police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell said. Were on the lookout for a white Chevy Astro van last seen going northbound on Route 1.A spokeswoman at Virginia Gov. Mark Warners office said the victim, who was shot near Fredericksburg, Virginia, had died.																								This was the fourth shooting at a gas station and the second to take place only metres away from a police station. Police say the sniper was firing a high-velocity rifle and chose his victims at random, killing them with one shot.																								Sporting and cultural events this weekend have been cancelled for fear that the sniper could be drawn to attack crowds of people or pick off children playing on fields.																								Exits along highway I-95, the major interstate up and down the East Coast were shut down in the Virginia area, and police were hoping traffic would slow the van they were hunting.																								State and federal investigators have searched for the sniper who has killed seven people and injured two more since October 2. On Wednesday a 53-year-old man Dean Meyers from Gaitherburg, Maryland, was killed at a gas station in Manassas, Virginia, a slaying that police have linked to the other shootings.

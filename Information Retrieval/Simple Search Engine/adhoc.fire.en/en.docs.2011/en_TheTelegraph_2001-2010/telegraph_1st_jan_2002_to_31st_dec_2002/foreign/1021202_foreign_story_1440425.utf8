 Monday, December 02, 2002 				 Palace at war with BBC over slur on royalty
 ANDREW ALDERSON																								London, Dec. 1: Buckingham Palace has sent a furious letter to the BBC complaining that a report by its flagship political programme on the future of the monarchy was biased and inaccurate.																								In a rare move, one of the Queens most senior officials formally protested about last Sundays On The Record on BBC1, which her aides thought was irresponsible and potentially damaging.																								They were particularly incensed that a public service broadcaster should screen such a one-sided report.																								The programme was inaccurate and extremely biased, said one royal official yesterday. Our letter takes the BBC to task and criticises it for broadcasting a diatribe against the monarchy.																								The Daily Telegraph has discovered that the letter was sent by Penny Russell-Smith, the Queens press secretary, to David Jordan, the editor of On The Record, on Friday.																								It was done with the knowledge  and support  of the Queens private office.																								Russell-Smith criticises the BBC for not seeking a right of reply from Buckingham Palace and for not checking facts, particularly over the Civil List payments, the money paid annually by Parliament for the royal familys expenses.																								There has been a series of disagreements between Buckingham Palace and the BBC in recent years.																								In 1995, the BBCs Panorama programme broadcast a sensational interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. It was screened without Marmaduke Hussey, then the chairman of the BBC, being forewarned, because his wife, Lady Susan Hussey, was a lady-in-waiting to the Queen.																								The following year, in apparent retaliation, the palace ended the BBCs monopoly of producing the Queens Christmas broadcast. Two years ago there was private anger within the royal family at the BBCs refusal to broadcast live coverage of the Queen Mothers 100th birthday celebrations.																								Buckingham Palace has become more active in challenging inaccurate and unfair stories. Last weekend, Prince Philip publicly denounced as fictitious claims in the Mail on Sunday that he had called the late Princess of Wales a harlot and a trollop in letters to her in 1992.																								In the On The Record report, Gloria De Piero, the BBC reporter who presented the item, said the Golden Jubilee celebrations had been spectacular but expensive, costing nearly 500,000 from the Civil List, the 7.9 million a year we give the Queen.																								The BBC in its poll of MPs asked whether the Civil List should be cut back, which in turn would reduce the money available for the Queens extended family, for her staff and for a suitably regal lifestyle, said De Piero. There was no mention of the Queens reforms to the Civil List.																								Since 1990 she has repaid all parliamentary annuities to members of the royal family with the exception of those for the duties carried out by herself, Prince Philip and the late Queen Mother.																								Payments for eight other members of the royal family, totalling more than 1.5 million a year, are reimbursed to the government. There was also no mention of the Queens decision in 1993 to pay income tax.																								De Piero opened her report by saying that a poll last week showed even lower public support for the royals than at any time since Dianas death. An embarrassing court case, allegations of rape and rumours that youre raising cash on the side are bound to spoil the festivities.																								The report continued with interviews with committed republicans and Left-wing Labour MPs.																								Paul Flynn, the Labour MP for Newport West, said the popularity of the monarchy had collapsed in ruins and we had these stories that are more reminiscent of a porn movie, or the fencing that takes place in an Arthur Daly shop.																								A spokesman for the BBC declined to comment on the criticisms of On The Record, which is presented by John Humphrys. We have no indication that a letter of complaint has been sent or is being sent, he said.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

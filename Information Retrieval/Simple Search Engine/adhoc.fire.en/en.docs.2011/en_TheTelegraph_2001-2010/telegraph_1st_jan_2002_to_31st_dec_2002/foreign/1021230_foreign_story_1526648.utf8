 Monday, December 30, 2002 				 People buy British, prince buys German
																								London, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Britains Prince Charles has been accused of hypocrisy for making a fervent Buy British appeal after signing a deal with the German car firm Audi.																								The Sunday Mirror said Charles had signed a 100,000 deal to replace his British-assembled Vauxhall cars with Audis before he appealed to local government, the armed forces, schools and universities to buy British food.																								This is hypocrisy from the heir to the throne who appears not to care about workers in his own country, Labour parliamentarian Tom Watson said after the newspaper revealed details of the deal.																								A spokeswoman for the prince said that she was only aware of one car bought from the luxury Audi unit of Volkswagen Ag to replace an Omega that is no longer produced by Vauxhall.																								Asked about reports that as many as six cars had been delivered, she said: I really dont know. I can only assume they are cars that private individuals (working as royal staff) wanted to lease.																								Blow to royalty																								After two funerals, two butler scandals and a Golden Jubilee, the popularity of Britains royal family has plummeted, according to a new poll.																								The soundings in Sundays Observer newspaper showed that only one in two Britons now believe the House of Windsor will last more than 20 years  down from 58 per cent a year ago. 																								One in four believe the institution will not survive more than 10 years after the death of Queen Elizabeth, who is now 76.

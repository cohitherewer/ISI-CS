(Reuters)																								Paris, Nov. 23 (Reuters): A court fined management of the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret 10,000 euros yesterday for racial discrimination in refusing to employ Black people outside of its kitchen.																								The court also slapped a 3,000 euro fine on Micheline Beuzit, an employee who told a Senegalese-born job seeker the Moulin Rouge doesnt take Blacks in the theatre, only in the kitchen.																								An investigation by state prosecutors found that the Moulin Rouge, whose scantily-clad can-can dancers are a huge tourist draw, had not hired a coloured person as a performer or waiter for 40 years, although many are employed as kitchen staff.																								Abdoulaye Marega who was turned away when he applied for the job in January 2001, was awarded 4,500 euros in damages. French anti-racism group SOS Racisme, which helped Marega bring the case, was awarded 2,300 euros.																								The Moulin Rouge started out as a bawdy music hall in the 19th century and its distinctive neon-edged windmill arms poke out above the rooftops in the seedy Paris district of Pigalle. It was most recently depicted in a film starring Nicole Kidman. Growing tamer with age, the club now draws coachloads of tourists and well-dressed executives to its nightly dinner and dance shows.

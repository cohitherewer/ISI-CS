The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, November 06, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Stones tested																																	 Los Angeles, Nov. 5 (Reuters): Rolling Stone Mick Jaggers star power was put to the test yesterday as the cream of Hollywood turned out to see his veteran rock band play its first theatre show in Los Angeles in more than 30 years.																																	Rock stars among the 2,200 fans at the Wiltern Theatre included Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Neil Young, Tom Waits, Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek, Fleetwood Mac co-founder Mick Fleetwood, Dwight Yoakam and Eagles bass player Timothy B. Schmit.																																	The film and TV community was represented by Anjelica Huston, Benicio del Toro, writer/director Cameron Crowe and Reese Witherspoon.																																	Jagger joked at the outset that he would allow all the famous people and everybody that thinks theyre famous  to come up on stage and join hands. The Wiltern stop marked the final show of the Rolling Stones Los Angeles trilogy. They played at the 20,000-capacity Staples Center last Thursday and the 45,000-capacity Edison Field on Saturday. The last time they played such a small venue in Los Angeles was in 1972 at the Hollywood Palladium, an old ballroom that holds about 3,500 people. The Rolling Stones have played four other small shows since their Licks world tour kicked off on September 3																													 																Over the hill																																	 Berlin (Reuters): A German driver who got out of his car on a hill to relieve himself found his car at the bottom of a river after he forgot to apply the hand brake, police said on Tuesday. At first he tried to claim his car was stolen but the police immediately found this wasnt the case, the police said in Leipzig. When the salvage team arrived the next morning, the car was already irreparable. He can expect a fine for parking on the sidewalk and not securing the car properly, Hoehn said. 																													 																Fiery row																																	 Cairo (Reuters): A woman set fire to her Cairo apartment after a row with her husband over his refusal to buy dried fruit and nuts traditionally eaten in the holy month of Ramzan, Egyptian newspapers reported on Tuesday. The blaze started when the woman doused the flat with kerosene and caused an estimated 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($6,500) of damage before firefighters brought it under control, al-Akhbar reported. Dried apricots, figs and nuts are relatively expensive and can often be the cause of domestic strife in Egypt if a familys wage earner refuses to buy them for Ramzan. During the month, which begins on Wednesday in Egypt, Muslims fast by day and eat and drink only at night. Many Egyptians like to celebrate in the evening with special foods.

 Tuesday, October 15, 2002 				 Brothers cheat death
																								London, Oct. 14: Two brothers on holiday in Bali have told how they cheated death by leaving the Sari Club minutes before the devastating blast.																								Ben and Joe Norton, from Paddock Wood, Kent, were nearing the end of their two-week holiday on the Indonesian island and had visited the ill-fated nightspot almost every night.																								But they decided to leave just 15 minutes before it was turned to rubble killing nearly 200 people. The 27-year-old charity drivers former partner Donna Mewett said: Ben phoned. He said he was OK. He was just a little way up the way when it went off. He saw some horrible sights.																								I think he is just a little bit taken aback by what he had seen really. He did say that any other night he would have been in there and they left 15 minutes prior to it. She added that Ben and his 35-year-old lorry driver brother Joe are due to catch their scheduled flight home.

 Tuesday, October 01, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Teddy traced to thief 																																	 Vienna, Sept. 30 (Reuters): Traces of DNA on a cocaine-stuffed teddy bear helped bring charges against a man who got away with a bank robbery five years ago, police said today.																																	The main post office in the upper Austrian city of Linz intercepted a teddy bear with a 200-gram belly-full of cocaine in July, and traced the recipient to a 40-year-old man. The Austrian said he had the drug sent from Brazil for his personal use, and was released after five weeks in custody. But tests on the furry toy matched DNA evidence found at the scene of a botched bank robbery in 1997, when two thieves threw their booty out of the window of the getaway car after an alarm went off in the money bag. The man admitted to the robbery on questioning, and said his then accomplice was his brother. Both are in custody. 																													 																Nigerian weds Thai in prison																																	 Nonthaburi, Thailand (AFP): A Nigerian inmate serving a life sentence for drug trafficking today married his Thai prisoner sweetheart in the hope of bringing her to Nigeria once an extradition treaty is finalised. Johnson Adibiesie, 35, tied the knot with 40-year-old Pranee Meenawong in a traditional Thai ceremony at the notorious Bang Kwang central prison  better known as the Bangkok Hilton. Both are serving life sentences on drug charges handed down in 1994, a corrections department official said. The couple have known each other since the 1980s, when they opened a leather business together, and have a child who lives in Nigeria.

The fracas was the latest in a string of misadventures involving the 30-year-old, who has revived not only Britains tradition of rock n roll but also the associated taste for mayhem.																																	The boy didnt look good, several of his teeth were punched out, the police said. Gallaghers spokeswoman said he would be spending much of the day in a dentists chair, while a German promoter said a Hamburg gig planned for Monday night had been cancelled.																													 																Box battle																																	 Los Angeles (Reuters): Harry Potter and James Bond each claimed victories at the North American box office during the US Thanksgiving Day holiday weekend, while a Disney cartoon version of Treasure Island was a turkey. According to studio estimates issued on Sunday, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets reclaimed the top slot with ticket sales of about $32.2 million for the three days beginning November 29. The boy wizard narrowly beat the latest James Bond thriller Die Another Day, which had opened at number one last weekend. This time, Bond reported $31 million. However 007 did win the five-day race, which includes Wednesday and Thanksgiving Day Thursday, with $46.3 million against Potters $45.8 million.

Jewel jinx																																	 The Hague (Reuters): Thieves stole diamond jewellery worth millions of euros on Monday from a Dutch museum exhibiting tiaras and necklaces borrowed from European kings and queens. It happened at four oclock (0300 GMT) in the morning. We dont know the full value yet but its in the millions. They took diamonds and jewellery on loan from other museums and private persons, said Bob Crezee, deputy director of the Museon science museum in The Hague. Crezee said an unknown number of people had broken into the museum and snatched jewels from the display, which is about diamond cutting and jewellery making and includes several pieces of historical significance. Police are investigating the crime and Crezee declined to give any further details because some of the owners of the gems and artefacts had not yet been informed. A museum spokesman said some of the jewellery on display were borrowed from European royal families but declined to give further details.

 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Screening reduces risk of breast removal
																								London, Aug. 22 (Reuters): If women receive screening for breast cancer, they are less likely to need to have their breasts removed, a study published in Britain said today.																								Conflicting findings about the benefits of screening have left women confused about whether or not it was worth having mammograms, how often and at what age to start.																								British and Italian researchers said their study of patients in Florence refuted other scientists who argued that breast cancer screening leads to over diagnosis and too many women losing their breasts through unnecessary surgery.																								The scientists from Britains Imperial Cancer Research Fund and several Italian institutes found that women who were screened were more likely to have relatively minor surgery to remove lumps, but less likely to need the whole breast removed.																								What were saying is: yes, women are having surgeries. But instead of having mastectomies, they are having more minor surgeries, a spokeswoman for the Imperial Cancer Research Fund told Reuters.																								The findings appeared on Friday in the British Medical Journal.																								The research found that the numbers of small cancers detected and minor operations performed both shot up dramatically in the Italian city of Florence after breast cancer screening was introduced in 1994.																								Those numbers fell back again after most women had their initial screenings, but finally settled in 1996 at a figure substantially higher than without screening.																								Meanwhile, the numbers of large cancers found and radical mastectomies performed to remove the entire breast fell almost by half to about 0.6 per 1,000 women.																								This indicates that the introduction of screening brings about a reduction in mastectomy rates, not an increase, they wrote.																								In March, Swedish scientists said breast cancer screening saved lives, producing a 21 percent reduction in breast cancer deaths among women offered screening versus women who were not.																								Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women. The risk of developing the disease increases with age. ADVERTISEMENT copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.

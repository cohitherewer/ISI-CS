 Sunday, November 10, 2002 				 Symbolic Maoist blast rocks Kathmandu
 DEEPAK THAPA																								Kathmandu, Nov. 9: This morning, Kathmandu woke up to a powerful explosion that reverberated to great distances in the bowl-shaped valley. 																								The target seems to have been the downtown head office of the national flag-carrier, Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation. But the bomb exploded outside the office premises and did not cause any serious damage to the building.																								Although the incident did not result in any deaths, the blast was one more in a series to indicate that the Maoists are on a rampage. Yesterday, an explosion in a town 25 km east of Kathmandu had killed a teenaged boy.																								The timing of todays bomb blast is significant for two reasons. One is that November 9 is the twelfth anniversary of Nepals 1990 constitution, one which the CPN (Maoist) is intent on replacing with another one written by a constituent assembly. The second is that it comes during the preparatory phase of a three-day bandh called by the Maoists from November 11 to 13.																								The three-day strike had been called by the rebels in anticipation of the parliamentary polls that were to begin on the 13 November. Although the elections have been postponed indefinitely with the ouster of Sher Bahadur Deuba as Prime Minister on October 4 and the subsequent assumption of executive authority by King Gyanendra, the Maoists have stuck to their original programme.																								For a country that just came out of the three-day Diwali break on Thursday, the weekend holiday followed by a three-day enforced shutdown means a suspension of normal business.																								 for five 																								more days. This is bad news especially for the tourism industry that 																								had just begun showing improvement.																								None of the blasts in the capital have killed more than one person at 																								a time, although the Maoists most probably have the means. But like 																								in the past the coming bandh too will most likely be a total success. 																								The scare value of possible attacks is all in favour of the Maoists.																								Almost on the sidelines is the government headed by royal-																								appointee, Lokendra Bahadur Chand, is still facing a crisis of 																								legitimacy. The manner in which the government was constituted by 																								the king on 11 October has also come under flak from constitutional 																								experts. To make matters worse, neither of the two major 																								parliamentary parties, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party 																								of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), has shown any inclination to 																								join the cabinet despite repeated exhortations by the prime minister.																								On the question of dealing with the Maoists, the government has 																								also repeatedly declared that it has opened the doors for talks, and 																								that the rebels have to indicate their desire to enter into dialogue. 																								Minister have dropped hints that some backroom manoeuvring may 																								be afoot to bring the Maoists to the negotiating table, but going by 																								the daily routine of attacks and the statements emanating from the 																								Maoist leadership, that may be a while in bearing fruit.																								There were encouraging signs in the 24 October statement from 																								CPN (Maoist) chairman, Prachanda, which asked for a political 																								exit to the present impasse through a dialogue among all political 																								forces, including the king, and for which the king would have to 																								initiate the first steps. This statement was remarkable for the absence 																								of anti-monarchy rhetoric and was viewed as a possible opening for 																								talks.																								However, it was back to square one two weeks later. A statement by 																								the convenor of the political outfit of the Maoists, Baburam 																								Bhattarai, called on all parliamentary and non-parliamentary forces 																								in a broad united front against the feudal monarchy. Bhattarai also 																								announced that the upcoming three-day bandh would signal the 																								beginning of a united peoples resistance campaign against the 																								king.																								It seems whether he does it directly or through the government, the 																								onus of action is now on the king. On the eve of the anniversary of 																								the constitution, a group of eight eminent personalities, including 																								three who were members of the constitution drafting committee in 																								1990, came out with a statement that said that the present 																								government is not legitimate and that it lacks public support.																								The statement also asked for either the reinstatement of the 																								parliament dissolved earlier in May or a resort to interim 																								arrangements that would restore the paramountcy of the peoples 																								sovereign rights. The interim arrangements, they said, should also 																								include the Maoistsa sentiment that has become more and more 																								kosher as the country lurches from one crisis to another.

 Thursday, October 31, 2002 				 Colombo curfew after clashes
																								Colombo, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Sri Lanka clamped a curfew on a Colombo suburb today after clashes between Muslims and majority Sinhalese over the planned building of a mosque, witnesses said.																								Houses and cars were set on fire and at least 13 people were wounded, officials and witnesses said. The clash also closed roads, leading to traffic jams throughout the city.																								Earlier this month violent clashes in the east of the island left about seven people dead, but the incident in Maligawatta in central Colombo was not believed to be related.																								The standoff is continuing. A mob of about 150 people are resisting police, one witness said. 																								Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebel peace negotiators flew out of the island on the same plane today for a second round of talks to end a two-decade ethnic war that has killed 64,000 people.

 Monday, December 30, 2002 				 Power shift in Kenya
 MANOAH ESIPISU AND HELEN NYAMBURA																								Nairobi, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Opposition leader Mwai Kibaki swept to a historic win in Kenyas presidential and general election, ending nearly 40 years of rule by President Daniel arap Mois KANU party, the electoral commission said today.																								KANU candidate Uhuru Kenyatta conceded defeat even before official results were declared, telling Kenyans in a statement: I accept your choice.																								I now concede that Mwai Kibaki will be the third President of the Republic of Kenya, he said. KANU and I will respect him and his position in accordance with the Constitution.																								A commission spokesman said hours earlier that provisional results showed Kibakis National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) alliance had won Fridays poll. He has won convincingly, and we will announce it officially later today, he said.																								But commission chairman Samuel Kivuitu later said he could not declare a Kibaki victory until all result certificates had arrived from the constituencies. 																								Looking at the figures we have so far, Kibaki is leading, he said. If it goes like that he is likely to be the next President of Kenya. But one must follow the law which says we must receive all the certificates.																								His statement caused an uproar among Opposition supporters expecting to hear him announce the final result, and he made a hasty exit, jostled and shoved by angry onlookers.																								Moi, who has ruled East Africas most important country and economy largely unchallenged for 24 years, was constitutionally barred from running.																								Kenyans reeling under harsh economic conditions turned massively to Kibakis alliance of about 10 parties that finally set aside years of bickering to forge a common front.																								The economy shrank in 2000 for the first time since 1963 and grew by only 1.2 per cent last year. Well over half its 30 million people live on less than $1 a day.																								Kibaki, a former finance minister who studied at the London School of Economics, has pledged to revive the economy and end Mois patronage-based style.																								But critics say NARC represents only an illusion of change, pointing to the many recent defectors from KANU among its ranks, and to Kibakis decade as vice president under Moi during one of the most intolerant periods in recent Kenyan history. Kenyatta told Kenyans to ensure that leaders you have elected deliver on their promises.

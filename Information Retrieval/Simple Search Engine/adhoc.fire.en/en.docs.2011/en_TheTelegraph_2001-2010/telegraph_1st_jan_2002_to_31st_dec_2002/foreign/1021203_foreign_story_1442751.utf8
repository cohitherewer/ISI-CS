																								London, Dec. 2: A promotional film made by Boeing that shows an attack on a fictional Islamic city has been condemned as irresponsible and insensitive by Muslims.																								The film, titled The Army  Objective Force: Realising the Vision, is being shown to British firms to promote the next generation of battle technology. It shows buildings being blown up by unmanned aircraft and tiny high-speed robot tanks. Mosques are clearly seen in the film, which resembles a video game and features a heavy assault in the year 2016 on a fictitious town called Takkbu.																								A narrator says the new technology, heavily reliant on satellites, aims to eliminate all collateral damage. Mosques and hospitals are given as examples of buildings that must not be hit.																								Boeing, which has a multi-million dollar order from the Pentagon to provide technology for Americas Future Combat Systems programme, is attempting to interest British companies in sub-contracted work.																								 It is likely that the ministry of defence will eventually adopt parts of the programme.																								An industry representative said he was taken aback by the presumption that Americas future wars would be against Islamic countries and found the film distasteful.																								Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: This is very insensitive. It endorses a strong feeling prevailing among Muslims that this so-called War on Terror by America is a war on Islam. A film like this is irresponsible. However, a Boeing spokesman said: This is not about West against East. The technology is part of a new type of warfare; one in which gathering information is critical. 																								Britain plans to vaccinate key military and health service workers against smallpox as a precaution against any terror attack with the deadly virus.																								Denying it had any specific information of a attack, the government said it would vaccinate 350 health specialists as well as selected members of the armed forces.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

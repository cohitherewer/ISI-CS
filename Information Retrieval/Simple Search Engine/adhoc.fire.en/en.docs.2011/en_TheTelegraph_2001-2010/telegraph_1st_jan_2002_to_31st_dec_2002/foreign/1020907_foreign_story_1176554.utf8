 Saturday, September 07, 2002 				 Imrans poll hopes revived
				 	 Imran Khan																								Islamabad, Sept. 6 (PTI): Reviving the election hopes of Shahbaz Sharif, brother of former Premier Nawaz Sharif, and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, Pakistans newly constituted election tribunal has approved their nominations, over-ruling the objections against them.																								The election tribunal yesterday allowed Shahbaz to contest the October polls, over-ruling the objections filed by Islamabad-based journalist Shahid Orakzai who said Shahbaz backed a mob attack on the Supreme Court in 1998 when Nawaz Sharif was the Prime Minister.																								When Orakzai persisted with his arguments, one of the high court judges on the tribunal, said: Dont try to dictate the court, The News reported today. The papers of Nawaz Sharifs wife Khulsoom have also been accepted. She will contest from Lahore. Officials had earlier said they would not allow Shahbaz, nominated as leader of the Pakistan Muslim League, to return to Pakistan to contest the polls. 																								The tribunal also approved the nomination of Imran Khan to contest the polls from his hometown Mianwali in Punjab after his graduation certificate was produced by his counsel. The poll officials had earlier rejected Imrans papers, saying he had not submitted his original degree certificate.																								Imran is contesting from three other constituencies in Punjab and NWFP. The tribunal, however rejected the nominations of three former MPs of the Muslim League.

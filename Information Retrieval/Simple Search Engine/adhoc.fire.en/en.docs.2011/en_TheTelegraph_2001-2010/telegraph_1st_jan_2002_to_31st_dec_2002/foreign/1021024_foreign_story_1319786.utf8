																								Sydney, Oct. 23 (AFP): Sir Anthony Hopkins cancelled promotional events in Australia today reportedly after a note from the serial sniper terrorising the Washington DC area was linked to his film, Hannibal.																								The host of a Melbourne radio talk show said Hopkins cancelled an interview with him scheduled for today on the orders of his US management company.

Hopkins was in Melbourne as part of a promotional tour for his new film, Red Dragon, third in the Hannibal Lecter series.																								United International Pictures marketing manager John Anderson confirmed to the Australian Associated Press that Hopkins had been scheduled to take part in two interviews in Melbourne today before returning to Sydney.

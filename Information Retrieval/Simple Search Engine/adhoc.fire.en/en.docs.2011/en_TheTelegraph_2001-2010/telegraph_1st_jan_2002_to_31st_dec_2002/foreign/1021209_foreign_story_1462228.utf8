 Monday, December 09, 2002 				 Once bitten, Anthonys do it twice
				 	 Anthony and Dayanara																								San Juan (Puerto Rico), Dec. 8 (AP): Singer Marc Anthony and former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres have renewed their wedding vows, emerging from a mass holding hands as bridesmaids in scarlet gowns showered them with white rose petals.																								Hundreds of well-wishers lined the narrow streets outside the cathedral of San Juan and shouted Kiss, kiss!. The couple responded with one more kiss before being whisked away in a black Limousine.																								The nuptial mass was the apparent triumph of a reconciliation by the couple. Although they announced a split-up in July, they never legally filed for separation, and Torres had described the church wedding as a new beginning.																								Anthony, the Grammy-winning singer born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, first married Torres in a Las Vegas civil ceremony on May 10, 2000.																								The plan was always to do the church wedding, said Jennifer Neiman, Anthonys publicist. It was one of those things that they always intended to do and never found the time.																								Torres, a Puerto Rican crowned Miss Universe in 1993, was wearing an ivory satin body-skimming dress with a trumpet skirt and a long train. The gown, by New York designer Reem Acra, was adorned with crystals and pearls and hundreds of metres of twisted thread made of pure gold.																								Hundreds of pink and white roses were laid on the cathedrals steps hours before the 27-year-old brides father, Jose Torres, accompanied her into the mass. The Reverend Ricky Gerena led the ceremony.

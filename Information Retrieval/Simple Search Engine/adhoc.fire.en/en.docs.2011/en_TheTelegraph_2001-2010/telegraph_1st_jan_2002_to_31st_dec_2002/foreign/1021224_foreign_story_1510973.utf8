 CRISPIAN BALMER																								Rome, Dec. 23 (Reuters): The heirs to Italys throne came and saw their ancestral homeland today, ending a 56-year exile imposed as punishment for their familys collaboration with fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in World War II.																								But news of the surprise trip was greeted with indifference, and the long-awaited re-entry proved to be more of a whimper than a bang, lasting less than five hours. Prince Vittorio Emanuele, 65, and his 30-year-old son had time for only a brief audience with Pope John Paul before flying back to their residence-in-exile  Switzerland.																								Although free to stay by an Act of Parliament, the prince said back injuries sustained during a car racing accident in Egypt meant he had to fly home to Geneva for further treatment. The prince, accompanied by his wife Marina Doria, promised his family would be back in February.

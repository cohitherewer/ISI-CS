 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 Fresh uproar over Cherie call
																								London, Dec. 10: Downing Street faced fresh accusations last night that it had not told the full truth about Cherie Blairs relationship with the fraudster Peter Foster after admitting that she called his solicitors to discuss his battle against deportation.																								The disclosure of her contact with Fosters lawyers two weeks ago appeared to contradict an earlier denial by No 10 that she had intervened in the immigration proceedings after Foster had helped her negotiate a discount on the purchase of two flats in Bristol.																								Last week Cherie Blair implied that she had not been aware of the details of his past as a convicted conman  and would have been more circumspect had she known.																								While Cherie Blair laughed and joked with children from Barnardos as she switched on Christmas tree lights outside No 10 yesterday, officials faced embarrassing questions about her involvement in Fosters fight against deportation.																								Downing Streets attempts to draw a line under the affair, which has paralysed Blairs office for a week, were thrown into confusion by a statement from Fosters lawyers. It disclosed that Cherie Blair telephoned them on November 22  two weeks after she had suggested that her contacts with him were over but while she was still exchanging emails with him over the purchase of the flats.																								In a statement faxed to newspapers, Janes Solicitors said that Cherie Blair had taken part in a conference call with Carole Caplin, her fashion and fitness adviser and Fosters girlfriend.																								The solicitors said: The avowed and plain purpose of the telephone call was to reassure Carole that the immigration proceedings against Peter Foster were being conducted on a regular and normal basis.																								We wish to emphasise that Cherie Booth, QC, did not intrude into our conduct of the proceedings and, for the avoidance of doubt, had no say whatsoever in our choice of representation of counsel.																								 quot;In our opinion she was simply seeking to provide support and 																								assurance to her friend Carole and acted with complete propriety. quot; 																								The firm refused to answer questions about the extent of Mrs 																								Blairs participation in the conference call. However, a call from 																								Mrs Blair, a leading human rights lawyer as well as the Prime 																								Ministers wife, would be a significant event in such a case.																								No 10 confirmed that Mrs Blair had made quot;one short call quot; to 																								Fosters solicitors, but denied that she had interfered in the 																								immigration proceedings. It said: quot;Mrs Blair stands emphatically 																								by her statement that, had she known the details of Peter Fosters 																								past, she would have been more circumspect. quot;																								Officials said that she had acted as Miss Caplins friend to try 																								to quot;reassure quot; her that quot;the solicitors were handling the case in 																								the normal way quot;.																								In a statement last week, Mrs Blair said that newspaper 																								allegations made against her were quot;false quot;. They included a claim 																								that she intervened in Fosters deportation case.																								When journalists put the allegations to Mr Blairs official 																								spokesman, they were again denied. Downing Streets record of the 																								briefing on the No 10 website states: quot;Had Mrs Blair been 																								assisting Mr Fosters legal battle against deportation? No. quot;																								Earlier, Mr Blair was drawn directly into the controversy over his 																								wifes purchase of the flats when No 10 disclosed that he had 																								cleared himself of any impropriety under the ministerial code of 																								conduct.																								The purchase had been financed with money from a quot;blind trust quot; set 																								up by the Blairs to prevent conflicts of interest over their 																								financial affairs while he was Prime Minister.																								Officials said Mr Blair had checked with Sir Andrew Turnbull, the 																								Cabinet Secretary, who had agreed that the code had not been 																								breached.																								But Mr Blairs official spokesman conceded that a potential 																								conflict of interest might have arisen if the Blairs property 																								portfolio had been larger.																								He denied that the controversy over the flats and Fosters 																								involvement in the deal had caused a rift between the Blairs and 																								Alastair Campbell, the Governments director of communications, or 																								his partner, Fiona Millar, who works for Mrs Blair.																								But No 10 did not deny reports that the Prime Minister had vetoed 																								his wifes plan to make a public show of her support for Miss 																								Caplin by inviting her to a charity carol concert.																								The Tories stepped up their demands for a full statement by Mr 																								Blair on his wifes involvement with Foster.																								Michael Ancram, their foreign affairs spokesman, said it was time 																								for a quot;complete, open and frank declaration quot;.																								In a letter to Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative leader, last 																								night, Mr Blair maintained that Fosters deportation case had been 																								 quot;handled entirely properly quot;.																								 quot;The Home Office has already made clear that no political 																								interference has taken place in this case, quot; he said.																								 9 December 2002: Blair faces demands for statement on conman																								 8 December 2002: Blairs ignored warnings by Campbell over 																								Cheries guru																								 7 December 2002: Cheries mortgage man faces trial for cash 																								plot																								 6 December 2002: Cherie says sorry over conman lie																								 3 December 2002: Blair flats conman faces new allegations																								 2 December 2002: Conmans girlfriend is Cherie Blairs guest at 																								Chequers																								Information appearing on Electronic Telegraph is the copyright of 																								Telegraph Group Limited and must not be reproduced in any medium 																								without licence.

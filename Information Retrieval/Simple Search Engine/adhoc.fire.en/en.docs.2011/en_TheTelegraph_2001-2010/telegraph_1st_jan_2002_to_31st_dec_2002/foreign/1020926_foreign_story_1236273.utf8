 Thursday, September 26, 2002 				 Blairism, Jedi in Oxford dictionary
 PETER GRAFF																								London, Sept. 25 (Reuters): Science fictions Jedi warriors and Klingon bad guys have entered the newest edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, along with asylum seekers, asymmetrical warfare and spin control.																								The first new edition in nearly a decade of the short version of the classic word bible will appear tomorrow, with 3,500 new entries, from ass-backwards to warp drive.																								Britains Prime Minister Tony Blair is immortalised with Blairism, Blairite, New Labour, Old Labour and the ill-fated construction project, the Millennium Dome.																								New slang terms include get real andbadass. There are also 500 new quotations. 																								Among the writers whose literary citations appear for the first time are best sellers Tom Clancy and Nick Hornby, Bridget Jones author Helen Fielding and, inevitably, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling.																								But although new words from science fiction films like Star Wars and Star Trek have made it, words coined for the Harry Potter books are still too new to appear. Generally, a word has to be used five times in five different places over five years, although something like text messaging got in quicker because it became so widely used so quickly, said spokeswoman Claire Turner.																								Rowling gets credit for notable uses of old words, such as beefy  an adjective describing Harrys awful uncle Vernon  and stump, as in: Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was. 																								But muggle  Rowlings made-up word for people who are not wizards  is still listed only as an early 20th century American slang term for a marijuana cigarette.																								Bet you didnt know that.

 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 Chador charger faces a query: what about Father Christmas?
 BELINDA GOLDSMITH				 	 Reverend Fred Nile. (Reuters)																								Canberra, Nov. 22 (Reuters): An Australian politicians call to ban Muslim women from wearing a traditional head-to-knee gown in public because they could be used to conceal weapons has sparked outrage in Australia.																								Talk-back radio and newspapers letters pages were brimming with accusations of racism today after one of Australias most outspoken conservative politicians, the Reverend Fred Nile, suggested a ban on wearing the body-enveloping chador in public.																								In New South Wales state parliament on Wednesday, Nile said the chador was a perfect disguise for terrorists as it conceals both weapons and explosives. He used as an example female Chechen rebels smuggling explosives into a Moscow theatre during a recent hostage crisis.																								The Christian Democrat politician fuelled the row further today, telling local television: Its only extremists who wear the chador... Theyre the people that (al Qaida leader Osama) bin Laden is manipulating and using in his terrorist movement.																								Niles proposed ban was instantly condemned by religious leaders, unions and politicians in the predominantly Christian country where Muslims have been increasingly victimised since the September 11, 2001, attacks by suspected Islamic militants on the United States.																								Nevertheless, it took conservative Prime Minister John Howard until today to rule out such a ban after his initial ambivalent comments triggered a barrage of criticism.																								You cant in a democratic society pass laws telling people how to dress, Howard told Sydney radio 2GB.																								Foreign minister Alexander Downer also said there was no plan to ban any sort of clothing, particularly where it was indicative of religious beliefs and customs.																								You could hide things under a raincoat I suppose. I dont think were going to ban raincoats, Downer told Australia radio.																								Writers to national newspapers ridiculed Niles proposed ban, asking why he had not extended it to stop Catholic nuns and priests from wearing traditional dress, ultra-orthodox Jews from wearing long coats and Father Christmas from carrying a sack. Perhaps Nile will only be satisfied when we all wander around the local supermarket stark naked, suggested John Ramsay from Bondi Junction in a letter to The Australian newspaper.																								Representatives of the Anglican Church disassociated themselves from Niles comments, saying it was disappointing that an elected Christian minister would make such comments.

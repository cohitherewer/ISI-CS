The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 Carter in veiled Bush attack
																								Oslo, Dec. 10 (Reuters): Saying that war is always evil, former US President Jimmy Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize today and urged the world to accept UN leadership in tackling challenges from West Asia to global poverty.																								Carter, calling himself a citizen of a troubled world, also made veiled criticisms of US President George W. Bush for opposing UN-led schemes to protect the environment or to create an international criminal court.																								Global challenges must be met with an emphasis on peace, in harmony with others, with strong alliances and international consensus, Carter told a ceremony in Oslo City Hall after collecting a Nobel gold medal and diploma to a standing ovation.																								Imperfect as it may be, there is no doubt that this can best be done through the United Nations, said the 78-year-old Democrat, who was President from 1977-81.

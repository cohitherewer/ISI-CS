The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, November 15, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Lying to be best																																	 London, Nov. 14 (Reuters): The Worlds Biggest Liar will defend his title against a small but devious group of challengers in a pub in northern England.																																	George Kemp beat five-time winner John Graham last year with a string of tall tales including one about his grandfathers greyhound which he said stopped in the middle of a race to have pups and then went on to win, followed by the puppies.																																	This years eight entrants will meet for dinner in the Bridge Inn, Santon Bridge, in the picturesque Lake District to limber up with a few pints of ale before going head to head with their lies.																																	They put their names in a hat and are picked out one by one, pub manager Teresa Appleton said. Each one then has five minutes to tell a pack of lies. A panel of six judges sits through the performances and then retires to consider its verdict.																													 																Horror seats																																	 Stockholm (Reuters): A customer in an international hamburger chain outlet in western Sweden lost his appetite when he discovered the restaurants toilet seats were being washed in its dishwasher alongside the kitchen utensils. The man noticed on a visit to the bathroom in the restaurant in Arvika, Sweden, that all the toilet seats had been removed. When he asked staff about the missing seats, an employee took them out of a dishwasher where they had been cleaned together with trays and kitchen utensils. The employee tried to reassure the customer by saying that the freshly washed toilet seat would be warm and pleasant to sit on.																													 																Sick scent																																	 London (Reuters): The makers of an Italian liqueur have pulled a novel advertising campaign which involved wafting the scent of almonds around London Underground stations after fears that the sweet aroma might be confused with cyanide. The 1.5 million ($2.4 million) wheeze used metal boxes full of almond oils which were positioned at the bottom of escalators in three major stations. Fans in each box spread the scent around with the idea of prompting travellers to associate it with the aroma of Disaronno amaretto liqueur. Advertising posters all the way up the side wall of the escalators aimed to help them make the connection. Unfortunately, as amateur sleuths and readers of Agatha Christie know, almonds smell like cyanide  not a great selling point at a time of heightened terrorist alert. This week, only three days after the scheme began, the British distributors of the drink withdrew it.

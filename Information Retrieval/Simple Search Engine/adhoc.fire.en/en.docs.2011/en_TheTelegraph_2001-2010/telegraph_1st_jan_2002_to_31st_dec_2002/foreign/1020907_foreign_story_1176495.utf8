 Saturday, September 07, 2002 				 Tigers still on US terror list
																								Colombo, Sept. 6 (PTI): The US today said LTTE would remain in its list of terrorist organisations until it renounced terrorism in word and deed but welcomed Sri Lankas decision to lift the four-year ban on the outfit ahead of historic peace talks in Thailand later this month.																								US listing of the Liberation Tigers as a foreign terrorist organisation will remain in effect until the group renounces terrorism in word and deed, the US embassy said in a statement.																								However, it said, the US understands and supports Sri Lankas decision to lift the ban on the LTTE in the context of moving forward with negotiations to end the conflict. 																								The US position is same as that of Britain and India in ruling out any review of their own decisions to outlaw the ltte at the present juncture, but supporting the movement towards commencement of talks.																								Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has worked hard in recent months to raise global support for his peace initiative, meanwhile, has said the de-banning of the LTTE in Sri Lanka would have no bearing on proscriptions in effect in other countries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, September 26, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Deadly duel																																	 Lima, Sept. 25 (Reuters): An irate Peruvian congressman yesterday challenged Vice-President David Waisman to a duel with pistols on a Lima beach, saying he had been insulted and called a coward, and his honour was at stake.																																	Eittel Ramos, who quit the governing Peru Posible party in April, said the trouble started earlier this month when he criticised First Lady Eliane Karp for saying two-bit parties were trying to undermine her husband, President Alejandro Toledo, whose popularity has plummeted. Ramos, 54, said Waisman, who is 65 and had heart surgery last year, called my attitude cowardly because I said what I said about a woman.																																	If the gentleman insulted me and called me a coward, I have the right to demand...a duel. Since I am the injured party, I choose the weapons and the place, declared Ramos.

Campbell Scott was named best actor for the dark comedy Roger Dodger and Moore best actress for Far From Heaven, a drama set in the 1950s.

Scott, 41, also is an executive producer of the film, the story of a scheming advertising executive who tries to teach his teenage nephew how to manipulate women during a night on the town.																								Hes a tough nut  he can be very cruel and charming at the same time, he said of his character. That stuff is fun to play.

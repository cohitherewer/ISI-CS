 Friday, November 29, 2002 				 Clintons see Chelseas digs during Oxford tour
 PETER FOSTER				 	 Chelsea Clinton																								London, Nov. 28: Bill and Hillary Clinton put aside the cares of public life yesterday for a tour round Oxford with their daughter, Chelsea, which included an inspection of her student digs.																								The former US President and his wife, now a New York Senator, posed proudly with Chelsea, who is studying for a masters degree in international relations at University College.																								Like any other set of parents the Clintons were obviously keen to inspect the house in north Oxford where 22-year-old Chelsea is often to be seen with her boyfriend, Ian Klaus.																								The Clintons have indicated their approval of his relationship with their daughter, inviting him to charity functions with Chelsea. Clinton and Klaus have at least one thing in common  they are both Rhodes Scholars.																								The informally dressed party were seen leaving Oxfords smartest hotel, the Randolph, where Bill and Hillary Clinton arrived to celebrate the approaching Thanksgiving holiday with their daughter.																								They stopped for lunch in north Oxford before returning to the city centre to browse in a bookshop. Bystanders said Americas former First Family appeared extremely comfortable as they moved around the city. They looked like any other proud parents on a day out, said one.																								Two-thirds of Americans think that former Vice-President Al Gore, who won the popular vote but lost the White House to George W. Bush in 2000, should not make a new attempt in 2004, according to a New York Times survey. Gore has been making a public comeback in recent days ahead of announcing in coming weeks whether or not he will make a new bid for the presidency.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

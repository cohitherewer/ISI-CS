 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Castro feeds buffalo, tries a raisin at US food fair
 ANTHONY BOADLE				 	 Fidel Castro tries a chocolate milkshake at a US-Cuban trade show in Havana. (Reuters)																								Havana, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Cuban President Fidel Castro bottle fed a Wisconsin buffalo calf and tried a Californian raisin today at the opening of the largest US-Cuban trade fair since the 1950s.																								More than 280 companies from 33 US states hope to recover a lost market for US food products as they push for further lifting of sanctions imposed on Cuba after Castros 1959 revolution. 																								We today open a new chapter in our relations with Cuba, said Allen Andreas, chairman and CEO of Archer Daniel Midland, the largest US food processor and chief sponsor of the five-day fair.																								ADM led the first shipments of grain and soy to Cuba in 43 years last December under a two-year liberalisation of the trade embargo. 																								Maverick Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, heading the American delegation of 800 food company executives and agriculture officials from seven states, said the fair was a first step towards normal relations between Cuba and the United States. Castro, 76, the son of a farmer, took most interest in the US livestock when he toured the fair. He held a milk bottle in two hands to feed a five-month-old buffalo and entered a pen to pat a beef breed bull.																								Little by little the difficulty is being overcome, he told reporters when asked about moves in Washington to lift the trade embargo and a ban on American tourists visiting the island. The legislation proposals in Congress are firmly opposed by the Bush administration. Castro tried a chocolate shake and fries, but not the burger, at a 1950s diner built by ADM to promote sales of its soy products.																								The California Raisin Marketing Board gave Castro two bottles of red wine and boxes of raisins.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Pervez set to have his PM
 							 - Pro-military Jamalis chances bright ahead of todays vote																								Islamabad, Nov. 20 (Reuters): The main pro-military Pakistan Muslim League party is poised to get its candidate elected Prime Minister tomorrow and form a government to continue President Pervez Musharrafs foreign and economic policies.																								Inshallah (God willing), we will get the majority, the partys prime ministerial candidate, Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, said after filing his nomination for the post.																								The partys two main rivals, a six-party alliance of hardline Islamic groups and a liberal party led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, look set for a spell in the Opposition after talks over forming a coalition broke down, analysts said.																								The Muslim League has already demonstrated its strength by winning a parliamentary ballot for the speakers post yesterday without needing the support of its rivals, thanks to a successful campaign to woo smaller parties to its side.																								It says it is confident of victory again tomorrow, but its majority is likely to be thin, indicating that the first civilian government since a 1999 military coup might not be stable.																								The likely exclusion from government of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, an Islamic alliance that won 60 seats in last months elections on a wave of anti-US sentiment, may reassure Pakistani investors and proponents of the US-led war on terror. 																								The Islamists strongly oppose Musharrafs support for the United States, want foreign coalition forces to leave Pakistani bases and say they would like to impose Islamic sharia law.																								The pro-military Muslim League Quaid-e-Azam (PML-QA) won 118 seats in Octobers general election, well short of a majority in the 342-member Assembly, but has attracted small parties to its side as well as defectors from Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians.																								Political analysts said the Muslim League was likely to continue Musharrafs policies and the way he has handled tension with India over Kashmir, support for the US campaign in Afghanistan and gradual economic reform at home.

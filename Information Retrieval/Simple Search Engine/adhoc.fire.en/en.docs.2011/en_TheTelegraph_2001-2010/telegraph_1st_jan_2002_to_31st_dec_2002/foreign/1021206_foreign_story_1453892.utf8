 Friday, December 06, 2002 				 Indonesia McDonalds bombed
																								Jakarta, Dec. 5 (Reuters): An explosion ripped through a McDonalds restaurant in the eastern Indonesian city of Makassar today, killing two people, police said.																								There were two blasts, the first at a McDonalds counter in Ratuh Indah mall. Two people died, police officer Rafael Sandy told Reuters by telephone from Makassar on Sulawesi island.																								Two people were seriously wounded and several were slightly hurt, he said.																								A second explosion, which caused no casualties, occured about an hour later in a car showroom about 4 km away, Sandy said.																								The McDonalds explosion came at 6.55 pm (1055 GMT), shortly after the breaking of the Muslim fasting period for Ramazan, when the restaurant was busy.																								Police were investigating whether the explosions were caused by bombs, Sandy said.																								There have been clashes, including bomb attacks, between Muslims and Christians on parts of Sulawesi island and elsewhere in the sprawling, predominantly Muslim country in recent years.																								The blasts came in the midst of an investigation of an October 12 bomb attack on the holiday island of Bali that killed at least 191 people.

																								Los Angeles, Dec. 21 (Reuters): All but 20 of the hundreds of West Asian men detained this week in southern California after voluntarily presenting themselves to register under new anti-terrorism rules have been released, officials said.																								All the the people taken into custody were people whose visitors visas had expired, a US Immigration and Naturalisation Service official said. Some remained in custody because there are circumstances surrounding them that potentially make them of interest to law enforcement.

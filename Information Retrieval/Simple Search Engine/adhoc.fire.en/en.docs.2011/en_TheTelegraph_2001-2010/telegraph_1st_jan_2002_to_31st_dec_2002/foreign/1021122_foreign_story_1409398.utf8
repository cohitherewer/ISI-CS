As I stand in the street I can see a church burning in the Malali-Badarawa area. I have counted no less than 10 churches burned, said one resident. I have seen and filmed two dead bodies on the streets.																								In Lagos, An explosion ripped through the cargo wing of the airport today, killing at least one person and trapping others inside, witnesses said. They said ambulances ferried wounded from the scene, just on the edge of the international terminal for Nigerias commercial capital, the busiest airport in West Africa. There was no immediate explanation for the blast at the complex, which is usually crowded with cargo agents and clients.

 Monday, September 23, 2002 				 Harry is not my son: Dis former lover
																								London, Sept. 22 (Reuters): A former lover of Britains Princess Diana said in an interview published today he was not the father of her youngest son Prince Harry.																								James Hewitt, a former cavalry office in the British army, said he wanted to dispel rumours that he, and not Prince Charles, was the father of third-in-line to the British throne Prince Harry.																								I have been aware for a while that the issue of Harrys paternity has been a major talking point. There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harrys father, he told the Sunday Mirror newspaper.																								I can understand the interest, but Harry was already walking by the time my relationship with Diana began. Buckingham Palace said it had no comment on Hewitts remarks.																								Hewitt, 44, said he first met Diana in 1986, two years after Harry was born. The couple had a five-year affair until news of their relationship broke while Hewitt was serving as a tank commander with British forces in the 1991 Gulf War.																								He was later branded a love rat and cad by Britains tabloids after he revealed details about their affair to journalist Anna Pasternak for her book Princess in Love.																								The Sunday Mirror said rumours about Harrys paternity had arisen after pictures taken of the prince to commemorate his 18th birthday showed similarities with images of Hewitt.																								Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine and people say we look alike, Hewitt said.Looking at the pictures I would say he is a much more handsome chap than I ever was.																								Diana was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997.

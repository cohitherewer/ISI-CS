 Saturday, November 02, 2002 				 Queen saves Dis rock from theft conviction
 PAUL MAJENDIE				 	 Burrell smiles as he leaves the Old Bailey in London. (Reuters)																								London, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Princess Dianas butler Paul Burrell was acquitted today of stealing her belongings after revelations from Queen Elizabeth undermined the case.																								Burrell, whom Diana once called my rock, sobbed with relief as Justice Ann Rafferty ruled he was not guilty on all three theft charges.																								Im thrilled, so thrilled, he told reporters after the case collapsed. The Queen has come through for me.																								Prosecution lawyer William Boyce said the Queen, Dianas mother-in-law, remembered she had had a conversation with Burrell, in which he told her he was keeping some of Dianas belongings for safekeeping.																								In all the circumstances, the prosecution has concluded that the current trial is no longer viable because it has proceeded on a false premise that Mr Burrell had never told anyone that he was holding anything for safekeeping, Boyce told the court.																								The prosecution decided there would no longer be a realistic prospect of conviction in this case, he said as the trial ended abruptly.																								A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: The decision to drop the case against Mr Burrell was entirely a decision for the prosecution.... The queen was not briefed on either Mr Burrells defence case or on the prosecution case against him.

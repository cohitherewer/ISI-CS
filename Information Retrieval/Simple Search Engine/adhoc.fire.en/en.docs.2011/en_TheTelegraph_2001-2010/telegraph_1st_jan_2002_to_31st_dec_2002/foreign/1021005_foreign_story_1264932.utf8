 Saturday, October 05, 2002 				 Philip Morris to pay $28 bn in damages
																								Los Angeles, Oct 4 (Reuters): A Los Angeles jury today ordered Philip Morris Cos. to pay a record $28 billion in punitive damages to a 64-year-old woman with lung cancer who blamed the tobacco giant for failing to warn her of the risks of smoking.																								The jury deliberated for about a-day-and-a-half in the punitive damages phase of the trial before awarding what was believed to be the largest punitive damages award in a tobacco liability lawsuit.																								The jury earlier found Philip Morris liable for fraud, negligence and product liability claims in the lawsuit brought by Betty Bullock of Newport Beach, California, and awarded Bullock $850,000 in compensatory damages.

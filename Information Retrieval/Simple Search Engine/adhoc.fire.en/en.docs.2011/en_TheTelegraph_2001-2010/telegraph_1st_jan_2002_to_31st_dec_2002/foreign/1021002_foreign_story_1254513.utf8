 Wednesday, October 02, 2002 				 Pak laws need House consent
																								Islamabad, Oct. 1 (PTI): Pakistans Supreme Court said today that all new laws and rules promulgated by Pakistan President Gen. Pervez Musharrafs government would not be valid without the approval of parliament to be elected on October 10.																								A full bench of the Supreme Court yesterday observed that laws promulgated under provisional constitutional order (PCO) had no legal status without validation by parliament.																								The laws promulgated by the executive authority under the provincial constitution order have no legal or constitutional status unless and until the elected parliament validates them, Justice Qazi Muhammad Farooq, one of the three judges of the bench, said while hearing an election appeal petition.																								 The judge said the only way any legislation brought under a PCO could be part of the Constitution was through a notification and its endorsement by the future parliament. 																								Once the Constitution was put in abeyance nothing could be inserted or deleted from it, the judge was quoted as saying by the media today. 																								Justice Farooq specifically mentioned the legal framework order (LFO) brought in by the Musharraf government outlining various new electoral rules including the controversial clause which prevents people convicted by courts from contesting elections. 																								The courts observation could have serious political ramifications as the PCO, which was promulgated by Musharraf after he took over power in the October 12, 1999, military coup, formed the bed-rock of the legal standing of his regime.

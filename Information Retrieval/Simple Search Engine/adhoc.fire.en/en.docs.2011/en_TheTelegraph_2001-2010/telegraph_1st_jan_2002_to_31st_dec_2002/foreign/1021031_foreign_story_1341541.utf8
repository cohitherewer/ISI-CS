 Thursday, October 31, 2002 				 Racist blasts rock South Africa
																								Soweto, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Ten bomb blasts rocked South Africa today, killing a woman and injuring two other people, in attacks that President Thabo Mbeki blamed on White Right-wing extremists.																								Nine bombs exploded in Soweto, South Africas biggest Black township which is on the outskirts of Johannesburg, and a 10th went off at a Buddhist temple near the capital Pretoria, police said. They said some damage was caused to targets including a mosque, railway lines and stations, but the scale suggested the explosive devices were relatively small.																								Mbeki pointed the finger at Right-wing Whites who he said were plotting to try and overthrow his Black majority rule government, which came to power after the end of apartheid in 1994.																								 These are criminal actions that seek to introduce a terrorist campaign in the country, Mbeki said in Cape Town.

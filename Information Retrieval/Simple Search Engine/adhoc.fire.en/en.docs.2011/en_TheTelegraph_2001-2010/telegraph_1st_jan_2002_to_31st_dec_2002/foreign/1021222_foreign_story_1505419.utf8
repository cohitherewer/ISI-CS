 AMIR ZIA																								Karachi, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Relatives of Asif Ramzi, a Pakistani Islamic militant suspected of involvement in the murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl, identified his body today among four mutilated corpses found in Karachi, police said.																								Police say they suspect Ramzi, who was also wanted in connection with a series of bomb attacks in Karachi, accidently blew himself up while making bombs on Thursday.																								The wife and mother of Asif Ramzi visited the morgue on Saturday and recognised his body, deputy inspector general of police Tariq Jameel said.																								Ramzis relatives had also visited the morgue yesterday and initially denied that Ramzis body was among the four corpses found in the rubble of a collapsed three-storey building. But today they requested a second visit, Jameel said. They recognised the body through marks on his foot and torso.																								Police said they had also taken a blood sample from Ramzis mother to conduct DNA tests and make certain the body was his. They found two fake identity cards bearing Ramzis photograph in the rubble as well as a motorcycle with 5 kg of explosives.

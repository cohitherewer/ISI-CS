The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, December 05, 2002 				 Therapy sought for Ryder
 JILL SERJEANT				 	 Winona Ryder																								Los Angeles, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Prosecutors plan to ask that actress Winona Ryder undergo drug and psychiatric counselling as part of her shoplifting sentence to be handed down on Friday, saying she was carrying eight different drugs when arrested  some of them obtained under a different name.																								According to court papers released yesterday, prosecutors are not seeking jail time for the Oscar-nominated star but are instead recommending that she be given three years probation, 60 days community service and a fine of $10,000.																								Ryder was convicted last month on two counts of shoplifting some $5,500 of designer goods from the Saks Fifth Avenue store in Beverly Hills in December last year after a sensational 10-day jury trial.																								Ryder, 31, star of Girl, Interrupted and Age of Innocence, had pleaded not guilty but did not testify. Her lawyers accused both Saks and prosecutors of targeting her because of her celebrity status. But it emerged after the trial that Ryder had been involved three times since May 2000 in suspected shoplifting incidents at other posh department stores but had never been charged.																								Legal documents released ahead of Ryders Friday sentencing provided more startling details about her arrest after already humiliating testimony that she used scissors to cut Saks security tags off handbags and hair bows costing hundreds of dollars apiece.

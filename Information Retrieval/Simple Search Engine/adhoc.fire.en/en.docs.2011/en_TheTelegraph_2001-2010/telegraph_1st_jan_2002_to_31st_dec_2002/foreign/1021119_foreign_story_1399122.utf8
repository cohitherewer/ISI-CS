 Tuesday, November 19, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																No drive for sex																																	 Singapore, Nov. 18 (Reuters): Work is killing Singaporeans sex drive.																						Too stressed from their jobs, they have little drive to make love at the end of the day, a study shows.																																	The result is that Singaporeans below the age of 40 have sex six times a month, far lower than many other societies, said Prof. Victor Goh, from the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at the National University of Singapore.																																	The study, which follows the sex lives of 460 men and women in the city state of four million, also found the older Singaporeans get, the less sex they have. The major answer is that they are too stressed out. They have children, they have responsibilities to the home, they work and they are too exhausted at the end of the day to have sex, Goh said.																																	The frequency of sex for those aged between 44 and 55 dips to four times a month and for those over 55 it is three times a month on average. And do Singaporeans want more sex? Results from the study are not promising. About 40 percent of men and only 20 per cent of women below 40 said they wanted more.																													 																Ghostly knot																																	 Taipei (AFP): A man who died of complications after having a tooth pulled and his girlfriend who committed suicide from grief were married in a traditional ghost wedding, it was reported on Monday. Some 30 family members attended the wedding ceremony of Chen Yen-Jen, 26, and Chiang Chia-Ling, 21, held at the city mortuary in Keelung, north of Taipei on Sunday. Chens brother and Chiangs sister tied the knot on behalf of the dead, holding photographs of the deceased. Chen died of meningitis on October 25 after he had a tooth removed a month earlier. His girlfriend killed herself on November 3, the day of his funeral, by burning charcoal in her college dormitory. She left a note asking to be married to Chen after her death.																													 																Ballet-thon																																	 St Petersburg (Reuters): More than 200 dancers, cheered on by thousands of spectators, danced into the early hours on Sunday to complete Russias first 24-hour ballet marathon. The dancers, many from the St Petersburg ballet school which gave the world such greats as Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov, performed some 20 arrangements, both classical and modern, at the citys celebrated Mariinsky theatre. Thousands of spectators quaffed beer and munched snacks in an atmosphere more reminiscent of a rock concert than a classical ballet performance, undertaken as part of celebrations for the 300th anniversary of the citys birth next year.

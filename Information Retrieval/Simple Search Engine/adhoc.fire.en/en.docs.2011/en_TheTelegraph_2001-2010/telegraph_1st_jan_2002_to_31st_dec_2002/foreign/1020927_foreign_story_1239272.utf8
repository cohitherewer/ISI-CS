The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, September 27, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Shaver shock																																	 Helsinki, Sept. 26 (Reuters): A buzzing ladyshaver in the luggage of the Finnish Prime Ministers wife set off a bomb alert near the European Union-Asian summit in Copenhagen earlier this week, Finnish media reported today.																																	The Danish polices bomb squad was called in after the driver of the car carrying the luggage of Paivi Lipponen heard a suspicious sound coming from one of her bags. The area was sealed off but did not disrupt the EU-Asia (Asem) summit. It was suspected that there might be a bomb in my bag. But there was no bomb, she told tabloid Iltalehti. Security was extra tight in Copenhagen for the meeting of representatives from 25 European and Asian countries, including many leaders. Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said police overreacted. 																													 																Tacky toy																																	 London (Reuters): A rabbit-eared sex toy was recalled on Thursday by British retailer Ann Summers out of concern it could cause injury to an unsuspecting user. The lingerie and sex toy chain said a batch of about 150,000 of the top-selling Rampant Rabbit vibrators were found to have defective seals that might allow the spillage of tiny beads contained in the shaft. The firm warned in newspaper advertisements and on its website it was recalling those vibrators sold between May and September 2002 in the interest of public safety. 																													 																Old order																																	 Hanoi (Reuters): A few days after the Japanese record holder celebrated her 115th birthday, Vietnam may have turned up its own candidate for the title of worlds oldest person. Like Kamato Hongo, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest living woman, Vu Thi Dao in northern Vietnam was born in 1887. But while Hongo celebrated her 115th birthday on September 16, only Daos year of birth is recorded in Vietnamese identification documents.																													 																Royal rite																																	 Copenhagen (Reuters): Denmarks Crown Prince Frederik is to announce his engagement to his Australian girlfriend Mary Donaldson next Wednesday, local media reported on Thursday. A local television station said on Wednesday that government officials had confirmed the 34-year-old heir to the throne of Europes oldest monarchy will announce his engagement with former Sydney real estate agent Donaldson, 30, on October 2. The wedding should take place on May 24, 2003. The couple, who met during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, have recently begun to show their affection for each other in public.

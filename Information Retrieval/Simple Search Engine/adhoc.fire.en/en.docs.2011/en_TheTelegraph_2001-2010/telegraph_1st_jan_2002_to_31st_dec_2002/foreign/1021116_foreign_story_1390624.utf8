The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, November 16, 2002 				 Militant executed in Virginia
																								Quetta, Nov. 15 (Reuters): The native city of a Pakistani Islamic militant executed in the United States for murdering two CIA employees mourned his death today and hundreds of people thronged to his home to pay respects.																								The family of Mir Aimal Kansi, who was executed by lethal injection for the twin killings in 1993, appealed for calm after a series of protests earlier in the week hailing him a hero and threatening retaliation against America.																								We have asked the people in the past, and we will say it again, that they should not do anything which hurts the country and the nation, elder brother Naseebullah Khan Kansi said by telephone. We are peaceful people. There is no anger in our heart. We are people who bow to Allahs will... Allah will do justice, a solemn-voiced Khan said.																								The Kansis are well-known and respected in Quetta, capital of southwestern Baluchistan province which borders Afghanistan.

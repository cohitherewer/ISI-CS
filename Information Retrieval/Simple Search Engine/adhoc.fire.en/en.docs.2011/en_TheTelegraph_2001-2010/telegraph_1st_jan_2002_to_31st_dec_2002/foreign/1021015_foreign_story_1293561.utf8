 Tuesday, October 15, 2002 				 The Soviet submarine officer who averted a nuclear war
 DAVID RENNIE																								Washington, Oct. 14: Only the caution of a Soviet naval officer saved the world from a nuclear fight to the death during the Cuban missile crisis, an unprecedented meeting hosted by Fidel Castro was told this weekend.																								Robert McNamara, who was the American defence secretary when the confrontation took place 40 years ago, said it could easily have become a full-scale conflict.																								The world has long known that it came to the brink of war during the 13-day crisis after American spy planes confirmed that Moscow had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba, only 100 miles from Florida. Only later did the West discover how close it came during a naval skirmish between an American destroyer and a Soviet B-59 submarine off Cuba on October 27, 1962.																								The destroyer dropped depth charges near the submarine to try to force it to surface, not knowing it had a nuclear-tipped torpedo. Vadim Orlov, a member of the submarine crew, told the conference in Havana that the submarine was authorised to fire it if three officers agreed. The officers began a fierce, shouting debate over whether to sink the ship. Two of them said yes and the other said no.																								A guy named Arkhipov saved the world, one of the conference co-hosts, Thomas Blanton, of George Washington University, told the Washington Post.																								The conference studied thousands of newly declassified intelligence documents and photographs from American archives. Guests included many who were in leading positions. Besides McNamara, there were other aides to President J F Kennedy: Arthur Schlesinger Jr and Theodore Sorensen. Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert Kennedy, also attended.																								Despite the atmosphere of reconciliation, fostered in part by Mr 																								Castros public condemnation of the Soviet leader, Nikita 																								Khrushchev, for quot;misleading quot; Mr Kennedy over the presence of the 																								missiles, old tensions still surfaced.																								Dino Brugioni, a CIA analyst who interpreted the first U2 spy 																								plane photographs of the missiles, argued fiercely with Russian 																								delegates who said the Soviet Union never intended to fire them.																								 14 August 2002: Cuban communism will die with Castro																								 30 June 2001: Castro hints at his brother as successor																								 8 October 2000: The teenager, Castro and the CIA poison plot																								Information appearing on Electronic Telegraph is the copyright of 																								Telegraph Group Limited and must not be reproduced in any medium 																								without licence.

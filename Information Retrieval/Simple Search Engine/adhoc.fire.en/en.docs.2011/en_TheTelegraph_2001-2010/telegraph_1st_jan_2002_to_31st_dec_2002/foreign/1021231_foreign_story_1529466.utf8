The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, December 31, 2002 				 Hostile Kenyans abuse Moi
 DAVID MAGERIA				 	 Outgoing Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi in Nairobi. (Reuters)																								Nairobi, Dec. 30 (Reuters): A dejected Daniel arap Moi spent his last moments as Kenyan President under a barrage of abuse from a hostile, jeering crowd impatient to see the end of his 24 years in office.																								Everything is possible without Moi! was the deafening cry as he appeared in a Nairobi park today at the inauguration of his successor Mwai Kibaki, who was elected head of state in elections on Friday.																								Moi, who has ruled Kenya largely unchallenged, looked sad and downcast as he read a brief speech, which was punctuated by calls of Go Away and Bye Bye. 																								Some of the crowd, estimated at 200,000 or more, threw lumps of earth in his direction as he walked towards the platform.																								Moi later left state house, the seat of power in Kenya, in a helicopter accompanied by his chief of staff, John Lokorio, and his spokesman, Lee Njiru. 																								He did not stay for a scheduled lunch with Kibaki. Presidential aides at state house said Moi was unhappy at the reception he was given at the inauguration.																								Attempts by other regional leaders attending the ceremony to praise Moi for handing over power peacefully were met with jeers and boos by the crowd.																								But Moi drew cheers from the crowd when he praised Kibaki as a man of integrity. Moi, 78, is widely blamed for ruining Kenyas once flourishing economy through years of corruption and misrule.

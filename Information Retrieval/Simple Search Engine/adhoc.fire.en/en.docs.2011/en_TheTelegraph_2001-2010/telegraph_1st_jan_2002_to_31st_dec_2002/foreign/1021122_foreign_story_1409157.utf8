 Friday, November 22, 2002 				 Police ponder action on Jackson baby stunt
 KERSTIN GEHMLICH																								Berlin, Nov. 21 (Reuters): German police said today they would examine whether Michael Jackson committed a crime by dangling his baby from a fourth-floor hotel window in Berlin in front of hundreds of fans.																								We are examining if there is cause to open an investigation into whether a crime was committed, said Berlin police spokeswoman Christine Rother after the incident was captured on film and widely broadcast in Germany and around the world.																								She said if it turned out there was suspicion of parental neglect of duty in respect of care and supervision, a formal investigation into Tuesdays incident would be started.																								Rother declined to give details of what the preliminary inquiry would entail nor would she say if Jackson himself, who is still staying at Berlins five-star Adlon hotel, would be questioned by police.																								Jackson could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for the organisers of the German television award ceremony Jackson is due to attend said they had no comment on the matter.																								The pop superstar has already apologised for the dangerous stunt after widespread complaints, saying he was excited by enthusiastic fans gathered outside his hotel window.																								The reclusive singer opened a window and held his baby, whose head was covered by a towel, over a railing with just one arm. The stunt shocked fans who had been screaming his name on the street below.

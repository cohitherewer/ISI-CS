 Sunday, October 13, 2002 				 14 killed as blasts rock nightclubs in Bali
																								Bali (Indonesia), Oct. 12 (Reuters): At least 14 people were killed and 120 wounded, many of them foreigners, in explosions at nightclubs on Indonesias resort island of Bali tonight, at least one of them caused by a bomb, officials said.																								Police said there had been three blasts at two nightclubs. One officer who declined to be identified said they had occurred simultaneously at around 11.30 pm local time (1530 GMT), one of them not far from the US consulate on Bali.																								At this stage we have 14 people dead. There are around 120 badly and lightly wounded, Yatim Suyatmo, police spokesman for Bali, said by telephone. He said one of the explosions had been caused by a homemade bomb.																								One local photographer said he had seen up to 15 cars wrecked by one of the blasts, with a number of people still inside the club. It was unclear if they were dead.																								Police said it was too early to say if all the blasts had been caused by bombs, but they come at a time of growing security concerns in the worlds most populous Muslim nation in the wake of recent terror threats.																								Police denied an earlier report that an explosion had gone off in Ubud, another popular tourist town on the island. They said all were concentrated in the Kuta Beach area. The wounded included Americans and Australians.																								Eyewitnesses spoke of chaos in the area near one of the blasts, at the Sari nightclub near the famous Kuta beach strip, as foreign tourists were revelling on a typical Saturday night. The island is Indonesias most popular tourist destination, and a favourite for Australians and Japanese.

 Friday, November 15, 2002 				 Sweeping changes in China army
																								Beijing, Nov. 14 (Reuters): China heralded a sweeping reshuffle at the top of the worlds largest army today when all generals over 70 on its Central Military Commission (CMC) left the partys Central Committee.																								But it was still unclear if President Jiang Zemin  who also left the Central Committee and is due to hand over as party chief to Hu Jintao tomorrow  would remain head of the CMC, which commands the 2.5 million strong armed forces.																								The promotion of a new generation of generals more savvy about the West and high technology warfare could accelerate the modernisation of the PLA and help institutionalise civil-military ties, analysts say.																								Neither of the 11-man CMCs two uniformed vice-chairmen  Zhang Wannian, 74, and defence minister Chi Haotian, 73  were on the new Central Committee elected at the close of the partys 16th congress today.																								Cao Gangchuan, 67, Guo Boxiong, 60, and Xu Caihou, 59, were the only CMC members who kept their seats, Xinhua said, indicating they were frontrunners for the vice-chairmanships.																								If we exclude Jiang Zemin from the equation for the moment, its a pretty thorough generational change in the military, perhaps a little deeper than we might have expected, said one Western diplomat.

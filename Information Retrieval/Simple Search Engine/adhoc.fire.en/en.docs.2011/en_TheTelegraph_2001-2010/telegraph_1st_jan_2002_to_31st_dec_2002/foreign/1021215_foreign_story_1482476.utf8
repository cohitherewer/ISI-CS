The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, December 15, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Caring Crowe																																	 Sydney, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Hollywood star Russell Crowe is about to pop the big question to long-time Australian girlfriend Danielle Spencer, local and international media reported today.																																	The 38-year-old New Zealand-born actor has reportedly splashed out on a 67,000 diamond ring for the former soap opera star.																																	Russell has decided that one of his biggest priorities in life is having a wife and kids, Britains The Sun newspaper quoted an unnamed friend as saying. Marrying Dani is the first step in making that dream come true.																																	Crowe said last month he was heading back to Australia to be with his father and girlfriend and escape a massive level of stress. I am in love with Danielle Spencer but I dont get to spend nearly enough time with her, he said in a message still posted on his rock bands website, www.gruntland.com, after he shocked fans in November with the cancellation of Gruntlands gigs.																						I feel a great need to wake up with her as many days of my life as I can, he said.																													 																Old hat																																	 Paris (Reuters): An instantly recognisable symbol of Gallic law and order for decades, the flat, circular-topped kepi hat of the gendarme will vanish from French streets next year as part of a new-look uniform. Unveiled to reporters in Paris on Friday, its successor softens the rigid lines of the original in a re-styling that some critics say resembles a black baseball cap.

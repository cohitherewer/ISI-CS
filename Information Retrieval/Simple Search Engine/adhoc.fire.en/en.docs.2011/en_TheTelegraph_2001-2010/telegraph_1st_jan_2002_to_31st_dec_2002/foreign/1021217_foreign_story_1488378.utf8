The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, December 17, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Raunchy retreat																																	 Beit Elazari (Israel), Dec. 16 (Reuters): Tucked away in a grove of persimmon trees in the farming community of Beit Elazari, a new industry of lovemaking has grown in fields once sown by Israeli pioneers dedicated to building the state.																																	Makom Bakfar, a collection of holiday cottages surrounded by high hedges and monitored by security cameras, caters to adulterous Israeli couples seeking a discreet refuge for their trysts just a short drive away from central cities such as Tel Aviv, Rehovot and Rishon Letzion.																						Their secrets are closely guarded from the prying eyes of betrayed wives and cuckolded husbands by a wealth of security measures usually only provided to Israeli Prime Ministers.																																	True to hotel tradition, customers sign in under assumed names  often generic Hebrew aliases such as Haim or Yossi  and the moshavs offer privacy impossible in city hotels. When I built the first cottage and put an ad in the newspaper for a secret hideaway for lovers, the phone began to ring off the hook, said owner Zvi Slor. Now I have 13 cottages and were at full occupancy...and I still cant meet the demand.																													 																Rookie hit																																	 Miami (Reuters): A 2,700 kg elephant smashed a rookie zookeeper against a rockpile at Miamis MetroZoo, badly injuring the man in what a zoo spokesman described as an attack to test dominance in the herd. The injured zookeeper, Michael Embury, 31, was hospitalised in critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery. He suffered a broken arm, two broken shoulders, gashes to the head and bruising of the spleen and brain in the Sunday attack but was expected to recover. Embury was feeding two female African elephants in an enclosed paddock when one of them, a 20-year-old named Flora, suddenly charged, knocked him to the ground and kicked him against a pile of boulders, knocking him unconscious, Magill said. Another zookeeper saved Emburys life when he scared Flora away by screaming and beating the ground.																													 																Royal visitor																																	 London (Reuters): British police said they were investigating how an intruder entered St James Palace, home of heir to the throne Prince Charles. The man was found in the palace grounds on Wednesday night, police said. He was questioned, his identity was established and he was escorted from the premises. There was no suggestion of danger to the royal family, but we need to look at how security was breached, the polcie said. A Sunday newspaper, the News of the World, said the man was a drunken Christmas reveller who had stumbled inside the palace grounds looking for a shortcut to a nearby Underground station.

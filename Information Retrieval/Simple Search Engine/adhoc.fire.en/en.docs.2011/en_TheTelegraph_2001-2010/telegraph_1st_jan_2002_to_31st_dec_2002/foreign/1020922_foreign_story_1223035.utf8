 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 Hitler row dominates Germany on poll-eve
 PHILIP BLENKINSOP				 	 A woman carries 10 one-litre beer mugs on the opening day of the Oktoberfest in Munich on Saturday. (AFP)																								Berlin, Sept. 21 (Reuters): A row sparked when a German minister allegedly compared the US Presidents methods to Adolf Hitlers overshadowed the final day before tomorrows election in Germany that promises a photo finish.																								Justice minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin has denied a newspaper report she likened George W. Bushs stance on Iraq to Hitlers use of foreign policy to hide domestic woes.																								Yet she still faces calls to quit and charges from Bushs national security adviser Condoleezza Rice that US-German relations have been poisoned.																								It was unclear what impact, if any, the last-minute furore sparked by the report would have on tomorrows result.																								Chancellor Gerhard Schroeders firm stand against any war in Iraq has benefited his centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), but his rival Edmund Stoiber and the conservatives accuse the government of isolating Germany and even threatening exports.																								West Asia and Iraq need a lot of new peace, but they dont need a new war, Schroeder said to cheers from the 5,000-strong crowd in the centre of Rostock.																								He said Germany had every right to be self-confident in its international policy given that it had demonstrated its readiness to take part in front-line action for peace.

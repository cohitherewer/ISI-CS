The US only unionised showgirls have turned to sexy slogans like that to spice up the picket line in their fight for better wages and increased sick days to boost benefits they say are too skimpy at the San Francisco peep-show-style club.																																	And with other light-hearted chants like Bad girls like good contracts and Starving strippers aint got nothing to shake, the ladies of the Lusty Lady are drawing attention to labour issues they say are important to all workers, no matter the profession.

Dance ends																																	 New York (AFP): In the grim, dark days of prohibition New York police raided clubs for illegal drinkers. These days, they are hunting down dancers. Despite the citys global reputation for a thriving nightlife, dancing is a strictly regulated activity in New York  subject to 1926, prohibition-era cabaret laws, originally designed to control Black speakeasies in Harlem. The laws limited the music that could be played and required I-D cards and fingerprinting for everyone who officially worked in a cabaret. Over the years, the restrictions have been whittled away, but one crucial statute has remained  a ban on dancing in any restaurant, bar or club that does not have a cabaret license. Twenty people sitting in a bar without a cabaret licence listening to, say, Brazilian music, is perfectly legal. However, if a couple decide to stand up and indulge in a quick salsa, the bar could be closed down immediately.

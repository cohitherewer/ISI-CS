 Wednesday, October 30, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																A name like Lula																																	 Sao Paulo, Oct. 29 (Reuters): Whats in a name? Apparently a lot for Brazils President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.																																	 just Luiz Inacio da Silva in 1945, the man now everyone in Brazil knows as Lula legally added his life-long nickname in 1982 when running for governor of Sao Paulo state. Da Silva is the most common surname in Brazil, like Smith in English or Garcia in Spanish. But for most Brazilians, first names or nicknames are what count.																																	Few Brazilians know their star soccer player, Ronaldo, was baptised Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima. And even President Cardoso is commonly referred to as just Fernando Henrique, or by his initials FHC or FH, even in the press. But Lulas new presidential status is causing consternation to some who have long addressed him informally and are now bound to speak to him under the rules of formal Portuguese.																																	The New York Times and White House may call him Mr da Silva, but for Brazilians hes always been just Lula  which is a nickname for Luiz but also means squid in Portuguese.

Drive sin																																	 Valetta, Malta (Reuters): Reckless driving violates Gods fifth commandment (Thou shall not kill) because it risks lives, a Maltese bishop said. Bishop Nikol Cauchi said government authorities may also become partners in sin if they turn a blind eye to poor road conditions in the country. Reckless driving is prohibited by the fifth commandment because it is not lawful to expose oneself or others to the probable risk of death, the bishop of the small island of Gozo also wrote in an opinion piece in Maltas The Times newspaper. Cauchis editorial called for action to curb accidents which have claimed the lives of 12 people in nearly 10,600 traffic accidents on the Mediterranean island state in 9 months.

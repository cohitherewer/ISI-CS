The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 Nepal set to resume normal life 
 DEEPAK THAPA																								Kathmandu, Nov. 13: It is with a sigh of relief that Nepal waits to reopen tomorrow after a three-day bandh called by Maoist rebels brought normal life to a standstill throughout the country.																								The only untoward incident in Kathmandu was the shooting today of a Maoist who had planted a bomb in the compound wall of the residence of Keshar Jung Rayamajhi, chairman of the Raj Parishad (Nepals equivalent of a Privy Council).																								 Rayamajhi had created a flutter a few days ago by claiming that King Gyanendras had acted on his advice in removing Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and assuming executive powers on 4 October.																								 (He later claimed he was misquoted.)																								The three-day strike was part of the Maoist programme to disrupt the parliamentary polls slated to begin on 13 November. The elections were postponed indefinitely because of the royal action on October 4 but the Maoists went ahead with the bandh, claiming that it was the beginning of a united peoples resistance campaign against the king.																								The weekend holiday followed by the three-day enforced shutdown has hit the country hard.

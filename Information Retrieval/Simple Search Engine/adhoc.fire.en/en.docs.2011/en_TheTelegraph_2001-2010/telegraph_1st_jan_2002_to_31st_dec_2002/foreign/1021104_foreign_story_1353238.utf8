The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, November 04, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Gossip silenced																																	 Hong Kong, Nov. 3 (Reuters): A Hong Kong gossip magazine said it was suspending publication after public fury over a cover featuring a local actresss topless photo taken during her reported abduction 12 years ago.																																	We take entire responsibility for the matter, publisher Chan Yiu-on said on behalf of himself and two other editors of East Week late yesterday.																																	Last weeks East Week cover caught even the attention of Hong Kongs top political leader, chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, who said yesterday the government was monitoring the incident. We regret the suspension of East Week. We deeply apologise to the victim, the public, the media and the employees of the magazine, publisher Chan told local television stations.																													 																Bus girl																																	 Tehran (Reuters): Irans first female bus driver has taken to the road in a small victory for gender equality that has already forced men to take a back seat. Seating on Iranian buses has been segregated since the 1979 Islamic revolution, with women forced to sit at the back so that they do not distract the normally male driver. But on Masoumeh Bolaghis bus, the seating order will be reversed for the same reason. Official news agency IRNA quoted Bolaghi as saying she hoped her example would have a positive effect on womens morale.																													 																Castaway																																	 London (Reuters): Britains Royal Navy rescued a man who said he had been adrift at sea for 26 days and survived by drinking rainwater after his speedboat broke down in the Caribbean. Lenny Leon Peter was rescued after a sailor on board the frigate HMS Grafton spotted the boat adrift on the ocean 1,100 km from Peters home on the island of Guadeloupe. It really was a tiny boat on a very big ocean, Graftons commander Richard Thomas said. It was really a one in a million chance that my lookout spotted him.																													 																Streetsmart																																	 Key West (Reuters): Jimmy Buffett, known for his Cheeseburger in Paradise song about the American diet staple, surprised a gathering of fans with a rare impromptu street concert in the Florida island city that he nicknamed Margaritaville. The 55-year-old greeted 3,000 members of the Parrot Heads in Paradise Inc. fan club, celebrating their 11th annual Meeting of the Minds convention, with favourite hits at a street festival.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, December 22, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Bulldog at the wheel																																	 London, Dec. 21 (Reuters): British television presenter Johnny Vaughan says his pet dog crashed his sports car in a bizarre accident, the Sun newspaper reported.																																	The tabloid said Vaughans bulldog nudged his 60,000 Maserati into gear and stepped on the accelerator  sending it flying into a van. I was too shocked to be angry, Vaughan, who presents a BBC chat show, was quoted as saying in the tabloid. I couldnt believe my dog crashed my car.																																	Vaughan said the crash happened after he stopped to check on his dog Harvey as he drove him home from a veterinarians practice in southwest London.																													 																Santa woes																																	 Florida (Reuters): Santa Claus is running behind on reading his mail this year, pushing things right up to the very last minute. His elves have all bolted and he has also discovered the Internet, which eats up much of his evenings. In this case, Santa Claus is Jack James, 78, who for 34 years has read the 6,000 or so letters to Santa that end up in this subtropical Florida hamlet instead of the North Pole. The job is not as satisfying as it once was, James admits. Last year, in the wake of anthrax attacks that reached their victims through the postal service, he opened his letters wearing gloves and a breathing mask.																													 																Hitlers birth																																	 Munich (Reuters): Adolf Hitler might have been born in Germany and not, as long believed, in the small Austrian border town of Braunau, Egon Fein, who has published Hitlers Weg nach Nuernberg (Hitlers path to Nuremberg), said. This could be an explosive issue for Germans and Austrians who have long tried to push Hitlers nationality off onto each other.

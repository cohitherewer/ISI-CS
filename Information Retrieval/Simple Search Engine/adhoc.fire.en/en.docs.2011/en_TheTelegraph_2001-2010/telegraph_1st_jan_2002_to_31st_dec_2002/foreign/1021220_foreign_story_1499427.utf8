 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Diaz takes big risk in Gangs
 PAULA NECHAK				 	 Cameron Diaz																								New York, Dec. 19: You need actors who arent afraid to take chances, says director Martin Scorsese.																								While Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis already have proved theyre game for a challenge, Cameron Diaz takes the biggest career risk with Gangs of New York, Scorseses 25-years-in-the-works epic.																								Its a dramatic, violent and visually breathtaking tale of the battles between native Americans and Irish immigrants for dominance over the squalid streets of New Yorks Five Points district. DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, a young Irishman seeking to avenge his fathers brutal murder 16 years earlier at the hands of nativist leader Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis).																								Caught between the two men is Jenny Everdeane (Diaz), a skilled bludget (thief) who eludes Bills powerful grasp and chooses Amsterdams poor but solid arms instead.																								All the actors profess a respect and awe for Scorsese, and Day-Lewis says it best: There are probably less than a handful of directors working in the world today for whom it is genuinely a vocation. Hes compelled to do that work to the point that if he didnt do it his life would be bereft.																								For DiCaprio the chance to work with Scorsese was one of the most memorable movie-making experiences Ive ever had because Ive never committed so much time, thought or effort to a movie  or felt so attached.																								Diaz, standing out as the sole female in a veritable boys club of a cast and enduring her part being written and expanded only as it was shot, is treading new territory. 																								And she was the only one of the stars who had to audition for her part.																								Remember, DiCaprio and Day-Lewis, hits and misses aside, already have proved their mettle as dramatic players, but Scorsese took a chance in casting a movie star who commands between $15 million and $20 million per project and is known primarily for such lightweight comedies as The Mask, Theres Something About Mary and My Best Friends Wedding, and for action fluff such as Charlies Angels.																								Her turns in darker fare  The Invisible Circus or Any Given Sunday  are more often than not overlooked.																								Scorsese notes that Diaz was suggested by Joe Roth, former head of Disney. He says he saw Theres Something About Mary and Being John Malkovich and liked her in them and, when auditions came around, asked her to read. 																								There was a spark between her and Leo, he says. She was great. I never saw any other of her movies, by the way. Just those two.																								Diaz laughingly says it is really, really easy to be the only woman on a set because you get the compliments flying your way from the crew, who are always happy to see you.																								Unlike several actresses in her league, Diaz says, she has no problem going to auditions.																								Everybody had heard about Gangs... and I just basically stood in line and hoped I could get in there and have an opportunity. Initially, I didnt know  or care  what the story was. 																								I didnt care how big the part was. If Martin Scorsese lets me come in and read for him and he likes me, Ill do it.

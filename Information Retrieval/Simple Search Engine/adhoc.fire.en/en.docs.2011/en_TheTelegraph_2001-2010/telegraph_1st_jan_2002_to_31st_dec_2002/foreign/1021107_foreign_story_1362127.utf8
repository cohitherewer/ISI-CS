 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 Europeans feel victory will boost Bush on Iraq
 ADAM TANNER																								Berlin, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Europeans, having at times accused George W. Bush of cowboy diplomacy, worried today the US President would be more emboldened, especially on Iraq, following his Republican partys mid-term election gains.																								The man from Texas and his Centre-Right party gained the historically rare opportunity to control the presidency and both houses of Congress with a strong showing in yesterdays elections.																								The likelihood that the American President will feel even more self-confident about his own views than prior to the election is great, Karsten Voigt, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeders US affairs coordinator, said. 																								But on the other side, I think that he needs to convince Europeans. And so far as military action (in Iraq) is concerned, he has not convinced the Germans  yet.																								Much of Europe has voiced concern about US calls for regime change in Iraq and criticised Bush on such issues as global warming, the UN war crimes court and his branding of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an axis of evil.

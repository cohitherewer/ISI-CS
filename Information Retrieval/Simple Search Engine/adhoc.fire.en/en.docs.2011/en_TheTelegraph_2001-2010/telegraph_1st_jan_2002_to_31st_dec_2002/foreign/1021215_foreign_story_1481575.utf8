 Sunday, December 15, 2002 				 Die Another Day irks N. Koreans
				 	 Pierce Brosnan																								Seoul, Dec. 14 (Reuters): James Bond was tortured by North Korea agents in his latest film, Die Another Day, and now hes being flogged again by his latest foe for insulting the Korean nation.																								North Korea today urged the US to stop showing the 20th James Bond feature film, calling it a dirty and cursed burlesque aimed to slander (North Korea) and insult the Korean nation..., said the secretariat of the committee for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.																								The MGM studio hit, starring Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry clearly proves the US is the root cause of all disasters and misfortune of the Korean nation and is an empire of evil, said the committee, which deals with South Korean affairs. Its statement was reported by North Koreas official Korean Central News Agency.																								In his latest adventure, Bond takes a hovercraft through the heavily fortified frontier dividing North and South Korea. He is caught and tortured in North Korea before being released in a prisoner exchange.																								The movie has also irked South Koreans, who especially object to a scene where Bond has sex in a Buddhist temple.																								The movie, which does not open in Seoul theatres until the years end, also shows a farmer tilling his field with a cow, which Korean critics say makes the country appear backward.																								The US should stop at once the show, the North Korean statement said, because it describes the DPRK as part of an axis of evil, inciting inter-Korean confrontation, groundlessly despising and insulting the Korean nation and malignantly desecrating even religion.																								The DPRK is an acronym for North Koreas official name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of North Korea.

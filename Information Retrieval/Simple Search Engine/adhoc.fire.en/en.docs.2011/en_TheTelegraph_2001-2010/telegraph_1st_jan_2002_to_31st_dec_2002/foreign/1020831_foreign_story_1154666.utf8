 Saturday, August 31, 2002 				 Hasina convoy attacked
																								Dhaka, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Nearly 100 people armed with sticks and stones attacked a convoy of cars carrying Bangladesh Opposition leader Sheikh Hasina and some of her party leaders today but no one was hurt, party officials said.																								Hasina escaped unhurt but one car in the convoy was damaged in the attack, said Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Hasinas political secretary and a senior leader of her Awami League party. 																								The attack was pre-planned, he said.																								The attack took place on a highway linking the southwestern districts of Satkhira and Jessore. Former Prime Minister Hasina was in the area after visiting a young woman who was injured in a recent terrorist attack, he said.																								Chowdhury said the attackers belonged to the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) but the party rejected the accusation.																								Speaking at a roadside meeting after the attack, Hasina accused her long-time rival and BNP leader, Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, of harbouring terrorists in her party and demanded their immediate arrest, local reporters said. 																								Awami League supporters held a rally in Dhaka later today to protest against the attack.																								About 5,000 party leaders, workers and supporters joined the rally, witnesses said.

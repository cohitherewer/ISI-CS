The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, October 09, 2002 				 Missile run-up to Pak polls
 MIKE COLLETT-WHITE																								Islamabad, Oct. 8 (Reuters): Pakistan said it successfully test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile today just two days before it holds a general election.																								The test was the second of a two-test series that political analysts said was aimed primarily at rival India at a time when the nuclear-armed neighbours were confronting each other over the disputed Kashmir region. Todays exercise coincides with the last phase of polls in Kashmir.																								On Friday, Pakistan said it had test-fired a medium-range Hatf-IV (Shaheen-1) surface-to-surface missile. Hours later, India test-fired a short-range surface-to-air missile of its own.																								Todays test by Pakistan involved the same type of missile as the first, according to the Pakistans Inter-Services Public Relations Directorate. This test was in continuation to the one conducted on October 4, 2002, to validate certain additional parameters, the directorate said in a statement.																								These parameters stand completely validated in the light of data collected from the test. The test concludes for now the series of planned tests.																								Janes Defence Weekly says the Shaheen-1 has a range of about 700 km.																								Todays test will strengthen Musharrafs position in the minds of his people, said Khalid Mehmood, of the Institute of Regional Studies in Islamabad.																								Benazir beamed live																								Benazir Bhutto, the self-exiled former Pakistan premier banned from this weeks elections, was beamed live via satellite to a rally in Lahore attended by 10,000 emotional followers.																								From London Bhutto, wearing a yellow headscarf, appeared last night on a massive makeshift cloth screen hung in the grounds of Lahores ancient walled city.																								The generals are afraid of me. Thats why they wont let me come back to Pakistan, she said, sparking thunderous cries of Prime Minister Benazir! Prime Minister Benazir!																								Police had confiscated the mega-screen originally to be used for the link-up.

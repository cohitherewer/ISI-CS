 Monday, December 23, 2002 				 Palestinian elections postponed
																								Ramallah (West Bank), Dec. 22 (Reuters): A Palestinian general election scheduled for January has been postponed indefinitely because of Israels reoccupation of West Bank cities, a Palestinian minister said today.																								Due to the Israeli reoccupation, obstruction and closures, it is impossible to convene the election on January 20, the minister, Saeb Erekat, said after a Palestinian Cabinet meeting. A Cabinet statement said elections would be held immediately after occupation forces pull back to positions held before a Palestinian uprising for statehood erupted in September 2000.																								The first and only Palestinian polls were held in 1996.																								President Yasser Arafat issued a presidential decree in September calling for election after coming under pressure from the US, and the European Union and his own people for an overhaul of his Palestinian Authority.

 Thursday, November 28, 2002 				 Cage, Presley end marriage doomed from the start
 JILL SERJEANT																								Los Angeles, Nov. 27 (Reuters): Oscar-winning actor Nicolas Cage has filed for divorce from second wife, Lisa Marie Presley, after just three months marriage in a short-lived union even by Hollywood standards.																								The 38-year-old star of Leaving Las Vegas and Captain Corellis Mandolin cited irreconcilable differences with the only child of Elvis Presley in divorce papers filed in Los Angeles yesterday. Presley issued a statement saying the marriage was doomed from the start.																								Cage and Presley were married in a secret ceremony in Hawaii in August, cementing an 18 month on-off romance between two of the more eccentric figures in show business.																								Cage declined to comment on the reasons for the divorce. I did not talk about the marriage and I am not going to talk about the divorce, he said.																								Presley said: Im sad about this but we shouldnt have been married in the first place. It was a big mistake.																								It was the third marriage for Presley, 34, a budding singer who was married to superstar Michael Jackson for less than two years and who previously had two children with musician Danny Keogh.																								Cage, who once ate a live cockroach for the movie Vampires Kiss, is a big Elvis fan. He recorded the Elvis hit Love Me Tender for the soundtrack of the 1990 movie Wild at Heart and reportedly has a voicemail message using his Elvis voice.																								He impersonated Elvis in a scene from the 1992 movie Honeymoon in Vegas and his marriage to Lisa Marie took place on the eve of the 25th anniversary of Elvis death.																								Cage, known for his edgy, risky screen characters, split from actress Patricia Arquette in May last year after a six- year marriage. He has a son with model Kristina Fulton.

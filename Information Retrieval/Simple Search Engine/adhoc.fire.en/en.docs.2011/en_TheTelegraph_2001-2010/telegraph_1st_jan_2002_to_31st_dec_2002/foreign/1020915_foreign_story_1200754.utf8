 Sunday, September 15, 2002 				 Show some backbone:US
 							 - Bush in fresh ultimatum to UN PATRICIA WILSON				 	 George W. Bush at Camp David, Maryland. (Reuters)																								Camp David (Maryland), Sept. 14 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today urged the United Nations to show some backbone on Iraq and made clear he was prepared to confront President Saddam Hussein with or without world support.																								Saddam Hussein has defied the United Nations 16 times. Not once, not twice, 16 times, he has defied the United Nations, said Bush, who this week challenged the world body in a keynote speech to enforce its resolutions on Iraqi disarmament.																								Enough is enough, he said.																								With Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, one of Americas most loyal allies in continental Europe, standing beside him at the Camp David presidential retreat, Bush said the United Nations deserved another chance to prove its relevance.																								This is a chance for the United Nations to show some backbone, some resolve, Bush said, but he added: Make no mistake about it, if we (the United States) have to deal with the problem, well deal with it.																								Despite US threats of an attack, Iraqs foreign minister made clear earlier today his Gulf nation would not allow UN weapons inspectors to return without other issues, such as sanctions, being resolved at the same time.																								The US administration is pressing Security Council members to agree quickly on a new resolution demanding that Iraq comply with UN disarmament demands, although Bush said yesterday he was highly doubtful Saddam would comply.

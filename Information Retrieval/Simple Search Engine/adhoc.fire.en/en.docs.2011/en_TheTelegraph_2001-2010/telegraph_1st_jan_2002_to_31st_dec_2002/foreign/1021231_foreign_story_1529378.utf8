				 	 Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones																								The actor Michael Douglas mother has married for the third time, in Bermuda during an outbreak of torrential rain.																								Diana Douglas Darrid, 79, has followed the family tradition by choosing a younger partner. Two years ago she saw her 58-year-old son marry Catherine Zeta Jones, 33.																								Douglas Darrid, herself an actress, met Donald Webster, 72, a former treasury chief of staff under President Richard Nixon, at a party in Washington in 1999 given for the launch of her memoirs, In the Wings.																								Zeta Jones, her husband and their son Dylan, 2, all wore black to the wedding service on Saturday, shielding themselves from the rain with a black umbrella. They are expecting their second child in the spring.																								The service took place at an 18th-century church in the town of Devonshire, Bermuda. The bride, who wore an ivory jacket and long skirt, was born on the island in 1923.																								Douglas Darrid filmed A Few Good Years in New York last summer with her former husband, Kirk Douglas, while Webster stayed behind in California taking care of the dogs.																								She said: We were calling each other every day and we pretty much decided: By God, its just about time to get married. 																								The new Webster was married to Kirk Douglas for seven years until they divorced in 1950. 																								She was married to her second husband, Bill Darrid, until his death in 1992. Michael Douglas has just completed a film called The Wedding Party. 																								In the comedy, he plays the father of the groom and an undercover agent who drags his sons future father-in-law on an international adventure.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Power transfer in one or two days
																								Islamabad, Nov. 20 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf promised today to transfer power to a new civilian Prime Minister in the next one to two days, just over three years since his 1999 bloodless coup.																								Musharraf addressed the nation on the eve of a vote in parliament to elect the countrys first Prime Minister since the coup. A party allied to the President is expected to get its candidate elected as Prime Minister, while Musharraf will remain as President with the power to dismiss parliament. My brothers and sisters, in the next one or two days, I will be fulfilling my promise by handing over the government responsibilities to a new Prime Minister, he said.

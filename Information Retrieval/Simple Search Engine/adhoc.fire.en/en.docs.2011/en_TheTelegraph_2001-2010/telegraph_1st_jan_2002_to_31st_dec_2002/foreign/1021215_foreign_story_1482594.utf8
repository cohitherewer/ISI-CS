 Sunday, December 15, 2002 				 Iraq Opp. meet in UK
																								London, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Opponents of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met in London today to map out a future for the country and call for a federal, tolerant Iraq in the event Saddam is ousted from power.																								Up to 1,000 people, including 330 delegates and scores of reporters and security guards, gathered at a plush hotel on the invitation of a committee representing six opposition groups recognised by the US.																								Washington has modelled this meeting on the one staged in Germany a year ago to forge an interim government in Afghanistan following the collapse of the Taliban government.

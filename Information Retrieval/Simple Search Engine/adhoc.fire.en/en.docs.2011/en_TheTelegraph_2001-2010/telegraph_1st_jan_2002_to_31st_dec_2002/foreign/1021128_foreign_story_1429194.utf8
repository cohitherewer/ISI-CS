Lula is an avid soccer player on weekends. His friends say he also cooks a mean pasta carbonara and loves to barbecue at his country home outside Sao Paulo.

He dropped the old name, Love World, and now calls his store Mikes Place. He covered the formerly bright red outer walls with a fresh coat of white paint.

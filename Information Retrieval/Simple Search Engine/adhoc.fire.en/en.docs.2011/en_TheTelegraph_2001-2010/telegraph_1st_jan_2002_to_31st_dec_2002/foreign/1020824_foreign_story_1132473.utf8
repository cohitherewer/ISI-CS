																								San Diego, Aug. 23 (Reuters): In the end, it all came down to a vug and a helicoid, just as you knew it would.																								The two obscure, but high-point words helped to decide the US national Scrabble championships yesterday in San Diego in favour of Joel Sherman, a former bank teller from the Bronx whose obsession with the popular board game began at age 6.																								Sherman, 40, credited his victory at the five-day tournament  besting Nigel Richards of New Zealand and Jakkrit Klaphajone of Thailand  to a happy confluence of luck and rote memorisation. Sherman said the triumph surpassed his victory in the 1997 World Scrabble Championship.																								The tiles I drew matched my preparation for the event for a change, Sherman said. But I prepared more for this national championship than I have for any other.																								Sherman figures that on a good day he can readily recall about 90 per cent of the official Scrabble dictionary  about 120,000 words of nine letters or fewer. Among his winning words yesterday were vug, which means a small crevice in a rock, and helicoid, a mathematical term.																								As one of 25,000 competitive Scrabble players worldwide, Sherman spends his days running a Scrabble club in Manhattan and preparing for tournament play.  copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved.

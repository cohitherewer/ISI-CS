 Friday, November 08, 2002 				 Butler attacks Diana family
 PAUL MAJENDIE				 	 Paul Burrell																								London, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Former royal butler Paul Burrell launched a vitriolic attack on the family of Britains late Princess Diana today, calling them hypocritical, foul-mouthed and jealous.																								He put the knife into the Spencer family after being acquitted of stealing Dianas belongings. His trial collapsed last week when revelations from Queen Elizabeth undermined the prosecutions case.																								Burrell wreaked his revenge on Dianas family in the latest round of What The Butler Said tabloid revelations in the Daily Mirror. He was scornful of Earl Spencers funeral oration for his sister. My stomach turned. I thought: Am I the only person here who thinks he is a hypocrite?																								In a pointed attack on Spencers memorial museum on the family estate where she is buried, he said: I, for one, would not parade her life and charge 10.50 a time.																								The Spencers refused to be drawn on Burrells tirade. The Spencer family will be making no comment on these matters. There is more dignity in silence, a spokesman told Reuters. 																								Burrell said Diana had asked him to listen in to a phone conversation she was having with her mother, Frances Shand Kydd. It was horrible. She was using the kind of language you would never expect to hear a mother ever say to a daughter.																								He said Dianas older sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who once dated Prince Charles, was jealous of her, telling her on her wedding day: I thought all this would be mine one day.

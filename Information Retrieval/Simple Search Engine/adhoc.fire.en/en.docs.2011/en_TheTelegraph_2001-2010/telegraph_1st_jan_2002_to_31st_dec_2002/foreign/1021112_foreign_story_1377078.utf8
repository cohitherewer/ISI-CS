 Tuesday, November 12, 2002 				 Gunman kills five in Israel
 MATT SPETALNICK				 	 Five-year-old Matan Ohayon who was killed by a Palestinian gunman in Israel on Sunday. (Reuters)																								Jerusalem, Nov. 11 (Reuters): Israeli foreign minister Benjamin Netanyahu called today for the removal of Yasser Arafats administration after a Palestinian gunman killed five Israelis, including a mother and her two children, in a kibbutz.																								The hawkish ex-Premier, appointed last week after the collapse of Prime Minister Ariel Sharons unity government, raised the spectre of military retaliation that could complicate a new US peace mission that began hours after he spoke.																								A gunman slipped overnight into Kibbutz Metzer, near the dividing line between northern Israel and the West Bank, and opened fire, killing a woman visitor and its administrator in a rare raid on a collective farm.																								The militant then burst into a house, shooting dead a 34-year-old woman in the doorway of her childrens room and killing her two sons, aged four and five, as they clutched covers over their head. 																								Today, Avi Ohayon staggered through the toy-filled room where his ex-wife and children died, then collapsed on a mattress when he spotted several small objects on a bed. God help me, he screamed. They killed a child who had a pacifier.																								The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an armed offshoot of Arafats Fatah group, claimed responsibility. It said it was avenging Israels killing of an Islamic militant leader, and vowed more martyrdom attacks until occupation leaves our land.																								Arafats Palestinian Authority expressed strong condemnation of the killing of civilians at the kibbutz, which it said was carried out while a brutal war machine kills Palestinian men, women and children.

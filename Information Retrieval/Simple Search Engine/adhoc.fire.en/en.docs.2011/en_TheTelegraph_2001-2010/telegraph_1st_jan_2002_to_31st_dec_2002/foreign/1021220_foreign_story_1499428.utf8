 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Gangsters using guns like Bonds
																								London, Dec. 19 (Reuters): London gangsters are arming themselves with handguns modelled on the famous Walther PPK used by James Bond as the British capital experiences a worrying surge in gun crime, the citys police chief said today.																								There is no street cred in a sawn-off shotgun for the majority of todays armed criminals, London police commissioner Sir John Stevens said.																								Handguns, particularly those modelled on the James Bond Walther PPK  real and replica  are the weapons of choice for todays modern gunman.																								Stevens was speaking out as gun crime rockets in the capital with gangsters more readily shooting rivals and the police. Most shootings are related to drug-fuelled turf wars between Jamaican-based Yardies and, increasingly in some areas, Turkish and Kurdish gangs.

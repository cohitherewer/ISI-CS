 Saturday, December 14, 2002 				 Cheriegate starts to hurt Blair govt
 MIKE PEACOCK																								London, Dec. 13 (Reuters): The British government is starting to sustain damage from Cherie Blairs dealings with a convicted Australian conman, a story that refuses to die.																								Westminster sources describe a paralysis among Prime Minister Tony Blairs team as they struggle to douse Cheriegate  a scandal over his wife accepting help from fraudster Peter Foster to buy property.																								Opinion polls show the public not only do not believe Britains First Lady but think the governments standing has been hurt by a saga that has rumbled on for nearly two weeks.																								A story that could have been defused by an early admission  nobody alleges Cherie acted illegally  has turned into a major headache as facts have been dragged out inch by inch.																								Even Blairs spokesman admitted it had been mishandled. Im not... pretending to you that this has been a model of good handling by the government, he said.																								Foster helped Cherie buy two apartments in southwest England, where her eldest son is at college, but the government press office denied Foster had been involved and Cherie admitted it only after leaked e-mail traffic showed he had assisted.																								Even after a tearful apology from Cherie earlier this week, new allegations have emerged, with the government  having already unwittingly misled journalists  struggling to keep up.																								Only one in three voters polled by todays Guardian newspaper fully believed the high-flying lawyers explanation that she had contacted Fosters lawyer only to reassure her friend Carole Caplin about deportation proceedings against him.																								Caplin, Cheries lifestyle guru and Fosters girlfriend, says she gave legal papers on the case to barrister Cherie but that she refused to read them.

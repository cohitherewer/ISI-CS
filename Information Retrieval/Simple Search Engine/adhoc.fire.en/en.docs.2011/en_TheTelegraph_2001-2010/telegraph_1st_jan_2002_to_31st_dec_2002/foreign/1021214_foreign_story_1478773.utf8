 Saturday, December 14, 2002 				 Rocca Pak visit to cool tensions
				 	 Rocca																								Islamabad, Dec. 13 (PTI): US assistant secretary of state for South Asia Christina Rocca is arriving here tomorrow on a three-day visit for talks with the newly-elected Pakistan government on a fresh initiative to ease tension between India and Pakistan.																								Rocca is arriving tomorrow at night from Kathmandu and is scheduled to stay in Islamabad until Tuesday next week, a media report said.																								This will be Roccas fifth visit to Islamabad this year and the first after the October elections and swearing-in of the pro-military government. 																								During her visit Rocca would call on President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali and hold talks with foreign minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri. 																								Roccas visit to Pakistan is very significant as it follows National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishras visit to the US. Mishra held talks with his US counterpart Condoleezza Rice and secretary of state Colin Powell. 																								It is not clear whether Rocca, who shuttled between New Delhi and Islamabad to ease tensions between the two countries earlier this year, carried any new proposals to resolve the crisis. 																								The controversy over Pakistans nuclear cooperation with North Korea will also figure on top of the agenda during her visit.

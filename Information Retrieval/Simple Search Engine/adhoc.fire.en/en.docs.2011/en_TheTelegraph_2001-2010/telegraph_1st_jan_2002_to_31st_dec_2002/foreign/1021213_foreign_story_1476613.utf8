The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 Plane clot deal out of court
																								London, Dec. 12 (Reuters): American Airlines, a division of AMR Corp, said today it had settled a case involving so-called economy class syndrome, a potentially deadly medical condition that has been associated with flying.																								Lawyers said the out-of-court agreement could have a big impact on a case involving dozens of airlines embroiled in a landmark court action in Britain concerning the same syndrome.																								A spokeswoman for American, the largest airline in the US, confirmed that the company had settled during the past week, but said she could not add any details because the terms of the deal were confidential.																								A source close to the situation told Reuters the case involved a traveller flying between Paris and the US in 2001.																								Lawyers for the claimants in the British-based case said the US settlement could boost their own arguments. It is definitely important, said Stuart Cakebread, a lawyer for the claimants. 																								I am very pleased that they have accepted responsibility, and would hope they do the same here.																								However, American Airlines declined to comment on the details of its US case.

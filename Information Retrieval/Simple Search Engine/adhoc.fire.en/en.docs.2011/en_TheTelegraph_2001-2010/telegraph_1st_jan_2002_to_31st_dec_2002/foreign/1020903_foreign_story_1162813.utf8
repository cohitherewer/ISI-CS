 Tuesday, September 03, 2002 				 Swede to be held in custody
																								Vasteras (Sweden), Sept. 2 (Reuters): A Swedish court ordered today that a man of Tunisian origin suspected of planning to hijack an airliner be held in custody for two weeks while police investigate and prepare formal charges.																								Kerim Sadok Chatty, who appeared at the hearing shaven- headed and wearing a grey T-shirt, was arrested on Thursday when a gun was found in his luggage as he tried to board a Ryanair flight from Sweden to Britain. His arrest came just two weeks before the first anniversary of the September 11 suicide hijack attacks in the United States.																								The chief prosecutor said Chatty, 29, was accused of planning a hijack, aviation sabotage, weapons offences and serious crime.

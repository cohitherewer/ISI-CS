Mobile mate																																	 Milan (Reuters): A guest at a hotel in Milan had reason to be grateful for having his mobile phone in the bathroom after ending up with his hand stuck down the toilet for more than an hour on Thursday.

Still naked, he was saved by firemen more than an hour later after calling an emergency number from his phone.

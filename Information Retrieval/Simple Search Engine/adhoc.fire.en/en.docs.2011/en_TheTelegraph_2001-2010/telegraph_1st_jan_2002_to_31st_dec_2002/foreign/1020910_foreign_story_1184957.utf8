Zoo flood																																	 Prague (Reuters): Visitors were allowed through the gates of the Prague Zoo this weekend for the first time since mid-August, when flooding forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 animals. Zoo officials said the heavy death toll caused by the rushing waters  135 birds, an elephant, two hippos, a lion, a seal and a gorilla  was still apparent from the many empty cages across the site. Some animals have yet to be returned to the riverside zoo because of stress from the flooding. We hope visitors will understand that they will not be able to tour the entire zoo grounds... (but) really, we need to return to normal life, zoo spokesman Vit Kahle said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, November 12, 2002 				 Protests over execution in Virginia
																								Multan, Nov. 11 (Reuters): More than 200 people protested in Pakistan today against the scheduled execution later this week of a Pakistani convicted of murdering two CIA staff in the United States.																								Chanting anti-US slogans, the protesters in the central city of Multan denounced the planned execution of Mir Aimal Kansi on Thursday in Virginia as inhuman and warned of an angry reaction in Muslim countries.																								There will be an extremely horrible reaction in the Islamic world if Aimal Kansi is executed and it will be strongly resisted, said a statement issued after the protest led by religious and political groups.																								The state department warned last week that Kansis execution could trigger retaliatory attacks on US or other foreign interests overseas.																								Pakistan is a key ally of the United States in its war on terrorism and has given permission for the US military to use three remote air bases for logistics for military operations in neighbouring Afghanistan.																								Kansi is from Baluchistan province, which borders Afghanistan and is a stronghold of hardline Islamic groups that made big gains in national elections last month by exploiting anger at Washington over its Afghan campaign.																								The chief of police in the southwestern province said he had ordered special security for US citizens living in the provincial capital Quetta.

 Sunday, September 08, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Crichton crack-up																																	 Los Angeles, Sept 7 (Reuters): The wife of Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton has filed for divorce in a Los Angeles court, seeking to end their 13-year marriage, according to court papers.																																	Anne Marie Martin Crichton has lived apart from her husband since August 2001, when they moved from New York to Los Angeles. The Crichtons have separate homes in the tony seaside town of Santa Monica and their 13-year-old daughter, Taylor Anne Crichton, lives with both parents, the divorce petition said.																																	The petition cites irreconcilable differences as the reason the marriage failed and asks the court to divide their property according to a previous agreement.																													 																Lauren loss																																	 Madrid (Reuters): A stomach bug rather than diplomatic jitters kept President George W. Bushs niece Lauren from modelling an Arabic-inspired collection at a fashion show in Barcelona, fashion house Toypes said on Friday. Lauren Bush was due to model three Arab-style outfits by the Galician label on Thursday. But she graced the catwalk only at the end of the show, hand-in-hand with designer Jorge Galinanes after the rest of the models had left. Local press reported on Friday that the models mother had refused to let her 17-year-old daughter model the collection when she saw the silk tunics and turbans.

				 	 Halle Berry: the latest real Bond girl. (Reuters)																								London, Oct. 18: James Bond has a new plaything  slim, blonde and plastic.																								MGM and Eon Productions have been granted the licence to sell Barbie the doll to help pay for Die Another Day, which at 70 million is the most expensive Bond movie. Mattel, her makers, say that Bonds Barbie will be at her stylish best in the shops  and presumably cinema foyers  decently clad in evening dress and red shawl.																								Lindy Hemming, the Welsh Academy Award costume designer, who has given trendy techno glamour to all Bond girls since GoldenEye, created the dress, which is slashed to the thigh to reveal a telephone strapped to Barbies leg.																								The doll is being sold in a 50 gift set with Barbies Ken character as OO7. He is in a tuxedo designed by the Italian fashion house Brioni, which is providing 3,000 hand-tailored suits for Dame Judi Dench as M and Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny.																								Die-hard Bond fans are becoming increasingly upset with the tie-ins and product placement. The latest real Bond girl, played by Halle Berry, features in her own advertising campaign, selling OO7 lipstick, eyeliner and mascara.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

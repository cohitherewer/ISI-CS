The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, September 19, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Marley magic																																	 Kingston, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Bob Marleys No Woman, No Cry was chosen Jamaicas most popular song and the reggae legend placed two others in the top 10 of a favourites list compiled to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Caribbean nations independence.																																	No Woman, No Cry, a song Marley and then members of the Wailers  Neville Bunny Wailer Livingstone and the late Winston Hubert McIntosh Peter Tosh  did in the early 1970s emerged as the number one single in the Jamaica 40 song contest, results of which were announced yesterday.																																	Marley and the Wailers also placed Redemption Song, which condemns slavery, at number three and One Love, a call for peace and unity named by Time magazine as its song of the century, at number four. The group had three other songs in the top 40, the most of any group.																													 																Radio roar																																	 London (Reuters): Help is at hand for would-be Porsche and Ferrari drivers whose wallets limit their choice of vehicles to rusting hatchbacks. American inventors have developed a car radio that delivers a choice of mighty roars from vintage classic cars and motorcycles. So even an old pickup truck or jalopy could sound like an early Corvette from the days before noise pollution controls and new engine technology reduced engine noise.																													 																Exam final																																	 Dubai (Reuters): A 42-year-old United Arab Emirates man finally got his high school diploma after sitting for the exam 17 times, a local newspaper reported on Wednesday. The Gulf News said hospital worker Abdul Samad Moosa had repeatedly tried to pass the exam which students normally sit at the age of 17 or 18 -- and failed. But this year, Moosa studied very hard and made the grade in English and mathematics to receive the certificate he coveted. Thank God, the paper quoted the father of five as saying. I intend to go to university and want to specialise in IT. 																													 																Train trick																																	 London (Reuters): A British train driver was forced to sprint 100 metres along the station platform to catch his train after it decided to start its journey without him. The ticket-collector climbed on and seconds later the train started moving. When I looked out the window I noticed the driver still on the platform. He ran as fast as he could past my window, then jumped on the train and stopped it, passenger Ann Sutton told the Daily Telegraph. The driver had been chatting to railway workers on the platform before the unscheduled departure of the local commuter service in south Wales.

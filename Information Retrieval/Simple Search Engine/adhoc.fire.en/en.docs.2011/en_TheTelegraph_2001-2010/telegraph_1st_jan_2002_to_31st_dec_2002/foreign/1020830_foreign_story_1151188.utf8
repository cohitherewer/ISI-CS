 Friday, August 30, 2002 				 Britain to suggest deadline
																								London, Aug. 29 (Reuters): Britain said today it would consider pressing for a deadline by which Iraq had to comply with United Nations resolutions on weapons inspections.																								Responding to a recommendation made by parliaments foreign affairs committee in June that the government propose a deadline for Iraqi compliance, the British foreign office said, existing UN resolutions require immediate Iraqi compliance including on weapons inspections. The government will nonetheless be giving further consideration to this recommendation (to propose a deadline).																								The deadline would apply to Iraqs nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programmes.																								It was not immediately clear why the foreign office had waited more than eight weeks to respond publicly to the committees recommendation.																								British Prime Minister Tony Blair came under fresh pressure on Tuesday to make his position clear on the issue of Iraq.

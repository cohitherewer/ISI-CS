 Wednesday, September 25, 2002 				 Congress puts war tab at $200 bn
																								Washington, Sept. 24 (Reuters): A US attack on Iraq could cost as much as $60 billion even if swift and successful, with any follow-up and broader economic strain perhaps pushing the final tab to $200 billion, a congressional report said yesterday.																								The report, prepared by Democrats on the House of Representatives Budget Committee, comes as Congress debates President George W. Bushs recent request for authority to use force if necessary to disarm Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein.																								Top Bush economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey last week estimated a war with Iraq could cost $100 billion to $200 billion.

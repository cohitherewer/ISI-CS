The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Paul seeks to clear air over credits
				 	 Yoko Ono (left) and Paul McCartney																								Los Angeles, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Let it be, said Paul McCartney to Yoko Ono.																								McCartney, in a lengthy statement released yesterday, rejected suggestions that the widow of his late partner John Lennon might have a court case because he reversed the credits on Beatles songs on his latest album from the traditional Lennon-McCartney to by Paul McCartney and John Lennon.																								McCartneys new album Back In The US Live 2002, lists 19 classic Beatles songs that way and McCartney said: The truth is that this is much ado about nothing and there is no need for anybody to get their knickers in a twist.																								While some press reports have indicated that Ono was considering litigation over the matter, her spokesman Elliot Mintz said: This is not an issue involving a legal matter... She is secure in the knowledge that the agreement that has been in place for the past 40 years stands, he said. Mintz said that in the past McCartney has asked Ono to reverse the order of songwriting credit and that she has rejected his requests.

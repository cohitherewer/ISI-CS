																								Chicago, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Depressed adolescents run a high risk of obesity, according to a US study published today.																								The finding was based on a look at more than 9,000 teens and pre-teens surveyed in 1995 and then again one year later, the report from Childrens Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine said.																								Among those adolescents not yet obese at baseline (the start of the study), the odds of becoming obese in the next year were doubled if they had a depressed mood at baseline, the report concluded.																								This risk persisted after controlling for several factors related to both depressed mood and obesity, including low self-esteem, low levels of physical activity, parental obesity, and lower levels of parent education, it added. The report said medical literature for several decades has contained studies linking obesity with depression.

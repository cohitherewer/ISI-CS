																								Islamabad, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Pakistans self-exiled former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto conceded today that it was uncertain whether her bid to contest the countrys October 10 elections would succeed.																								But she urged Pakistanis to vote for her Pakistan Peoples Party in the interests of democracy. The jury is still out on whether I can personally contest the elections, the former Prime Minister said in an e-mail interview with Reuters from Dubai.																								She was referring to her plan to challenge rejection of her nominations to stand in the polls. But she added: I am still contesting the elections through those supportive of my party and of democracy. I urge the Pakistani people to vote overwhelmingly for the party. 																								Election officials rejected Bhuttos nominations, citing her July conviction for failing to answer corruption charges.

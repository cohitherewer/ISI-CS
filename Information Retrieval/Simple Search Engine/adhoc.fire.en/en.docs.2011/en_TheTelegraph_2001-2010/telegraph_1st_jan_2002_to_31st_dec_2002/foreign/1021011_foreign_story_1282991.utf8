 Friday, October 11, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Lemon juice																																	Reproductive physiologist Roger Short, from the University of Melbournes obstetrics department, said a few drops of lemon juice can be a cheap, easy-to-use solution to protect women from both HIV and pregnancy. 																																	The juice should be squeezed onto a piece of sponge or cotton wool and placed into the vagina before sex, he said. We can show in the lab that lemon juice is very effective in immobilising human sperm and also very effective in killing HIV, Short told Australian Broadcasting Corp television in a science programme.

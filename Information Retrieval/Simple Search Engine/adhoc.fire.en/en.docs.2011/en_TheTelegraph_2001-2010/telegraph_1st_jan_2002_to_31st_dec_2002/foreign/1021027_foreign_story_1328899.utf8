																								Islamabad, Oct. 26 (PTI): Pakistans military regime finalised plans to transfer power to newly elected political leaders during the first week of November. 																								President Pervez Musharraf gave approval to the transfer of power plan during a high-level meeting here yesterday, Pakistan news agency NNI quoted officials as saying. 																								At the meeting between leaders of the top political parties, the government decided to convene the first session of parliament on November 4 and planned to hold the election for speaker and deputy speaker on November 5 followed by election for Prime Ministers post on November 7, officials said.																								The submission of nomination papers for the leader of the house is on November 5. 																								According to the plan, Chief Election Commissioner Irshad Hassan Khan would chair the first session of the parliament and administer oath to the newly elected members of the National Assembly. 																								The stalemate in government formation continued as the Musharraf-backed Pakistan Muslim League-Qaid-e-azam (PML-Q), thought to be the front-runner with 77 seats, appeared nowhere near forming a government.

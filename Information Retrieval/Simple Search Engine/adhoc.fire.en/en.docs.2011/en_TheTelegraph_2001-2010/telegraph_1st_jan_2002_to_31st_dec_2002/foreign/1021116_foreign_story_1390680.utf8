The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, November 16, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Beckham bull																																	 London, Nov 15 (Reuters): The names of England soccer captain David Beckham and his pop star wife Posh Spice Victoria are being adopted by Britains farmers for their cattle.																						Posh and Kylie are replacing more traditional names for cows such as Daisy or Marigold, while Beckham is popular for bulls.																																	A survey of 200 farmers by the National Farmers Union revealed that while the old names were still popular, the new icons of style, pop and sport were suddenly in vogue, and even royalty had a place.																																	Along with the Beckhams and their son Brooklyn, pop princess Kylie Minogue and Prince Charles lover Camilla Parker Bowles are also cropping up among the countrys herds.																																	The influence of celebrities is just as likely to be felt in a farmers field as in cities and towns. These days, Marigold, Bluebell and Buttercup have to compete with Kylie and Posh, NFU deputy president Tim Bennett said.

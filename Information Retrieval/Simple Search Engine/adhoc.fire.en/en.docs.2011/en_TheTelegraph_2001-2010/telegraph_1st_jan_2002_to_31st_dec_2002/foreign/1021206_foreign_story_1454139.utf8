 Friday, December 06, 2002 				 Pak blast rips Macedonia consulate
																								Karachi, Dec. 5 (Reuters): A bomb ripped through Macedonias consulate in Karachi today and three bodies were pulled from the rubble, police said.																								They added that at the time of the blast no one was in the single-storey villa in the Defence Housing Authority neighbourhood. One of the victims was a security guard who appeared to have been killed before the explosion. It appears he was murdered, said a policeman. He had stab wounds to his neck.																								The two other bodies, one a middle-aged woman, had not yet been identified, he said. They too were killed before the explosion. The bodies have been sent for autopsy.																								No group has claimed responsibility for the blast which is being described by the authorities as an act of terrorism.																								A crane was at the scene lifting debris and rescue workers and police scoured the rubble for clues hours after the incident.																								Its certainly an act of terrorism, but we have no details about what kind of group was involved, Zaheer said. Police have started their investigations. An official from the Macedonian foreign ministry in Skopje said that there were no Macedonian citizens employed at the consulate. A Pakistani businessman Bilal Qureshi was appointed honourary consul there. We didnt know about any threat made to our consulate, or what might be the motive for such an attack, the official said.

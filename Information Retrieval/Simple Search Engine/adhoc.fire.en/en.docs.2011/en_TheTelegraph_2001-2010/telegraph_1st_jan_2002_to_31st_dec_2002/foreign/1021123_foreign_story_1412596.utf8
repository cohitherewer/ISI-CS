 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 Plan to kill Afghan leader foiled
																								Kabul, Nov. 22 (Reuters): Afghan authorities said they had averted an assassination attempt on the defence minister today, arresting two Arabs carrying explosives and apparently planning a suicide bombing.																								Mir Jan, deputy head of foreign relations of the defence ministry, told Reuters that two men carrying bombs were arrested on a street frequently used by defence minister Mohammad Qasim Fahim.																								Before committing the action, security forces foiled their plan. Both of them are Arabs, Jan said. Fahim is fine, actually the incident was aborted before he passed through the street.																								Jan did not give more details about the incident in the upmarket Wazir Akbar Khan area, home to many diplomatic missions. 																								Fahim and his Northern Alliance faction forms the backbone of President Hamid Karzais government, set up after US forces and their Afghan allies toppled the Taliban regime last year.																								The 45 year-old Fahim, who is also a vice president, survived an attempt on his life in the eastern city of Jalalabad during a spring visit.

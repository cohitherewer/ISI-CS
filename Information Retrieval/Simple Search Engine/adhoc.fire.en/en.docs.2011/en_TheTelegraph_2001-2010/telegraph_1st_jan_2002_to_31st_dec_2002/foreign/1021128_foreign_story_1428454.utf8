 Thursday, November 28, 2002 				 MQM quits Jamali government
																								Karachi, Nov. 27 (Reuters): A regional party withdrew its support today for the new pro-military Pakistani government, jeopardising the Prime Ministers survival in office less than a week after he was sworn in.																								Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), powerful in southern cities, said it would sit in the Opposition in national and provincial assemblies after Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamalis government failed to back it in a row with a rival faction over control of some parts of Karachi.																								MQM and the breakaway faction have been at loggerheads for years over what the MQM calls no-go-areas in sprawling Karachi where the rival faction holds sway.																								The Jamali government has failed to honour promises it had made to us. Therefore we have decided to sit on Opposition benches, Farooq Sattar, a leader of MQM, told a news conference.																								MQM won 16 seats in the National Assembly in last months general election and threw its weight behind Jamalis bid to become the countrys first Prime Minister in three years.																								MQMs support was crucial for Jamali, who became Prime Minister with a razor-thin majority last week. He must survive a mandatory confidence vote within two months to survive in power.

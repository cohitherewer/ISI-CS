The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, November 12, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Right to see porn																																	 London, Nov 11 (AFP): British prisoners will be allowed to receive hardcore pornography after a serial murderer used European human rights law to overturn a ban by prison authorities, the Sunday Telegraph reported.																																	The British prison service is now drafting new regulations giving wardens discretion to allow inmates to receive pornography after a number of prisoners argued the ban violated the Human Rights Act which guarantees freedom of expression and the right to receive information.																																	 particular the change stems from a campaign by Dennis Nilsen, jailed in 1983 for murdering six young men, for the right to receive explicit homosexual pornography, said the newspaper.																																	British prisoners had been allowed to receive only soft pornography available from regular newstands, and guards would sometimes tear out pages containing pictures deemed too explicit.

Fright flick The Ring trailed in third place, with $16 million, followed by Eddie Murphys spy spoof I-Spy, with $9 million, and sophomoric stunt film Jackass: The Movie, with 7.2 million.

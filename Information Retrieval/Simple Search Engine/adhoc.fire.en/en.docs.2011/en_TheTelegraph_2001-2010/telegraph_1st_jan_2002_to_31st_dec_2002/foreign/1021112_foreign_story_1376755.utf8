The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, November 12, 2002 				 Annus horribilis again dogs royals
 ANDREW CAWTHORNE				 	 Queen Elizabeth at a Remembrance Service in London on Sunday. (Reuters)																								London, Nov. 11 (Reuters): Revelling in public affection just months ago, Britains royal family was struggling to retain its dignity today as a rape claim and week of embarrassing tales by a butler enveloped them in fresh scandal.																								Royal aides  who coordinated Queen Elizabeths successful Golden Jubilee celebrations over the summer  were holding emergency meetings at Londons Buckingham and St James Palaces to plot a way of stemming the unwelcome media fest.																								The man at the centre of it all, Princess Dianas former butler Paul Burrell, was out of the country in New York. But his planned interviews with US media were sure to keep the unwelcome spotlight on the royals. In a week of Burrells downstairs tales of life with Diana, who died in a 1997 Paris car-crash, the most serious allegation to emerge was of a gay rape involving royal servants.																								Following the butlers revelation that Diana made a tape of remarks by the alleged victim, ex-royal servant George Smith came forward at the weekend to claim he was raped by one of Prince Charles servants in 1989 and the man tried to assault him again in 1995.																								In a newspaper interview, he accused Charles of trying to cover up the incident by thwarting an internal inquiry into the allegations. The unnamed man at the centre of the allegations denied that and denounced the current media frenzy. Whatever the truth, the rape claim has further whipped up a scandal-hungry media, already full of Burrells stories of Dianas romantic liaisons, squabbles over her possessions after death, and other shenanigans in the royal corridors.																								The stories have been a personal nightmare for the queen in the year she marks 50 years on the throne. All the good done by the Golden Jubilee is diminishing day-by-day, wrote one of Britains best-known royal-watchers, columnist Richard Kay. The image of the Windsors has been blackened by each twist, from the widespread flogging off of royal gifts to the rampant promiscuity of gay palace staff. The Burrell saga, plus the death earlier this year of the queens mother and sister, are threatening to turn 2002 into a repeat of her famous annus horribilis in 1992. 																								Then, her son Charles split from Diana and a fire ravaged her castle at Windsor outside London.

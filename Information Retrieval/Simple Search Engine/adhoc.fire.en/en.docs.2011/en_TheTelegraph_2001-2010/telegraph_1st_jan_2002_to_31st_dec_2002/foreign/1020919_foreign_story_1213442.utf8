 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 Bradford embassy in London
																								London, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Fed up with a life of national obscurity, a northern English city has taken an audacious step across Britains north-south divide to open its own embassy in the heart of the capital.																								Nestled between the Ugandan and Canadian embassies on Londons Trafalgar Square, Bradford embassy raised bemused eyebrows today when it opened its doors to the public.																								Staff at the embassy were making no excuses. We have sheer nerve, a spokesman admitted. Were daring to be different, having a bit of fun.																								From the outside it resembled its important neighbours, a small polished plaque on the door read Bradford Embassy. But the atmosphere inside the small collection of offices was certainly anything but conventional.																								Instead of the austere decoration and unwieldy forms that greet visitors to Bradfords ambassadorial neighbours, guests enjoyed locally produced beer, pies and crisps while viewing exhibitions of art.																								Anyone able to prove they had links with the city  proof comes via a trivia test on all things Bradford  were presented with a Bradford visa and passport.

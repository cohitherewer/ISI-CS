 Tuesday, September 24, 2002 				 Chancellor mends ties with US
																								Berlin, Sept 23 (Reuters): German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose opposition to a US war with Iraq helped him win re-election, began mending ties today by announcing the departure of a controversial minister.																								However, he gave no sign that all would now be harmony with Germanys Nato ally, insisting on his right to differences of opinion.																								Schroeders first move was to announce that Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, the justice minister who last week allegedly said Bushs desire to distract from domestic politics with war recalled Hitlers methods, would not be in his new Cabinet. Although she denied making the comparison, Schroeder said he had asked not to be considered.

 Wednesday, October 02, 2002 				 Men more hot-headed than women
																								Washington, Oct. 1: Brain scientists have found evidence supporting the idea that men are more hot-headed then women. 																								Ruben Gur and Raquel Gur of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and their colleagues studied the brains of 57 men and 59 women, focusing on the parts known to be involved in emotion and anger. 																								The orbital frontal cortices, which are involved in regulating aggressive behaviour, were proportionately larger in women than men, the researchers found. 																								The larger volume of cortex devoted to emotional modulation may relate to behavioural evidence for sex differences in emotion processing, the researchers wrote in this months issue of the journal Cerebral Cortex, although they acknowledged that environmental and cultural factors undoubtedly contribute to sex differences in aggression.

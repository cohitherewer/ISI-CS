 LEE ROMNEY AND DANIEL HERNANDEZ 																								Los Angeles, Oct. 7: Thousands of protesters opposed to a war in Iraq converged today as part of a coordinated national effort that stretched from New York Citys Central Park to San Franciscos Union Square and spots in at least a dozen other cities. 																								Los Angeles County Sheriffs department Lieutenant Pat Jordan estimated the crowd at the Federal Building in Los Angeles at about 3,000 but a California Highway Patrol officer, overseeing the peaceful rally and march, put the number at well above the groups permit for 3,500. Organisers pegged the turnout at 10,000.																								The rallies, pulled together by an umbrella group called the Not in Our Name Project, were timed to coincide with the eve of the one-year anniversary of the beginning of bombing in Afghanistan.																								While polls have generally shown support for the Bush administrations actions since the September 11 terrorist attacks, and for a war on Iraq with allied and UN support, the weekends well-coordinated events indicate the presence of a national dissent movement.																								Central Parks event, where actor Martin Sheen spoke, drew more than 10,000 people, San Franciscos drew thousands and a Chicago demonstration attracted more than 1,000. On Saturday, a companion rally in Portland, Oregon, drew an estimated 5,000.																								In Los Angeles, protesters toted signs from the straightforward, Dont Invade Iraq, to the snide, No, Its Not Iraq. Its the Economy. Were not Stupid. Protesters said they hope to send a strong message to Congress and fellow Americans that opposition to a war is alive, and expressing it is a form of patriotism.																								The crowd was packed with the regulars of progressive rallies: tattooed students pounding drums, Green Party activists promoting their candidates and the more radical Revolutionary Communist Progressive Labor Party distributing newspapers.																								But the rally also drew first-time demonstrators who said they are deeply concerned about the implications of a war and feel their voice has not been heard.																								Bush is expected to make his case for a war on Iraq, which he says has developed weapons of mass destruction, in a televised speech today. 																								Not in Our Name was born out of a meeting last March in New York. Since then, nearly 20,000 artists, intellectuals and musicians have signed a Statement of Conscience against the Bush administrations resolve to wage war on Iraq, a country which has no connection to the horror of September 11.																								The statement also decries the Patriot Act, which gave the government greater latitude to curtail civil liberties																								in the name of the war on terrorism. 																								The lengthy list of signatories on the statement,																								which was published in full-page advertisements in The																								New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, include																								Edward Asner, Barbara Kingsolver, Eve Ensler, Tony																								Kushner, Alice Walker, Steve Earle, Laurie Anderson,																								and Noam Chomsky. 																								At the events across the country Sunday, demonstrators																								recited a ``Pledge of Resistance against war,																								roundups of immigrants and infringements of civil																								liberties. 																								A recent Washington Post-ABC poll showed that three in																								five Americans favoured using force to get rid of																								Saddam Hussein. But 47 percent opposed such a move																								without the support of our allies (46 percent approved																								it) and 52 percent of those polled said they feared																								Bush would move too quickly to challenge Saddam. Other																								polls have reflected greater dissent. 																								And many Democratic members of Congress have said that																								calls, letters and e-mails from constituents have																								overwhelmingly opposed a war. 																								Organisers drew on a network of labor, religious,																								student and other activist organisations. Among the																								speakers was Ron Kovic, the Vietnam War veteran who																								wrote ``Born on the Fourth of July and has become an																								outspoken peace activist. 																								Steve Boise, 43, wore a hard hat emblazoned with the																								U.S. flag and the name of his union local to let																								people know hat ``blue collar America is talking about																								this at work. 																								A pipefitter, Boise said he and his co-workers have																								spent hours discussing a potential war in Iraq and																								have decided ``its all about controlling oil in the																								Caspian Sea ... This just doesnt make any sense to																								us. 																								Boise said he attended because ``it feels like our																								views arent being expressed. ...I dont understand																								the doublespeak, he said. ``Patriotic now means,																								`Sit down and shut up.

 PAUL MAJENDIE				 	 Former Bond girl Honor Blackman (left), who played Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, with Christopher Lee, who played Scaramanga in The Man with the Golden Gun, in London. (AFP)																								London, Oct. 16 (Reuters): From Oddjobs deadly bowler hat to Scaramangas golden gun, James Bond celebrated his 40th anniversary in the movies yesterday with an exhibition honouring the worlds most famous spy.																								Scaramanga even reached for his golden gun and posed with Pussy Galore on Bonds elegant Aston Martin to herald one of the silver screens longest-running superheroes.																								For Barbara Broccoli, whose late father Cubby was the mastermind behind the cinemas most successful spy films, the exhibition at Londons Science Museum was like a walk down memory lane. It is like seeing my whole life, Broccoli told Reuters at the press launch of the show which was also attended by Christopher Lee and Honor Blackman who fondly recalled their Bond days as Scaramanga and Pussy Galore.																								I am 42. This really is like walking through my whole life, said Broccoli of the movies that began in 1962 with Dr No and reach number 20 next month with Die Another Day.																								Broccoli said: I started on school vacations working on the set making tea and coffee. The first one I had a full-time job on was Octopussy. Now I am a producer with my brother Michael Wilson. Pierce Brosnan has just starred in his fourth Bond movie and Broccoli would dearly love him to stick with the role which he has said is like slipping on a comfy pair of old slippers.																								Id love him to do another Bond, Broccoli said. People always ask me who the next Bond is. That is like asking a bride walking down the aisle who her next husband is going to be.																								And from Sean Connery to Roger Moore, she refused to be drawn into the old game about who was the definitive Bond.																								It is like asking someone who is their favourite sibling is. Each one has meant a lot to me growing up and I have been lucky to be friends with them, she said. 																								More than half the worlds population has seen a Bond film. They used to be compulsory viewing for KGB agents fascinated by Bonds killer gadgets. Bikini-clad starlets launched a million male fantasies. 																								Signing in with a Bond switch card, you are taken into spymaster Ms plush London office and whisked through to Qs gadget room.																								Then pause to admire Rosa Klebbs infamous flick-knife shoes. Cling to the Golden Gate Bridge and relive one of Bonds deadliest fights. Boo the baddies from Blofeld to Goldfinger. Plunge into the villains lair as the special effects blast off.																								The exhibition runs in London until next March.

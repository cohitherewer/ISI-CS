 Saturday, October 12, 2002 				 Benazir slams Pervez on counting
																								Islamabad, Oct. 11 (Reuters): Benazir Bhutto, Pakistans exiled former Prime Minister, accused the government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf today of rigging the vote count in this weeks general election to shut her party out of power.																								Speaking by telephone from London, Bhutto said that her party looked to have been cheated out of an outright election victory, and was now considering whether it wanted to join a crippled coalition government or go into opposition. Bhutto said the counting of votes was taking much longer than usual because officials were manipulating the figures in favour of pro-Musharraf parties.

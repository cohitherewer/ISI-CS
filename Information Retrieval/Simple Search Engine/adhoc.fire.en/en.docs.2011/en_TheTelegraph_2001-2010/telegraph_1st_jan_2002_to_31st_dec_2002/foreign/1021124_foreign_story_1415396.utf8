 Sunday, November 24, 2002 				 Ageing tankers to ship more oil
																								London, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Two ageing tankers, flying a flag of convenience black-listed for safety, are set to ship more oil across European waters as Spain battles the slick left by the sunken Prestige, industry sources said yesterday.																								One of the ships, the 26-year-old Byzantio, was recently detained for failing a port inspection and is on charter by Crown Resources, a Russian-owned trading company which also chartered the Prestige.																								The other tanker, the 22-year-old Express, is set to follow exactly the same route as the doomed Prestige, past the oil-covered coast of northern Spain on the way from the Baltic Sea to Asia.

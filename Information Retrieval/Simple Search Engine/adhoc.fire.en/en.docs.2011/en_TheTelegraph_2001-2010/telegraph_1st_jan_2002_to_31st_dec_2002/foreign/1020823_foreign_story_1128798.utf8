 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Stock scar on doyenne of domestic bliss
 Deena Beasley				 	 Martha Stewart																								Los Angeles, Aug. 22 (Reuters): She can organise a wedding and whip up a souffle at the drop of a hat. But can Martha Stewart, Americas doyenne of domestic bliss, remove the tarnish from her reputation and her business empire?																								Many experts say no, that its too late for Stewart to undo the harm caused by allegations that she engaged in insider trading  and that is a recipe for trouble at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, her guide to good living company.																								She is being investigated for insider trading after selling nearly 4,000 shares of ImClone Systems a day before they fell precipitously on news that regulators refused to review the biotech companys cancer drug.																								Stewart has denied wrongdoing, citing a pre-existing arrangement to sell the stock if it fell below $60 a share. On Tuesday, ImClone shares traded at $8.10 on the US Nasdaq stock market.																								Even if she is legally exonerated, her image as the mistress of homeyness is significantly tarnished. Shes playing this a little too close to the vest. Its a contradiction of the marketplace image of open, warm and domestic, said organisational psychologist Dr Ken Siegel.																								Stewart, also chief executive of Omnimedia, made her fortune by focusing on  in print, radio and television  crafts and tasks traditionally done by women. In the current pink and lavender issue of Martha Stewart Living, she tells readers how to convert shells and bottles into sand candles.																								Someone as culturally prominent as Stewart would be expected to address the public and she has not really done that, resulting, rightly or wrongly, in the perception that she has something to hide, said Steven Fink, president of Lexicon Communications, a Los Angeles-based crisis management firm. She hasnt made any new friends with this episode. Now its almost so set in concrete its hard to see a way out, he added.																								He and other communications experts say Stewart and her minions have badly bungled their response to the ongoing investigation, failing to address it early on and adopting a bunker mentality that has served to inflame the press.																								She thought she could talk her way out  shes very glib at the microphone, but to go on TV and keep chopping cabbage while a serious reporter is asking questions was not a good idea, said Fink.																								During a June appearance on CBS The Early Show, when host Jane Clayson tried to engage her in a discussion of the ImClone sale, Stewart said: I want to focus on my salad, adding that she would be exonerated of any ridiculousness. Stewarts appearances on the morning programme have since been put on hold, a spokeswoman for her company said.  ADVERTISEMENT copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, August 25, 2002 				 Stones rock in secret concert
 [+uc('Hugh Davies the daily telegraph')+]				 	 Mick Jagger																								London, Aug. 24: The Rolling Stones marked their 40 years together with a secret show in a Toronto dance hall ahead of a world tour which, with its punishing schedule over the next two years, could mark their exit from the stadium stage.																								They came straight from rehearsals in a school in Canadas largest city, charged 300 fans the equivalent of just 4 apiece, and invited 700 guests, including Sharon Stone and Dennis Quaid.																								News of the one-off gig was given to a Toronto radio station, starting a rush to the Palais Royal, a road-house style venue by a lake. The owner, Dan Contogainnis, said: They liked the hall because they were happy to be on the water with a nice breeze coming in. Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra have played here, and now the Stones.																								The street crowd grew to 1,000 as people streamed from a Bob Dylan concert at the nearby Molson Amphitheatre. Excitement was high as the Stones went on at 10.30 pm to a deafening roar. Members of the band wandered on the stage, plugged in their instruments and led off with a searing version of their 1974 classic Its Only Rock And Roll (But I Like It).																								Mick Jagger cried: Its great to get out here and play  I tell you. 																								The band then played If You Cant Rock Me, a staple of the 1970s shows, following with the crowd pleasing Honky Tonk Woman, Wild Horses, Heart of Stone, Hot Stuff, Cant You Hear Me Knocking? and Jumping Jack Flash.																								The Stones kept it up for 90 minutes, ending with an encore of Brown Sugar.

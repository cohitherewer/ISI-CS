The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, November 14, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Potter pirates																																	 Los Angeles, Nov. 13 (Reuters): Computer geeks have apparently tried and failed to use their technical wizardry to copy a pirated version of Warner Bros. newest Harry Potter movie to the Internet before its Friday theatrical release.																																	Warner Bros, a unit of AOL Time Warner, said today that it had opened a copy of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets that it discovered in a hard-to-find location on the Internet and found it to be an empty decoy.																																	A company statement said the report it received about a pirated copy of the newest Potter film showing up on the Web turned out to be unsubstantiated. Warner Bros. had earlier said the copy that had been discovered was of poor quality. Industry experts said that having a film leaked to the web before its opening is not unusual, but rather the norm these days, especially with highly anticipated films like Spider-Man.

 Sunday, August 25, 2002 				 Posing as Celine, comics pull a gag on Britney 
				 	 Celine Dion: The fun will go on																								Montreal, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Oops! Montreals radio pranksters did it again.																								Canadian comics posing as singer Celine Dion persuaded Britney Spears to sing a duet with golfer Tiger Woods called Lets Make a Hole in One for a bogus charity event.																								Their radio clip was aired on the Internet yesterday at www.radiopranks.com.																								Montreal comic Marc Audette, deftly imitating the voice of French-Canadian diva Dion, chatted with Spears on the telephone about each womans charity foundations.																								After a few minutes of mutual admiration, Audette got down to business and invited Spears to come to Montreal and visit her club  in reality, a popular Montreal strip joint.																								We certainly wont be distracted there, Audette said. Of course, Boy George wont be invited, just to be sure.																								The comic asked Spears, 20, to participate in the charity, rattling off a list of other famous people who will be there.																								Tiger Woods, one of my personal friends, just promised me hes going to sing a very special song in duo with you and its going to be called Lets Make a Hole in One, Audette gushes.																								Oh, I would so be interested, oh my goodness, definitely, Spears replies. 																								When do you all want to do it?																								She first had a little bit of an aggressive reaction but then she was laughing, Audette told Reuters, calling Spears a good sport. 																								She didnt even think it was a gag. I dont know why. I think she was so impressed to speak to Celine Dion.																								Audette and fellow comic Sebastien Trudel  known as the Masked Avengers  are well-known for fooling famous people on their radio show.																								The pair played an April Fools Joke on Bill Gates earlier this year when they pretended to be Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

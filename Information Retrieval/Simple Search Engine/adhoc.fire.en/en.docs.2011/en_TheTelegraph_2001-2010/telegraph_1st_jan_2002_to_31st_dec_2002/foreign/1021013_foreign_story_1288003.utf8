The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, October 13, 2002 				 Jagger was ashamed of early songs
																								London, Oct. 12 (Reuters): The first songs penned by Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Keith Richard were so sentimental they were ashamed of them, Jagger told BBC Radio in an interview to be broadcast tomorrow.																								We couldnt write rock songs. We just wrote these crap ballads, he told Britains Radio Five Live . The bands first five hits were all cover versions of songs written by other stars, though imbued with the Rolling Stones flavour. 																								But manager Andrew Loog Oldham wanted them to write their own material  and locked Jagger and Richard in a room until they did. Jagger said he and Richard were these two rebellious band members, and we would write nice little tunes, but sentimental stuff.

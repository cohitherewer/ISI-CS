The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, September 24, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Deadly drunk																																	 Stockholm, Sept. 23 (Reuters): Swedish police caught a drunk Norwegian driver three times in as many hours on the weekend, a Swedish newspaper reported on Monday.																																	Police pulled the man over after spotting him hitting speeds of 140 km per hour on a stretch of road where the limit varies between 50 and 70 km per hour, the daily Aftonbladet said. Officers found he had an alcohol level of 0.66 parts per thousand, or more than three times the maximum allowed under Swedish law.																																	Police confiscated the mans drivers licence, but set him free. Undeterred, he drove on towards Norway but was caught, and released, a second time.																																	The Norwegian tried his luck a third time but was caught yet again, and this time a prosecutor confiscated his car.																													 																Rosy the rat																																	 Sydney (Reuters): An Australian court fined three people A$375 ($206) on Monday for abandoning a pet rat named Rosy. Animal rights campaigners in the eastern state of Queensland were delighted with the fine and dozens of people had offered to take in Rosy the albino rat, which was dumped in a cage by the side of the road, local media reported. Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals inspector Gary Langford told reporters outside the magistrates court in Mackay, a small town in northern Queensland, that he had received at least 40 offers to give Rosy a home. Theres an extremely large amount of rodent fans out there in Mackay, Langford told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Neither Langford nor the Mackay magistrates court could be reached for comment. 																													 																Lengthy loan																																	 Sydney (Reuters): A 92-year-old Australian woman has become the nations oldest first-time home buyer after securing a housing loan she does not have to pay off for another 30 years. Her local financial institution is banking on the mother-of-five living to 122 under the terms of the loan. Margaret Cole, who grew up in a poor coal-mining town in Wales, Britain, decided concerns among the nations traditionally risk averse banks about her age would not stop her embracing the great Australian dream of home ownership. She has been a battler all her life and was not taking no for an answer, James Hunt, her real estate agent at First National Wyong, told Reuters on Monday. She also bagged a A$7,000 ($3,850) grant from the government for first-time homebuyers, an incentive normally aimed at the young. Cole, who emigrated to Australia in 1976, has had a little help from her daughter and brother-in-law, whose names are also on the ANZ Bank mortgage as co-guarantors.

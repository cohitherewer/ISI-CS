 Tuesday, November 05, 2002 				 Theft twist to Posh kidnap plot
 EMMA GRAHAM-HARRISON				 	 David Beckham with wife Victoria and son Brooklyn																								London, Nov. 4 (Reuters): Five men arrested in connection with an alleged plot to kidnap Victoria Beckham, Spice Girl wife of England football captain David Beckham, appeared in a London court today on unrelated charges of theft.																								The five, who were arrested over the weekend, were remanded in custody after appearing at Horseferry Road Magistrates Court on charges related to the theft of a valuable jewelled turban from Sothebys auction house.																								The men are Azem Krifsha, 30, a Kosovan living in London; Joseph Rivas, 24, from London; Rusu Sorin, 31, a Romanian living in London; Adrian Razvan Pasareanu, 28, a Romanian living in Morden, south London and Alin Turcu, 18, a Romanian living near London.																								The five were part of an initial group of nine arrested by a special kidnap unit of the police after a tip-off from a tabloid newspaper whose reporters infiltrated the gang in search of a story about the alleged selling of stolen antiques. Of the other four, one woman was released without charge and two men and another woman were bailed on matters unconnected to either the theft or kidnap investigations.																								But as yet, police have not laid any kidnapping charges. Inquiries into an alleged conspiracy to kidnap continue and all five men are also on police bail.... pending further inquiries into these matters, Scotland Yard said in a statement. 																								The Beckhams hired a bodyguard in 2000 after reports that police had uncovered a plan to snatch Victoria and their son Brooklyn and hold them for ransom. No arrests were made in that case.																								Last July, a woman was detained under the Mental Health Act following allegations she broke into the hallway of the couples Cheshire home, near Manchester, and stole their mail.																								Two years ago, a man was arrested for cutting the brakes on Beckhams Ferrari and the couple have reportedly had bullets sent through the mail to their home.																								The couple spent 150,000 pounds on a customised armour-plated Mercedes car which is able to withstand gunfire, landmine blasts, and gas attacks.																								The couples palatial home in Hertfordshire, dubbed Beckingham Palace, already boasts security which would not shame the real royal family but David Beckham said he would review the situation.																								The first role of a father and a husband is to keep his family safe, he said in a statement.

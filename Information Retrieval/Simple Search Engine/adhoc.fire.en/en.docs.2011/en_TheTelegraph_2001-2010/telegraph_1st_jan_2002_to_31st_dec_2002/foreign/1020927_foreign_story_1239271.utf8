 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Greenspan awarded honorary knighthood
				 	 Alan Greenspan																								London, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Amid the baronial splendour of the royal familys summer residence in the Scottish Highlands, the worlds most powerful central banker Alan Greenspan was awarded an honorary knighthood today.																								The tranquil surroundings of Balmoral Castle, which was built for Queen Victoria in the 1850s, provided a serene backdrop for the investiture ceremony by Queen Elizabeth.																								They stood in symbolic contrast to the recent turmoil on world financial markets and the spectre of recession stalking a US economy over which Greenspan has presided for the past 15 years.																								Before receiving his award in the softly-lit and west-facing library which overlooks the rose garden, he spoke of his close friendship with chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown and the gratitude which the US owed its British ancestors.																								He went on to say that he was deeply appreciative of this honour which I shall always cherish. Because he is not a British citizen, Greenspan cannot style himself Sir, but he can put the letters KBE  for Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire  after his name.																								There was also no knighting in the traditional sense with an investiture sword, but simply the handing over of the insignia.

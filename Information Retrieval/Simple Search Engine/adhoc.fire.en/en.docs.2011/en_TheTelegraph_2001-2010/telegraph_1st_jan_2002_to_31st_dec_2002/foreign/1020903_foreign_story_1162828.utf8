 Tuesday, September 03, 2002 				 Imrans lack of graduation hits poll bid
				 	 Imran Khan																								Islamabad, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Former Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan has had two of his five nominations to stand in October 10 elections rejected for failing to show his original university degree, his party said today.																								But Khans Tehrik-e-Insaf (Justice Movement) said the former cricketers three other nominations had been accepted.																								We dont know the criteria of the election authorities, Tehrik-e-Insaf spokesman Akbar S. Babar told Reuters.																								We had submitted similar sets of nomination papers, which were accepted by three returning officers and rejected by two.																								Pakistani politicians routinely nominate themselves in more then once constituency to increase their chances of election and to minimise the chances of bureacratic hitches. 																								Under new election laws introduced by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, only graduates can contest the polls and have to produce their original university degree at the time of scrutiny of nomination papers. One of the constituencies where Khans nomination was rejected was in his hometown of Mianwali in the central province of Punjab.

 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Plan to remake Superman
																								Los Angeles, Sept. 26 (AFP): Hollywoods fascination with money-spinning comic book superheroes revved up a notch with the announcement that Warner Bros Studios is planning a remake of its 1978 classic Superman.																								US director Brett Ratner, who was behind the blockbuster action flick Rush Hour 2 will direct the new adventure epic, while Jon Peters, who produced such mega films as last years Ali and Batman, will be the producer, Warner Bros said yesterday.																								The studios president of domestic production, Jeff Robinov, said that J.J. Abrams, the writer of Armageddon had penned the screenplay, which is based on DC comics classic character, created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The announcement ironically came on the 50th birthday of the actor who personified Superman in the 1978 film Superman: The Movie and in three sequels: Christopher Reeve.

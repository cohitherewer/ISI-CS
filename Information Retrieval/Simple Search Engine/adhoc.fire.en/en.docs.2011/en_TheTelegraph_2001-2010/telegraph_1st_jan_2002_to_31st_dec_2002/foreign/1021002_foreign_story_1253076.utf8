 Wednesday, October 02, 2002 				 Senior Tories critical of Currie
																								London, Oct. 1: Senior Tories turned on Edwina Currie yesterday as she and John Major prepared to make their first public appearances since the disclosure of their four-year affair.																								One former woman Cabinet minister told The Daily Telegraph that opinion in the Conservative Party had swung rapidly against Currie. First reaction was Gosh! but that was quickly overtaken by the view that crucifixion is too good for her.																								She was joined by David Mellor, the former heritage secretary, who mounted a vitriolic attack against his former colleague in the London Evening Standard.																								So basically she sold John Major down the river for cash, like a cheap trollop. As someone who has been there, I can only shudder at the torment of the dammed he must have gone through every time someone elses private life was in the headlines.																								Currie, 55, and Major, 59, are both due to break cover tomorrow after avoiding the cameras for the last five days.																								Major, who is on a speaking tour of the United States, will address an invitation-only dinner for 600 guests in Dallas, Texas, tomorrow in aid of the charity Mercy Ships, for which he is being paid 27,000.																								The former Prime Minister, who has issued only a brief statement on the affair, is expected to appear at a press conference before the event.																								Currie, whose comments have so far been confined to the pages of the national newspaper serialising her diaries, will appear on Radio 5s breakfast programme tomorrow and on tomorrow nights edition of Tonight With Trevor McDonald. ITV1 has changed its schedule to accommodate the programme.																								Neither Majors wife, Dame Norma, who is at the family home in Cambridgeshire, nor MCurries first husband, Ray, to whom she was married during the affair between 1984 and 1988, have spoken publicly on the subject.																								The chorus of Tory condemnation was joined by a former senior whip and member of the Cabinet in the 1980s. He ridiculed Curries belief, made clear in her diaries, that she considered herself a potential rival of her then lover for the Tory leadership following the departure of Lady Thatcher.																								That was complete and utter nonsense, said the source. Edwina always had a liking and a gift for publicity but she was pretty unpopular with other backbenchers.																								He denied any knowledge of the relationship at the time, despite the role of whips as intelligence gatherers in the Commons. The idea that the whips always know whats going on is frankly baloney, he said.																								In the third instalment of her diaries published in The Times newspaper, Currie speaks of her depression when Major was in Downing Street and she was marooned in the Tory backbenches.																								Right now I felt lonely, neglected, unused and unloved! wrote Currie at home in London on January 24, 1991, two months after Major took office.																								I wish my flat was filled with one big man in his blue underpants, she continued, alluding to Major who was once famously described as being the kind of guy who tucked his shirt into his y-front briefs.																								I wish I was warm and sticky and laughing... I havent been drinking, but Im deep in a black hole tonight and there is no one else in it here with me, added Currie.																								Major was lampooned for years by cartoonist steve bell in his regular newspaper strip as wearing his y-fronts on the outside of his trousers in a not-so-sophisticated copy of superman.																								Another former senior whip in the 1980s said he had no																								idea about the affair. quot;Its a while ago but I think I																								would have remembered it, frankly. Whips like to think																								we know a little bit more than other people do and we																								like to cultivate our image of discretion because that																								makes people more likely to confide in you.																								 quot;But that doesnt mean to say you know everything. I																								doubt many people knew of it, simply because it would																								have come out earlier. quot;																								One report suggested that Mr Major feared his affair																								with Mrs Currie had wrecked his ambition to become a																								Knight of the Garter, one of the highest honours in																								the Queens gift.																								All other surviving former Prime Ministers are members																								of the Order and Mr Major was said to be desperate to																								join them. However, a friend reacted with scorn.																								 quot;John Major is genuinely a commoner. That is why he																								didnt want to go to the Lords. So, I dont think you																								will find he is kept awake at night by worries about																								the Garter. quot;																								A spokesman for the Conservative Party said they were																								not aware Mr Major would be attending the annual																								conference in Bournemouth next week. He was not at																								last years conference.																								 29 September 2002: I was a decoy for Majors affair																								says former Downing Street cook 																								 30 September 2002: Currie set her sights on leading																								Tory party 																								 8 October 2001: Former premiers staying away 																								Information appearing on Electronic Telegraph is the																								copyright of Telegraph Group Limited and must not be																								reproduced in any medium without licence.

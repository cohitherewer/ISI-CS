 Saturday, September 21, 2002 				 Natalie sights set on Hollywood
																								London, Sept. 20 (Reuters): Australian soap star turned chart-topping singer Natalie Imbruglia now has her sights set on Hollywood.																								Imbruglia, whose Left in the Middle album has sold more than six million copies, revealed that she is now in talks with casting agents in Los Angeles and taking classes to teach her to speak with an American accent.																								I am enjoying learning again and I want people to know that I am available for films because I wasnt when I was doing my music, the 27-year-old star told Britains Sun tabloid.																								She argued that if fellow Australian Guy Pearce, the star of LA Confidential, can graduate from soaps to Hollywood, then so can she. There is a lot of snobbery towards soap stars but its great training for young actors. 																								Im not embarrassed I was a soap star. It got me started and Guy Pearce has proved you can cross over, she said.																								Natalie Imbruglia first burst on the pop scene with her hit single Torn.

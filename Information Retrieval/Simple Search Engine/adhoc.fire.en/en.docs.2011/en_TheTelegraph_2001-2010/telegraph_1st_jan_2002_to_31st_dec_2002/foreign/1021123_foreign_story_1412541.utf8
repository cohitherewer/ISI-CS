 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 MTV to use Mandela to send AIDS message
 BRENDAN BOYLE				 	 Nelson Mandela																								Cape Town, Nov. 22 (Reuters): The MTV pop channel is using its global reach, the sparkle of its stars and the moral authority of South Africas Nelson Mandela to send a message of AIDS awareness and tolerance to young people worldwide.																								Video footage from a Cape Town concert tomorrow featuring stars Sean P. Diddy Combs and Alicia Keys will be combined with an earlier concert in Seattle to produce a 90-minute programme, likely to reach up to two billion people around the world, MTV executive Bill Roedy said today.																								The Cape Town concert  which the stars will be performing for free  and the Staying Alive special, due for broadcast on World Aids Day, December 1, will feature a hard-hitting segment with former South African President Mandela, who endured 27 years in prison for his anti-apartheid beliefs.																								Mandela will introduce a young rape victim who is now HIV positive and they will talk about the discrimination she has had to endure because of it. Its a very tough message, Roedy said.																								Mandela, who admits he still finds it difficult to say the word condom in public, has become a leading AIDS awareness campaigner in South Africa, the worlds worst affected country.																								At least one in nine South Africans, or about 4.8 million people, is suffering from the disease or infected with the HIV virus that causes it. Researchers say up to seven million people could die of AIDS-related illness by 2010.																								MTV is working closely with South Africas leading AIDS lobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), to make sure the twin messages of awareness and tolerance get across.																								This is an awareness event, its not a fundraising event, said TAC activist Vuyiseka Dubula.																								She said more than 100 people living with HIV/AIDs would be at the concert with their now familiar red and white HIV Positive T-shirts.																								Dubula said South African activists were excited about the project because MTV and the stars it features can get through to pre-teen and teenage fans very effectively. Most young people identify with people like Alicia Keys and P. Diddy. They wont listen to the President or the minister of health in the same way, she said. President Thabo Mbeki and health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang have been at loggerheads with AIDS activists for over two years over the governments refusal to provide life-prolonging anti-retroviral drugs in state clinics.																								World Bank managing director Mamphele Ramphele said during a visit home today the countrys AIDS policy makes you shudder. Roedy said the concert, sponsored by computer billionaire Bill Gates through his private foundation and Levi Strauss jeans, was costing more than a million dollars to produce.

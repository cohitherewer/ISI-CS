 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 Churchill suit to be auctioned
																								London, Nov. 12 (Reuters): A ghostly reminder of British wartime leader Winston Churchills ample figure goes on display in London next month when his famous siren suit, still moulded to the shape of his generous waistline, is sold at auction.																								Churchill himself designed the all-in-one boiler suit of pinstriped grey wool so he could be comfortable but authoritative during the long hours he spent working in his central London bunker.																								Sixty years after World War II, Churchills suit is expected to fetch upwards of 25,000 when it goes under the hammer alongside a half-smoked cigar and other memorabilia on December 12 at Sothebys. Its an amazingly atmospheric garment because its never been cleaned so when you hold it up you can actually see the shape of Churchills body in it, said the current owner.

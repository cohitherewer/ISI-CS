 Friday, August 23, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Mills wins																																	 London, Aug. 22 (Reuters): Former Beatle Paul McCartneys new wife Heather Mills has accepted 50,000 in damages from a British newspaper which claimed she was being investigated over charity money, her lawyer said today.																																	The money was offered to settle her libel claim after a May 12 article in the Sunday Mirror alleged the Charity Commission was investigating her over money collected for an Indian earthquake amputees appeal in 2001. Former model Mills, who married McCartney in an Irish castle in June, turned to raising money for the limbless after losing her left leg below the knee in a motorcycle accident in 1993. More recently she and McCartney have campaigned against landmines. 																																	 a statement, Mills lawyer said she planned to donate the damages money to the charity Adopt-A-Minefield UK. She was pleased the Sunday Mirror has recognised that the allegations were unfounded and that her reputation has been vindicated, it said. She is also pleased that she may now concentrate on the important issue of her charity work instead of wasting an enormous amount of valuable time and energy defending her charity and herself, it added. 																													 																Stone end 																																	 Chicago (Reuters): They say diamonds are forever. And now the dearly departed can be, too. A Chicago company says it has developed a process for turning cremated human remains into diamonds that can be worn as jewellery. Were building on the simple fact that all living creatures are carbon-based and diamonds are carbon-based, said Greg Herro, head of LifeGem Memorials. The blue diamonds are the answer to people who think a tombstone or an urn full of ashes is not personal enough. And they are portable, Herro said. Herro, who describes himself as an entrepreneur, said he has spent the past three years refining the process, successfully making a diamond from cremated human remains in July. A small thimbleful of carbon can be made into 0.25 carat diamond, for which LifeGem would charge $4,000. A full karat would cost $22,000.  copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 Pak cricket team doctor detained
 FROM IDREES BAKHTIAR AND REUTERS				 	 Imran Khan: Livid																								Lahore, Oct. 22 (Reuters): Pakistani intelligence officials and FBI agents put prominent orthopaedic surgeon Dr Amir Aziz Khan under detention yesterday evening. 																								Official sources said Dr Khan, former chief executive of the Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, was summoned several times during the last two days by the FBI officials over his alleged links with Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. The sources said the investigators grilled the doctor for allegedly providing formulas of biological and chemical weapons to Osama bin Laden.																								Yesterday, two FBI agents accompanied by a team of intelligence officials arrested the doctor from his house at 3.30 pm and drove him to the Lahore airport. 																								However, the Punjab police IG Asif Hayat was not aware of the arrest. The police did not take part in the operation, he said. 																								Imran protests																								Former Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan, newly elected as a member of parliament, also issued a stinging protest against the reported detention of Dr Amir Aziz Khan in Lahore yesterday. I have known him for 13 years, Khan said. Being an orthopaedic surgeon, he used to look after our (national) cricket teams muscle and bone injuries free of charge.																								Khan said Aziz had been providing free consultancy for a cancer hospital Khan had set up in Lahore. Khan said he had sent hundreds of poor people over the years for free treatment there.																								I am ashamed that we are being treated like this on our own country, on our own soil, Khan told a news conference in Islamabad. I want to ask, does Pakistan have any sovereignty at all? Is it a sovereign country or a slave?																								Newly elected parliamentarians from the religious Muttahida Majlis-Amal (MMA) alliance in the province of Punjab met in Lahore today and signalled their objections to the detention.																								It is a violation of human rights and doctors rights, Liaqat Baluch, the MMAs nominee for the prestigious post of speaker of the national assembly, or lower house of the parliament, told reporters after the meeting.																								If he is handed over to America, it will be a serious blow to Pakistans integrity and sovereignty, he added, threatening public protests.

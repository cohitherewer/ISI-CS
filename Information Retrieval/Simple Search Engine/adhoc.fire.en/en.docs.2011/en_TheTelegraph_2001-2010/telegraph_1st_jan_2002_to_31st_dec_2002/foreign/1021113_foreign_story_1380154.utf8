 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 MTV show replay sets boy on fire
																								Seattle, Nov. 12 (Reuters): A 15-year-old Washington state boy suffered serious burns when he set himself on fire trying to re-enact a stunt from MTVs controversial show Jackass, police said today.																								The boy from the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Washington, soaked his shirt in rubbing alcohol late on Friday and ignited it while his friends stood by with a video camera shooting footage they planned to sell, police and local media reported.																								After suffering first-degree burns over his face and upper body, the teenager initially told police that someone had set his clothes on fire while he walked on a trail after attending a high school football game in Issaquah, Washington, police said.																								But police later recovered a backpack containing an alcohol-soaked T-shirt, lighter fluid and a video camera.

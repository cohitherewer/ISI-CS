 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 Slur on Bush, Harvard
																								Boston, Oct. 9 (Reuters): President George W. Bushs former oil firm entered into a partnership with Harvard University that concealed the companys financial woes and may have misled investors, a student and alumni group said in a report today.																								The report said the partnership between Harken Energy Corp. and Harvard, created with Bushs approval, bore strong resemblance to the partnerships that helped disguise Enrons problems. The White House disputed that comparison.																								HarvardWatch, an independent group of students and alumni that monitors the schools investments, said the partnership raised troubling questions about the universitys involvement in Harken when Bush was a board member.																								The deal, which HarvardWatch said improved Harkens financial position, also gave further evidence of improper corporate practices at Harken while Bush was a director, the group said.																								A spokesman at the White House brushed aside the groups suggestions of malfeasance and its comparing of aspects of the Harken-Harvard partnership to Enrons so-called off balance sheet transactions. Harvard proposed and set the terms of the partnership, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. Independent reports note that it was fully disclosed and complied with accounting rules, so there really is no comparison.																								In addition, Harvards relationship with Harken began before the President joined the board, McClellan said.																								Harvard Management Co., which oversees the schools endowment, was the biggest shareholder in Harken in 1990 when the two sides agreed to the Harken Anadarko Partnership. Harken is an oil and gas exploration and production firm with operations in the Texan oil belt and internationally, in Colombia.																								Over the next two years, the partnership allowed Harvard to bail out Harkens business by removing from its books a large percentage of the companys loss-generating assets and debts in the Anadarko region of Texas and Oklahoma. The manoeuvre improved Harkens official financial position, leading to a gradual recovery in the oil firms share price. Harvard profited from the upswing to unload some 1.6 million shares of the company.																								Bush  who held three high-level positions at Harken, according to HarvardWatch  gave the deal his personal approval according to minutes of the August 29, 1990 board meeting.																								HarvardWatch said key parts of the report, including the minutes, were obtained by the Center for Public Integrity under the Freedom of Information Act.																								Officials at both Harken and Harvard were not immediately available for comment.

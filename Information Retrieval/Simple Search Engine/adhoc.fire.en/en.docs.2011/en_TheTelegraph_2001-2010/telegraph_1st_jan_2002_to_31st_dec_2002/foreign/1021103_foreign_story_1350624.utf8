				 	 Mistry																								Toronto, Nov. 2 (Reuters): Celebrated Canadian author Rohinton Mistry has cancelled the second half of a US book tour, complaining of unbearable humiliation as a result of racial profiling, the Globe and Mail reported on Saturday.																								He (Mistry) has been extremely unhappy about the way he has been treated in airports around the US in the first half of his tour, the Globe reported a representative of Mistrys US publisher, Alfred. A Knopf, as saying in a memo sent to affected bookstores.																								Mistry, who was born in India, has had three works short-listed for the Booker Prize, including Family Matters this year. As a person of colour he was stopped repeatedly and rudely at each airport along the way  to the point where the humiliation for both he and his wife has become unbearable, the newspaper quoted the memo as saying.

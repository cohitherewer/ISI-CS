 Thursday, December 26, 2002 				 US snowstorm
																								Dallas, Dec. 25 (Reuters): A winter storm rolled through southwest and central sections of the US yesterday, causing at least 15 deaths and bringing an unexpected White Christmas to regions that seldom see snow.																								Three people were killed in Oklahoma as a winter storm dumped up to 12 inches of snow in some parts of the state, an Oklahoma Highway Patrol spokesman said. The capital Oklahoma City received about 6 inches of snow and is likely to have its first White Christmas in over 25 years.																								Were digging ourselves out now. We had a lot of cars banging and bumping into each other, an Oklahoma Highway patrol officer said.																								The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for large parts of southern Missouri and sections of Illinois.

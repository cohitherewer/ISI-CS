				 	 Michael Jackson holds his baby son from a hotel balcony in Berlin. (Reuters)																								Berlin, Nov. 20: Pop megastar Michael Jackson has admitted making a terrible mistake after dangling his nine-month-old son from a fifth floor hotel balcony.																								Stunned fans watched in horror as Jackson, holding the baby with one hand, lifted him over the railings at the hotel in Berlin, Germany. 																								The infant, wearing only a romper suit, began to struggle before the singer, who was holding a white cloth over the babys head, pulled him back in and returned into the hotel room.																								In a written statement the singer, who was heavily criticised by child protection groups, said: I made a terrible mistake. I got caught up in the excitement of the moment. I would never intentionally endanger the lives of my children. 																								A spokeswoman for the Bambi entertainment award ceremony, which Jackson is due to attend in Berlin, said the child was Jacksons third and youngest, Prince Michael II.																								The existence of the baby was made public in August when he was reported to be six-months-old. 																								Mystery still surrounds the identity of the childs mother and the question of whether the infant is adopted. 																								His eldest son, five-year-old Prince Michael, and four-year-old daughter Paris  both by his former nurse and ex-wife Debbie Rowe  were also with him on his German visit, according to his friend, the psychic Uri Geller.																								The NSPCC condemned the balcony incident, saying no one should attempt such a stunt.																								Jackson also drew criticism from Geller, at whose wedding the singer was best man. 																								I think it was a silly thing to do. He probably did it because he was overwhelmed emotionally by the fans. He wasnt thinking. He is a great father. He is an incredibly loving dad, he said.																								Today, Michael Jackson took his children to a Berlin zoo and other tourist attractions.																								Jackson wore a dark suit as he strolled through Berlins zoo with his children, who wore red veils, reportedly to protect them from becoming a target of kidnappers. 																								They were escorted throughout the day by a convoy of security guards.																								Jackson visited the zoos famous monkey house and paused to inspect one of the gorillas.																								Jackson later went to Potsdam outside Berlin to see the baroque Sans Souci palace.

 MIRJA SPERNAL				 	 Antonio Banderas and Susan Sarandon: Collective sadness																								London, Sept. 9 (Reuters): On the eve of the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the US, film celebrities in Europe and America shared their memories and thoughts about that day.																								In interviews Video News, the stars recalled their reactions to the news that hijacked aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania.																								I was scared, said American actress and producer Goldie Hawn. For the first time since the Cold War, when I was little and I would hide under tables when Id hear the fire engine because I thought it was an air raid attack, I was scared. And I couldnt stop crying.																								Hawn was so moved she decided to knit the Stars and Stripes: I sat in front of the TV set and I knitted the American flag.																								Spanish actor Antonio Banderas, at home in Los Angeles and sleepless, switched on his television to watch the news and heard that the World Trade Centers Twin Towers had been hit.																								I remember the moment specifically, the moment in which the towers were falling down, the first one, and being with my mouth totally open and in a state of incredulity.																								I couldnt believe what I was watching, literally, it was almost like a movie, Banderas said. Pretty much like the experience everybody had. And tremendous sadness and then immediately after thinking, what are going to be the consequences of this?																								Italian film legend Sophia Loren said at the Venice Film Festival: We were horrified... the incredulity of what was happening live on television, (it) was really the most awful day of my life.																								The thoughts of Mexican actress Salma Hayek, also at Venice, went to the more than 3,000 people who died that day. There were a lot of people that lost people in this horrible incident and I think it was a time of collective sadness, she said.																								James Woods was among the many American entertainers who took part in America: A Tribute To Heroes, a televised fundraiser aired worldwide last September which raised millions of dollars for those affected by the attacks. I just didnt think of terrorism till they started mentioning it, Woods said. 																								Actors in New York city at the time of the attacks spoke of their shock and sadness over what occurred. British film director Sam Mendes said, My memory of it was that I was there, in New York, and that it was something Id rather forget.																								Yoko Ono, musician, artist and widow of ex-Beatle John Lennon, said: The September 11th situation really shocked all of us living in New York city and most of us are still in shock. But I think that somehow, we are coming together more and there is a kind of warm feeling in New York City.																								A number of celebrities preferred to look into the hopefully brighter future than look back.																								Id rather look at what were doing now and how were going to proceed from here. I want to look forward and not look back, said actress Susan Sarandon, star of Thelma and Louise.																								Harrison Ford said: Its wise that we reflect on why that happened, and weve changed behaviours to affect some changes in the world  and I mean other things than military reaction.

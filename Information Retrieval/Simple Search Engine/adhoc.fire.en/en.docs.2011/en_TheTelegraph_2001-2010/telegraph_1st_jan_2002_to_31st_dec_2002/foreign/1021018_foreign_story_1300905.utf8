The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, October 18, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Casino cure																																	 Tokyo, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Policy measures have so far failed to fix a long-term Japanese economic malaise that has trimmed jobs and government budgets, so why not try casinos for a cure?																																	That is the message from maverick Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara, who tried his hand at gambling today to promote casinos as a way of bringing in much-needed jobs and money.																																	Tokyo is in the vanguard of at least eight Japanese local governments who would like to place their bets on casinos to help revive their languishing economies.																																	 tough economic times like this, we need to secure some sort of guarantee for jobs and revenue, Ishihara said. 																																	Taking a chance on casinos, though, will be far easier said than done. Gambling in Japan is tightly controlled and strictly limited to a handful of events such as horse races.																													 																King Elvis																																	 Los Angeles (Reuters): Long live the King. Elvis Presley is extending his reign over the US pop charts for a third straight week thanks to a greatest-hits album released 25 years after his death, according to sales data issued on Wednesday. lvis: 30 Hits sold 205,000 copies during the week ended October 13, pushing its three-week domestic tally over the 1-million mark and relegating the veteran rock band Bon Jovi to the number two spot for the biggest album debut of its career. A similar pattern occurred in the US charts the week before, when the Presley retrospective deprived the Rolling Stones of what would have been their first number one album in 21 years. The Stones latest hits package, Forty Licks, slipped from number two to number three in its second week with sales of 147,000 copies, according to album sales tracker Nielsen SoundScan. The heavily promoted Elvis album also has been a tremendous hit overseas, selling nearly 6 million copies worldwide and topping the charts in two dozen countries, according to RCA Records.																													 																Mad mother																																	 Multan (AFP): A Pakistani mother of 11, apparently tired of her duties as a housewife, drugged her children and husband and then ran off with her 18-year-old lover, local press reported on Thursday. The 42-year-old woman from a village outside Multan in central Punjab province had been caught red-handed twice with the teenager. She laced milk with drugs, knocking out her husband and children on Wednesday, and eloped with her paramour, media reported.

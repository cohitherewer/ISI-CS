 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 Bush twins can legally drink as they turn 21
				 	 Barbara and Jenna Bush																								Crawford (Texas), Nov. 26 (Reuters): Underage drinking problems became a thing of the past for US President George W. Bushs twin daughters yesterday when they celebrated their 21st birthdays, turning the legal age to drink.																								Jenna and Barbara Bush made worldwide headlines last year after they were charged with misdemeanor underage drinking violations in two separate incidents in Austin, Texas.																								The twins yesterday were in Texas, where they were to spend the Thanksgiving holiday weekend with the President and First Lady Laura Bush at the family ranch in Crawford. 																								The White House, very protective of the twins privacy, had no comment.																								Jenna, a student at the University of Texas in Austin, was fined $500 and her drivers license was suspended for 30 days after she was caught drinking a beer at an local bar on May 16, 2001.																								She got a second ticket on May 31, 2001, for using someone elses identification to try to buy a tequila margarita at a popular Austin restaurant. 																								Her sister Barbara, a student at Yale University in New Haven, Conn. who was visiting Austin at the time, was ticketed after police found her with a margarita and a tequila shot. Both were 19 at the time. The legal drinking age in Texas is 21. For the May 31 incident, the twins cases were dismissed after they completed their respective probations and paid fines.

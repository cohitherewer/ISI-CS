 Monday, November 25, 2002 				 Austrias far-right bleeds at hustings
 MARCUS KABEL				 	 Joerg Haider casts his ballot in Klagenfurt on Sunday. (AFP)																								Vienna, Nov. 24 (Reuters): Austrian populist Joerg Haiders far-right party plunged in todays elections, but a landslide victory by his conservative partners could save their centre-right ruling coalition, projections showed.																								Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel of the conservative Peoples Party has signalled he is open to renewing the coalition whose collapse in September triggered snap elections, but talks could take weeks and no outcome is certain. Before the final results one shouldnt say anything. We will have talks with everybody, Peoples Party general-secretary Maria Rauch-Kallat said on Austrian state television ORF when asked about possible coalition choices.																								But the Social Democrats, who came in second behind the conservatives, said they believed Schuessel was more prone to reviving his coalition with the far-right than to forming a grand coalition of the two biggest parties.																								It does seem that there will be a black (Peoples Party)-blue (Freedom Party) coalition again, said Social Democratic party manager Doris Bures.																								According to the latest projections by state television ORF, Haiders anti-immigration, eurosceptical Freedom Party only garnered 10.4 per cent of votes, an almost 17 percentage point drop in results from Freedoms record results in 1999.																								The projections, based on almost half the votes counted, lent credibility to the claim that voters were tired of Freedoms in-fighting and the policy swings that led to the break-up of the centre-right coalition.																								Schuessels conservatives surged to 42.9 per cent, their best result in two decades, after the chancellor successfully co-opted Haiders tough anti-immigration stance and wooed away Freedoms most popular figure, finance minister Karl-Heinz Grasser.																								The result meant Haiders party was down but not out, with a chance of returning to government despite falling below their modest target of 15 per cent. The Social Democrats, traditionally Austrias biggest party, took second place with 36.6 per cent. Their potential coalition partners, the Greens, posted 8.2 per cent.																								The Social Democrats had hoped to return from nearly three years in opposition, either in a German-style red-green coalition with the Greens or a return to the grand coalition with the conservatives that ruled Austria for 13 years until 2000.																								The snap election was called after Haider triggered a coalition crisis by trying to retake control of the party he led for 15 years until 2000, forcing the resignation of moderate Freedom ministers. Schuessel then called off the coalition.

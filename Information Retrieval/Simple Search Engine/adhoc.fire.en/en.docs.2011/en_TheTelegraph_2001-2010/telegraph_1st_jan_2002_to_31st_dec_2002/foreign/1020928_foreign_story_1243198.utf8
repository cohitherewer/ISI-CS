The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, September 28, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Wheelchair wonder																																	 Toronto, Sept. 27 (Reuters): Canadian paralympian Jeff Adams climbed the 1,776 stairs of the world largest tower in a wheelchair yesterday to show the disabled world some of the biggest obstacles can be overcome.																																	Adams, a four-time competitor at the Paralympics, believes stairs are among the biggest barriers to people in wheelchairs. The best part of living is standing up to a barrier, Adams told reporters. Adams, 31, is the first person to attempt and complete climbing Torontos CN Tower in a wheelchair. It took some five hours to climb, moving backwards in a specially made wheelchair, the inside staircase of the tower that dominates the skyline of Canadas most populous city. Its so outside the box and also something you never thought was possible in a wheelchair, he said.																													 																Crude bits from Blighs Bounty																																	 London (Reuters): Crude but vital artefacts Captain William Bligh used to save his loyal crew in an epic open boat voyage after the 1789 mutiny on the Bounty were sold at auction on Thursday. They give a poignant insight into the trials of the captain and his 18 starving and parched crew on their 43-day voyage across the Pacific. Several of the key relics, owned by Blighs descendants living in New Zealand, were bought by Britains National Maritime Museum and will be seen in public for the first time.

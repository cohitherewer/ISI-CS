 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 Moron high cost
																								Ottawa, Nov. 26 (Reuters): The top aide to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien who called US President George W. Bush a moron resigned today, saying the controversy generated by the comment had made her position untenable.																								Francoise Ducros, Chretiens communications director, had been under intense pressure from Opposition politicians and the media since making the remark last Wednesday during a conversation with journalists during a Nato summit in Prague. She first offered her resignation last Friday but Chretien refused to accept it, saying the remarks had been private. But today she sent Chretien a letter saying she was quitting. It is very apparent to me that the controversy will make it impossible for me to do my job. I would, therefore, like to leave my position as director of communications immediately, wrote Ducros, who had been in the post since mid-1999.																								Ducros, a 40-year-old lawyer known for her combative and often abrasive manner, showed undying loyalty to Chretien and was considered one of the most influential players in Ottawa. Im very sorry. She was very good, a very competent person and served me and served the government extremely well, and I wish her good luck, Chretien said. 																								Chretien declared last week that Bush is a friend of mine, he is not a moron at all. But Ducros; comments did little to improve his cool relationship with the US President. Chretien comes from the Left wing of Canadas ruling Liberals and is uncomfortable with the right-wing Republican presidents stance on many issues.

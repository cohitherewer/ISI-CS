				 	 Amanpour																								Tehran, Oct. 9 (Reuters): Iran barred Christiane Amanpour, CNNs chief international correspondent, from entering the country with journalists accompanying British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, UK diplomats said today.																								Iranian officials gave no reason for excluding Amanpour, who is half Iranian and half British. In London, a CNN spokeswoman said the company had received no explanation or comment from the Iranian government.																								We find the Iranian government decision to ban Christiane inexplicable and unjustified, spokeswoman Suzanna Flood said.																								A British diplomat in Tehran said: The facts are that the Iranians do not want her to come into the country and she has had to get off the plane in Kuwait.																								They have an exclusion order against her, and they have refused to reconsider it for this trip, the diplomat added.																								Straw is due to arrive in Tehran at 0930 GMT on the last leg of a four-nation Middle East trip to seek support for a tougher UN resolution on Iraq.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, October 04, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Slim dogs live long																																	 Philadelphia, Oct. 3 (AP): If your pets diet has gone to the dogs, consider this: a study finds that dogs who ate less lived nearly two years longer and developed fewer chronic diseases than those allowed to eat as much as they wanted.																																	The 14-year study, funded by Nestle Purina Petcare company, involved 48 labrador retrievers from seven litters.																																	 The dogs were paired off, with one fed 25 per cent less than its sibling starting at age 8 weeks. 																																	The thinner dogs lived for a median 13 years and had fewer diseases, such as debilitating osteoarthritis, compared to their all-youcan-eat partners,who lived for a median 11.2 years.																																	Just as obesity in children and in adults is not something to be looked at casually, neither should obesity in pets, said Gail K. Smith, a researcher at University of Pennsylvanias School of Veterinary Medicine.																													 																Show ends																																	 New York (Reuters): Les Miserables will end a 16-year run on Broadway after 6,612 performances when the musical based on Victor Hugos classic novel closes on March 15, the producers announced on Wednesday. The production, which has grossed more than $390 million and been seen by 9 million people, will stand second on Broadways longest-running list behind Cats, which gave 7,485 performances. I never dreamed that a musical like Les Miserables could become one of the longest-running shows of all time, and I am very grateful to American audiences for embracing such a different kind of musical in such an overwhelming way, producer Cameron Mackintosh said in a statement.																													 																Croc ride																																	 Sydney (Reuters): Australias quirky Northern Territory has more crocodiles than humans, but they dont normally take the bus. Driver Baz Young said he did not notice his reptilian passenger until a woman passenger pointed under his seat. Ive got no idea where he came from, Young said on Thursday near Darwin. I believe someone must have taken him into the bus thinking that theyd take him somewhere and maybe he was too strong for them to hold so he disappeared under the seat and theyve done a quiet exit and left me with the crocodile, he said.																													 																Nurse serial																																	 London (Reuters): Nurses from the Philippines about to start work in northern England are to be shown episodes of Britains longest running soap opera, Coronation Street, to familiarise them with local customs and accents. A hospital in Macclesfield, Cheshire, has recruited the 24 nurses because it cannot get enough locally trained staff.  The soap, set in a fictional working class district of Manchester, has been a favourite in Britain for 42 years.

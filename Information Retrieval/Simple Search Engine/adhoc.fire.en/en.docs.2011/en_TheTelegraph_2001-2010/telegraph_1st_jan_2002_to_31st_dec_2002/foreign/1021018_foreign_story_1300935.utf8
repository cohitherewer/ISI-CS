The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 Pressured Indonesia to get tough on terrorists
 JOANNE COLLINS				 	 A bowl lies amid the ruins of the destroyed Sari Club in Kuta, Bali. (Reuters)																								Bali, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Indonesia, under pressure to get tough with terrorists after a weekend bombing that killed nearly 200 people on its resort island of Bali, said today a new anti-terrorism decree will carry the death penalty.																								The maximum punishment under this decree will be the death penalty, justice minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra told reporters after a meeting of top parliamentary officials with President Megawati Sukarnoputri to discuss the decree.																								The meeting came the day Australia urged its citizens to consider leaving its northern neighbour if they are concerned about their security, saying it received disturbing new information of threats to Westerners in the wake of the bombings that ripped through a Bali nightclub district on Saturday.																								Foreign minister Alexander Downer said the disturbing new information of generic threats to Westerners in Indonesia came from intelligence sources but did not give details.																								An international team of investigators is hunting for clues that might link radical foreign and Indonesian Islamic groups to the Bali attacks which killed more than 180 people, including as many as 119 Australians.																								In Bali, police were questioning four men over the bomb blasts there. National police spokesman Saleh Saaf said: I would like to clarify that we havent arrested anyone yet. We were questioning two people but this is now four.

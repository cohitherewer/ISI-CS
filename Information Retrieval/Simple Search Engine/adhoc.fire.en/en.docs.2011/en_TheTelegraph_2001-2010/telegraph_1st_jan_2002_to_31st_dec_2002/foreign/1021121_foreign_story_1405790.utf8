																								London, Nov. 20 (Reuters): With Harry Potter weaving his magic worldwide at the movies, author JK Rowling has offered a tantalising glimpse into the next instalment of her wizard saga.																								But you will have to pay up to 6,000 for a clue to what might happen in the eagerly awaited Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix.																								The author of the worlds most popular childrens books has provided a teaser  93 random words on a card that is up for auction next month at Sothebys in London. The sale is for Book Aid International, which provides books for developing countries.																								Sothebys today offered a short sample of what the lucky winner will get on the autographed Rowling card.																								Thirty-eight chapters ... might change ... longest volume ... Ron ... broom ... sacked ... house-elf ... new teacher ... dies ... sorry, Rowling writes in a literary trailer certain to spark a fever of anticipation among her devoted readers.																								Fervent Potter fans will have to wait until the December 12 auction to bid for the rest of the plot outline.

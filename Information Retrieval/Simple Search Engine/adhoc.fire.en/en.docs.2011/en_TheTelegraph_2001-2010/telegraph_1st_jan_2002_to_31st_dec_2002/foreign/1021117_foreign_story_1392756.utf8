The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, November 17, 2002 				 Top model left exposed on catwalk by fur protest
 JONATHAN HARRIS																								New York, Nov. 16: Protesters opposed to the use of fur in fashion stormed a catwalk and shouted slogans at the model Gisele Bundchen.																								The campaigners from Peta, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, invaded the runway during the Victorias Secrets show in New York. They brandished placards saying: Gisele: fur scum.																								They targeted the Brazilian, who was parading in only underwear at the time, because she was one of the most prominent models to wear fur since it began to creep back into acceptability in fashion circles.																								The protesters were dragged away and arrested after the demonstration on Thursday night.																								Dawn Carr, a Peta spokesman, said: By getting into bed with the fur-pushers Gisele has become Peta enemy number one. Every time that Gisele or anyone else wears furs they are sentencing countless animals to a violent and cruel death.																								Bundchen was paid a reported 320,000 and given two black mink coats by the American fur company Blackglama this month to head its new advertising campaign.																								This was Petas second high-profile protest this week. Its latest advertisement features Sophie Ellis Bextor, the singer, holding up a skinned fox with the slogan: Heres the rest of your coat.

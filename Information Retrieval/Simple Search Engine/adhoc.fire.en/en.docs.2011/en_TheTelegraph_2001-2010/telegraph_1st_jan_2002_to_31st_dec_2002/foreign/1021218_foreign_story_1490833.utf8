 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 Ono in song credits fight
																								London, Dec. 17: Yoko Ono has threatened legal action to stop Sir Paul McCartney reversing the traditional Lennon-McCartney songwriting credit for Beatles songs on his new live album.																								Peter Shukat, the lawyer representing John Lennons widow, told the Los Angeles Times that Sir Pauls decision to reverse the credits on 19 songs featured on Back in the US Live 2002, including Eleanor Rigby, Hey Jude and Yesterday, was ridiculous, absurd and petty. He said: This was done against [Onos] wishes. Paul is hurting his own legacy with this. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

(AFP)																								London, Sept. 8 (Reuters): Britains most radical Islamic group, al-Muhajiroun, is planning to hold a controversial conference on September 11 highlighting the positive outcomes of last years attacks, according to its website.																								Entitled A Towering Day in History, the conference will be held at Londons Finsbury Park Mosque, home to firebrand cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri and previously visited by terror suspects, including Zacarias Moussaoui, an alleged conspirator in the attacks.																								Masri is due to deliver a speech in the evening entitled: The US conspiracy against Islam and Muslims, while al-Muhajiroun founder Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed will speak on The positive outcomes of September 11.																								The Sunday Mirror newspaper quoted Syrian-born Bakri as saying there were 70 positive outcomes from September 11. 																								Muslims now know who the enemy is, he said. 																								It is now black and white.																								Bakri denied the meeting would be a celebration of the attacks. 																								We are not celebrating the deaths of these people, he was quoted as saying. 																								We regret their deaths as we regret the deaths of all innocent people.																								The Sunday Mirror said he would use the conference to warn Prime Minister Tony Blair that Britain faces terror attacks if war is declared on Iraq.																								Bakri caused outrage last October by calling Blair a legitimate target and urging followers to kill anyone involved in military action against Muslims. 																								Police said then that they had insufficient evidence to prosecute him for racial incitement, but would monitor his activities.																								Bakris critics, including many of Britains two million Muslims, believe he is exploiting the countrys liberal freedom of expression laws to incite racial hatred. 																								The mosques Egyptian-born Abu Hamza al-Masri, who is wanted on terrorism charges in Yemen, has also recently called on Muslims to avenge any attacks on Iraq by the US and its allies.

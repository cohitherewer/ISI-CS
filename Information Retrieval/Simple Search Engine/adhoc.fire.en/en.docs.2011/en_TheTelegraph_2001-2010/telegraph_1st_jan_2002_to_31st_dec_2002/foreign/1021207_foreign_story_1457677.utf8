 Saturday, December 07, 2002 				 Winona escapes jail
																								Beverly Hills, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Oscar-nominated actress Winona Ryder was spared jail time today for her felony shoplifting conviction but was placed on three years probation by a Beverly Hills judge and ordered to undergo drug and psychiatric counselling.																								Ryder was convicted on November 6 of grand theft for stealing more than $5,560 in goods and damaging a $795 Calvin Klein purse during a December 12, 2001, shoplifting spree.																								Superior Court judge Elden Fox followed prosecutors recommendations to sentence her to probation and 480 hours of community service and ordered her to pay more than $6,300 in restitution to the Beverly Hills store, plus $3,700 in fines to the court. 																								Fox told Ryder she needed to make necessary changes in your life and warned her if you steal again, you will go to jail.																								Do you understand that? Fox asked her. Yes, I do, she responded. I intend to hold you accountable, Fox said. You have disappointed many people who have been entertained and inspired by your talent.

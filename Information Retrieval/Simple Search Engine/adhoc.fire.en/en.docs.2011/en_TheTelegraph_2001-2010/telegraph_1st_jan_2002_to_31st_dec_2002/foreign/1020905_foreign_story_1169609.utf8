 Thursday, September 05, 2002  Fine Print				 				 				 																Roving men																																	 Missaglia (Italy), Sept. 4 (Reuters): Husbands eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier. At least thats the solution proposed by an Italian mayor  and a woman mayor at that.																																	Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace. They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her clothes back on. But the mayor, far from sympathising, told the wives to get sexy if they wanted to keep their men.

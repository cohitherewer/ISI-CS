 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 Netanyahu new foreign minister
																								Jerusalem, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was sworn in as Israels new foreign minister today, with plans to challenge Ariel Sharon as Israels leader with a get-tough policy towards the Palestinians.																								The 53-year-old Right-winger, popularly known as Bibi, took the standard parliamentary oath a day after Prime Minister Sharon called an early election in the wake of the Centre-Left Labour Partys defection from his coalition. Netanyahu replaces Shimon Peres, who quit along with five other Labour ministers last week in a dispute over funding for Jewish settlements on occupied land. 																								By taking the foreign portfolio in the minority government, Netanyahu returns to a political stage he largely abandoned after Labours Ehud Barak ousted him as Prime Minister in 1999.																								Before the nationwide vote, Israels two main parties  Sharons Right-wing Likud and Labour  will hold leadership elections. Netanyahu said he would challenge Sharon for the Likud leadership in a party primary. Palestinians voiced concern that Sharons decision to hold elections nine months ahead of schedule would stir more turmoil in West Asia.

 Tuesday, December 17, 2002 				 DVD Jon awaits verdict
																								Oslo, Dec. 16 (Reuters): A landmark trial of a teenager in Norway over Hollywood charges of video piracy ended today with prosecutors urging a suspended 90-day jail term.																								Jon Johansen, known in Norway as DVD Jon, is charged with having unlocked a code and distributed a computer programme enabling unauthorised copying of DVD movies, angering Hollywood studios who fear mass piracy and loss of vast revenues.																								The thief who breaks into his own flat is not committing any crime, Johansens lawyer, Halvor Manshaus, told the Oslo court in his closing argument of the case  seen as a battle between cyber Davids and corporate Goliaths.																								Following five days of hearings, prosecutor Inger Marie Sunde spent much of her closing argument saying that Johansen, participating in what she called gang crime, was a key player in developing the DeCSS programme.																								I think this case is about gang crime. It is beyond any doubt that there was a rivalry in developing the programme, she said. Sunde called for a suspended 90-day sentence for Johansen that could bring a maximum two years prison.

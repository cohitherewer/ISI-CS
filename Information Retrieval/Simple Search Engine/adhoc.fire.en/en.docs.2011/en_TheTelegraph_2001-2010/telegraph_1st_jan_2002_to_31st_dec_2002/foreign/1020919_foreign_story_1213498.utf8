 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 Illness comes to the aid of Nazi collaborator
 MARK JOHN				 	 French Nazi collaborator Maurice Papon in Paris on Wednesday. (Reuters) 																								Paris, Sept. 18 (Reuters): French Nazi collaborator Maurice Papon, 92, left jail today after an appeals court ruled he was too ill to serve the rest of his sentence for helping deport Jews to wartime concentration camps.																								Papon was sentenced in 1998 to 10 years in prison for complicity in crimes against humanity because of his role in 1942-1944 in organising the transport of 1,560 Jews to a Paris transit camp on the way to Auschwitz.																								Walking steadily, he emerged from a small door at Paris Sante prison to jeers from a waiting crowd, got into a car and was driven away. Stunned by the courts unexpected decision, Jewish and anti-racist groups protested loudly against the early release. Papon served only three years of his sentence, having entered prison in 1999.																								Lawyer Jean-Marc Varaut said before his release that Papon himself was surprised by the courts ruling. He didnt believe it. He didnt think the magistrates had that much independence, he told journalists.																								The appeals court ignored the public prosecutors request to keep the former Vichy official in prison because releasing him could cause public unrest. It said the medical evidence his lawyers had presented had shown he was too ill to stay in jail.																								But groups representing Jewish victims of Nazism were outraged. 																								Ive just heard this sad news and Im stunned, Michel Slitinsky, spokesman for the civil parties at Papons original trial, told Reuters.																								Justice minister Dominique Perben reminded journalists that the government had opposed the release.																								Papon, the first senior official of the collaborationist Vichy regime to be convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity, had a successful political career after the war and was Frances budget minister when his past caught up with him in 1981. 																								In May of that year, the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine published documents showing he authorised the arrest and deportation of Jews and was praised by German occupation authorities as a reliable and able collaborator.

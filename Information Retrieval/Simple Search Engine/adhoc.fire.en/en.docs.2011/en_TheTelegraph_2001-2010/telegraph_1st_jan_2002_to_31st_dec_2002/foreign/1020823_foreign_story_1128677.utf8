 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Beauty puts beau, body before crown
				 	 Katrin Wrobel after she won the Miss Germany title in  January, 2002. (Reuters)																								Berlin, Aug. 22 (Reuters): Miss Germany has broken her contract and could lose her crown because she objects to beauty contest rules banning her from marrying or posing in the nude, organisers said today.																								Ralf Klemmer, director of the Miss Germany Corporation that holds the annual pageant, said Berlin dental technician Katrin Wrobel cancelled a contract with his firm because she said it contained immoral clauses.																								The contract she and all the girls in the competition signed beforehand spelled it out quite clearly that marriage and nude photographs during the year are not allowed, Klemmer said.																								He said the rules were quite clear and Wrobel would be stripped of her Miss Germany crown if she did not relent.																								The same rules apply to the Miss competitions all around the world, added Klemmer, whose firm has organised 42 consecutive Miss Germany contests since 1960. 																								Its strange that she now rejects this. But there is no way she can compete in the Miss World competition in Nigeria if this is not resolved.																								Weve never had a case like this in 42 years, he said. If she wants to relinquish the crown then the runner-up will be awarded it. There cannot be another competition this year.																								Wrobels lawyer Christian Schertz was not immediately available for comment. 																								He was quoted in Bild newspaper today as saying Wrobel had cancelled the contract because it is filled with immoral clauses.																								A tall brunette considered a long-shot to win the German competition in January, Wrobel, 24, has since landed a job as a presenter on a German television game show. She has long lived with her boyfriend, a 29-year-old electrician.																								I only took part in the contest for some quick cash, Wrobel was quoted as telling Bild.I never thought I would have a chance of winning. ADVERTISEMENT copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved.

 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 Centre asks NTPC to add 30,000 MW in 10 years
																								New Delhi, Nov. 13 (PTI): In a bid to achieve the target of adding 1 lakh MW power generation capacity by 2012, the Centre today said that it wanted National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) to increase its quota of contribution to up to 30,000 mw instead of 20,000 mw.																								We are persuading NTPC to add between 25,000 to 30,000 MW in the next 10 years, up from the earlier target of 20,000 MW, Union power secretary R. V. Shahi said at a function organised by NTPC to induct a new batch of trainees.																								Shahi said for the Tenth Five-year Plan, the ministry has been asking NTPC to add 12,000 MW instead of 9,500 MW as decided by NTPC, adding that a final decision in this regard would be taken soon.																								Asked whether NTPC has asked for concessions in order to invest huge money to add between 25,000 MW to 30,000 MW power generation capacity, Shahi said, We are discussing various issues including a few concessions. He, however, refused to elaborate, saying things have not been finalised as yet.																								It mat be recalled that NTPC has been given the go-ahead for raising money from the capital market by way of an initial public offer (IPO) to enhance its existing equity base by upto 10 per cent in the current fiscal.																								Earlier, NTPC had made a representation to the ministry of power saying that the corporation should be exempted from paying dividend for the next few years considering the huge investments in the next 10 years.																								With the implementation of the new availability based tariffs (ABT), NTPC had estimated a fall in its revenues and its capacity to generate internal resources by nearly Rs 15,000 crore till 2012. If this scenario continues, it may become difficult to fulfil the target of adding even the original quota of 20,000 MW.																								NTPC sources said that corporation was also contemplating raising resources from overseas funding agencies but declined to give details.

Calcutta, Sept. 14: The curtains came down on one of the biggest congregations of CEOs on Saturday with the closing of Day 3 of the national management convention, organised by the All India Management Association (AIMA). The 30th national convention will be held in Delhi in September next year. 																								We reached out to maximum number of people. A galaxy of CEOs and leaders from the corporate world addressed over 800 delegates in the past three days. We are very happy with the response, said AIMA president Rajive Kaul. 																								Corporate chieftains from different sectors of India Inc  from old economy manufacturing to new economy service sector  deliberated during the three-day meet on an entire gamut of issues. The list included names like J. J. Irani, Sunil Bharti Mittal, N S Sekhsaria, Subir Raha and Deepak Parekh. 																								West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee inaugurated the event and telecom guru Sam Pitroda set the mood of the meet  How to win the new future  on Thursday. During the seven separate sessions in the past two days, the CEOs tried to work out strategies to meet the challenges facing Indian business and industry. 																								Asutosh Padhi, associate principal, McKinsey amp; Co. summed up the deliberations during the valedictory session and listed the five take aways lessons from the seminar. These included identification of threats from factors like competition from China and opening up of capital markets. 																								The service sector will be the engine of growth and there is a huge potential for domestic demand explosion, said Padhi, while highlighting the opportunities. 																								The consultants message to the corporate sector, the second take-away, was: To survive, you have to play to win. If you cannot recover cost of capital, return the money to the shareholder and pull down the shutters. 																								The other three lessons stressed the need for innovation, for recognising the inevitability of corporate social responsibility as a norm and recognising the importance of public policy changes for accelerated growth. 																								The convention ended with Kaul distributing awards to budding managers and regional management associations for their performance. AIMA vice president R Gopalakrishnan signed off the show.

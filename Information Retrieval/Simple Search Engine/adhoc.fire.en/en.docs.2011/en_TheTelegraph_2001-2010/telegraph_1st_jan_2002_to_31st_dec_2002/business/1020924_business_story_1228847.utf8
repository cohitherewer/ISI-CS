 Tuesday, September 24, 2002 				 Procter wants Nivea in its make-up kit
																								Frankfurt, Sept. 23 (Reuters): US consumer products giant Procter amp; Gamble is in talks with Allianz AG to buy the insurers 43.6 per cent stake in Beiersdorf, maker of Nivea skin products, the Financial Times reported on Monday. 																								The newspaper cited industry sources as saying Procter amp; Gamble had already approached the German insurer and that an offer would follow within the next few days. 																								Allianz wants to sell its stake in Beiersdorf, which owns the highly successful Nivea skin care range and Elastoplast brand, as part of its strategy of disposing of substantial industrial holdings. Its stake is worth about 3.2 billion euros ($ 3.14 billion) at Fridays closing price of 86 euros. Beiersdorfs market capitalisation is 7.2 billion euros.																								Under German take-over law, P amp;G would have to make an offer to all Beiersdorf shareholders, including family-owned Tchibo Holding, if it bought Allianzs stake. 																								Tchibo, a coffee and retail group rich with cash after selling German tobacco company Reemtsma earlier this year to Imperial Tobacco, has also talked to Allianz about buying its stake, industry sources said. Tchibo, which owns about 30 per cent of Beiersdorf, would not have to make a full bid for the company if it increased its stake. It has said it would be open to a deal whereby part of Allianzs stake would be floated. 																								That would increase Beiersdorfs free-float and increase its chances of promotion to the blue-chip DAX index but could be embarrassing to Allianz, which bought more shares at the start of the year with a view to strengthening its hand in any talks on a change of ownership. 																								Beiersdorf shares have fallen about 40 per cent since hitting a record high of 144 euros in February. 																								Tchibo chief executive Reinhardt Poellath said last month he wanted an agreement with Allianz by the end of the year. 																								P amp;G and Frances LOreal have a strategic interest and the financial clout to carry off a take-over but were put off earlier this year by the price Allianz was demanding and the chance that Tchibo may remain as a minority shareholder. Sources have also said that Beiersdorf management may oppose a take-over by LOreal or P amp;G.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 23: The third review committee of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) today submitted its report to the government in which it suggested ways to streamline the functioning of the institute and increase commercial revenue generation.																								The report was submitted by Prof C.N.R. Rao, who headed the review committee, to Vijay Goel, minister of state in the Prime Minsiters Office and statistics and programme implementation.																								The suggestions included assigning an enhanced and pivotal role to ISI in upgrading the quality of data generated by various ministries of the Central and state governments. It also suggests that the institute should be assigned the task of developing sample survey methodology. 																								The committee also recommended that the statistical quality control and operational research division of the institute should be rationalised and enlarged to cover all high quality statistical applications in demand from industry and the service sector. The objective has to be pioneering research for solving problems.																								The committee also suggested that a long-term plan should be chalked out for the institute, including a 15-year vision document and 10-year perspective plan, indicating the direction of research, teaching activities and supportive infrastructure development. 																								The third review committee was set up in November last year to look into the multi-disciplinary scientific activities of the institute. The committee also wanted to exploit the possible synergies from diverse areas of available expertise (both within and outside ISI).

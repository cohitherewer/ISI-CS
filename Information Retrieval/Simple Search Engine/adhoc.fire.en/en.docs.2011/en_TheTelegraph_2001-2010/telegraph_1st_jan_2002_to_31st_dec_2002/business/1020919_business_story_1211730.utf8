Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Sept. 18: Hewlett-Packard India (HP) has registered a 20 to 25 per cent rise in sales of storage products in the eastern region over last year. The company has also developed a strategy to cater to the growing storage needs of sectors like software, telecom and steel plants in the region.																								The plans for consolidation include strengthening its channel partner network in the region, which covers both resellers for focussed engagement with customers and wholesalers for better distribution, marketing manager, network storage solutions Avijit Basu said. 																								Over the past few years, there has been a 70 to 75 per cent growth in storage requirements across the country. H-P is mainly focussing on the telecom, petroleum, financial institutions and banking and extended manufacturing sectors in India, he said. We expect to grow in tune with the industry. H-P commands a 20 per cent market share of the storage market.																								The complexity of the networked storage environmentcombined with limited financial resources and human resourceshas made it even more difficult to address storage challenges, explains Basu. As a leading networked storage solution provider, H-P meets the needs of its customers through a holistic approach that focuses on technical innovation, heterogeneous solutions and stress-free storage devices.																								The company has introduced additions to its storage solutions portfolio with products that increase storage efficiency and optimise performance, availability and scalability.

 Saturday, September 28, 2002 				 Truckers to go on strike from Nov 15
																								New Delhi, Sept. 27 (PTI): Truckers and commercial road transport operators will go on an indefinite strike from November 15 in protest against hike in insurance premium and imposition of toll tax on existing roads.																								All india motor transport congress (AIMTC), a representative body of 28 lakh truckers in the country, said the imposition of toll tax on roads in the name of completing the National Highway Development Project (NHDP) was unjustified as the government was already charging Re 1 per litre cess on petrol and diesel for the same purpose.																								Besides, we are paying road tax for the very same purpose, AIMTC secretary general J.M. Saksena told reporters here.																								Motor transport industry, he said, was in recession with 26 per ent idle capacity. Compounding the woes was the periodic hike in diesel prices.																								Due to these increases, the operating cost of truck has substantially gone up whereas the freight rates have remained static or even gone down in many sectors, he said.																								Levy of toll over and above the existing taxes/cess on truckers lacks justification and fair play. However, still, if the government needs more resources for road network then the toll should be levied on end-user i.e. toll on freight charges for goods transports to different destination, Saksena said.																								He said motor insurance corporations have also increased monthly insurance premium in the range of Rs 95 to Rs 185 which was putting pressure on margins.																								Unless these issues are resolved, truckers will strike work, he added.

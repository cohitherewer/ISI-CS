 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 Boost for hydro electricity
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: The government plans to give a thrust to hydropower generation during the Tenth Five Year Plan period. 																								Speaking at the World Economic Forum summit, power secretary R. V. Shahi said the government is committed to attain the 41,000 MW target for power generation during the period. He asserted it is achievable. 																								Special emphasis would be given to the hydropower sector as its share in total power generation has come down from 45 per cent to 24 per cent over the last few decades, he added. 																								 We have developed a scheme to boost hydropower to 27 per cent of the total electricity generated by next year, Shahi said. 																								Emphasising the need to look at alternative source of energy and reduce dependence on oil and gas, N. K. Singh, member Planning Commission, said, solar and wind energy should be examined with more interest by the power ministry. Also nuclear power needs to be tapped intensely. 																								In India, we are yet to reach a stage where nuclear power is an important component of energy sector. This is an issue that has to be explored. There needs to be a paradigm shift in the power sector, Singh said.																								The plan panel member also called for speedy clearance of the Electricity Bill which is pending before Parliament. Recently, the Standing Committee has returned the Bill to the power ministry with its recommendation.

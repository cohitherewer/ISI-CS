 Tuesday, September 24, 2002 				 JD Power rating pat for Yamaha, Honda
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 23: The JD Power study for two-wheelers is out and the winners are: Yamahas RXZ, the best motorcycle and Honda Motorcycle and Scooters Activa, the best scooter. The study, based on the promised performance monitor (PPM) index, was carried out by Metric Consultancy Limited.																								The PPM indexa universally accepted indicator of product qualityreflects the number of problems reported by every 100 users in the first three months of use.																								The study reveals that the average PPM index for the two-wheeler industry in India is 248 problems per 100 vehicles, a lot worse than the 2001 average of 196. This is either an indicator of falling standards or greater consumer awareness.																								The pecking order for motorcycles was: Yamaha RXZ with 112 problems for every 100 vehicles, followed by Hero Honda CD-100 DLX (153), Yamaha YBX-125 (167), TVS Fiero (171) and TVS Samurai (174).																								Hero Hondas latest launchDawntrailed in seventh place with 188 part problems per 100 vehicles. The category average for motorcycles was 248 complaints, up from 196 complaints last year.																								Most surprisingly among the 16 models of motorcycle that are above the average rate of problems does not include the best-selling model Splendor from the Hero Honda stable.																								The increase in the number of defects in the category may very well be due to awareness among Indian customers. Likewise, it may not be due to bad performance that Splendor has been left out, but in all probability it is too old a model to be remembered, the study observed.																								In the scooter category, Activa from the Honda stable topped the charts with 129 problems for every 100 vehicles. It was followed by Bajaj Safire (170), Bajaj Chetak (227), LML Select II (237) and Kinetic ZX Zoom (239). The average for the scooter category was 239.																								In the step-thru category, Hero Honda Street Smart was the best choice, whereas in the moped segment, TVS registered a clean sweep with both Scooty and TVS 50 beating all the other competitors.																								The study pointed out that the largest problem areas in the two-wheeler segment are the engine and transmission, which comprise 49 per cent problems. Locks, control knobs and lights account for 15 per cent of the problems, while 13 per cent involves silencers and shock absorbers. Dashboards and handle accounts for the 14 per cent of the total problems encountered in two-wheelers.

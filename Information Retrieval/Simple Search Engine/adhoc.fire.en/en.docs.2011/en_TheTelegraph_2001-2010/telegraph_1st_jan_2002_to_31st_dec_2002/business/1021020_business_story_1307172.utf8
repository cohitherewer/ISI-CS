 Sunday, October 20, 2002  Business Briefs																								 Calcutta, Oct. 19: Labour trouble has again stopped work at the Garden Reach factory of Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL). Nearly 1,200 permanent workers stopped work today alleging violation of terms of service and standing orders, Hindustan Lever Sramik Karmachari Congress said in a statement. HLL management, however, refuted the allegation. A company spokesman said, there was no violation of any agreement and permanent workmen were called upon to do some work inside the factory in a condition of exigency in the interest of the factory and the workmen themselves. But the employees union said that the workers move to resort to cease work was because the management directed permanent workmen to do the job of contract labours. Work at the HLL plant had been affected since October 10 due to a bonus dispute between the contract labourers and their contractors.

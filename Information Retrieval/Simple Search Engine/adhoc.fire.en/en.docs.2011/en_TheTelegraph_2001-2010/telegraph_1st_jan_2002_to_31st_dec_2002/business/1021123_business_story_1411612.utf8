 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 The Radisson hotel in Varanasi																								New Delhi, Nov. 22: Carlson Hospitality Worldwide, owners of the Radisson Hotels and Resorts, is planning to take its hospitality brand to the secondary cities in the country. 																								After establishing its presence in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore, Carlson is ready to go to places like Noida, Guwahati, Shillong, Kanpur, Agra and Lucknow. A Radisson is due to open shortly in Hyderabad.																								K.B. Kachru, senior vice president of Carlson Hospitality India, said: These cities are very attractive to foreign tourists due to their rich cultural heritage and they really lack world class hospitality. Our aim is to cover all these places. Varanasi is the first step to this venture.																								The hotel has been promoted by Bhadohi Hotels Ltd, a joint venture between Khan Group of Industries and Unitech. It is managed by Radisson Hospitality Worldwide Hotel Management Services, a joint venture between Radisson Hotels, USA, and Unitech Ltd. Bhadohi Hotels will invest Rs 35 crore for the 80-room hotel. Under this banner, Radisson hotels in Lucknow, Agra and Kanpur will be built.																								This will be the sixth Radisson in India. The next will be coming up in Noida and others will follow soon. Our target is to open up 18 Radissons by 2005. Some of the constructions have started and others are on the drawing board. But we will meet our target very soon, said Kachru.

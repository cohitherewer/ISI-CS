 Friday, October 25, 2002 				 Rahman tunes for AirTel users
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 24: AirTel, the cellular mobile service from Bharti, today launched five original ring tones composed exclusively for its customers by A. R. Rahman, the well-known music composer. 																								The original ring tones will be available to more than 2.3 million AirTel customers.																								Bharti director (marketing and corporate communications Hemant Sachdev said, This is the first time that a world renowned music composer also known as the Mozart of the East has composed original ring tones for any mobile operator anywhere in India and perhaps even in the world. These original ring tones are yet another exclusive benefit for our AirTel customers. These ring tones attempt to bring to life the brand promise of Live every moment and are in line with our strategic effort to build an AirTel community.																								The ring tones can be downloaded in a few simple steps. One has to choose messages on the handset menu and write a new message. 																								The message should be keyed in as tone, a single space, a tone name (for example Dream), another single space followed by the brand name of handset being used by the customer or short handset code (for example NOK for Nokia) and finally sent to 500. 																								The customer will receive ring tone as a message from 500. He has to save the message to complete the download.																								A. R. Rahman said in a statement, Creating these ring tones for AirTel has been an enjoyable experience for me and I do hope that AirTel customers will Live every moment with these ring tones.																								Each ring tone had been created with a unique character. While the tones Dream and Desire are variations of the original score composed by A. R. Rahman for AirTels new campaign, the tones Buddy, Sizzle and Little One are aimed at the youth and family. 																								AirTel recently unveiled its brand campaign roping in A. R. Rahman. This is Rahmans first association with any brand anywhere in the world.																								The Rahman campaign is part of a comprehensive brand-building programme. Bharti recently unveiled AirTels brand identity built on the earlier positioning of Touch tomorrow, injected with renewed energy and heightened optimism.																								These Rahman tones bear the signature of the maestro, known for his inimitable style and brilliant innovative compositions, said Sachdev.

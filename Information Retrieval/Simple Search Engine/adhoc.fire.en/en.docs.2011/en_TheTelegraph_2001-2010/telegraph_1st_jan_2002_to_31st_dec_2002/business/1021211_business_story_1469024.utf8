 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 Govt tables demand for additional grants
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 10: The government today tabled in Parliament Rs 9,045 crore supplementary demands for grants for this fiscal which includes provision of Rs 1,949 crore bailout to UTI and Rs 3,806 crore for providing foodgrains under various schemes in drought-hit areas.																								 The Rs 1,949 crore bailout to UTI would comprise Rs 438 crore for meeting shortfall under US-64 and Rs 1,511 crore shortfall under the assured return schemes, the second batch of supplementary demands for grants, said.																								 Comprising 37 grants for various ministries, the supplementary demands for grants tabled in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha would involve a cash outgo of only Rs 5,032 crore as the remaining Rs 4,013 crore would be matched by savings.																								 The increased expenditure of Rs 3,806 crore provided to rural development ministry would be for meeting additional requirements for supply of foodgrains under Sampoorna Gramin Rojgar Yojana and food for work programme particularly in the drought affected states. The grants also provide Rs 500 crore for ways and means advances to state governments facing financial crunch. As these were recoverable in the same fiscal, there would be no cash outgo.																								Meanwhile, the government assured that it will take effective steps to revive sick industries, check cheap imports and illegal trade as the Rajya Sabha today passed a Bill seeking creation of a revival fund and national company law tribunal. The basic intention of creating the company law tribunal is to replace Sick Industrial Companies Act which now rests with the BIFR.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 Hard choice for Calcutta techie
 M RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Sept.19: Only emotions attract this IT professional to Calcutta not its infrastructure.																								Infowavz, a premium call centre company that offers customer support, sales and business process management services for global companies like Microsoft and AT amp;T, is led by a passionate Calcuttan, Zia Sheikh, who is the chief executive officer of the company which is having to make a tough choice between Calcutta and Hyderabad to set up its office. It seems that Hyderabad may get the opportunity to play hosts to the company that recently received $ 5 million in funding from ICICI Venture and that supports several Fortune 100 companies like AT amp;T and Microsoft.																								Its a clear toss up between superior infrastructure and passion for the city and the decision will be taken in next few weeks.																								I am passionate about the city and Calcutta is top on my list but we are also exploring Hyderabad. It has a good infrastructure and it is very critical for the quality of service we offer, says Zia Sheikh, who graduated from St. Xaviers College, Calcutta.																								Infowavz currently supports several Fortune 100 companies from its state-of-the-art multi-channel facility in Mumbai with client services offices in London, Toronto and Los Angeles. 																								Leveraging its international partnership network, Infowavz offers multi-location services from over 80 global facilities for clients interested in multi-site disaster recovery or multi-lingual support.																								We plan to use the funds that we have received towards expanding infrastructure in India and overseas. In India, the size of operations is being increased from 300 seats to 500 seats within the next few months,  said Sheikh.

 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Oct. 18: Bluecurve from the Linux stable moves into India to capture the desktop segment hitherto monopolised by Windows from Microsoft.																								Red Hat, the providers of open source technologies, including Linux, will launch Red Hat Linux 8.0, also known as Bluecurve, to capture the desktop market in India.																								Linux was created in 1991 by the then college student Linus Torvalds. He wanted to create an operating system for his own use based on expensive, proprietary Unix. He made the new operating system (OS) available on the internet with the source code, and protected it with a special licence that allowed others to improve the software as long as the code remained visible and modifiable. In other words, open.																								As the demand for Linux grew, Red Hat and other companies began selling a packaged version of the OS, including documentation and support.																								The move by Red Hat to enter the desk top segment in India and worldwide is a first serious initiative. The company expects to capture 10 per cent marketshare in the Indian PC segment through its product.

Red Hat Linux 8.0 is the perfect choice for small businesses and enthusiasts looking for a reliable, easy-to-use operating system with the latest productivity applications. Linux has been growing phenomenally in the last few years. The Indian governments decision to promote Linux as a platform of choice is a major shot in the arm, added Tapia.																								Key features of the latest release will have, user-friendly desktop with numerous graphical enhancements and icons, tools to set up configurations for several system services and settings, including firewall, peripherals, Apache, Samba, and small network settings.																								It will also offer personal firewall tool and graphical tool to easily customise your security settings. The product also comes with a new accessibility features like graphic user interface (GUI) support for braille and mobility-limited language interfaces.																								We are also in process of localising the product in Hindi. This will help us to expand our reach in the Indian market. Initially we will be targetting the educational and government institutions and research institutes. The product will be available off the shelf and can be customised to the needs of the user, said Tapia.

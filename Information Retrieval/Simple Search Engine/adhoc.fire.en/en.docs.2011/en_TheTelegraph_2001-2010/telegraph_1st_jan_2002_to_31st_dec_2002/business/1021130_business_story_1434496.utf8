 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Team LG seeks to cash in on World Cup frenzy
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: It is cricket first!																								Sourav Ganguly is spared from shooting for the ad-campaign for the product he is endorsing and asked to concentrate on net practice.																								Carl Hooper calmly informs his sponsor that he is unable to come for the opening of the showroom because of a team meeting. And Sanath Jaisurya requests Ravi Shastri to represent him in the commercial programme as he wants to carry on at the nets.																								No thats not real life, its reel life. 																								All this is happening in the 22 commercials of LG Electronics that features the 14 captains playing the World cup, besides Ravi Shastri. The commercials will be aired from December 1.																								LG Electronics India is all ready to cash in on the passion for cricket by launching a Rs 40-crore ad campaign.																								Cricket First campaign will show the interest of cricket and not LG. We have seen the passion in India for this game and want to promote this image, said Ganesh Mahalingam, LGs marketing head.																								The budget of Rs 40 crore for this ad blitz is flexible. If required we can increase it to Rs 50 crore. In the World Cup, we have an understanding of $ 30 million only for media sponsorship. Around 2,000 customers of LG products will have the opportunity to see the World Cup games live, he added.																								Apart from Ganguly, Shaun Pollock of South Africa, Waqar Younis of Pakistan, Stephen Fleming of New Zealand, Ricky Ponting of Australia, Sanath Jaisurya of Sri Lanka, Heath Streak of Zimbabwe, Steve Tikolo of Kenya, Ronald Lefebvre of Holland, Carl Hooper of West Indies, Nasser Hussain of England, Khalid Mohammad of Bangladesh, Deone Koetze of Namibia and Joe Harris of Canada will be the brand ambassadors of LG. 																								LG is targeting a Rs 3,000-crore turnover in 2002 and a Rs 4,500-crore turnover in the coming fiscal with the World Cup campaign kicking off, said the marketing chief.

Total income (net of excise) increased to Rs 1,089.77 crore, from Rs 961.51 crore in the second quarter last year.

Its income in the quarter at Rs 131.07 crore was 2.5 per cent lower than last year. CMC posted a net profit of Rs 5.2 crore during the quarter.

Aptech net at Rs 2.34 crore																								IT education company Aptech Ltd has posted a net profit at Rs 2.34 crore for the second quarter ended September 30.																								The companys income from operations for the reporting quarter stood at Rs 41.11 crore, Aptech Ltd said in a release here today.

PNB Gilts net up 80%																								PNB Gilts today announced a 80 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 30.01 crore during the second quarter of this fiscal as against Rs 16.63 crore during July-September 2001. Total income surged by 43 per cent to Rs 60.16 crore during the second quarter from Rs 42.10 crore during the year-ago period.																								This impressive performance is the result of dropping of non-SLR yields to all time low levels, along with the increased focus on the relationship based business with mid-segment like cooperatives, banks, regional rural banks, provident funds, private sector insurance companies, corporates and trusts, managing director Arun Kaul said.

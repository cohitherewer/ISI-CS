 Friday, December 06, 2002 				 Hyundai to roll out new range next year
 SHASHWATI GHOSH				 	 going full throttle																								New Delhi, Dec. 5: Hyundai Motors India Ltd plans to start production of a range of new vehicles next year: a sports-utility vehicle, a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), and a model in the sub-premium segment positioned between mid-size and premium sedans.																								Earlier, the company had decided to import the full range of vehicles as completely built units (CBUs), but changed its plans owing to the increasing competition. 																								The Terracanthe SUV lined up for launchwill be assembled within a month of its launch as a CBU. In the MPV, the company has chosen to launch the Caren.																								In the sub-premium segment, Hyundai is more inclined to launch the Elantra than the Matrix (another model which has been under consideration) because it is closer to Skoda Indias Octavia, the only sedan present in the sub-premium segment. Incidentally, Toyota is planning to enter this niche segment with its hugely popular model, the Corolla.																								We are at the moment adding on to the manufacturing line to raise production from 12 lakh vehicles per annum to 1.5 lakh vehicles. But this is for the vehicles we are already producing, Bong Gou Lee, HMILs executive director, marketing and sales said.																								To add new vehicles to our production list we will have to set up a different production line. Hyundai has around 500 acres of land so it will not be a problem. In an assembly line production, it is not possible to change the dies for every other car. So a new line is necessary, he added. Hyundai has already announced a further investment of $ 350 million that will be used to fund the expansion of the Santro and the launch of the new range of vehicles.

 Monday, September 09, 2002 				 Haldia Petro decision in two months, says Buddha
																								Howrah, Sept. 8 (PTI): West Bengal chief minister Buddhadev Bhattacharjee today said the state government will take the final decision on who will hold the reins of Haldia Petrochemicals in one or two months.																								HPL is a big asset for the state and many parties are seeking management control in it. But we will take the final decision on the issue in another one or two months, Bhattacharjee said while inaugurating the plastic processing unit of Raunaq Plastics Ltd at Uluberia in Howrah district.																								He said despite many rumours regarding the fate of HPL, it turned out to be a milestone for the state and helped expedite the governments industrialisation move. 																								A total of 516 industrial units were set up in Bengal after HPL started functioning in 2000 and HPL also provided bright prospects for the states plastic and chemical sector, the chief minister said.																								Referring to Howrah district, Bhattacharjee said initiatives were taken to build a complex of rubber, foundry, agri-products and hosiery units. 																								He said a large number of small and medium units had already been set up in the district in last few years following improvement of roads, like the national highway number six. Managing director of Raunaq Plastics Ltd Deepak Himmatramka said his unit would work in co-ordination with HPL as its downstream project.																								The new plastic processing unit would produce water tank, container, door and window frames, he said.																								Local MP Hannan Mollah referred to the recent closure of a few units of Uluberia Silpa Bikas Kendra and requested the CM to look into the issue.

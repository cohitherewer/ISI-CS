 Tuesday, October 01, 2002 				 Japan bid to clean up sick banks
 							 - Economics minister named top financial regulator LINDA SIEG				 	 Takenaka: Taking centre stage (AFP )																								Tokyo, Sept 30 (Reuters): Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Monday tapped his pro-reform economics minister, Heizo Takenaka, to become the governments top financial regulator in a move that boosted hopes of a banking sector clean-up.																								Takenaka, who retained his economics brief in a Cabinet reshuffle, takes over the financial services portfolio from Hakuo Yanagisawa, who had been widely seen as an obstacle to aggressive government action to clean up Japans ailing banks.																								Takenaka had clashed with Yanagisawa over the latters opposition to a controversial infusion of public funds to help banks clean up the massive bad loans that have cluttered their balance sheets for more than a decade, stalling economic growth.																								Speaking after his appointment was announced, though, Takenaka took a cautious line.																								A public fund injection would not be a target in itself but one possible result, he told a brief news conference.																								I would like to look at all available options and think of the best way, said Takenaka.																								Koizumi had been under pressure from anti-reformers in his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to make appointments that would boost their clout, but a rise in his popularity ratings to nearly 70 per cent after a recent high-profile North Korean summit had bolstered the Prime Ministers ability to fend them off.																								News of Takenakas appointment sparked a rebound in Tokyo share prices, boosted the yen and prompted a fall in government bond prices as investors bet strong reform might now materialise.																								I think that (Takenakas appointment) is excellent news for the (equities) market. Of all the Cabinet people, Takenaka has the most aggressive policy on sorting out the banks problems, said Garry Evans, a strategist at HSBC Securities in Tokyo.																								Koizumi also reappointed finance minister Masajuro Shiokawa, an octogenarian lawmaker prone to verbal gaffes who has come out in favour of public fund injections if needed, to help banks maintain adequate capital as they write off bad loans.																								Speculation that Yanagisawa would be replaced had been followed by talk of a deal that would let him stay, so Koizumis decision to hand Takenaka the post seemed a bolt from the blue.																								I think its a complete victory for reformers, said Fiachra MacCana, head of research at West LB Securities in Tokyo.																								Sceptics still wonder if Takenaka, an academic with no firm political base, can match bold proposals with action.																								It shows Mr Koizumi has a strong will to make changes or to take more proactive action, said Naoko Nemoto, banking sector analyst at Standard amp; Poors international credit rating agency.																								But she added: I have some concern about (Takenakas) leadership, his real ability to make changes.																								Hes not at all supported by the financial community or businessmen, so its very challenging, Nemoto said.																								Unanswered questions																								Bankers, who say they neither need nor want public money, were clearly not happy to see Takenaka take over.																								Im terribly disappointed, said an official at one of Japans four megabanks.																								Bankers wanted someone who understood that ending deflation was the priority for solving the bad loan problem, but Takenaka has been calling for public injections, so its a double shock.																								Japans big banks fear public fund injections would increase government interference and even threaten executives jobs.																								As financial markets applauded, some experts turned their attention to what happens nextwhether, for example, deadbeat debtor firms would be closed down if the government gets tougher on bad loans.																								Nonetheless, hopes are high that the hard political decisions will be made. Its not going to be easy, but it is clear that they are gearing up to do what needs to be done to solve the problem, said one Western political analyst.																								Economic uncertainty 																								Japans economy, the worlds second largest, has been mired in the doldrums for a decade and industrial production data released on Monday underscored the uncertain outlook.																								The government said industrial output rose 1.6 per cent in August from July, but that was well below a consensus forecast of a 3.0 per cent rise in a Reuters poll of 18 economists.

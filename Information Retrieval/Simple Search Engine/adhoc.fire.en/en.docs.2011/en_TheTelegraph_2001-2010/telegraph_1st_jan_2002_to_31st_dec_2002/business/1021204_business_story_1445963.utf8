The capital adequacy has been achieved without raising any equity or Tier-II bond.																								The net non-performing asset of the bank is down from 10.2 per cent to 7.6 per cent. The bank has been able to recover Rs 40 crore in the first six months as against Rs 34 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. UBI has made a fresh accretion of NPAs to the tune of Rs 20 crore as against Rs 50 crore in the previous year.

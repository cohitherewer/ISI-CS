 Friday, October 04, 2002 				 Police stalk DSQ promoter 
																								Calcutta, Oct. 3: The Calcutta Police are in hot pursuit of Dinesh Dalmia, managing director and promoter of DSQ Software. 																								DC (DD-I) Soumen Mitra said the police had sought the chief metropolitan magistrates permission to issue an arrest warrant.																								Dalmia, who was based in Calcutta until a few years ago, lives in Chennai now. Though Mitra said he was absconding, relatives said he was still at home.																								He is wanted for connections with Harish Chandra Biyani. Dalmia had offered to bail Biyani out when he failed to fulfil payment obligations to the Calcutta Stock Exchange.																								Biyani had obtained shares of DSQ Software from Dalmia, and had given them to the exchange for recovery of his dues. But it was later found that the shares had been issued illegally. Besides Dalmia, the police are said to be looking for his aides in Calcutta.

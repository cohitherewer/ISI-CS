 Saturday, October 26, 2002 				 Cetma yardstick for brand leaders
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 25: The Consumer Electronics and TV Manufacturers Association (Cetma) is planning to furnish monthly industry data to end bitter corporate wars over conflicting claims for the slot of the market leader. 																								We are appointing a market intelligence group to prepare monthly data according to products such as 14, 22 or higher category projection TVs. 																								But to avoid any misunderstanding over short term data, brand-wise figures will be provided only once every six months in a joint venture with ORG, said Rajeev Karwal, Cetma president and Philips vice-president (marketing).																								Recently, the industry witnessed a major row between LG and BPL, both of whom claimed the number one position. BPL, citing ORG figures that vouched for its sales of 3,38,000 units, claimed a 17.2 per cent share of the colour television market. LG, on the other hand, claimed an around 18 per cent market share with sales of 6.5 lakh television sets.

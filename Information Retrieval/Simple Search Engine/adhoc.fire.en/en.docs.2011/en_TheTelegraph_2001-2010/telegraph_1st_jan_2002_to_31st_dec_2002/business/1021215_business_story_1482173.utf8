 Sunday, December 15, 2002 				 Fiat retains chairman, names joint CEO
 JOHN TAGLIABUE																								Paris, Dec. 14: Ending a bitter week-long struggle for control of Fiat, the companys board on Friday retained Paolo Fresco as chairman and joint chief executive and promoted the chief operating officer, Alessandro Barberis, to join him in the chief executives job.																								Barberis, 65, ran the Piaggio Motor Scooter Company, which is also controlled by the Agnelli family of Fiat, before joining Fiat in June. He succeeds Gabriele Galateri di Genola, who announced his resignation on Tuesday.																								Fresco held his seat thanks to Fiats powerful creditor banks, but also its patriarch, Gianni Agnelli. Agnelli chose Fresco three years ago to transform Fiat into a modern conglomerate. Together they turned back a quiet conspiracy that included Agnellis younger brother, Umberto, to oust Fresco and change Fiats management.																								In some ways, the attack on Fresco was similar to others elsewhere in Europe that have ousted executives who failed to stanch losses at unprofitable units. 																								In his three years at the helm, Fresco pushed Fiat into new businesses and expanded others, but he neglected the main auto unit and amassed a $ 33 billion debt load that forced Fiat to reach a $ 2.8 billion agreement in May with creditor banks to stay afloat.																								But Fresco was also in the sights of the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was eager to assuage Italians frightened by widespread layoffs at Fiat. 																								The government gained the backing of Umberto Agnelli, who feared the banks. If Fiat failed to turn around, the banks could exchange their loans for equity, effectively replacing the Agnellis as Fiats main shareholders.																								over.																								considered																								close																								Social																								at																								Umberto																								rules																								Italys																								from																								wants																								the					 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

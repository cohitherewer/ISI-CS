 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug 30: The Indian software industry will have to innovate, and innovate continuously to emerge as a leader in the software engineering sector and retain its cutting edge among software developing countries.																								At an Infosys organised brainstorming held at Bangalore and webcast worldwide on the issue of Software engineering: How India can lead, the panelists consisting of academia and industry stressed the need for innovation in software engineering. Both, representatives from academia and industry agreed that innovation in software engineering in India has been traditionally centred on developing utilities for humans. In order to become a leader in software engineering, work has to be focused on development technology savy processes.																								According to Deependra Moitra, general manager (engineering) at Lucent Technologies Ltd and member of IEE Software Education Board, We (software companies) are waiting for the opportunities from other countries to develop products so that we can build software. This is not the way to become a leader. We have to create opportunities through innovation that will help bring more business.

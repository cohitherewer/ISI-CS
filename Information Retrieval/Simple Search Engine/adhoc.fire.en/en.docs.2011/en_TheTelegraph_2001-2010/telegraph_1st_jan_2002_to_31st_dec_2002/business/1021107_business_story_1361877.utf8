 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 Vodafone renews bid for Cegetel stake
																								London, Nov. 6 (AFP): Vodafone Group is renewing its 6.77 billion euro cash offer for media giant Vivendi Universals 44 per cent stake in Frances Cegetel, less than a week after the offer was withdrawn.																								Vodafone said its new offer came after it reached an agreement with its fellow Cegetel shareholders  Vivendi, BT and SBC Communications  that Vivendi may exercise its pre-emption rights over Vodafones acquisition of BTs and SBCs interests in Cegetel, between November 21 and December 10.																								Vodafone is offering to pay $ 6.74 billion for Vivendi Universals stake in Cegetel  the same terms as its previous offer made on October 16 and which last week lapsed without being accepted.																								Vodafone chief executive Christopher Gent said: We have renewed our offer because we continue to believe that Vodafone is the natural home for Cegetel and that it would be in the best interests of all parties.																								Vodafone, the worlds largest mobile telephone operator, already owns 32 per cent of SFR, Cegetels profit-making mobile phone arm.

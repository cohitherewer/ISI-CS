The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, December 16, 2002 				 Symantec zooms in on India
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Dec. 15: Symantec, the US based integrated security solutions company, has identified India and China as the two countries that will drive growth in the Asia-Pacific region. 																								The $ 1,071.4-million company commands a 20 per cent share of the global internet security market and has operations in 38 countries.																								Security is a growing concern for companies all over the world. In India, the issue is gaining importance, which is evident from the fact that we have around 1,000 companies in the country who use our products, Symantec Indias country manager Joy Ghosh said. 																								The company entered the Indian market in 1999 and has witnessed a 300 per cent growth since then. There are also plans to set up a sales and support office in Delhi. Symantec has 17 authorised value-added resellers who address enterprise needs and 30 resellers who operate in the consumer market.																								We have entered into partnerships with major Indian players like Wipro, HCL and Zenith to market our products, said Ghosh.																								Ghosh also added that the major revenues would be generated from government and public sector units and the banking and financial sectors. 																								Ideally companies should spend at least 10 per cent of their IT budgets on security, he added. 																								With threats to information systems coming from all sides and growing in number and complexity, customers should know that strengthening the perimeters is not enough.																								Further, he expressed concern regarding pirated and unlicensed products that adversely affected revenues. According to Nasscom, almost 60 per cent of the software in India is pirated or dubious. 																								However, with the business process outsourcing (BPO) and telecom sectors expected to see a boom in the next few years, Symantec is optimistic of the growth prospects in the country.

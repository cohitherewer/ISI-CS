 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 Breather for Vivendi
																								Paris, Sept. 18 (AFP): Cash-strapped French media conglomerate Vivendi Universal said today it had received a bank credit worth $ 2.9 billion.																								The announcement followed a report earlier in the day in the newspaper Liberation, which said Vivendis creditor banks had closely scrutinised Vivendis accounts and had sought assurances that a project to shed assets worth 10 billion euros, as announced by chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou, was underway.																								Fourtou replaced Jean-Marie Messier in July and immediately vowed to pare down operations at the sprawling conglomerate and to secure bank credit to overcome a cash crunch.																								Messier was replaced after Vivendi ran up overall debts of 35 billion euros stemming from an ambitious investment and acquisitions strategy.

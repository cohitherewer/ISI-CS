 Sunday, September 08, 2002 				 Hero Honda eyes 50% market 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 7: Hero Honda plans to achieve a 50 per cent market share this fiscal, riding high on the success of Ambition. The company hopes to sell about 10,000 Ambitions per month. At present, Hero Hondas market share has dropped to 45 per cent from 48 per cent. 																								The company has also invested Rs 100 crore in its two plants to raise total capacity to 2 million bikes without the addition of a third plant. Pawan Kant Munjal, managing director, Hero Honda Motors, said, There is a technological study going on with Honda technicians to augment the capacity of the existing plants. The two million capacity will take care of the demand till end of 2003. By then we should be ready for the third plant for which the feasibility study is still on.																								The Ambition, priced at Rs 44,612 (ex-showroom Delhi), competes well with 110-cc bikes which sell for about Rs 41,000-Rs 42,000. Hero Honda has also broken the boxy front look that was its trademark and come up with a round headlight topped with a regal crest and an all-new console. The 133-cc engine provides an 11 bhp thrust, which has been kept low in order to accommodate the fuel efficiency clause. The bike accelerates from 0-60 kmph in only 6 seconds.																								Atul Sobti, senior vice-president (marketing and sales), said, The bike positioned in the price category of 125-cc motorcycles, has a perfect blend of power acceleration and fuel efficiency.

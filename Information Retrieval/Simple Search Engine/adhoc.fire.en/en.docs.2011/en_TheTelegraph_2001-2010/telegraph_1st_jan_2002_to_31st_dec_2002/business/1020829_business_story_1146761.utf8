 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: Aptech, the IT education service provider, has formed an academic alliance with the Australia-based Southern Cross University (SCU). As part of the MoU, current and prospective Aptech students can obtain a Bachelors degree in applied computing of SCU from select Aptech centres in India itself. 																								Pramod Khera, managing director of Aptech Training Ltd, said, This global alliance with SCU is already operational in around 20 countries such as Nigeria, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Fiji, Sri Lanka and China. We are training over 1,000 students world-wide. We aim to train 500 students in select metros in India in the first phase.																								Under this offshore programme, as part of the three year stint at Aptech, students can study Aptechs ACCP World Programme simultaneously with the curriculum from Southern Cross University, he added.																								V. Balasubramanian, who has recently been appointed as the executive director on the Aptech board, said, The students will have an added advantage of completing the course in three years as compared to other four-year degree programmes. At the end of three years, they will have dual certificates from Aptech and SCU, Australia. With this course, students will have the advantage of pursuing two world class curricula and attain international certification.																								The ACCP World Programme curriculum earns the student 16 credits. The remaining eight credits can be acquired on completion of eight SCU modules, which are to be studied concurrently with the ACCP World Program curriculum. On completion of a total of 24 credits, the student is eligible to a full-fledged Bachelor of applied computing degree from Southern Cross University, Australia.																								To get admission to the degree course students must be above 17 years of age, have completed 12 years of formal education, and gain an IELTS score of 6 overall with no band less than 5.5.

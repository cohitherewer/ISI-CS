 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 29: Lubricant maker Valvoline Cummins (VCL) plans to enter the filter manufacturing business by the end of the next financial year.																								VCL is a 50:50 joint venture between Valvoline International Inc, USA, and Cummins Diesel Sales and Services (India), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cummins India.																								Prabha Shankar, vice-president (marketing) of VCL said, We are toying with the idea of manufacturing filters (oil, fuel and air). The market is currently controlled by the unorganised sector. We are now doing a survey on the market. We hope to come up with the products by the end of the next financial year.																								The Indian lube market is growing at a rate of 3-4 per cent as compared with the 1-2 per cent growth in the world market, Shankar added.

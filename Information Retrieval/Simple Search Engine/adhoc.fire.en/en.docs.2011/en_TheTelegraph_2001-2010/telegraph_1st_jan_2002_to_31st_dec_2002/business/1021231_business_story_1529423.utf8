 Tuesday, December 31, 2002 				 Bharti reassures customers
																								New Delhi, Dec. 30 (PTI): The Bharti group said today consumers need not be swayed by new offerings in the market as the company would respond next month to the changing market situation.																								We will soon respond to the changing market situation, and customers need not be swayed by the various offerings coming in the market, chairman and group managing director of Bharti Sunil Mittal said. 																								Mittal said that the company would next month chart out a plan of action, aimed at offering customers better value proposition, but declined to give specific details. 																								We are committed to providing the best customer value so they (customers) need not worry, Mittal said.																								Bharti was not simply responding to the limited mobility launch by various players, he said, adding, This is owing to the overall changing market situation. WiLL is also a part of it but there are many other things happening.																								Mittals comments come in the wake of the launch of limited mobility services by Reliance last week with three schemes, including a three-year unique Dhirubhai Ambani Pioneer offer at Rs 3000 across 673 towns and cities in the country.																								The service, based on code division multiple access (CDMA) platform, would provide messaging, internet, videoconferencing, music download and movie download services.																								Reliance would commence demonstrations of the service on January 15 and bookings by February.

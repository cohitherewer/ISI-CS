 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 27: The communications ministry has set up a committee headed by telecom secretary Vinod Vaish to thrash out the pending issues on procurement of telecom equipment with the telecom manufacturers.																								The committee will interact with Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association (Tema) and is likely to incorporate their demands in its budget inputs to be sent by the communications ministry to the finance ministry.																								The decision to set up a committee was taken following a directive from minister of state for communication Sumitra Mahajan.

They also requested the minister to form a high-powered committee to sort out all the important issues raised by them.																								Tema also unveiled a comprehensive directory that contains full information on the national telecom scenario as well as the telecom equipment manufacturing sector. A delegation led by Tema president Narendra Kumar Goyal presented a copy of the directory to Mahajan on Tuesday.																								The directory is a resource book which is extensively used by Indian missions abroad and foreign missions in India. The telecom associations world wide have used this to forge tie-ups with the local companies in India and also to outsource products. We are also planning to bring it out in a CD form and will put it up on the Tema website for easy access, Goyal said.																								The directory, released after a gap of four years, includes topics like an overview on Indian Telecommunication, NTP 1999, highlights of foreign investment policy, telecom manufacturing sector, telecom services sector, telecom software sector, telecom exports, the Department of Telecommunications, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,																								Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited, Centre for Development of Telematics, Telecom Consultants India Limited and current duty structure on the telecom equipment.

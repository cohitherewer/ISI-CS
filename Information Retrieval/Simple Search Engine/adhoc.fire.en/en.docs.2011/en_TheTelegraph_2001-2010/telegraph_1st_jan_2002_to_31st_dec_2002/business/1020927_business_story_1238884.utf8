 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 26: Powered by the success of the new Suzuki Alto in Europe launched in March this year, Maruti Udyog has targeted a 150 per cent increase in total exports during this year.																								The company plans to export over 31,000 vehicles during 2002-03, compared with 12,232 vehicles in the previous year and 15,000 units exported during 2000-01.

Based on the initial discussions with distributors, Maruti had planned to export 14,000 units of the Alto.

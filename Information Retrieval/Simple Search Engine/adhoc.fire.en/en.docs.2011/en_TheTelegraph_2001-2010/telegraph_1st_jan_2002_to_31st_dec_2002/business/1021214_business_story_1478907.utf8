 Saturday, December 14, 2002 				 Car sales up 8% in November
																								New Delhi, Dec. 13 (PTI): Domestic car sales rose by 7.6 per cent during November on the back of growth posted by major automakers like Maruti, Hyundai and Tata Engineering.

Total sales rose to 41,140 cars from 38,220 cars sold in November last year, the data showed. The November sales were, however, lower by 9.2 per cent over 45,317 cars sold in October this year.																								Car sales traditionally decline during November and December after increasing in the festive month of October as customers tend to postpone their purchases to the New Year. However, cheap loans and heavy discounts by automakers helped drive up sales in November this year.																								Cumulative (April-November 2002) car sales increased by 7.6 per cent to 3,44,924 units from 3,20,403 units a year ago. Sale of commercial vehicles surged by 23.4 per cent to 14,279 units in the review month from 11,566 units last year. Cumulative sales in this segment stood higher by 30.8 per cent at 1,14,152 vehicles.																								Sale of utility vehicles, however, fell by 2.3 per cent to 8,569 units, while cumulative sales in this segment rose by a modest 3.1 per cent to 69,543 units.																								Total two-wheeler sales rose by 19 per cent to 4,53,603 units in November. During April-November, cumulative two-wheeler sales jumped by 22.3 per cent to 33.29 lakh units.																								Motorcycles powered the good performance in this segment clocking a 36.4 per cent growth to 3,59,120 units during the reporting period. 																								Scooter and scooterette sales, however, dipped by 11.8 per cent to 70,609 units while mopeds slipped by 37.1 per cent to 23,874 units during the month.																								Continuing with their good run this fiscal, sale of three-wheelers went up by 12.7 per cent to 18,129 units. Cumulative three-wheeler sales was higher by 13.2 per cent at 1,48,314 units.																								While market leader Maruti posted a 9.6 per cent rise in sales at 21,344 units in November, the local unit of Hyundai Motor recorded a 28.6 per cent at 9,187 units. Telcos sales were up by 11 per cent to 5,758 cars.																								Sales of Honda Siel and DaimlerChrysler increased by 30.6 and 29 per cent to 1,148 and 111 cars, respectively.

Sales of Fiat India and Hindustan Motors also fell by 56.3 and 5.9 per cent to 1,146 and 1,082 cars, respectively.																								New entrant Toyota Kirloskar sold 103 units of its latest luxury car Camry.																								Sales of commercial vehicles, especially heavy trucks, are mainly related to economic growth. Sales this year have been helped by replacement demand from fleet operators, good performance of cement and steel sectors and the ongoing National Highway Development Programme.																								In the utility vehicle segment, sales of Mahindra and Mahindra saw a rise of 2.5 per cent to 4,263 units while that of Toyota Kirloskar dipped by 4.4 per cent to 2,006 units.																								In the multi-purpose-vehicle (MPV) or van-type vehicle, Maruti posted a dip of 16.7 per cent to 4,005 units.

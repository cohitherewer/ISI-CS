Mastershare, one of UTIs popular offerings, is currently a close-ended scheme, a dispensation the countrys largest mutual fund plans to change as a close-ended scheme cannot issue fresh units, whereas open-ended ones can buy and sell units close to their net asset values. The move would mean that the schemes corpus could grow through inflows as it has been one of the out-performers in the industry, having recorded positive earnings from its investments.																								The proposal will be considered by the board at its December 23 meeting.

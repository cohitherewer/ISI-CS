 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 4: Satyam Computer Services Ltd has finally found a strategic buyer for its ISP ventureSatyam Infoway Ltd. 																								Satyam Computer, in a late evening communiqu to the Bombay Stock Exchange, said it was entering into separate definitive agreements with the Softbank Asia Infrastructure Fund (SAIF), through a company controlled by it and VentureTech Solutions Pvt Ltd (VentureTech), which will invest a total of $ 20 million in new shares of Sify.																								The separate investments by the SAIF Investor and VentureTech (including the subsequent VentureTech subscription) will change the shareholding pattern of Sify.

The announcement also effectively puts an end to market rumours that Reliance Industries was eyeing the ISP company, which is listed on the US bourses. 																								Satyam said it proposes to allow the SAIF-controlled company, SAIF Investor, to invest $ 13 million for approximately 7.56 million newly issued ADRs (one ADR is equal to one equity share) at a price of $ 1.72 per ADR.

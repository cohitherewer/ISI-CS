 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: A scientific approach to project management, fast-track construction projects and a long-term management of roads are essential for the development of road infrastructure in India. 																								B C Khanduri, minister of state for road transport and highways, said, The private sector should seriously look into the time and cost overrun factors and a commitment to finish a project on time should be stressed. He was speaking at the construction summit organised by the Construction Federation of India and Confederation of Indian Industry.																								The Indian construction industry must take an active part in the road development process of the country and should not perceive it as a mere business proposition but as contributing to the growth of the nation. 																								He also said that a penalty clause of one and a half percentage of the entire project would be imposed for delays. He said a scientific approach to project management, fast-track construction projects and a long-term management of roads should be undertaken by the private sector.

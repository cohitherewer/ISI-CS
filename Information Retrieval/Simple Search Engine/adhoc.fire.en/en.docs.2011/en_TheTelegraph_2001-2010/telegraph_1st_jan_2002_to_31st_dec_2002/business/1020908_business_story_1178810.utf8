 Sunday, September 08, 2002 				 Hoteliers target local tourists
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 7: The severe recession in the tourism industry has forced the hotel industry to look at non-conventional sources of revenues. The steep drop in the flow of foreign tourists, following terrorist attack in the US last year, has resulted in hotels looking to domestic tourists for survival.																								We have renewed our thrust on the domestic and untapped areas like Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, says Navin Suchanti, chairman of Sinclairs Hotels and Transportation Ltd. We have also introduced two new streams in out travel division.																								Sinclairs has already entered into an arrangement with tour and travel operators in Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal and Thailand. The company is also looking for co-operators in Australia, South Africa, Kenya and Mauritius.																								We are in the process of finalising logistical facilities with a tour operator in Thailand, says Suchanti. Almost 45,000 Thais visited India to tour the Buddhist circuit.

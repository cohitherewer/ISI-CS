 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 Cellular base up 5.2% in October
																								New Delhi, Nov. 13: (PTI) Indias cellular subscriber base has grown by 5.21 per cent in October 2002 to touch 89.7 lakh customers against 85.3 lakh in September this year.																								Industrys monthly additions went up from 3.61 lakh in September 2002 to 4.45 lakh in October this year, according to latest figures released by Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).																								The figures, however, do not include October data from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL). Its subscribers in September have been taken as the latest figure. Hence the actual all-India cellular base may be higher than reflected in the data.																								Metros recorded an increase of 1.79 lakh subscribers which is more than previous month while circle A comprising Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka amongst others registered an increase of 1.41 lakh which is less than last months addition.

 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 New policy for urea pricing 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Oct. 9: The group of ministers (GoM) constituted on the new urea pricing policy has decided on a switchover from the existing unit based retention pricing scheme (RPS) to the group-based concession arrangements with effect from April 1 next year. 																								The recommendations of the GoM, which met today, will be placed before the Cabinet for its approval. 																								The GoM has also recommended that during stage I, 50 per cent of the production of each unit may be supplied through the ECA (Essential Commodities Act) allocation mechanism and the remaining 50 per cent permitted for sale to farmers at notified maximum retail price outside the ECA allocation. 																								The department of fertiliser, in consultation with the ministry of agriculture, will work out the modalities to further increase the free sale quantities towards the end of stage II.

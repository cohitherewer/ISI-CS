 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 Trai clears air on spat
																								New Delhi, Oct. 22 (PTI): The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India today said BSNLs cellular tariff plan with free incoming calls called Post-Paid Plan-325 was only an introductory offer and would be available for only 90 days.																								The pre-paid tariffs and post-paid Plan-325 of BSNL have been approved by the telecom regulator as an introductory offer, which should not be available for more than 90 days, and that before the end of this period regular and duly approved tariffs for the relevant service areas should be introduced by BSNL, the Trai said in a statement. 																								This assumes significance as Union communications minister Pramod Mahajan had earlier in the day categorically dismissed private operators criticism that BSNLs cellular tariffs were predatory and said BSNL had launched its cellular operations only after receiving Trais approval.

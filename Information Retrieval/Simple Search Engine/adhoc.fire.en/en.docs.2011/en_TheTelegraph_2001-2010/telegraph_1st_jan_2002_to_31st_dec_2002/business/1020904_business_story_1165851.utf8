 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 Manila course for Bilt B-school
 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, Sept. 3: Another corporate-sponsored business school is ready to open its portals.																								The new B-school is sponsored by the Thapar-owned Ballarpur Industries (Bilt) which has roped in Manila-based Asian Institute of Management to offer its executive management programmes in India.																								A company spokesperson said the Asian Institute of Management was scouting for a partner through whom it could offer its education programmes in India.																								Bilt is promoting the programme under the aegis of the All India Education Society (AIES) which it had registered in the early nineties but which has been activated only now. 																								The 18-month degree course doesnt come cheap: it will carry a price tag of Rs 4-lakh which is on a par with what you would pay at any of the top IIMs.																								The course will be operated under AIES and will be held in Pune. It is meant for working executives who have to be sponsored by their employers. During the duration of the course, the executive attends it for one week every month and goes back to office for the other three weeks. 																								The objective of AIES is to establish schools, colleges, management institutes and colleges for higher education, and technical education colleges, said the spokesperson. 																								Based, on the success of the executive management programme, other educational projects will be taken up by the company, the spokesperson said. Bilt is, however, reluctant to give the business details of the tieup or the amount it is investing in the project.																								The same faculty that conducts classes at the Manila institute will be brought to India in tune with their schedule. The faculty which has about 10 teachers will be headed by Sonny Colomba dean of AIM.																								Colomba is coming to Pune on Saturday (September 7) to participate in a seminar to be held by Bilt on building human capital for competitive advantage. 																								The executive management programme, called E-MBA, will start its course in January next year. Application forms for the course will have to be submitted in November. Advertisements seeking applications will come out shortly, the spokesperson said. There is no strict limit on the number of seats as such. The nature of the course will be one where curriculum is tailormade for candidates belonging to industry.																								It is like a continuing learning programme and taking the learning back to the institute, said the spokesperson. Asiaweek had ranked Asian Institute of Management among the top 50 management institutes in Asia. 																								The prestigious Indian Institutes of Managements (IIMs) continue to be the most sought after management institutes in the country, whose mainstay is the post graduate management programme offered. The IIMs also offer short-term courses for executives.																								Last year, the first batch of the post graduate programme entered Indian School of Business (ISB) in Hyderabad which runs a one-year post graduate programme in management as also a series of executive programmes.

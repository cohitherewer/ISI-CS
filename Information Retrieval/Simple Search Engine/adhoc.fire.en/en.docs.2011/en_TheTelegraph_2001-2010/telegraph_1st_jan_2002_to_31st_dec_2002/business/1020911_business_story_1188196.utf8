 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 Govt plans to overhaul DGFT functioning
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 10: The government today announced its intention to overhaul the functioning of the office of Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). 																								In the light of the present liberalised trade regime where decision making layers have been erased and the process simplified, a three-member in-house committee will be set up to ensure greater transparency, reorient and further fine-tune the functioning of the DGFT, Union minister of commerce and industry Murasoli Maran said.																								The committee will be headed by former commerce secretary P. P. Prabhu and include former telecom secretary Shyamal Ghosh and textile secretary S. B. Mahapatra, both of whom have served as the DGFT. The committee will be used to make the process export-friendly so that even an inexperienced village artisan can export without difficulties and bureaucratic impediments, Maran said.																								The two day interaction could be taken as a part of a mid-term analysis of the current Exim policy with a view to sustaining and further accelerating exports, he added.																								Maran emphasised on the role of ports to double export volumes by 2007. While complimenting the ports for successfully implementing the one-day licensing scheme he said, The next step of improvement should be introduction of on-line payment and use of digital signatures to mark the successful culmination of computerisation of the entire gamut of operations of the DGFT.

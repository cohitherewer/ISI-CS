																								New Delhi, Dec. 6 (PTI): Another aspirant has opted out of the race for international long distance services with Net4India approaching the department of telecom to surrender its letter of intent.																								We have written to DoT to surrender our long distance LoI. We have been observing the international long distance market and we have decided not to enter this arena for the time being, Net4india chief executive officer Jasjit Sawhney said.																								Internet service provider Net4India, which also offers internet telephony services, had been issued the LoI for long distance services in May this year which was valid for three months.																								In August 2002, Net4India approached the department seeking an extension of the LoI and was subsequently granted an extension.																								Commenting on the withdrawal, Sawhney said that there were certain issues relating to ILD including origination and access codes.																								Stating that the companys core strength was service to business customers, he said, We will would now concentrate on tapping other areas.																								Meanwhile DoT has decided to cancel the LoI, sources said.

 Thursday, September 12, 2002 				 Tyco picks new chief financial officer
 ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 																								New York, Sept. 11: Tyco International has selected David J. FitzPatrick, a senior vice-president and chief financial officer of the United Technologies Corp, to be its new chief financial officer as it tries to restore the companys credibility among investors, executives briefed on the appointment said. 																								A spokesman for Tyco declined to comment Tuesday night, but United Technologies issued a statement confirming that FitzPatrick had stepped down to accept the job at Tyco. 																								At Tyco, FitzPatrick, who is 48, will succeed Mark H. Swartz, who had been criticised by investors for arcane and opaque financial manoeuvres. 																								Swartz was also a longtime colleague and friend of Tycos former chairman and chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, who resigned a day before he was indicted on charges that he evaded more than $ 1 million in New York sales taxes. 					 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

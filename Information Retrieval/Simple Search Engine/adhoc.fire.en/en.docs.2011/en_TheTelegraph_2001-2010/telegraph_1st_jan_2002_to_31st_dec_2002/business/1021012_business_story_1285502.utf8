But the management of the company moved the Company Law Board (CLB) alleging that the acquisition was illegal. In a notice sent to the stock exchanges today, IFB said the CLB had restrained Javeri from exercising voting right on shares acquired after June 27, 2002.																								Javeri holds substantial stake in a number of companies, including Gujarat Cycles  a company promoted by the Gujarat government and the Munjals of the Hero group. He says he does not punt on conventional market favourites.

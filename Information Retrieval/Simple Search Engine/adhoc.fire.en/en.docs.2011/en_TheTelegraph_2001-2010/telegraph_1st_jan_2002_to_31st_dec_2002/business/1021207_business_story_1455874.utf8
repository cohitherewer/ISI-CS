Reliance would also acquire 40 per cent stake in KG-ON-1 in Krishna-Godavari Basin, while Tullow would have the remaining 60 per cent stake.																								Sources said Reliance has been given the operatorship in all the five blocks. The production-sharing contract for the blocks would have to be signed again, they added.

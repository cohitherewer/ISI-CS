 Saturday, November 16, 2002 				 Moodys hints at banks upgrade
																								New Delhi, Nov. 15 (PTI): A day after putting Indias foreign currency rating for a possible upgrade, global rating agency Moodys today indicated that it may upgrade the deposit and debt issues of the countrys leading banks like the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda.																								Although the ratings of some banks and financial institutions are constrained by the country rating ceilings, other weaker PSUs are pulled to the ceiling based on support by the government, Moodys said in a release issued from Limassol today.																								Moodys assigned a Ba3 rating to foreign currency deposits of SBI, ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, PNB, Central Bank of India, Canara Bank, Bank of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Union Bank of India.																								ICICI Banks rating for both debt and issuer has been placed a notch higher at Ba1, while SBIs Resurgent India Bonds have been assigned a Ba3 rating. The debt issue of IDBI and Power Finance Corporation has been placed at Ba2, while IFCIs issuer rating was pegged at Ba2 by the rating agency.																								The deposit ratings of Central Bank of India and Union Bank of India, the debt rating of IDBI and the issuer rating of IFCI all impute government support, Moodys said.																								The rating agency would, however, review the ratings of weak FIs and banks.																								While we continue to believe that the government is willing to support the foreign currency obligations of the banks and FIs, we will review the timeliness of the likely support, especially in the case of weakest institutions, it said.																								Meanwhile, finance secretary S. Narayan today said that Moodys decision to consider a possible upgrade of Indias sovereign ratings only vindicated the governments view that the countrys economic fundamentals were strong.

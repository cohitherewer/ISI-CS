 Saturday, October 05, 2002 				 Roche ends marketing tieup with Nicholas
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 4: Nicholas Piramal India Ltd (NPIL) today said its 10-year Frame Cooperation Agreement of 1993 with F Hoffman-La Roche (FHLR), will come to an end in November 2003.																								The ten-year agreement, gave NPIL the right of first refusal for distribution of new Roche products in India. 																								NPIL will cease to distribute six biotech products, Cymevene, CellCept, Zenapax, MabThera, Xelode and Herceptin, after November 2003.																								However, Roche products manufactured in India by Roche prior to November 1993 and subsequently by NPIL will remain with Nicholas. 																								Turnover from these products in the financial year 2001-02 was Rs 71.48 crore.																								NPIL explained that for any locally manufactured products to be launched after November 2003, Roche will license the product to an Indian party. However, the first opportunity would be given to NPIL. 																								The opportunity could be availed of provided NPIL has the requisite technical facilities as per Roche standards and NPIL has no product that conflicts with the Roche product offered. 																								With the conclusion of this agreement NPIL said it would now have greater flexibility to seek out licensing for new post 1995 patented products from research based global companies. NPIL will actively explore all such opportunities.

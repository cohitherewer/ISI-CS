Addressing a press conference here today, ITGI managing director Ajit Narain said, In the year 2001-02, over 80 per cent of the total premium booked was through the commercial products.

The product portfolio of the company currently comprises commercial products like fire, machinery, breakdown, loss of profit along with a protector series of personal loans.																								The company has recently launched the Home Suvidha policy and Home Trade policy.

The company has also hired competent risk inspectors to audit safety standards of the different projects and other risks, he said.

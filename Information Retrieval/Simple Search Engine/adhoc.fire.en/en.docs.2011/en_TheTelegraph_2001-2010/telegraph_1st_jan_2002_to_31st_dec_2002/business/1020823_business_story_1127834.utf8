 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Global food prices to shoot up
																								Washington, Aug. 22 (PTI): A change in global climatic pattern witnessed in recent years in a manner adversely effecting agricultural output will raise food prices world-wide, well known agricultural expert and president of the Earth Policy Institute Lester Brown has said.																								Presenting a bleak scenario, Brown points out that Indian agriculture also suffered from high temperatures, including a heat wave with temperatures reaching 45 degrees Celsius in May, late and weak monsoon and a depleting water table.																								Scanty rainfall has lowered Indias estimated rice harvest from 90 million to 80 million tonnes.																								Looking at the global picture, Brown, quoting an August 12 study by the US department of agriculture said the grim situation brought down the updated estimate of the worlds grain harvest for 2002, reducing it to 1,821 million tonnes from Julys estimate of 1,878 million tonnes. 																								With world grain consumption this year projected at 1,904 million tonnes, this lower harvest leaves a shortfall of 83 million tonnes, he says.																								The precipitous drop in the month-to-month estimated harvest triggered an accelerated rise in prices of wheat and corn in world markets, he said, adding it also had an indirect impact on prices of products derived from grain, such as bread, breakfast cereals, pasta and livestock products, including meat, milk, and eggs.																								This is the third consecutive year in which world grain production has fallen short of consumption and this years production was lowest in three decades, he said.																								Listing the three key factors that contributed to the reduced harvest this year, Brown said it was low grain prices at planting time, crop-withering temperatures, and falling water tables.																								Several years of low grain prices have discouraged farmers from investing in land improvement and other production-enhancing investments. They have also forced farmers to stop planting crops on marginal land, the expert says.																								The average global temperatures for September and November 2001 were the highest ever recorded for those two months in 134 years of record keeping. Then December, January, February, April and May posted their second highest temperatures on record. And July 2002 was the fourth hottest ever. 																								High temperatures combined with low rainfall in many countries to create drought conditions, Brown said, adding reports of heat-stressed crops have been common in the top three food producersthe United States, India, and China.																								Meanwhile, water tables are falling, as farmers pump more water to meet the growing world demand for food. Water tables are now dropping at an alarming rate in key farming areas of China, India and the US.																								In China, 70 per cent of the grain comes from irrigated land. In India, the figure is 50 per cent, and in the US, almost 20 per cent.																								Boosting land productivity is now much more difficult. In earlier times, higher grain prices led to an expansion of irrigation, but with water table depletion so widespread this does not seem likely. 																								Farmers also respond to higher prices by applying more fertilisers, but with use already quite high, even in developing countries, it is more difficult to expand fertiliser use profitably.

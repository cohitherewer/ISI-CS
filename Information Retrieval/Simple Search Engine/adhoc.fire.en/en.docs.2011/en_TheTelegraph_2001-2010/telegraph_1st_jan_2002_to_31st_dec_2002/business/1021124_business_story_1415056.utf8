 Sunday, November 24, 2002 				 Centre spotlight on textile exports
 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, Nov. 23: As part of a long term policy to boost Indias main export  textiles  the central government has drawn up a plan to set up five apparel export parks within a span of 5 years, extendable to other areas.																								These five apparel parks have been approved in principle by a high level inter-ministerial committee. However, in a recent Cabinet decision the limit of five apparel parks has been removed and it has now been decided that other states which can identify viable export apparel parks too will be funded to start these high value export jump start zones. The central government has set up a budget of Rs 75 crore to set up the apparel parks for exports in the next five years.																								The five apparel parks which have been approved in principle by the Planning Commission are located at Surat, Tronica city in UP, Vishakapatnam, Bangalore and Thiruvananthapuram. 																								The central assistance for each park would be limited to Rs 17 crore. Of this, the grant for infrastructure facilities will be limited to Rs 10 crore, a limit of Rs 5 crore for meeting common facilities to enable the units to meet labour, social and environmental standards and a limit of Rs 2 crore has been set for training facilities.																								The apparel export scheme being carried by the textile ministry is in tune with the National Textile Policy, which has a focused thrust on setting up apparel manufacturing units of international standards at potential growth centres. 																								Apart from meeting competition from imports, the objective is to boost export to achieve the target of $ 50 billion by 2010, as per the policy.

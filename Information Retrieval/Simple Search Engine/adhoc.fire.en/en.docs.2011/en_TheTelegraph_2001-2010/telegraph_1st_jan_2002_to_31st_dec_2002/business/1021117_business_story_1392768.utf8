 Sunday, November 17, 2002 				 Merger likely by January
																								Kozhikode, Nov. 16 (PTI): The merger of Nedungadi Bank with Punjab National Bank is likely to be completed by January, said Nedungadi chairman J R Prabhu. Since assets and liabilities of NBL would be taken over by PNB, thereby ensuring total protection to the depositors money with interest and that all the employees would be absorbed, the merger proposals are likely to be accepted unanimously by all the quarters.																								However, modalities concerning seniority of staff would be worked out by PNB in consultation with NBL. PNB has the right to rationalise the network vis--vis retaining potential centres and closing down others, Prabhu said.

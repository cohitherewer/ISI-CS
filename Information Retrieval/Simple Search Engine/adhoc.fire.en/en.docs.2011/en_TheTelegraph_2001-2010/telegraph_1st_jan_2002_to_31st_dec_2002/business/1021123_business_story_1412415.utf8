 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 Institute unveils crash course for non-bankers
																								Mumbai, Nov. 22 (PTI): The Indian Institute of Bankers (IIB) has set up five strategic business units and decided to throw open its courses to financial sector professionals and those aspiring for career in banking.																								The institute is expanding its focus as liberalisation has changed the skills and knowledge requirements and job opportunities have grown in the non-banking segments of the financial sector, president of the institute and Union Bank of India chairman and managing director V. Leeladhar told reporters here today.																								The five SBUs include educational services, testing and certification and research divisions, Leeladhar said.																								The institute, which is celebrating its platinum jubilee in 2002-03, will host a four day international banking summit at Delhi from December 1, he said.																								About 50 foreign and 100 domestic delegates are expected to attend the bankers conclave which will be inaugurated by Union finance minister Jaswant Singh, he said. Reflecting a change in activity profile, the institute would be renamed as the Institute of Banking and Finance, IIB chief executive officer R. H. Sarma said.																								Non-members, professionals, who were not working with banks, would be able to take courses like diploma in bank financial management and PG diploma in financial advising, Sarma said.																								IIB has also developed performance benchmark for deposit services and personal lending activities and set up banking standard development board to assess the standards of banking professionals, he said.																								Sarma said the pilot testing of the benchmark at 30 branches of select private and public sector banks have shown satisfactory results. Banks would be encouraged to adopt these for internal assessment and later think about making it an industry-wide requirement, he added.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 3: American Supplier Institute (ASI), the leading US quality control consultant that advised General Electric (GE) on the adoption of Six Sigma quality standards, is looking for a large local partner which will help it set up shop in India.																								Executive vice-president Subir Chowdhury said: We see great opportunity in this country. We are scouting for a suitable partner for the last few months, as we want an Indian business leader to launch our operations here.																								ASI has offices in eight countries nowUS, Egypt, Japan, Korea, England, Spain, Germany and Brazil. Most of its revenues come from the US followed by Japan and Korea. Besides India, ASI is also eyeing China as a potential market.																								Six Sigma has created a revolution in the US, Japan and Korea. GE is one of the best-known success stories. Adoption of Six Sigma standards has not only helped companies improve the quality of their products and services, it has also pushed up their bottomlines. Indians have yet to become quality-conscious. Even the IT companies that offer high-quality services do not do so consciously. There are just a handful of companies  like Wiprothat meet the Six Sigma standards, Chowdhury said.																								To rope in a local ally, ASI is open to offering equity stake in its Indian venture. It could be joint venture or a strategic alliance without equity participation, Chowdhury said.

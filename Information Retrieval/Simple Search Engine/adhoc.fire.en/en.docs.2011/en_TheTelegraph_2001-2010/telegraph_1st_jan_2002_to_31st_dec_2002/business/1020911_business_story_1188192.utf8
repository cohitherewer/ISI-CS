Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury.																								Calcutta, Sept. 10: India will soon become the hub for all implementation and development activities for D-Links networking products. India presently contributes around 10 per cent to the turnover of D-Link Corporation, its US parent.																								The US is strong in engineering and integration activities. Their expertise will be used to manufacture new products in different segments of networking, director (sales) Prabodh Vyas said.																								Speaking at a meet to introduce D-Links futuristic products, Vyas said, There are plans to increase exports to the US and Europe through our parent company. We are also looking at exports to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. 																								The US parent company is also considering import of structured products from India.																								D-Link has also launched a slew of products and solutions in networking and communications, which included enterprise networking, VoIP, storage and security, internetworking, metropolitan area networks (MAN), structured cabling, video over IP and wireless.																								With the launch of these products, D-Link is strategically positioned to provide complete end-to-end networking solutions for large enterprises. This launch will open up new market segments, estimated to have a potential of over Rs 100 crore for the company, said Vyas. With the launch of Layer 3 switching, firewalls for network security and network attached storage, we are in a position to provide complete end-to-end networking solutions for large enterprises. 																								The products were developed and manufactured at the companys facilities in Taiwan, China and US. D-Link registered a turnover of Rs 424.3 lakh for 2001-02 with a sales turnover of Rs 174.3 crore. We expect to grow 20 to 30 per cent over that of the market, added Vyas. Despite networking suffering negative growth last year, we maintained an increase in sales.																								Responding to a query on the companys plans of increasing its production capacity, Vyas said the existing facilities were sufficient for the market needs.

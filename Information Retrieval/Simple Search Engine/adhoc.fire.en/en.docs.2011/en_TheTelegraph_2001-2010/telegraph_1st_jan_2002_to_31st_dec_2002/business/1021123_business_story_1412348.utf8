 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 Nasscom, LSE join hands for infotech
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 22: The National Association for Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) and the London Stock Exchange today signed a memorandum of co-operation committing the two organisations to work together for the benefit of the Indian infotech industry.																								The memorandum commits the LSE and Nasscom to share research and market data, organise joint marketing events and seminars and work together to promote the advantage of a London listing to Indian IT companies. Clara Furse, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said, This agreement reinforces LSEs commitment to Indian IT companies. The IT industry in India is expanding at an impressive rate, and, for this to continue, companies will need access to further capital. 																								London is home to more international capital than any other financial centre in the world but, more importantly, in the current environment it offers world-leading standards of corporate governance and market regulation. These advantages mean that London is increasingly becoming the first choice for Indian IT companies that want to fund their future growth.																								The UK is the second largest market for Indian IT services companies accounting for about 12 per cent of the total Indian IT services exports. The need today is for Indian companies to consolidate and expand their presence in the UK and Europe and to engage with this important financial market to raise capital. 																								The MoU with LSE envisages the fulfilment of both these objectives to enable Indian IT companies to explore new horizons with UK and Europe in the technology sector, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Sept. 13: Indias largest car maker Maruti Udyog today launched a variant of its entry-level model Maruti 800 in an aggressive attempt to push sales of the car in non-metro markets. 																								The new car would have all the features of an existing M 800 Standard (Bharat Stage I) model but comes fitted with an airconditioner and tinted glasses.																								It has been priced at about Rs 2.15 lakh (ex-showroom Lucknow), which is about Rs 25,000 more than the non- airconditioned M 800 standard and Rs 20,000 less than the airconditioned M 800 deluxe version.

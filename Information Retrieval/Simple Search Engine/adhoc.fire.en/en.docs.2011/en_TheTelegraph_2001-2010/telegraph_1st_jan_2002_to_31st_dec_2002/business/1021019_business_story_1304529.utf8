 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 18: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said normalcy would be restored at the Garden Reach factory of the Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL) by Saturday. Agitating workers had forced suspension of operation at the unit.																								Labour minister Mohammad Amin today brokered a settlement between the management and the workers. The dispute arose after five out of the 21 contractors engaged by HLL refused to pay 20 per cent bonus to their workers. 																								After the meeting with the minister, the contractors agreed to pay bonus within a month in two instalments. Amin said: The union has agreed to call off the agitation. I have appealed to them to show restraint. The minister gave a report on todays development to the chief minister.																								P. K. Chatterjee, regional personnel manager of HLL, however, said the atmosphere in the factory is still tense and it is difficult to carry out operations.

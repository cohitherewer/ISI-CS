 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 26: An economic growth of 5 to 10 per cent per annum, 100 per cent literacy, self reliance in critical sectors and zero poverty are some of President A. P. J. Abdul Kalams visions for India as a developed country.																								At an event organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the President shared his vision with some 1400 children from across the country at the Vigyan Bhawan in Delhi on Childrens Day  November 14.																								CII is organising a similar event in Calcutta, but on a larger scale  the President will interact with some 7,500 students from the city on January 21.																								CIIs regional office has already invited some 150 schools in the city and its suburbs to participate in the event.																								We have chosen the innocuous neighbour schools. We have indicated to them that we can take maximum of 100 students from each school, but we may have to reduce the number if too many schools respond to the invite, said Dipankar Chatterjee, chairman of CIIs eastern region.

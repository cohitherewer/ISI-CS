 Saturday, November 09, 2002 				 Feasibility study on port at Sagar
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 8: Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) is scouting for a financially and technically strong partner to set up a full-fledged port system at Sagar and a floating terminal at Sandheads.																								The move will change the face of the countrys oldest port, which is now striving for a makeover from its current status of being a riverine port.																								CPT chairman A.K. Chanda said a feasibility study is being conducted and potential for both port systems has been found to be enormous. Chanda said the draft at Sagar is 10.5 metres, while it is 50 metres at Sandheads, the highest in the country.																								Several international consultants and port experts who have visited Sagar have been charmed by the prospects of the area. Once a full-fledged port is set up, it will augment port facilities in the eastern region tremendously, he said.																								CPT has decided to raise the draft at Sagar by another two metres to 12.5 metres through dredging.																								Chanda said the port at Sagar and the floating terminal at Sandheads will help the Calcutta Dock System regain its glory.																								CDS has done very well of late but there is room for further improvement, he said referring to the dock systems inherent problem of draft because of the heavy accumulation of silt in the Ganges. Chanda also noted that the CPT is diversifying into port consultancy services with the help of its skills and resources.																								The Indian port sector is witnessing various activities and we saw good business potential in the consultancy business. The CPT is keen to become a strong player in the inland water transport system, which has a potential to carry 18 million tonnes per annum at a much cheaper cost.

 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Citi earnings up 23% in Q3
 RIVA D. ATLAS 																								New York, Oct. 16: Citigroup reported a 23 per cent increase in third-quarter profits on Tuesday, providing a welcome distraction to investors anxious about numerous investigations involving its investment banking business. 																								The bank said the strength of its consumer business, along with a gain on the sale of its headquarters on Park Avenue, helped offset losses in its investment portfolio and write-downs on loans to telecommunications companies and related to Argentina. 																								The performance lifted Citigroups stock on Tuesday, which rose $ 3.83, to $ 34.14. Shares have tumbled 27.5 per cent for the year. 																								Citigroups stock has fallen as analysts struggled to quantify the cost of numerous lawsuits and investigations involving conflicts of interest at the companys investment bank, Salomon Smith Barney. Michael Mayo, an analyst at Prudential Financial, has estimated that Citigroup could eventually pay billions of dollars in fines and settlements. Citigroups largest shareholder, Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, said Tuesday that now that Citigroup has reported such strong results, All those doubters should shut up, repeating the words several times for emphasis. 																								The stock has been hammered like the company is going out of business, he said. It is unjustifiable. 																								At the start of a conference call with analysts, Sanford I. Weill, chief executive of Citigroup, said, I cant believe the company were about to talk about is the same as the one youve been reading about in the newspapers, trying to ease concerns about recent investigations that have hurt Citigroups stock. Citigroup had net income of $ 3.92 billion, or 76 cents a share, compared with $ 3.18 billion, or 62 cents a share, the same quarter a year ago. 					 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

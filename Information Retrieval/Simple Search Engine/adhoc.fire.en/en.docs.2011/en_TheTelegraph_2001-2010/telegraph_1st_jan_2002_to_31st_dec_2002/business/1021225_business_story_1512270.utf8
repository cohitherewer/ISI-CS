 Wednesday, December 25, 2002 				 Fosters buys stake in Dubai company
				 	 Party-time (AFP)																								Melbourne, Dec. 24 (AP): Australian brewing and wine company Fosters expanded its interests in West Asia with the acquisition of a stake in a major Dubai-based alcohol sales, marketing and distribution business.																								Fosters said today its Brewing International division has acquired 40 per cent stake in African amp; Eastern Dubai and African amp; Eastern Oman, known as A+E.																								The Australian company did not reveal the exact cost but said it was less than $ 18 million.																								Fosters spokeswoman Jo Ford said the acquisition was to protect and secure the interests the company already has in the region.																								We have had a 25-year history with A+E as our distributors over there. But this gives us the opportunity to secure management control over the company, and with that, greater control over those interests, she said.																								It is in line with our business strategy of developing Fosters Lager globally, she added.																								Ford said while the Muslim population of Dubai does not drink alcohol, the Gulf state has a large expatriate community.																								Fosters shares closed 4 cents lower at $ 4.53 on Monday.

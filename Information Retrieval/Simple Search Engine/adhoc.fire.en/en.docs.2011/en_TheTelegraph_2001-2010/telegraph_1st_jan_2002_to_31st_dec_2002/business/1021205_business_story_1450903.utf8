The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, December 05, 2002 				 Sales at Ford, GM skid in Nov.
 DANNY HAKIM 				 	 In slow motion																								Detroit, Dec. 4: Sales at General Motors and the Ford Motor Co fell sharply in November from robust levels a year ago, and both stocks were battered Tuesday on Wall Street. 																								Many investors are concerned about the prospect of slumping industry sales next year, which even the automakers are expecting, coupled with increasing competition as foreign carmakers open more plants in the United States and continue to encroach on the lucrative pickup and sport utility market. 																								Shares of Ford, which had begun to emerge from a deep swoon in recent weeks, fell 13 per cent Tuesday, or $ 1.49, to $ 9.96. 					 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

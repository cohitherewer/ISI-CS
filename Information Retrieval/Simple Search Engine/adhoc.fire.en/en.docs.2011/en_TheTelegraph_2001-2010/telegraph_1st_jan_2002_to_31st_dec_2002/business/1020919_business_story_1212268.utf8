New Delhi, Sept. 18: Hero Motors today launched Hero Smarta 4-stroke step-thru priced at Rs 19,900 (in south India) and Rs 21,500 (elsewhere).																								We have a dealer network of just 55 in the rural areas at a time when we are launching a totally rural two-wheeler. So we are interested in appointing over 10,000 dealers to reach the countrys panchayat level. This will be done under the Prime Minister Rozgar Yojna, where these dealers will be self-employed but the money will be provided by Hero Finance Service, senior vice-president Sanjay Bharadwaj said. The company will be stumping up Rs 380 crore to establish these dealerships.																								The bike, which cost Rs 15 crore to develop, has a design that can be changed to fit different carriers and make it more user-friendly.																								Pradeep Handoo, vice-president business development, said, The engine developed for this product by American company Briggs and Stratton, will be used for a range of products in this line. Instead of 75cc, these products will have higher capacity to address the needs of the rural people.

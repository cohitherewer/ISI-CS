																								Calcutta, Sept 14: The domestic jute industry has been able to free hessian, a versatile jute cloth, from the clutches of Europe. The European Patent Office has recently revoked the hessian patent obtained by UK-based GEO-HESS for lack of novelty and inventive merits.																								Arun Bal, secretary of the Jute Manufactures Development Council (JMDC), said here today that it took several years of combined efforts of different jute bodies, including JMDC, Indian Jute Mills Association (Ijma), and Indian Jute Industries Research Association (Ijira), to free hessian from the European grip.

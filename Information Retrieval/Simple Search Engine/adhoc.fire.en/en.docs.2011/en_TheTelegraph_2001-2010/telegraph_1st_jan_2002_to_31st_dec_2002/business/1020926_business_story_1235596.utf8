 Thursday, September 26, 2002 				 Parts makers seek support 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association of India (Tema) will soon present a white paper to the government to highlight the problems faced by them and seek necessary support. The association also plans to tap the telecom market in countries that are part of the South Asian Association of Regional Co-operation (Saarc). Tema plans to enter into a memorandum of understanding with similar organisations in Saarc nations, particularly Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.																								A Tema delegation, led by president Narendra Kumar Goyal, plans to point out to the government that several policies are yet to be implemented. The current scenario in the telecom manufacturing sector is alarming. This will have a drastic impact on the telecom manufacturers. The jobs of a large number of workmen and engineers are at stake, Goyal said.

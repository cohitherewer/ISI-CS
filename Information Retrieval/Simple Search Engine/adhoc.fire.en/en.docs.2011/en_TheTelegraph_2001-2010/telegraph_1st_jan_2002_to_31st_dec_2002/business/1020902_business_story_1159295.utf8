 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Amul to give foreigners a Taste of India
 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, Sept. 1: The Taste of India is all set to tickle taste buds abroad. Amulthe quintessential brand of the soil from the co-operative set-up of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)has now drawn up plans to tap the overseas market. 																								In its first phase of its expansion overseas, GCMMF will set up marketing operations, offices and Amul depots in Bangladesh, the Himalayan Kingdom of Nepal, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 																								Confirming the overseas market expansion plans of its flagship brand Amul (acronym for Anand Milk Union Limited), a senior GCMMF marketing official said the setting up of operations in these four neighbouring countries will take about six months. We expect a revenue of about Rs 150 crore in these countries, from the first year of operations, he said. 																								The official said that in the subsequent phase of overseas expansion Amul will be considering Singapore, and thereafter it will consider the feasibility of markets in the European Union and the US. Initially, the production facility for Amul products will be in India, he said. 																								While products from the Amul bouquet will be marketed in these countries, the focus will be on selling ghee, butter, milk powder, shrikhand and ice creams. Other Amul products like chocolates and frozen pizzas too will be pushed in though. 																								Refusing to provide any investment figures for these operations the official said that key marketing officials will be appointed to head these operations. Subsequently, it is also likely to rope in staff from GCMMF, though the employment of local staff is not totally ruled out. 																								Currently almost all of Amuls exports is to these neighbouring countries, where it now intends to set up full-fledged marketing operations. Now, we sell through export agents, but we are keen that our own men set up operations to build the market and the brand, he said.

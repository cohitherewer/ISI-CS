The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, October 28, 2002 				 Awash in Maruti discount deluge
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA				 	 the car brings it all																								Calcutta, Oct. 27: Are you a Maruti owner? If yes, you can expect discounts from various companies ranging from white goods makers to dotcoms. 																								The countrys largest four-wheeler maker is in talks with a host of consumer durable manufacturers and dotcoms for a tieup that will benefit its customers.																								Maruti is sitting on probably the most attractive database of top notch domestic consumers. This database, developed over two decades, will now be shared with select companies in various sectors, a senior company official said.																								Maruti has already entered into alliances with air-conditioning major Carrier Aircon, IT education companies like Tata Infotech and dotcoms like e-gurucool.com. Sources said several other companies have also shown keen interest to use Marutis rich database for marketing their products.																								The official further pointed out that special offers help these companies cut through the clutter and speak directly to their target audience. The companies behind the offers save on advertising costs. These savings, along with special promotional discounts, add up to a substantial amount that is passed on to customers, he explained.																								Maruti scrutinises these offers to ensure they offer the best deal to the customer. We look at it as a win-win proposition, he said. The official further noted that Maruti does not sell or release customer information to marketers, handling all communication directly. Registered Maruti customers are notified of new offers every month.

The company will make 120 E-Class Mercs during November and December, Hans-Michael Huber, managing director and CEO DaimlerChrysler India Ltd told reporters here. 																								We have just started the assembly (of cars) and demand is high, he said after the company launched the Mercedes Benz E-Class in Karnataka at Sundaram Motors here. The company, he said, had set a production target of 1,300 cars of different segments this year and planned to grow by 10 to 15 per cent. We see a moderate and constant growth in volume.

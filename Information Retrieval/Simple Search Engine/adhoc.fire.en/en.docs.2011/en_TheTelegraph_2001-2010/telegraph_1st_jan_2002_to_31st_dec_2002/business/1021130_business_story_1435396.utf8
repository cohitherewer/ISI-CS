The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Japan team on business hunt in east
 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, Nov. 29: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) is taking a high-powered Japanese delegation to Calcutta to scout for investment opportunities in the east next month.																								The delegation will include the top brass of Honda Motors, Itochu, Toshiba, Marubeni, Mitsubishi Chemicals, Mitsui Construction, Nisho Iwai and Toyo Engineering. The team will be visiting Calcutta on the occasion of the 31st joint meeting of the Indo-Japan Business Co-operation Committee (IJBCC), but will really be looking to assess investment opportunities.																								The programme will be in close co-operation with the consul general of Japan in Calcutta, Ficci secretary general Amit Mitra told The Telegraph.																								For quite sometime, Japanese companies have been concentrating on other parts of the country, particularly Bangalore, Hyderabad, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra. 																								However, in the last one year, we have been making strong presentations to them on the possibilities of investment in Bengal. Further, we have received enormous co-operation from the consul general in Calcutta to make the whole thing possible, Mitra added.

Calcutta, Oct 3: After two years of evolving as a corporate body, BSNL is still trying to formulate a policy to initiate growth and protect the interests of its employees. 																								The largest telecom player in the country had roped in KPMG three months back to look into human resource related management issues, for manpower planning and incentive schemes. 																								KPMG has tabled the first draft report on HR integration and norms for new services, which will be implemented after being approved by the board. The final report will ready by January next year, says BSNL director (planning) Kranti Kumar.																								Kumar said the company has also appointed Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to draw up an insurance scheme for BSNL employees which will be implemented shortly. 																								BSNL officials were in the city to attend the 25th state conference of Telecommunication Engineering Services Association (Tesa).																								Besides integrating former DoT employees into the company, the major challenge faced by BSNL is on the marketing front. 																								There are three major areas that need to be addressed, said S. P. Chakraborty, chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones. It is necessary to build an image based on quality, trust and efficiency. Besides brand building and marketing, customer services is another area requiring attention.																								BSNL has requested the government to allow it to function as an autonomous body, lamenting that even after two years of corporatisation, the board was not effective.

 Tuesday, October 15, 2002 				 Henkel offer
																								Frankfurt, Oct 14 (AFP): German consumer chemicals group Henkel, makers of Persil detergent, has made an informal $ 4.4-billion offer to buy hair care products specialist Wella, the Wall Street Journal Europe reported today.																								However, the companies remained far apart from agreeing on a price for the deal, the newspaper added, quoting sources familiar with the situation. Neither group was immediately available to comment, but if the deal were to go ahead, Henkel would rank only second behind French group LOreal in the wholesale hair care market.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Global goal																								Lucknow, Oct. 19: The progress made in the telecommunications sector in the recent past is a major achievement of the NDA government as this has made the entire world easily accessible, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said here today. 																								He was speaking at the launch of the countrywide cellular services of the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) here. Vajpayee made the inaugural call to deputy Prime Minister L K Advani in New Delhi from the Raj Bhawan here. Vajpayee lauded BSNLs initiative by describing it as a great step forward in the field of telecommunications. 																								Observing that there are people who still thought that the country needed more food than telephones, the Prime Minister said it is a fact that the facility has improved the living standard of people and brought them closer to each other. Vajpayee recalled the time when telephones were scarce. But now there was no scarcity of either the instruments or of immediate availability of phone connections, both mobile and traditional ones. There were as many as one crore mobile phone users in the country and they were gradually becoming more popular than the stationary phones, he observed.

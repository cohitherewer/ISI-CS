 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 19: Himalaya Herbal Healthcare, which forayed into the Rs 350-crore chyavanprash market today, is planning to launch a range of neem-based products in the near future. Speaking on the sidelines of the launch, S.K. Mitra, executive director, research and technical services, said a slew of products based on neem is on the anvil but did not divulge the details. 																								President and CEO Ravi Prasad said that about 10 new herbal products are in the pipeline to be launched in the near future. But added that it is premature to talk of them now. Starting with north India, Himalayas chyavanprash will be gradually marketed in the west, south and eastern part of the country.																								The Rs 250-crore company, which sells natural herbs, herbal personal care products and ayurvedic medicines, plans to double its turnover in five years time, said Prasad.

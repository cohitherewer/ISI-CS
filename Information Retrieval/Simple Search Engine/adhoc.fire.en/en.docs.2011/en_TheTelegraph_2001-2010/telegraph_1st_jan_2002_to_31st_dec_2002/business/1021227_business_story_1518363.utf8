The Yojana has four important components: upgradation and strengthening of the saturated Golden Quadrilateral and its diagonals at an estimated cost of Rs 8,000 crore, construction of four mega bridges at Patna and Munger over the Ganga, at Bogibeel over the Brahmaputra and at Nirmali over the Kosi at an estimated cost of Rs 3,650 crore. The other two components are port connectivity and development of multi-nodal rail corridor projects at an estimated cost of Rs 3,000 crore and expeditious completion of last mile projects of Rs 808 crore. Vajpayee had announced the projects on August 15 this year. 																								No project should languish for want of resources. The linking of the four metros through the rail golden quadrilateral project will enhance the speed of goods trains in particular as well as passenger trains. It will also reduce pollution, Vajpayee said.

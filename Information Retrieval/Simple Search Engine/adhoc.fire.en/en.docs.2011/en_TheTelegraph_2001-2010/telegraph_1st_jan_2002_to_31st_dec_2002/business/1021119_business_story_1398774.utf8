 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, Nov. 18: Women may form almost a quarter of Net users in India, but they still seem to be lagging behind their counterparts in America, China, Brazil and Russia, at least as far as usage of software and other IT-enabled services is concerned.																								Statistics put out by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) today show that Indian women hold a little over a fifth of all professional jobs in the software and infotech sectors. However, this figure is much lower than that in developed nations and even other developing nations like China and Brazil.																								In the US, 53 per cent of Netizens are women. The percentage in China and Brazil is also an encouraging 45 per cent and 63 per cent respectively. 																								Interestingly, the number of women internet users are lower than the percentage of women making up the infotech workforce in most countries except India. 																								The report on e-commerce and development for the current year by Unctad says while work done by women ranges from data entry to software programming and systems analysis, they tend to be hired for operations requiring less complex skills.																								Even though a small percentage of women have the necessary qualifications to be in infotech related areas, a huge majority of women has not been able to go ahead in such areas due to social constraints. For such a large community, 23 per cent is not enough. Nonetheless, it is a very significant number, Jyotsna Chaterjee, director, Joint Womens Association told The Telegraph.

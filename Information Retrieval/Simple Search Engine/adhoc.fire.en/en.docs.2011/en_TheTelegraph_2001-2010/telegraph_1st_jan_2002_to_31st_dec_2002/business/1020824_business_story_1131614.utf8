 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: SRL Ranbaxy, the diagnostics laboratory chain owned by the promoters of Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited that has four regional laboratories in the country, has drawn up plans to open one more regional laboratory in Calcutta by the end of the year at an investment ranging between Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore. 																								By the end of the year, the company plans to open another regional laboratory in Guwahati at a similar investment. SRL Ranbaxy used to be earlier known as Speciality Ranbaxy Limited when it was a joint venture of Speciality of the US and Ranbaxy. Earlier this year, it became 100 per cent owned by the promoters of Ranbaxy and changed its name to SRL Ranbaxy. 																								Speaking to The Telegraph about the companys expansion plans in Calcutta and Guwahati, SRL Ranbaxy CEO Vidur Kaushik said, Apart from opening two more laboratories in these two cities, the number of collection centres, currently numbering six in Calcutta, will be doubled by the end of the year. 																								SRL right now has 500 collection centres in 215 towns. We intend to increase it to 2,000 centres in 400 towns in the next three to five years. The overall plan is to have another 32 laboratories in India, Kaushik said. However, he refused to set a time frame for it. 																								The turnover of the company in the fiscal ending March this year was Rs 45 crore. Our compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is over 40 per cent per year and we aim to be a Rs 250-crore company in the next three to five years, he said.  copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved.

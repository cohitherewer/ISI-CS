 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 A-I restructuring on cards
																								New Delhi, Nov. 26 (PTI): In a major restructuring exercise, public carriers Air-India (A-I) and Indian Airlines (IA) have jointly appointed a consultant to formulate a long term business plan for the two airlines, the Rajya Sabha was informed today.																								The consultant, who will also study the possible synergy in the operations of A-I and IA and optimum utilisation of the fleet, is expected to submit its report within six months, civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussain said. He ruled out withdrawing A-I flight to Bangkok from Guwahati, saying the Centre did not intend to close the flight though it was making losses. He, however, said since the flight was not a profitable one, there was no proposal to start any new international flight from Guwahati to other foreign cities.																								The minister said four ATR aircraft would start operating in the north eastern region from December 25 to connect the states in the north-east with Guwahati acting as the regional hub.																								Responding to a query from RJD member Laloo Prasad Yadav as to why there was no international fight from the Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan international airport at Patna, he said the runway was short and did not meet the specifications for operating international flights.

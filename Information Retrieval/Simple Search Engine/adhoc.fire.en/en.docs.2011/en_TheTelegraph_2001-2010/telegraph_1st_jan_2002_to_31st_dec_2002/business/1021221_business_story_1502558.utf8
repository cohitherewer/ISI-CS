 Saturday, December 21, 2002 				 Tribunal wants govt to limit limited mobility
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 20: The Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) today asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and the government to ensure that limited mobility service providers do not offer services beyond the short distance charging area (SDCA).																								A short distance charging area is a telecom area within a taluk, tehsil headquarters. Since August 15, 1998, the local area has become co-terminus with an SDCA. The headquarters of an SDCA is generally a short-distance charging centre (SDCC). An SDCC is a particular exchange in a long-distance charging area, (LDCA) as currently defined for the purpose of charging such calls.																								The tribunal was hearing a petition filed by the Cellular Operators Association of India alleging that basic service providers like Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL) and Shyam Telelink were flouting norms and offering the service beyond SDCA limits.																								While refusing to issue any direction to the basic service providers offering wireless in local loop limited mobility to install the V5.2 software in their network, TDSAT issued directions that such service providers should follow limited mobility guideline.																								In their petition, cellular operators had demanded that while the Supreme Court allowed basic operators to offer limited mobility, they must not be allowed to use mobile switching centre (MSC) and be permitted to only access network based on national standard for V5.2 as prescribed by the Telecom Engineering Centre.																								In its order, TDSAT said while the earlier petition filed by the cellular operators demanding installation of V5.2 in their network will be heard in 10 weeks, we direct both the government and Trai to ensure limited mobility service providers do not offer the service beyond the SDCA.

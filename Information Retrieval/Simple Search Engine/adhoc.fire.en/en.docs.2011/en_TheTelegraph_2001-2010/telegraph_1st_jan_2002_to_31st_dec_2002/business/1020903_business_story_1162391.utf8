																								New Delhi, Sept. 2 (PTI): Videocon International has decided to invest Rs 200 crore in setting up an integrated manufacturing facility for a range of consumer durables and components in Andhra Pradesh.																								As part of its expansion strategy, the group has also firmed up plans to foray into refrigerators under the Kenstar brand and these will be launched by next month, a senior company official said. We will launch three models of refrigerators under Kenstar brand name next month, videocon international chairman V.N. Dhoot said.																								I am not selling only fridges ..... I also deal in components. Our compressor plant at Bangalore has, at present, 25 per cent idle capacity. This will be utilised by selling the Kenstar brand of fridges, he added. Asked whether this foray will mean the new range might eat into flagship brand Videocon sales, Dhoot said the multi brand strategy had worked very well for the group and he expected it to continue to reap profits.																								He said the Andhra plant will make colour television, VCD and DVD players, hi-fi audio systems and dish washers besides washing machines and refrigerators.

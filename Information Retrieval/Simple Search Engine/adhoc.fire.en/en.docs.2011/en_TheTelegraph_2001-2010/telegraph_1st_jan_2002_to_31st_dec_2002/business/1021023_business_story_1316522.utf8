 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 EchoStar, Hughes revise merger plan 
 SALLIE HOFMEISTER 																								Los Angeles, Oct. 22: In an effort to save their proposed $ 18-billion satellite-TV merger, EchoStar Communications Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp. filed a revised plan Monday with federal regulators that will clear the way for new competition, said people familiar with the filing. 																								Under the proposal submitted to the US department of justice, EchoStar and Hughes have agreed to sell broadcast spectrum to cable rival Cablevision Systems Corp. Cablevision is planning to launch a limited satellite-TV service next summer. 																								Yet analysts wonder if the Cablevision plan is too late. Two weeks ago, the Federal Communications Commission blocked the merger of EchoStar and Hughes, which owns DirecTV, because folding the nations only two satellite- TV providers into one company would create a monopoly with limited consumer choice. Together, EchoStar and DirecTV would serve nearly 20 per cent of all US households. 																								The FCCs formal decision, released Friday, indicated that the commissioners remain sceptical of any new satellite-TV rival emerging because of the significant competitive hurdles.

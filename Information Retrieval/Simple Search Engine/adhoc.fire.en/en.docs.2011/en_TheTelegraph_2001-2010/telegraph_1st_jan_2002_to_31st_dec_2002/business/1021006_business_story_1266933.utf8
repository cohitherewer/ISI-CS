																								New Delhi, Oct. 5 (PTI): Resolution of contentious interconnect issue involving recently-privatised VSNL and state-owned BSNL may take some more time as a high-level meeting between deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and his Cabinet colleagues, including communications minister Pramod Mahajan could not be held today.																								The meeting, earlier scheduled for today, was aimed at resolving the ongoing stand-off between the two telecom companies on the issue of interconnect rates for routing of international long distance traffic.																								The previous meeting which was held on September 24 remained inconclusive.

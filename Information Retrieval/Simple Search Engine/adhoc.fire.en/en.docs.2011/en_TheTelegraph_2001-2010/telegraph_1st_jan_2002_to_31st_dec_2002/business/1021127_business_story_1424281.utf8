The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 Bajaj to export bikes
 SHASHWATI GHOSH AND SRINJOY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: The countrys largest scooter-maker, Bajaj Auto, views exports as key to its profits. It is developing a new 110 cc motorcycle to cater to the global market, chairman and managing director Rahul Bajaj said.																								The same model will be launched in India but without certain specifications. Exports have certain specifications which will price the model unnecessarily costlier for the Indian market, he said.																								The firm has tied-up with Japanese auto-major, Kawasaki Motors Corporation for technical support and marketing distribution for its exports. Kawasaki has realised the competitiveness of India as a manufacturing base and also the fact that our production-cost is one of the lowest in the world, Bajaj told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the India Economic Summit. 																								They have commissioned us to deliver the motorcycles in Europe and Indonesia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, he said. The two firms are also exploring the possibility of exporting three-wheelers.																								Regarding the expected export volumes the firm wishes to achieve, Bajaj said: It should be in tens of thousands. However, it also depends on the markets capacity to absorb because Kawasaki has global sales of half a million.																								A senior Bajaj official said the firm is still undecided on branding the product. Ideally we would like to have co-branding with Kawasaki, but it will all depend on what they want.

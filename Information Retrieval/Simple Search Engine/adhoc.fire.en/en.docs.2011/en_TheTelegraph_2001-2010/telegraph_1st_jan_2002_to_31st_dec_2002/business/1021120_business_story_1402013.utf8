 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 PowerGrid ready to wheel DPC power
																								Mumbai, Nov. 19 (PTI): Transmission major Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) has expressed its readiness to evacuate power generated by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to other states if it is asked to do so by the government.																								We are an open access provider. If asked to transmit power from DPCs 650 MW phase one to other states PGCIL will be ready to do it, said chairman and managing director R P Singh.																								He said if required the company could also lay a direct transmission line from the $ 3-billion base load power plant, connecting it to the western grid.																								According to another top PGCIL official, Dabhol Power is already indirectly connected to the western grid through Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).																								Things will improve greatly in the state once DPC restarts generation, he added. 																								Meanwhile, PowerGrid has completed the second phase of its proposed national grid by commissioning the 450-km Raipur-Rourkela transmission line, thus connecting the power deficit western region with the surplus eastern grid.																								We have commissioned this most important interconnection almost a year ahead of schedule. The western grid will now be able to get 800 to 1,000 MW power more from the surplus eastern region, the chairman said.

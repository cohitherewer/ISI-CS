Calcutta, Oct. 24: Zydus Cadila Healthcare Ltd is set to launch a host of vaccines in the domestic market through a licensing arrangement with Berna Biotech of Switzerland. The proposed launches include vaccines for diseases like Hepatitis-A, typhoid, and chicken pox.																								The company, which has already introduced the Hepatitis B and rabies vaccines in the Indian market, is expected to launch the other vaccines in the next few months.																								Zydus Cadila senior vice-president M. S. Kulkarni said the countrys vaccine market is a very large one. We hope to gain a sizeable market share in the next couple of years with the vaccines we have and the ones we are going to launch.																								Kulkarni, who was here today to launch the rabies vaccine, said the company had no plans to produce the vaccines that it proposes to launch. There will not be any technology transfer deal for the proposed vaccines as the one we had with Berna Biotech for the rabies vaccine. These vaccines will be launched through a licensing arrangement, he said.																								The company has invested Rs 22 crore to set up a rabies vaccine plant following the technology transfer deal it struck with Berna.																								The current capacity of the plant is 1.5 lakh doses per month, which will be raised to 2.5 lakh in six months and over three lakh doses by the end of one year. The company will invest another Rs 20 crore in the capacity expansion programme. Under the technology transfer deal, the company will also be able to export the rabies vaccine to 30 countries. 																								Q2 net up 16.4%																								Zydus Cadila today reported a rise of 16.4 per cent in net profit at Rs 25.4 crore for the quarter ending September 30 2002, as against Rs 21.8 crore a year back.																								Sales increased by 25.4 per cent to Rs 191.6 crore from Rs 152.8 crore in the second quarter last year, a Zydus release said.																								The company attributed the improved performance to a 24.9 per cent rise in domestic sales and 25.5 per cent rise in exports.

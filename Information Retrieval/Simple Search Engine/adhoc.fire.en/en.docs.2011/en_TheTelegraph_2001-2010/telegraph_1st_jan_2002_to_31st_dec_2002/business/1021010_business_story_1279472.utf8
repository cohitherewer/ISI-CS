 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 BSNL moves tribunal against Trai order
																								New Delhi, Oct. 9 (PTI): Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd is believed to have approached the telecom tribunal against Trais cellular tariff order of September 6.																								In its tariff order of September, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) announced its decision to refrain from specifying tariffs for the services, leaving the determination of prices to market forces, except in cases where the service provider was offering any other type of service in the same circle such as basic or long distance. Such operators would be required to report tariffs for the regulators approval five days prior to implementation. 																								BSNL has challenged Trais order, alleging it seemed to be worded in a way that virtually applied to only BSNL and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, sources said. BSNL felt the Trai order did not apply to other companies which operated various services through group entities. The order came at a time when BSNL was readying to launch its cellular services CellOne.

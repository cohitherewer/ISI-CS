 Thursday, September 12, 2002 				 Gallo to acquire Martini winery
 FRANK J. PRIAL 																								New York, Sept. 11: E amp;J Gallo, the worlds largest wine producer, has agreed to acquire the Louis M. Martini Winery of St. Helena, California, one of the oldest premium wineries in the Napa Valley. 																								Terms of the deal, announced late Monday, were not disclosed. 																								The Martini winery produces 120,000 to 150,000 cases of wine a year; Gallo, which is based in Modesto, California, produces about 6 million cases a year. 																								Owning Martini will give Gallo a larger presence in the Napa Valley, supplementing the companys already vast holdings in the neighbouring Sonoma County. The acquisition is the latest step in Gallos efforts to change its image from that of a producer of inexpensive blended and fortified wines based in Californias Central Valley to a maker of premium varietal wines based in Healdsburg, in Sonoma County.

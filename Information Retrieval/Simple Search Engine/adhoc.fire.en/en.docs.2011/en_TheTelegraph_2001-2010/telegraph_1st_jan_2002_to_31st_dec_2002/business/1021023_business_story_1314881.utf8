 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 22: Indian Aluminium Company Ltd (Indal), the Aditya Birla group company, has registered a marginal 2 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 31.5 crore in the quarter ended September 30 against Rs 30.7 crore during the corresponding period last year.																								The company would have posted a negative growth in net profit had the interest charges not reduced substantially. Indal bore an interest of Rs 6.42 crore in the second quarter against an interest outgo of Rs 9.3 crore in the corresponding period last year. The turnover has, however, risen by 10 per cent to Rs 369.5 crore against Rs 334.9 crore in the first quarter last year.																								The major contributor to its income remains the aluminium segment with Rs 250 crore while the chemical segment contributed Rs 141.5 crore.																								The companys metal production for the six-month period stood at 20,049 tonnes against 22,125 tonnes in the first half of last year. The company attributes this to the disruption of operations at the Hirakud smelter by a cyclone early this year.																								The overall production from the two-sheet plant at Belur and Taloja stood at 32, 358 tonnes against a production of 35,929 tonnes in the first half of last year.

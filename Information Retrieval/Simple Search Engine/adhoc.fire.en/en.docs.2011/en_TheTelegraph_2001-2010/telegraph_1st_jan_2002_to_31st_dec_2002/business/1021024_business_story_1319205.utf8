 Thursday, October 24, 2002 				 Oil unions threaten strike 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 23: Oil sector employees have threatened to go on a complete indefinite strike in case the government decides to go ahead with the privatisation of Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL).																								The threat, delivered in a letter written by the 45,000-strong Oil Sector Officers Association to petroleum minister Ram Naik, alludes to an earlier 20-page letter written to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								The association pointed out that during the 1971 war, multinationals like Esso, Caltex and Burma Shell did not help the government maintain adequate fuel stocks and remained lukewarm on the supply of petro products to the defence sector, forcing it to depend solely on Indian Oil Corporation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, September 05, 2002 				 TCS on overseas recruitment spree 
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Sept 4: The Rs 4,187-crore Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is aggressively focussing on recruiting from major international business management schools and engineering institutions in a move to consolidate its position as a global player. The infotech major has already commenced recruitment from the London Business School and is scouting other campuses in the UK and US for talent.																								This is part of our overall strategy to employ skilled personnel from the countries in which we operate. The present trend is to have around 75 per cent of local talent. This is also because most countries like to ensure job prospects for their citizens, explains Atul Takle, vice-president for corporate communications.																								TCS plans to recruit more than 3,000 people during the current financial year, of which 2,500 will be from campus interviews. The company has already employed 1,500 people and around 1,700 more will be on the roster within the next six months.																								The companys expansion plans and its foray into new business areas has necessitated the intake of new talent with varied skills and domain expertise. Takle says that the company will strengthen its China operations from 40 to around 200 by March 2003.																								TCS is also putting together a team of around 100 people for their new chip design venture. A very large scale integration chip design team will develop technologies for telecom, multimedia and process control. The global market for chip design is estimated at $ 20-30 billion.																								Another focus area for the company is information security consulting. With norms getting stricter by the day and the growing need to protect information, eSecurity is seen as major revenue earner. We have more than 100 engineers in the security practice. Last year, the company earned Rs 8.5 crore from this unit. For 2002-03, we have set a target of Rs 50 crore for security consulting.

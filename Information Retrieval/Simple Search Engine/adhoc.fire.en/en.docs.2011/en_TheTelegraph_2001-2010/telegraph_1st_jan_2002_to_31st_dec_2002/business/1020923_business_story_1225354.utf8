 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Sept. 22: Wipro Consulting is sprucing up its act to face the IBM-PricewaterhouseCoopers combine in the infotech arena. The consulting arm of the Rs 736.8-crore Wipro Infotech is all set to use the tried and in-house tested Six Sigma engine to drive growth in the consultancy business segment. Wipro Infotech is the IT and communication services division of Wipro Limited.																								Six Sigma is a powerful statistical tool that helps reduce costs on all levels and also helps to gain optimum usage of the technology implemented. To achieve Six Sigma, a process must not produce more than 3.4 defects per million opportunities. It results in low error rate, less time and cost overruns, and ultimately better project performance. The disciplined, data-driven methodology eliminates defects in any processfrom manufacturing to transactional, from products to services.																								We have successfully implemented the Six Sigma formula to reduce bottomlines by almost Rs 30 crore within the organisation. It is this experience that we wish to leverage and deliver cost-effective workable solutions for our clients. Our consulting services have two clear focus points  to spur revenue growth and ensure production and business efficiency, head of the consulting division and chief knowledge and technology officer Anurag Srivastava said.																								The consultancy division will focus mainly on serving clients based in India, Asia-Pacific and West Asia. Srivastava adds that currently, the company will provide services for the finance, telecom and manufacturing sectors only. The consultancy division was incorporated in April this year and till now, has been providing services to the companys own clients.

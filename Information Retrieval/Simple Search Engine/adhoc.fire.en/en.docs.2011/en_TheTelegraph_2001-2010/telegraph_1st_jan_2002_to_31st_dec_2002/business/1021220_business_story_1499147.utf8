 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: Gold prices skyrocketed to touch near 7-year high levels at Rs 5,680 in the local bullion market today on frantic buying triggered by an extremely bullish trend overseas. 																								The price shot up to touch the days high of Rs 5,680, a level seen in February 1996, on reports of a remarkable rise in its prices in London, where it quoted around $ 354 an ounce in the afternoon.																								The rise in yellow metal in Asian countries to $ 354 gave a new meaning to the term bull run. It moved between $ 339 and $ 354 range during the day.

																								Rome, Nov, 26 (AFP): Fiat has agreed to suspend a controversial restructuring plan designed to shed 8,100 jobs and save its loss-making auto wing during crisis talks with Italys government and unions, a government official said.																								Regional affairs minister Enrico La Loggia said the company had agreed to suspend the plan until December 5 to allow more time to negotiate with unions.																								Industry minister Antonio Marzano is to hold further talks with Fiat executives and union officials tomorrow, La Loggia said. The announcement came late on Monday at the end of a four-hour crisis meeting in Rome between government ministers, Fiat management and union officials called to discuss the crisis at the automaker.																								Marzano told newspersons that the first tranche of some 5,000 layoffs at the companys auto plants, due to begin on December 2, would be pushed back as a result. Union leaders hailed the climb-down as a victory. Weve reached a constructive result, nobody will be laid off on December 2, said Giorgio Airaudo, a metalworkers union official at the talks.																								That was the precondition we wanted in order to discuss the companys plan, he added.																								Earlier, officials said Fiat had signalled it was prepared to ease the controversial restructuring plan. 																								.Rome fes115																								ld fiat thousands march in rome to protest fiats layoff plans																								rome, nov 26 (ap) tens of thousands of striking fiat workers marched through rome today to protest the ailing automakers plans to lay off about 8,100 people.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pawar: Optimist																								New Delhi, Dec. 6: NIIT today recorded a net profit of Rs 1.31 crore for its fourth quarter ended September 30, 2002, compared with Rs 12.5 crore a year ago, reflecting a drop of 89.5 per cent.																								Consequently, the company has made a provision of Rs 5.7 crore for doubtful debts in the fourth quarter.																								NIITs global brand revenues also came down to Rs 799.5 crore from Rs 1,139 crore in the corresponding period last year. As a result, the NIIT board has recommended maintaining the dividend at Rs 4.50 per equity share of Rs 10.																								However, NIIT reported a 26 per cent jump in its global revenues (NIIT Ltd and its subsidiaries) at Rs 243.1 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, as against Rs 193 crore in the third quarter ended June 30, 2002.																								The company claimed that lead indicators like the order intake for software services have also grown steadily over the last six quarters. 																								NIIT had posted a steady increase in the order book from $ 18 million in the first quarter to $ 29 million in the second quarter, $ 33 million in the third quarter and $ 33.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.																								Enrolments in the learning business grew 22 per cent in the fourth quarter to 132,262.																								Commenting on the companys performance in the year just ended, NIIT chairman Rajendra S. Pawar said, The company handled the challenging year with resilience. By recording quarter-on-quarter growth for the third consecutive quarter in both businesses, NIIT is on a growth path.																								NIIT made three acquisitions during the financial year, that complement its identified technologies and verticals like knowledge solutions, finance and insurance and SAP implementation practice.																								The companys international business contributed Rs 420.05 crore to NIITs total annual revenues while Rs 379.4 crore was contributed by business from India.

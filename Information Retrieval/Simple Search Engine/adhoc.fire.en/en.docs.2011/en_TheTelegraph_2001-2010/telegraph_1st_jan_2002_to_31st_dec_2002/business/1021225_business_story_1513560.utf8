 Wednesday, December 25, 2002 				 L amp;T board meeting put off
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 24: Larsen amp; Toubros (L amp;T) board meeting planned for December 28 has been put off. There is no official word on the reason. 																								We have scheduled the board meeting sometime next month, said a senior L amp;T official. He said the convenience of all board members was kept in mind before taking the decision.																								He refused to call it a postponement, saying bourses have not been sent the mandatory intimation yet. When we have not informed stock exchanges, how can we call it a postponement?, the official explained.																								The change is sure to fuel speculation that the move is yet another attempt by the company to blunt the A V Birla groups resistance to the cement de-merger. The Birlas open offer for 20 per cent of L amp;T, now frozen by Sebi, has not evoked a favourable response from FIs. This emboldened the L amp;T management to come out strongly against the groups bid to wrest control. 																								The meeting would have discussed a proposal by CDC to pick up a stake in the company that would have been spawned after the L amp;T cement spin-off.

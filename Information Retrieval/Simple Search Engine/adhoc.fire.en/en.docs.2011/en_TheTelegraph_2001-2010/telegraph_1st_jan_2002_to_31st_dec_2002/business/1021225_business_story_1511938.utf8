 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE																								Durgapur, Dec. 24: Steel Authority of Indias (SAIL) Alloy Steels Plant (ASP) has flagged off the first export consignment of 1,920 tonnes of stainless steel slabs. The plant, which bagged an order for 10,000 tonnes of low nickel variety stainless steel HR coils from China, is sending the slabs to Salem for rolling into HR coils before being shipped to China. 																								This export order is significant for ASP as demand in the domestic market has been shrinking and prices falling. 																								We are fully geared up to cater to the order as servicing this order is bound to open up more opportunities for us, said ASPs executive director, N.P. Jayaswal. 																								With the firming up of the international steel market, the plant plans to tap the export market. Keeping this in view, ASP plans to enhance the production of stainless steel to over 5,000-tonnes a month.

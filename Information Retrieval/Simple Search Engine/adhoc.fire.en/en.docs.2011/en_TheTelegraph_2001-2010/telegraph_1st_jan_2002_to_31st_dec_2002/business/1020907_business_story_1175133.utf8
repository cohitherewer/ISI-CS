The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, September 07, 2002 				 Globsyn GEMS set to sparkle
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Sept. 6: Globsyn Technologies (GTL) plans to extend its finishing school concept to the entertainment industry with the initiation of GEMS Globsyn Entertainment and Media School. The institute, which is expected to commence courses in January next year, will cover all aspects of entertainment from production to media management. 																								The idea is to blend management and technology and use it to structure the entertainment industry, GTL chairman and managing director Bikram Dasgupta said. It is necessary to bring in education to help tap the huge potential in this field. It is not possible to develop equity beyond a point without proper management skills. Our courses will aim to convert untapped potential into equity.																								Dasgupta believes that the finishing school will inject a certain degree of professionalism into the industry. Biswajit Guha, member of the executive committee of Association of Television Affiliates (ATA), agreed with Dasgupta that most technicians in Calcutta are on-the-job self-trained personnel, who can deliver the goods, but not quality. 																								With around 40 serials being shot daily in six studio floors and 15 to 20 Bengali films being made annually, there is definitely a requirement for trained technical personnel. Professional training will bring a degree of quality into the industry and help produce better films, adds Guha. The present environment in the studios is also pathetic. A touch of professionalism could help change the scenario, which is not very prospective at the moment.																								GTL is holding talks with eminent personalities in the entertainment industry to form the governing council. The core team is expected to be finalised by mid-September. 																								GTL also plans to address the placement issue for GEMS students. We will undertake forward integration in this sector in the near future. The entertainment industry offers enormous potency and there are plans to set up studio facilities, which would provide opportunities for students. Moreover, the right kind of training will help generate self-employment opportunities.																								GEMS will function as a separate business unit, which may later be hived off as a separate entity.

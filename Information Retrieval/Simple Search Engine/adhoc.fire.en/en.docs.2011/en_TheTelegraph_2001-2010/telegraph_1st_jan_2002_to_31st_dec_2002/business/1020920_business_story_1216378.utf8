 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 Barista Coffee going places
 GARIMA SINGH AMP; SHASHWATI GHOSH																								New Delhi, Sept 19: Amit Judge-promoted Barista Coffee is going international. While their first venture will be in Sri Lanka, it also plans to go to Gulf countries and south-east Africa, where they will be taking on the latte lord Starbucks of the US.																								In Sri Lanka, Barista has tied up with Jewlex, the biggest group in the retailing business. The joint venture will be owned 51 per cent by Barista Coffee and 49 per cent by Jewlex and the outlets will be under Barista Coffee Lanka Ltd. The first store is supposed to open within a week. 																								Although Barista will not face rivalry from Starbucks until it goes to the Gulf, it is quietly preparing to take on the Big Beanos in the international market. In India, Barista has a similar tieup with Tata Tea, who owns 34.3 per cent in Barista Coffee Company Ltd. 																								Sandeep Vyas, executive vice-president, market and communication said, We have got a huge expansion plan, among which Sri Lanka and Gulf countries are the immediate markets we are looking at. Our quality and response of customers have made us confident of being successful outside the country too.																								Within the country also, Barista is set to rejig its establishment with a new line of beverages, both cold and hot. The new line, which will be made available in all their 110 outlets across India, will be more area-specific than the first beverages they launched a couple of years ago. They have already introduced a range of Italian food and cookies to complement its range of Italian coffees. 																								Vyas said, The current line will have hot beverages like original Canadian and Jamaican coffee and will keep the clienteles interest in the establishment. We will be launching a full range of products, some of which will delight the Calcutta crowd.																								Calcutta, which boasts of three Barista outlets at present, will double by the end of this fiscal. Barista also plans to go to other eastern markets like Bhubaneswar and Guwahati. It is also planning to increase the number of stores from 110 to 250 this fiscal which means increasing its presence in 20 cities up from 17.

 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Pfizer India looks at ways to integrate Pharmacia
 VIVEK NAIR 																								Mumbai, Sept. 15: Close on the wheels of the world-wide acquisition of Pharmacia Corp by Pfizer Inc, the latters domestic subsidiary has begun examining ways to blend operations of the two.																								Under the preliminary plans being considered here, products of the group may be bundled under three major segments that include cardio-vascular, anti-infectives and consumer products. Yet, sources did not rule out the possibility of more divisions being formed due to the enhanced product portfolio that will accrue to Pfizer from the acquisition of Pharmacia.																								They said that the company does not foresee any synergistic difficulties since products of Pharmacia are complementary with its huge basket of offerings. 																								In the next couple of months, the company will look into synergising the product portfolio of Pharmacia India Pvt Ltda closely held company with brands like Depo Provera (contraceptive), CeeOn/Healon (cataract) among others.																								Sources here said that even as the company is yet to arrive at a final decision, Pfizer may bring both these brands as well as Selsunthe anti-dandruff medicated shampoo acquired by Pharmacia earlier this yearunder its consumer product division which has other reputed brands like Benadryl and Gelusil, to name a few. Assimilating most of Pharmacias other brands into the Pfizer fold are not expected to be any problem. 																								While the combined sales force of the merged entity is expected to touch over 1,500, it is speculated in some circles that Pfizer India may opt for the buy-back route to mop up the remaining shares in Pharmacia Healthcare Ltd and de-list the entity in the months to come.

 Friday, December 27, 2002 				 Infotech to add new flavour to tea firms
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Dec. 26: With technology penetrating all sectors, the $ 20-billion Indian tea industry cannot remain far behind in using IT as an enabler. Tea majors Tata Tea and Goodricke are in talks with Navision India, Microsofts business solution distributor, to procure the Tea Estate and Nursery Management modules. The modules will reduce costs and ensure smooth management of resources while helping tea estates manage the entire range of activities right from leaf-plucking to packaging. 																								The Tea Estate and Nursery Management modules have been designed to integrate activities specific to the tea industry. Moreover, all the details get reflected in the financial statements, explains managing director Yash Nagpal. 																								The solution will be a major initiative and will drive growth in vertical solutions in the east. We have spoken to members of the Tea Board and so far the response has been encouraging.																								The Tea Estate module is designed to plan and control field activities involving leaf plucking, herbicide and pesticide application, cultivation, sprinkler irrigation, drainage, rationalisation of fertiliser application and transportation of green leaves to the factory.																								The Nursery Management Module has provisions for streamlining nursery practices like bed preparation, sieving, hand weeding, transplantation herbicide and fertiliser application.																								The company has also introduced solutions for sectors like construction, health, and agriculture. There are special solutions for the media and advertising, lawyers and for maintenance of ships and aircraft.																								Armed with products that cater specifically to the small and medium enterprise segment, Navision is set to close at least 10 deals by December-end in the east alone. 																								Nagpal said the company would invest around  7 million in its Indian operations. We have already invested  3 million mainly on training of solution centres, product methodology and in understanding customer needs and implementation of solutions, he added.																								Navision will also increase its solution centres across the country from 75 to 150 by the end of next year. It is also in the process of recruiting personnel for the new branch offices in Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta.

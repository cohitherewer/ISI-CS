 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 Ficci meet to chart Bengal growth plan
 GARIMA SINGH				 	 Lodha: Best foot forward																								New Delhi, Nov. 6: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) will suggest ways to integrate several segmentssuch as the services sector, the knowledge industry, petrochemicals, horticulture, agro-processing and portsin a bid to put West Bengal firmly on the growth track. 																								The suggestions will be made during interactions that will form part of Ficcis national executive committee meeting to be held in Calcutta later this week. 																								We want industries relating to the service sector, knowledge-driven industry, chemicals and petro-chemicals, mineral-based industry, agro-processing, horticulture and ports to be integrated to provide a thrust to the region, as these have been recognised as its areas of core competence, Ficci president R. S. Lodha told The Telegraph.																								We will present our views and ideas before the chief minister, he added. This will be done when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya and Planning Commission member N. K. Singh address members of the executive committee on Friday.																								We want to see eastern India gallop ahead just the way southern and western India have done, Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said. We need to inculcate a positive attitude towards the involvement of the private sector, which can create wealth and employment for people in the region, he added. Mitra said it was time that the region picked up speed or else we will witness a fractured economy in future.																								We wish to see agro-processing parks, chemical parks, knowledge parks and more common effluent treatment plants in the near future. Tourism, water sports and port facilities are other areas with potential which need to be harnessed, Lodha said.																								The government must work in participation with the private sector in an atmosphere where infrastructure is jointly created, transaction cost is reduced and worker-management co-operation is increased. 																								Some 70 industrialists who are also members of the executive committee are expected to participate in the meeting. Those who have confirmed their participation include G. P. Goenka, chairman of the Duncan-Goenka group, Chirayu R. Amin, managing director of Alembic Chemical Works, K. K. Bangur, chairman, Graphite India, S. K. Birla, director Birla group, O. P. Lohia of Indo-Rama Synthetics, Ashwin Dani, vice-chairman Asian Paints, Harshvardhan Goenka, chairman RPG Enterprises and Sudhir Jalan, chairman and managing director, Bells Controls.

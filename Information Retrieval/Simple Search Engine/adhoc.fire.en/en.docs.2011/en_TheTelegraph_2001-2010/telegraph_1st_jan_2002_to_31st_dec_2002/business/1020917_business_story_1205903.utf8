 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Bayer to focus on OTC pain killers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 16: Global chemicals, plastics and pharma conglomerate Bayer AGs Indian arm has decided to rework its focus in pharmaceuticals by concentrating on over-the-counter pain killers and antacid drugs.																								It will also look into the possibility of acquisitions in the segment to strengthen its presence in India. D. Kambeck, chairman and managing director of Bayer Group said, We havent got our strategies right for the Indian market yet. We are working on it. Bayers Indian health care arm showed a 4.4 per cent drop in sales last year in an otherwise booming pharma market.																								Bayer has also tied up with an as yet unamed marketing partner to push the OTC drugs. Bayer already has a co-marketing alliance with Wockhardt for Glucobay. Kambeck, who said Bayers Indian operations were being restructured, added the German major would be selling off its famous pesticide brand Baygon on a global scale. 																								However, as Baygon now sells mostly in south Asia, parts of Africa and Latin America, interest on this brand would be high among major chemical firms in the country.

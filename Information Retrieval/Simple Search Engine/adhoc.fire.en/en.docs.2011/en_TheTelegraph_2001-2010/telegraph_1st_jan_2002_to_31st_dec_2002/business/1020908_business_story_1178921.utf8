 Sunday, September 08, 2002 				 Koshika Tele goes to Supreme Court
																								New Delhi, Sept. 7 (PTI): Koshika Telecom has moved the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court order directing the company to pay Rs 81.87 crore to the government for the Uttar Pradesh (east) cellular circle allotted to it. The private cellular company has moved the apex court after the division bench of Delhi High Court, comprising Justice Usha Mehra and Justice R.C. Jain, upheld the order of its single judge on the issue.																								We are of the opinion that the conditions imposed by the single judge cannot be said to be unjustified or harsh by any standard, rather the same appear to be eminently justified, the high court had said in its order passed on August 26 while dismissing its petition challenging the May 31 order of the single judge.																								When contacted Vinay Rai, chairman and group managing director of the Usha group, refused to comment on the issue saying it is a sub-judice matter. We, however, have moved the Supreme Court on the matter, Rai said. According to the August 26 order, the company has been directed to pay the licence fee at the rate of 20 per cent against the current rate of 10 per cent of the gross revenue.

 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Pune, Dec. 16: The Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (Telco) is all geared up to corner a 20 per cent market share of the highly competitive C-segment with its indigenously developed sedanIndigo. 																								Nearly 23 months of rigorous preparations later, the car will be available across the country from December 19, a day after its official launch. The Indigo is Telcos second sedan since the launch of the hugely successful Indicawhich announced the companys arrival on the passenger car scenein December 1998. 																								Unveiling the car here today, Telco executive director (passenger car business) V. Sumantran said the Indigo is set to create a new chapter in the history of the company.																								The Indigo will be available in five variants, two diesel and three petrol. While refusing to give the price structure for sedan, Sumantran indicated the vehicle will be priced between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7 lakh.																								The Indigo will be competitive both feature-wise as well as in pricing. We are optimistic that the car will be accepted by the customers as they have accepted Indica. It will be the second chapter of success, he said.																								The Indigo is being rolled out as part of the companys spate of new product launches scheduled between August 2002 to July 2003. The launch of the Indigo shows the spirit of Telco, which faced a rough patch only a couple of years back, he said. 																								The sedan comes with an 18-month unlimited kilometre warranty and will be available through 100 dealerships backed by a 436-strong service network across 168 cities.																								The Indigo petrol comes with an 85 bhp engine, while the diesel version is the only vehicle in this class with a turbo-charged engine. An entirely new powertrain, a three link independent suspension and large 14-inch wheels are other unique features. An extended wheelbase with a semi-forward profile helps maintain a compact overall length and large interior space without compromising the manoeuvrability of the car in tight traffic conditions.																								With 450 litres of trunk space and a 42-litre fuel tank capacity, the Indigo is appropriately suited for long-family drives on weekends and vacations, the company said.																								The car has undergone extensive and rigorous tests at the internationally reputed test facilities of MIRA, UK. The Tata Indigo also complies with European safety norms of full frontal, offset and rear impact. 																								Sumantran added that the company has invested around Rs 350 crore to manufacture Indigo and the proposed Estate on the Indica platform. The Indigo exemplifies the evolution of the Telcos capabilities to offer distinctive, trend-setting products across the spectrum of the passenger car segment, he added.

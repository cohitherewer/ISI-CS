The swap ratio for the merger has been fixed at one share of Reliance Industries for 11 shares of Reliance Petroleum.

Reliance today said its group companies had complied with all the laws and was co-operating with DCA in its investigation of accounts. If Reliances application for compunding of offences is accepted, the charges would be dropped on payment of the fine.

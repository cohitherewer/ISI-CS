 Sunday, December 15, 2002 				 Satyam, Wipro disaster units in Mauritius
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 14: Software majors Satyam Computers and Wipro Technologies will set up disaster-recovery centres in Mauritius.																								Baboo R. Gujadhur, managing director of Bank of Mauritius, the island nations apex bank, said, Wipro and Satyam are among the several Indian software firms that have decided to invest in Mauritius.																								The disaster-recovery centres housing modern telecommunication network facilities will be equipped to take over the firms ongoing development projects in case of emergency situations like war or natural disasters. 																								We have decided to set up a disaster-recovery centre in Mauritius, the official spokesman of Satyam Computers told The Telegraph. However, he added, the firm is yet to decide on the size of the investment. Wipro officials, on the other hand, neither denied nor confirmed the move.																								Earlier, Infosys Technologies, the countrys leading software firm, had announced that it will set up its first recovery centre in Mauritius with an investment of around Rs 125 crore.																								Rising insurgency and fear of another war against Pakistan had sent Indian software firms scurrying for a safer place from where it will be able to sustain its operations. Also, the possibility of losing vital data in a war-situation had made them step up their efforts to draw up disaster recovery plans.																								Gujadhur said software firms are eyeing Mauritius as it is a cheaper country to operate from. Flight connectivity with India is good and we have a well-developed financial market with major international banks operating in our country, Gujadhur said. Satyam has around 40 software professionals and Wipro around 30 professionals for implementation of disaster recovery plans.																								For the half-year ended September 30, 2002 Wipro Technologies revenues have leapt by 21 per cent (year-on-year) to Rs 1,060 crore. 																								For Satyam Computers, revenues for the half-year period (April-September) stood at around Rs 499 crore, an increase of 17 per cent year-on-year.

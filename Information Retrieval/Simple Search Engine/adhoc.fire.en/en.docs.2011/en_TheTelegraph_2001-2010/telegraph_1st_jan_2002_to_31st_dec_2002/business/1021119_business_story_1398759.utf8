Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Nov. 18: The Tea Board of India and the tea industry plan to appoint IMRB to rate exporters. The rating will take off in the next three to four months. The appointment of a rating agency has been recommended by international consultants Accenture to ensure a better image for Indian exporters in the global markets. 																								The Tea Board will also appoint an inspection agency to ensure that exporters abide by the rules for using the logo for Indian tea being developed by it. The board has drawn up a logo called World Gold Standard for Indian tea for the export markets. Any exporter can seek one-time approval from the board for using the logo.																								We recently launched the logo in Russia and buyers there are also keen to use the World Gold Standard for 100 per cent Indian tea on their packets, Tea Board chairman N. K. Das said at a press conference here today. 																								Indian tea exports suffered a setback this year in the Russian markets. Last year, exports to Russia stood at 70 million kg, but that is expected to go down by 15-20 million kg this year. Exports till September stood at 137.10 million kg. The tea industry is looking at an export figure of 196 million kg in the current year the same as last year.																								The industry, along with the Indian Merchant Tea Exporters Forum and the Tea Board, will organise the India International Tea Convention between March 6-8. It will give tea producers, exporters, blenders, distributors, packaging companies, equipment manufacturers and suppliers an opportunity to interact with each other. The convention will showcase the best of Indias tea product portfolio, Das said.

 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 Wal-Mart sales trail forecasts
 BRAD DORFMAN																								Chicago, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the worlds largest retailer, said on Monday that November sales at stores open for at least a year were tracking at the low end of its guidance, adding to concerns about the strength of consumer spending in a sluggish economy.																								In addition, department store chain Federated Department Stores Inc  which owns the Macys and Bloomingdales chains  called sales disappointing. Bankrupt retailer Kmart Corp also said sales in the latest week softened.																								A weak economy, erosion in consumer confidence, job losses and a possible war with Iraq are casting a shadow over the key holiday shopping season in which many retailers traditionally book about a quarter of their annual sales and the bulk of their profits. Most analysts and retailers look at November-December sales together to even out changes in the calendar.																								Target Corp, the No. 3 US discounter, said same-store sales last week and for the month-to-date were above its plan, which calls for a decline of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent.

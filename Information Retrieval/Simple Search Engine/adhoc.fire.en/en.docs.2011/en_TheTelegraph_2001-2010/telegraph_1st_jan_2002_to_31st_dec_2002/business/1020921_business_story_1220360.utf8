																								New Delhi, Sept. 20 (PTI): Indias imports of 300 sensitive items during April-July 2002 increased by about 25 per cent to Rs 4476.81 crore mainly on account of a surge in imports of crude palm oil and soyabean oil.																								Provisional data compiled by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade indicates that imports of the 300 items touched Rs 4476.81 crore compared with Rs 3588.08 crore during the first four months of the current fiscal.																								The significant increase in imports was mainly due to higher imports of edible oils valued at Rs 3096 crore against Rs 2120 crore last year.																								As per the data, while imports of crude palm oil have gone up, that of refined soyabean and palm oil have gone down leading to better utilisation of the processing capacity in the country.

Barring foodgrains, cotton and silk, alcoholic beverages and poultry, imports of all other sensitive items registered an increase in imports.																								Imports of milk and milk products increased to Rs 16.35 crore from Rs 6.88 crore during the period while that of automobiles increased to Rs 68.42 crore from Rs 21.48 crore last year.

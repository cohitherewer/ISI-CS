Net sales were up by a good 60 per cent to Rs 37.19 crore (Rs 23.31 crore) while its operational expenditure went up by 48 per cent to Rs 29.98 crore (Rs 20.24 crore) bringing about a sharp improvement in the margins.

The stock currently trades at Rs 78 discounting its June quarter annualised EPS of Rs 13.46 by just about six times. At a 19 per cent growth rate in profits and a discounting of just about six times the stock is cheap.																																											FINOLEX INDUSTRIES 																																											The largest manufacturer of rigid poly vinyl chloride (PVC) in the country, Finolex Industries Limited has ostensibly reported a fine performance for the first quarter ended June with a growth of 166 per cent in the net profits over the previous corresponding period. However, an interesting aspect of this is that the total income was down 1 per cent to Rs 213.17 crore (Rs 214.36 crore) but total spending of the company went down by a massive 14 per cent to Rs 164.90 crore (Rs 197.91 crore). Income from operations was up 1 per cent over the last year to Rs 211.34 crore (Rs 208.88 crore) against which there has been a 15 per cent decline in the operational costs at Rs 149.92 crore (Rs 175.93 crore) substantially improving the margins. Operating profits were up 86 per cent over the year ago period to Rs 61.43 crore (Rs 32.95 crore) while OPM shot up to 29 per cent from just about 16 per cent during the same period last year. Further weakening the position was a 67 per cent drop in other income, which stood at Rs 1.83 crore (Rs 5.48 crore) but this was more or less compensated by a 51 per cent drop in the interest cost which stood at Rs 4.15 crore (Rs 8.50 crore). Depreciation was up 1 per cent to Rs 10.49 crore (Rs 10.39 crore). With an across the board savings in costs the company reported a rise of 149 per cent in its before tax profits which in turn took up the tax provisioning by 57 per cent to Rs 4.85 crore (Rs 3.09 crore) leading to a 166 per cent rise in the net profits at Rs 43.78 crore (Rs 16.45 crore). The stock currently trades at Rs.30 discounting its June quarter annualized EPS of Rs 13.55 by just about twice. Seems pretty cheap.

During the quarter the company reported an extraordinary expense of Rs 0.40 crore against an income of Rs 18.56 crore during the previous corresponding quarter, which if considered would mean a drop of 84 per cent in net profits over the same period last year. The stock is currently trading at Rs 83 discounting its June quarter annualised EPS of Rs 8.07 by 10 times.

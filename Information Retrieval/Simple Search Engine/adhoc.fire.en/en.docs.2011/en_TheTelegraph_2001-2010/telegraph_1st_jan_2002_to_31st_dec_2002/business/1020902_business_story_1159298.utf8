 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Inflation shoots up to 35-wk high
																								New Delhi, Sept. 1 (PTI): A fall in primary articles and fuel prices failed to check the inflation rate which went up by 0.38 per cent due to a rise in prices of manufactured products, to touch a 35-week high of 3.41 per cent for the week ending August 17.																								The annual rate of inflation stood at 3.03 per cent for the previous week and 5.35 per cent a year ago. 																								Wholesale prices (WPI) rose by 0.1 per cent at 166.9, up from 166.7 for the previous week.																								The revised inflation rate for the week ending June 22 was at 2.74 per cent against a provisional figure of 2.24 per cent, while final WPI stood at 165.2 against a provisional figure of 164.4.																								Index for primary articles declined by 0.3 per cent to 173.7 from 174.2 during the last week mainly due to cheaper prices of food articles like tea (4 per cent) and fruits and vegetables and inland fish (3 per cent). Prices of barley climbed up (6 per cent), jowar and bajra (3 per cent each), maize (2 per cent) and masur (1 per cent). 																								Index for non food articles rose by 0.9 per cent at 164.4 from 162.9 a week ago and 156.2 a year ago due to higher price of groundnut seed and fodder (6 per cent each), raw silk (4 per cent), raw rubber (3 per cent), niger seed (2 per cent).

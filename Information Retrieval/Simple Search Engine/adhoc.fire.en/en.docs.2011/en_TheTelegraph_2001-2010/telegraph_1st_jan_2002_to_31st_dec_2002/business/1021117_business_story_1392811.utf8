 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 16: There is a new consulting firm on the block that wants to retrain employees thrown out of jobs. Grow Talent company, which has signed a strategic partnership with the US-based Right Management Services, wants to do just that but it will be calling this service career transition and organisational consulting service.																								Anil Sachdev, founder and CEO of Grow Talent, says, The introduction of career transition services will benefit employers who understand that providing these services for departing and redeployed employees represents sound business practice and maintains the dignity of employees leaving the organisation.																								Says Glenn Heidenreich, vice-president (Asia), Right Management Consultants, More than 80 per cent of the Fortune 500 companies are our clients who benefit from our services in organisational consulting and career transition.																								Grow Talent has till now managed to bag three projects from its partner Right Management to provide its expertise in career transition. Although Sachdev declined to reveal the name of its clients, he confirmed the companies are big financial corporations.																								Sachdev adds, Companies like Hindustan Lever, Larsen and Toubro, Godrej, Hughes Software and Dr Reddys Laboratory are amongst few companies who have utilised our services in the field of leadership development, coaching, acquiring talent, appreciation process and power enhancement process.																								Heidenreich says a career transition process can stretch from a basic three-day programme to even a 12-month process if needed. 																								Sachdev says, A major reason why big companies take the pain of hiring consultants is to ensure that they dont lose out on their brand name, enjoy a goodwill and help maintain a mental stability of employees who have enjoyed the loyal services of their employees.

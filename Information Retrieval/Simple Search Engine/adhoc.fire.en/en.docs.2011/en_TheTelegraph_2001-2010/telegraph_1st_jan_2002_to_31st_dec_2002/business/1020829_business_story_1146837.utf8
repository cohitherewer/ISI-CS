 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: Bharti Telesonic, Indias first private long distance operator and a fully owned subsidiary of Bharti Tele-Ventures, on Tuesday signed the interconnect agreement for national long distance services with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL).																								This will allow BSNL to connect the STD calls made from Bhartis network and take it to its subscribers end. Similarly, calls emanating from BSNLs network to IndiaOne network will also be delivered to the subscribers of Bharti. 																								The revenue share has been retained at 60:40. Under this arrangement, if a call originates from Bhartis network, the company keeps the 60 per cent of the charges for the total call minutes while the carrier BSNL keeps the 40 per cent. Similarly, BSNL will get to keep 60 per cent and will give 40 per cent to Bharti if the call emanates from its network. Bharti Telesonic had earlier signed an interconnect agreement with both BSNL and MTNL to provide ILD services.																								The physical interconnect between Bharti Telesonic and BSNL is expected to be completed by mid September. Company executives say the interconnect agreement with MTNL will be signed soon. With the signing of the interconnect agreement, IndiaOne will now be able to extend its services to over 40 million fixed line subscribers of BSNL besides extending the services to over 8 million mobile subscribers. 																								IndiaOne was responsible for bringing down prices sharply by first catalysing the massive 62.5 per cent rate cut in the domestic long distance charges and later by dropping the international call charges by 40 per cent. 																								According to N Arjun, CEO of Bharti Telesonic Ltd, The interconnect agreement with BSNL is another milestone for Bharti Telesonic and IndiaOne in its mission to bring world class long distance services at affordable rates and providing a choice to the consumer.

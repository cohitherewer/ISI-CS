 HAITHAM HADDADIN																								New York, Oct. 4 (Reuters): Tokyo stocks rebounded from 19-year lows on Friday, with analysts warning of more volatility ahead as investors await a government plan that could unleash a torrent of bankruptcies forcing banks to mop up bad debts.																								After falling half a per centage point in the first 10 minutes of trade, the benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average swivelled to end the day up 91.12 points or 1.02 percent at 9,027.55, pulled by bargain-hunting in battered blue-chips such as NTT DoCoMo.																								In Europe, swirling rumours sent investors fleeing from top financials such as Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank to push European shares sharply lower by mid-session on Friday ahead of the weeks key economic data. 																								Stocks in the US are set for an essentially flat open on Friday, with Wall Street bracing for the crucial September jobs report which is expected to point to weaker labour market conditions.

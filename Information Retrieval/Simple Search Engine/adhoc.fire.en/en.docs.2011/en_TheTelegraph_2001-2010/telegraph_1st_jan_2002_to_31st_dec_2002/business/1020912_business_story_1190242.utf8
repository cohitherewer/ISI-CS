The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, September 12, 2002 				 Somnath sets up meet with Sony next week
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Sept. 11: Sony Corporation managing director Jiro Aiko will discuss possible investment in Bengal with West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) chairman Somnath Chatterjee in Mumbai on September 17.																								Aiko has written to me, requesting a meeting in Mumbai since he cannot come to Calcutta. I expect talks on investments in the state. We held discussions on the issue during my visit to Japan. We hope something positive will emerge from the parleys. The industrial climate in the state is conducive to investment, Chatterjee told The Telegraph here today.																								However, industry watchers in the state feel Sony will not rush into Bengal with funds. Japanese investors are very cautious. They will look into all aspects before putting in their money, they said. They pointed to Mitsubishi Chemicals, which invested Rs 1,600 crore into a PTA plant at Haldia, held several rounds of talks with the state government and other agencies before taking a final decision. In this case too, we feel it will take time before the investments come in.																								State industry department officials feel that Sony may come in any of the areas like electronics, entertainment, handset manufacturing and others. Gopal Krishna, managing director of WBIDC, said: All discussions are being held at a high-level. I will not be able to comment on the matter.																								Sony India, set up by the Japanese electronic giant in 1995 as a 100 per cent subsidiary, has come a long way, having embarked on a path of fast growth backed by skilled manpower, infrastructure, manufacturing facility, systems integration, distribution network and other facilities. Its Dharuhera unit in Haryana can make 2 lakh units of audio equipment and 3 lakh units of CTVs.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 18: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has issued regulations on the quality of service for voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP)-based international long distance (ILD) service.																								An expert committee was constituted under the aegis of Trai with representatives from the telecom regulator, department of telecom, Telecommunication Engineering Centre, the Centre for the Development of Telematics and academia to set the norms for assessing the quality of service offered by ILD service providers. The regulations have been issued based on the recommendations of the committee.																								These regulations provide for end-to-end quality of service parameters to be met by ILD operators as well as in the ILD segment of the network. The regulation also prescribes the testing procedures and specifies the testing agency for this purpose. 																								In its recommendation on opening up of the ILD market, the Trai had recommended that ILD operators be permitted to employ VoIP as a technology option to engineer their ILD networks and offer two types of quality of service, one equivalent to landline (PSTN) which will be toll quality and another below toll quality. A set of parameters has been provided for the two types of networks. Telecommunication Engineering Centre of the ministry of communication has been specified as the testing agency.																								An official statement from the government said that these regulations will ensure that ILD operators provide toll quality of service to subscribers. Further, for a lower tariff, a below toll quality of service could be extended to the subscribers who desire to avail of such facility.

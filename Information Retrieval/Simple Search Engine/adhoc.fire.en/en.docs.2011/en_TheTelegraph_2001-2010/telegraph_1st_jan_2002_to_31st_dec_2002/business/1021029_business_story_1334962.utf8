 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 Dell sees potential in Asia-Pacific
				 	 small is beautiful: Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell introduces its smallest desktop computer OptiPlex SX260 in Tokyo on Monday. (AFP)																								Tokyo, Oct. 28 (AFP): The head of computer maker Dell today said he wants the firm to double in size by expanding into new business areas and benefiting from the Asia-Pacific market, which is set to become the worlds largest for computer systems.																								The Texas-based company also aims to become the market leader in Japan, where customer requirements for computers set the trend for other countries to follow, Michael Dell told a news conference in Tokyo.																								We believe that we can double the size of our revenues by pursuing attractive markets and by serving customers, the chairman and chief executive said, without giving a time-scale.																								Next year, the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan would become the second largest computer market in the world, growing to the largest by 2005, he said.																								This represents a significant opportunity for Dell with many new customers, said Dell.																								Dell has plenty of room to grow across PC servers, storage, services, software peripherals and data networking.																								These new areas would ultimately represent 50 per cent of the companys total business, said the chief executive.																								We continue to face a challenging market in an economic sense around the world, but Dell is succeeding by maintaining a monocled focus on customers, he told reporters.																								Computer makers have suffered from slump in demand over recent years and although the operating environment remained severe, there were signs of a rebound, Dell said.

 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 Pepsi Foods V-P moves to Godfrey Philips
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Sept. 10: Pepsi Foods executive vice-president Deepak Jolly is packing his bags and carrying them to Godfrey Philips India (GPI) Limited. 																								After an eight-year stint with cola giant Pepsi, Jolly will be joining the cigarette major as director corporate affairs, a post which has been lying vacant for some time. He will join next week. 																								Jolly will be replaced at Pepsi by Annie Cyraic, who is moving from Bechtel. 																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Jolly said, I am accepting the job offer in the executive committee of GPI. At Pepsi, I was handling media relations and internal communications. At GPI, my responsibility as director corporate affairs will include dealing with various industrial associations, pressure groups and government authorities. 																								Jolly said he had indicated to his top management at Pepsi about three months back that he wanted a change. Tobacco companies need serious lobbying in the wake of the tobacco Bill pending in Parliament, that discourages tobacco smoking in public places. 																								Jolly is also expected to join the Tobacco Institute of India (TII) as a representative of his company once he joins GPI.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 1: India Inc is looking at the Asean market to increase its export turnover at a time when domestic consumption has ground to a virtual standstill, with growth pegged at a mere 3 per cent per annum.																								Indian business feels that not only can trade with Asean countries be doubled from a current level of $ 7.8 billion within two years, but India can also forge a better relationship that will help secure greater FDI inflows. 																								Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a meeting that served as a curtain raiser for the India-Asean meet to be held this month in Delhi and Hyderabad, Ficci secretary general Amit Mitra said, Indian business needs new markets for its products where it can also expand. The Asean countries, with Myanmar joining in, is the closest to home for both purposes.

																								Calcutta, Dec. 2 (PTI): Nasscom will soon appoint a public relations firm in the US to promote Indian software in that country, its president Kiran Karnik said.																								Speaking at Infocom 2002 here today Karnik said since the US accounted for more than 60 per cent of the market for Indian IT industry, it was necessary to promote the India brand in that country. He said Nasscom would first promote the India brand, then the India IT brand and lastly the individual Indian companies involved in making the software. Other important destinations for the industry are Japan and Europe and new areas will also be targeted, he added. 																								The Nasscom chief said the dependence of Indian software companies on the US economy was as good as the other way round as US firms look for cheap imports.

 Saturday, December 07, 2002 				 Ordinance stalks loan dodgers 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 6: Continuing its tirade against non-performing loans, ICICI Bank today issued a notice to Jord Engineers India Ltd under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Ordinance 2002.																								Officials said that the company had undertaken an expansion-cum-diversification programme for setting up additional facilities for manufacturing 18,000 tonnes of steel fintubes and 3,000 tonnes of heat recovery steam generation systems.																								However, they alleged that the promoters have failed to complete the project. In spite of repeated negotiations, the promoters have not shown any commitment to work out a restructuring scheme. The account has been classified as a NPA by the lenders, an official claimed.																								Meanwhile, after slapping notices on 1,182 wilful defaulters, Punjab National Bank has started seizing and auctioning assets of firms which failed to settle dues.

Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Dec. 13: After two years of deliberation, Wipro Limited has finally commenced work on its software development and IT-enabled services centre in the city. The centre is being set up with an initial investment of Rs 50 crore.																								The software centre was the first project to be cleared by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee when he assumed office in November 2000. The project had been put on hold mainly due to the downturn in the IT industry.																								We expect to commission the centre within the next 15 to 18 months. We already have a critical mass of customers and are ready to move accounts to the centre as soon as it is operational, chairman and managing director Azim Premji said at the ground-breaking ceremony at Salt Lake in the city.																								The Wipro centre marks an ambitious beginning and will contribute significantly to the growth of the IT industry in the state. After a steady growth for the past few years, West Bengal is keen on accelerating its performance in the sector and will concentrate on attracting major investments, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on the occasion. 																								Bhattacharjee said the state would leverage the combined advantages of quality human resources, low attrition rates, low real estate costs and good communication infrastructure. He added that Wipros call centre services would help the state establish itself in the IT-enabled services sector.																								We will actively participate in the Bengal governments IT plans, Premji said. This is one of the few states that facilitates easy clearances and we are positive about our performance here.																								Premji further said the centre would house 1,000 employees as against the 2,500 employees projected earlier. 																								The centre will allow us to enhance our services in the eastern region for our computer systems, peripheral systems, sales and after-sales services. It will also service the requirements of clients in Europe, Japan and the UK, added Premji. The Wipro campus will include an exclusive customer care centre, a state-of-the-art learning centre comprising training rooms and lecture halls.																								Wipro provides comprehensive IT solutions and services, including systems integration, IT-enabled services and research and development services to global corporate.

 Friday, August 30, 2002 				 Two former WorldCom executives indicted
 [+uc('Jube Shiver Jr. Los Angeles Times- Washington Post News Service ')+]				 	 Sullivan: The games up																								Washington, Aug. 29: Two former top executives of WorldCom Inc. were indicted Wednesday on securities fraud and other charges, significantly widening the federal governments efforts to prosecute alleged accounting fraud at the now-bankrupt telecommunications giant. 																								The move is seen as a key step for the government to possibly seek an indictment of former WorldCom chief executive Bernard J. Ebbers, legal experts said, although Ebbers lawyers contend he had no knowledge of the accounting scheme under which profits were allegedly inflated by billions of dollars. 																								Federal prosecutors accused Scott D. Sullivan, the 40-year-old former chief financial officer of WorldCom, and Buford Yates Jr., the companys former director of general accounting, of directing a two-year-long scheme to conceal $ 3.8 billion in company expenses and boost profits. 																								The 24-page indictment also names two other WorldCom accounting executives, Betty Vinson and Troy Normand, as unindicted co-conspirators. However, court papers filed Wednesday indicate that Vinson and Normandalong with WorldCom controller David F. Myerswere prepared to plead guilty and cooperate with the government. 																								If the fraud is proven, it would be the largest accounting scandal in US history and would further tarnish WorldCom, once a high-flying tech giant that carries nearly half of the countrys internet traffic and runs MCI, the nations No. 2 long-distance carrier. 																								Attorney General John Ashcroft said he intended the governments indictment to send a clear message to deter corporate lawbreakers. 																								Todays indictments are the result of sustained law enforcement actions aimed at prosecuting corporate law-breakers and protecting the savings and pensions of Americans, Ashcroft said. With each arrest, indictment and prosecution, we send this clear message: corrupt corporate executives will be punished. Sullivan, who was arrested on Aug. 1 along with Myers, allegedly conspired with Yates to instruct subordinates to hide WorldComs mushrooming expenses by capitalizing expensesimproperly shifting costs from operating to capital expensesthus reducing reported expenses and artificially inflating profits. 																								In the seven count indictment, prosecutors alleged that the scheme began taking shape around 1999 when WorldCom entered into a large number of long-term lease agreements with other carriers to amass additional network capacity for an expected explosion in Internet traffic that never materialized. 																								Many of the leases, the indictment said, required WorldCom to make upfront payments to other carriers regardless of whether WorldCom actually used the additional capacity. Before the summer of 2000, WorldCom treated these payments as operating expenses. But as the number of carrier leases climbed and became a significant expense, WorldCom did an about face and began to capitalise the costs. By ordering subordinates to carry out the change, the indictment said, Sullivan and Yates engaged in an illegal scheme to ... falsely and fraudulently boost WorldComs reported earnings. 																								The moves allowed WorldCom to report to investors that its expenses were about 40 per cent of company revenue between 1999 and 2000, even though the actual figure was closer to 50 per cent. As Sullivan, Myers, Yates, Vinson, and Normand well knew, there was no justification in fact or under generally accepted accounting principles for these entries, the indictment says. 																								WorldComs accounting problems first surfaced in late June, when the company was forced to restate its earnings and admit that it wrongly listed $ 3.9 billion as capital expenses in 2001 and 2002. A month later, WorldCom filed the biggest bankruptcy filing in US history. Since then, the company has disclosed an additional $ 3.3 billion in inflated profits. Sullivan, Yates, and their co-conspirators were able to assure that WorldComs reported earnings exceeded its actual earnings from October 2000 through April 2002 by approximately $ 5 billion, said the indictment, which does not mention Ebbers at all.

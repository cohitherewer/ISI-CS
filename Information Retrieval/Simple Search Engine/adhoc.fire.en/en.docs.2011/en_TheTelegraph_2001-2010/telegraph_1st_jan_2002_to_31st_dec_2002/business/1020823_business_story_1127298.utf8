The unit manufactures 4,0005,000 CTVs per month on a contractual basis.																								Sources said talks are currently on with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC). It had earlier approached the Dhoots of Videocon to take over the unit.																								The company intends to invest Rs 100 crore once the deal is finalised, top-level sources added.																								The company had earlier announced plans to set up a greenfield project in north Bengal. The company is now serious about the project. They are currently discussing the details of project with the Bengal government. It has earmarked an investment of Rs 100 crore for this project as well, sources added.																								Videocon entered Bengal by taking over the colour television manufacturing unit of Philips India Ltd at Salt Lake for Rs 9 crore in December 1999. Videocon has now decided to expand and set up a refrigerator and washing machine manufacturing unit within the premises of the Salt Lake factory, in which it will invest Rs 80 crore. The unit will provide employment to 100 people.																								Announcing this, WBIDC chairman Somnath Chatterjee said, During the last week, the WBIDC top brass had meetings with Videocon chairman V. N. Dhoot, managing director R. N. Dhoot and president of Videocon International P. N. Dhoot, at Aurangabad and Mumbai. The company immediately responded by working out a plan of expansion for the existing unit, setting up additional state of the art-assembly lines for appliances like refrigerators and washing machines.																								Gautam Sengupta, chief operating officer of the Videocon plant at Salt Lake said, Excellent industrial relations at the Salt Lake factory have encouraged the company to expand its operations. There is an excellent work culture in the factory and the productivity has gone up to 50,000 colour television sets per month. In the last two-and-a-half years we have not lost a single man-day. 																								The company manufactures CTVs under the brand name Videocon, Akai and Sansui. Videocon enjoys a 40 per cent market share in the CTV segment.																								Sengupta said the company will manufacture the latest model of refrigerators known as Sensiflow at the factory. We will also manufacture 165-litre refrigerators which will be priced below Rs 7,000, at this factory. The products will be available under the Videocon brand name.

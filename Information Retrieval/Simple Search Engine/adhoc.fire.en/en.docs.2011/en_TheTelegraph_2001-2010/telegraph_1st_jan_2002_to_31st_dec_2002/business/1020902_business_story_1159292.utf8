 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Gopalpur port talks this week
 SIB KUMAR DAS																								Berhampur, Sept. 1: The meeting to decide the fate of the Gopalpur port has been rescheduled to September 6. Talks on whether it should be handed over to Adani Exports were supposed to be held on August 26. The deferment has raised doubts on whether the port would be handle cargo this year. Workers want the state government to ensure the seasonal anchor port operates even after it is taken over by Adani Exports, which intends to turn it into a round-the-year facility.																								The president of the Gopalpur port labour union, Daniel Das, said dredging, which would enable the port to continue operations this year, has not yet started even as talks for the ports transfer to Adani continue. The delay has made workers apprehensive that the port may not get any cargo this year once it changes hands.																								To start with, the union wants arrangements made for dredging, and Rs 3 crore handed to keep Gopalpur running until a final decision on the take-over by AEL is taken.

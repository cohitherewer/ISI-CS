 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 McDonalds tastes sour quarter
 DEBORAH COHEN				 	 the pie shrinks: An outlet in Times Square, New York (Reuters)																								Chicago, Dec. 18 (Reuters): McDonalds Corp said on Tuesday it will post its first-ever quarterly loss after cutting jobs and closing outlets, as sales at the worlds largest restaurant company deteriorated in the saturated US fast-food market.																								Shares of the hamburger maker fell 8 per cent to close at $ 15.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, down $ 1.39.																								The stock, which fell an additional 4 cents in after hours trade on Instinet, was the most actively traded issue on the NYSE, earlier touching $ 15.59  its lowest level in nearly eight years.																								The US fast-food market has become increasingly competitive as McDonalds, hamburger rivals Burger King Corp and Wendys International Inc and Taco Bell parent Yum Brands Inc struggle to maintain market share as consumer tastes change and other fast-food options emerge, such as sandwich chain Panera Bread Co.																								McDonalds, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, has been testing other concepts, including pizza and Mexican-food chains, while Wendys has relied on its Canadian doughnut chain to help drive growth. Yum has been pushing aggressively into overseas markets such as China.																								So far in the fourth quarter, McDonalds sales at stores open at least 13 months are down 1.6 per cent before the effects of foreign exchange, the company said in an updated earnings outlook.																								Same-store sales in the United States, McDonalds largest market, fell 1.3 per cent in October and November and 1.5 per cent through the first 11 months of the year, a sign that the companys new discounting strategy is not meeting expectations, analysts said.																								Its clear that the discounting programme is not working, said Bear Stearns analyst Joe Buckley, referring to the Dollar Menu McDonalds recently launched to drive up sales.

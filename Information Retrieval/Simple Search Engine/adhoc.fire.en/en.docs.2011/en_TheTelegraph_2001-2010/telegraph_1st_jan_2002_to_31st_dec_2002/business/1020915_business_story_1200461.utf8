 Sunday, September 15, 2002 				 Telco roadmap to become leader
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 14: Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (Telco) may phase out non-performing passenger vehicles while bringing in new models in order to become an industry leader in the domestic market.																								Tata Sons executive director R. Gopalakrishnan said the company has already stopped making models like Tata Estate which was launched a few years back.																								Phasing out models and replace them with newer ones is something which is a very common trend. The power and other aspects of an older model may not be suitable today, he said.																								Gopalakrishnan, however, did not divulge the name of the models which are not performing well.																								He said the company will come out with a new version of Estate on the Indica platform next year.																								The Tata Sons executive director is optimistic about Telcos current year performance with Indica continuing to make headway even in the depressed market.																								It is always very encouraging that an auto project is about to break even in three years time. We are hopeful that the company will be able to make profit before tax during the current year itself, he said.																								Stating that the passenger vehicle segment is a priority area where the company will move on, he said there could be need for alliance and partnership in the process which is the global trend.

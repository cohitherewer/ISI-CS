 Tuesday, September 03, 2002 				 H-P to focus on five areas 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 2: Hewlett-Packard has identified visibility, future investments, software solutions, customer relationship management and infrastructure as its five thrust areas of success in India.																								Peter Blackmore, executive vice-president of Hewlett Packard said, Inventory costs will fall with quicker information. The demand is greater than supply and both the IT and telecom sectors are going through a period of adjustments. All this will result in a period of consolidation.																								Speaking at a CEOs forum organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, Blackmore asserted that all IT companies should have a drive to be competitive and use cost-saving methods. They should focus on fast return on investments and also look out for real revenue growth riders.																								According to Blackmore, it is the ability to be futuristic in a macro-economic environment that will take the companies forward. Well-managed infrastructure, higher utilisation and enhanced productivity should continue to be the focus area for companies who wish to widen their network.																								He said even though the economy is going through a recession, information technology will continue to be a strategic driver for the future. Our system has grown over a period of time. We need to catch up, manage it well and help it increase. Blackmore went on to say that there needs to be a close synchronisation between services, software and solution capability and customer relationship management in order to deliver results in a customer environment.																								He said HP will continue to invest in the country, as India with its huge skilled manpower provides an enormous potential in the IT sector, adding it would look for partners to provide complete end-to-end services. However, he refused to divulge investment plans and details of the HP-Compaq merger.

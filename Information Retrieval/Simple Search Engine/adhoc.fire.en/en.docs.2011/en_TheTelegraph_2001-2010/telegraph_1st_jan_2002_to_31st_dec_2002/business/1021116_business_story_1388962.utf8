The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, November 16, 2002 				 Animation firms come together
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Nov. 15: With the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) having declared 2002-2003 as the Year of Multimedia, efforts are now on to provide a platform for the animation industry to voice their concerns and opinions. 																								Taking the lead in this regard is the CII itself, which is facilitating the setting up of an animation association along the lines of Nasscom, to provide a face for a sector that is expected to employ more than 2 lakh people worldwide by 2005. The association will help synergise the various verticals of the industry.																								CII is also holding talks with various players in the industry for making joint marketing efforts overseas. 																								This will be of extreme importance as India has emerged as a favoured outsourcing destination for multimedia projects in the US, Arena Multimedia vice-president Sudhir Mathur said.																								The global digital animation industry is expected to touch $ 70 billion by 2005 from $ 30 billion now.																								Arena Multimedia, a division of Aptech, has set up a Special Interest Group in Multimedia Arena (Sigmma) in association with IIT Mumbai to facilitate research for the multimedia industry. The forum will also explore technological and artistic advancements in multimedia and automation of design and serve as a unifying link between industry, academia, business and government. 																								The growth opportunities have also led Arena to embark on an expansion plan to establish a presence in more than 20 countries by the end of 2003. We will explore the African market, China, south-east Asian belt, West Asia, Korea and Vietnam, with more than 320 centres globally, said Mathur.

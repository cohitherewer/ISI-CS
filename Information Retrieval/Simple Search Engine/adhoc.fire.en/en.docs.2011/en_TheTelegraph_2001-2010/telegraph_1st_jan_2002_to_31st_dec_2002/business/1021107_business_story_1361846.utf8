 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 SEC chairman quits as pressure mounts
 KEVIN DRAWBAUGH				 	 Pitt: Shown the door																								Washington, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Harvey Pitt resigned under pressure after a series of political missteps that embarrassed the Bush White House just when it needed to shore up investors unnerved by accounting scandals.

Probes by the SEC and Congress General Accounting Office are under way.																								Webster could not be reached late on Tuesday. His colleagues on the accounting board declined to comment on Websters future. The board was established to crack down on auditors and bolster market confidence after a rash of business scandals that started last fall with energy trader Enron Corp.																								For markets, the real issue is the election, said Arnie Owen, managing director of equities at Roth Capital Partners in New York. The Pitt issue has been going on for a couple weeks. ... I dont think it will matter for the markets.

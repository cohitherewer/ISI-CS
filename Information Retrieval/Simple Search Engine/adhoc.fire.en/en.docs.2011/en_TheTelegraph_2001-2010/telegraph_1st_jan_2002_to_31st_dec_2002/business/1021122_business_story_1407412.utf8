				 	 standing tall																								New Delhi, Nov. 21 (PTI): Sharp recovery in the petroleum refinery and electricity sectors helped the countrys six infrastructure sectors post an impressive 6.1 per cent growth during October 2002 compared with 2.6 per cent last year.																								Cumulative growth of the six core sectors during April-October 2002 was 5.6 per cent, more than double the 2 per cent growth recorded in the same period last year, provisional data released today by the industry ministry showed.																								The good performance in October was mainly due to growth in petroleum refinery, electricity and cement sectors which registered growth rates of 11.1, 7.4 and 6.7 per cent respectively. 																								The only sectors that recorded lower growth rates in October were crude petroleum, coal and finished steel.																								Crude petroleum clocked a 0.3 per cent rise as against 1.1 per cent a year ago while the growth rate of coal sector dipped to 3.7 per cent as against 9.2 per cent growth last year.																								Similarly, the finished steel sector also showed a marginal decline in its growth rate at 5.7 per cent as against 6.9 per cent in October 2001.																								All the six core sectors posted higher growth rates during April-October 2002 as compared with the previous year. Particularly high growth rates of 9.3 and 7.3 per cent were witnessed in the cement and steel sectors, indicating a sustained recovery of the infrastructure sector. 																								Mining shrinks																								The mining and quarrying sector registered a negative 3 per cent growth in September 2002 as compared with the preceding month. The negative growth was mainly due to lower output of coal, lignite, natural gas (utilised), petroleum (crude), copper concentrate, lead concentrate, dolomite and magnesite, an official release said.																								The value of mineral output in September 2002 maintained the same level compared with the corresponding previous month.

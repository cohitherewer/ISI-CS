 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 No-frills Indigo priced at Rs 4.35 lakh
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 hot wheels																								Mumbai, Dec. 18: Creating violent ripples in the dormant mid-size segment, Tata Indigothe Tatas first offering in the segmentwill come with an aggressive price tag of around Rs 4.35 to 5.20 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) and thus taking competition headlong in the C segment.																								A late entrant in the midsize segment, which is dominated by the Maruti Esteem, Ford Ikon and Hyundai Accent, the Tatas today shook up equations, much like it had done with its Indica in the B segment following an aggressive pricing strategy. 																								The move comes at a time when other car manufacturers are contemplating a price hike completely putting them on the wrong foot. 																								The pricing is expected to trigger a battle in the C segment that has so far been unaffected unlike the hatchback segment, analysts tracking the industry say. The midsize premium sedan was today launched commercially at the Mahalaxmi race course in a glittering ceremony attended by Tata Engineering chairman Ratan Tata.																								Tata Indigo is a significant milestone in the evolution of the passenger car business of the company and enables us to establish a presence in segments constituting 70 per cent of the total domestic passenger vehicle market, with one of the widest ranges in the country, proclaimed Tata. The Indigo comes with several class-leading features and we are quite optimistic of the car gaining wide acceptance in the market.																								The Indigo will start appearing in 100 dealerships showrooms from December 19 and is backed by a 436-strong service network across 168 cities in the country, the company said.																								The car is priced in the range of Rs 4.38 to Rs 4.99 in Mumbai for the petrol version, which will have three models. The diesel version will cost around Rs 4.84 to 5.25 lakh. 																								The base diesel version comes with power steering, heating and air-conditioning and is priced at Rs 4.8 lakh while the top-end model is priced at Rs 5.20 lakh. The base petrol version model comes with manual steering and air-conditioning as standard features at Rs 4.35 lakh while the top-end petrol model is priced at Rs 4.95 lakh.

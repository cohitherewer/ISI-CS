Calcutta, Sept. 19: After striking success in its loose tea retailing strategy, Duncans Industries is planning to launch garden-specific branded tea in the domestic market. To begin with, the company will retail premium Darjeeling tea, Marybong Mystique in chestlets.																								Gradually the company will start selling tea from its Dooars gardens like Kilcott, Hantapara and Gangaram. The company has 17 gardens within its fold of which two are in Darjeeling.																								J.K. Majumdar, senior vice-president, Duncans Industries said that premium handpicked tea from the Marybong tea estate will be sold in chestlets. The chestlets come in 100 gm and 250 gm and the prices range from Rs 100 to Rs 750.																								He added that the launch of Marybong Mystique is a value addition to our Bush to Cup concept, which aims to reach the blend to the consumer within the shortest possible period. We have introduced this brand after extensive research carried out among the ultra-niche clientele.																								The company has also received enquiries from Japan, UAE, Germany and the US for Marybong chestlets.																								The company is pursuing an ambitious growth strategy in the field of premium loose tea retailing with the establishment of Duncans Tea house outlets in different parts of West Bengal. About a 100 outlets would be set up by the end of the current financial year.																								Duncans has also firmed up plans to go national with its loose tea retailing concept. The company would launch loose tea retailing in Rajasthan and Gujarat by the end of the current financial year, Majumdar said.																								The company also plans to reach out to the masses with its loose tea retailing business. Each of the outlets that we set up will appoint 10 to 20 people who are hard working and will sell these teas in the rural areas and remote parts of the state. They will have to deposit a nominal amount of Rs 2,500. The company will also give them training on tea, he added.																								The Duncans packet tea business enjoys 7-8 per cent market-share and brands such as Double Diamond are market leaders in various parts of the country.

 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 Ranbaxy seeks Austrian ally
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Oct. 22: Okopharm, the Austrian health food supplement company, is in talks with Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (RLL) for a possible business tieup to bring in its portfolio of OTC products numbering more than a hundred. 																								Okopharm recently launched its Soya Plus capsules for problems related to menopause (for 40-plus women) in Delhi and Gurgaon. While the Delhi-based Double Green Healthcare Pvt Ltd is the official representative for marketing and distributing the product, the company is looking for pharmaceutical companies with presence in the OTC segment to spruce up distribution. 																								Ranbaxy, which has ambitious plans for the OTC health products segment, had some time back set up a new OTC business division, but Dr Morepen beat it to the counter, entering into an alliance with the Austrian company to distribute Soya Plus through its Lifespring retail outlets in Delhi. Okopharm can extend this tieup with Morepen to other products across various cities. 																								Wolfgang Stelzhammer, managing director of the $ 25 million Okopharm, said, We are talking with pharmaceutical companies which have a presence in the OTC segment for possible business tieups like marketing, distributing, exporting our products to the entire eastern region with India as the hub. 																								The Soya capsules have been priced at Rs 380 for a box of 30. Other Okopharm products in the pipeline are slimming capsule Vitazymes, Basovital for acidity problems, and vitamin S and D tablets. 																								Girish Pundit of Double Green Healthcare said the company expects to sell about 6,000 boxes of Soya Plus in the next three months.

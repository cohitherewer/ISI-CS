Our aim is to be the largest player in the dermatology segment by bringing in more international brands to India and thus capitalising on the strong R amp;D investment of our parent, which is to the tune of 14 per cent of its revenues. If there are any good specialised dermatology brands, we will look at acquisition as an opportunity, he added. In the anti-acne segment, the venture is optimistic about the success of retionoids.

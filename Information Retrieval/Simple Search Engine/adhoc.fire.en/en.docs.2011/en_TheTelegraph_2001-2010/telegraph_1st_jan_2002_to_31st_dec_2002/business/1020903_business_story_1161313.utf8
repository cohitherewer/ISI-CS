 Tuesday, September 03, 2002 				 Lupin growth prescription ready
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 2: Lupin Ltd, the cephalosoporins major, has identified contract research and manufacturing of bulk intermediates and herb-based drugs or phytomedicines as new businesses which would propel it in the years ahead. This was announced by chairman D. B. Gupta at the companys 20th annual general meeting held here today. With regard to contract research and manufacturing services (CRAMS) of bulk intermediates, he added that Lupin has positioned itself as a cost-effective partner for overseas pharmaceutical companies.																								Industry circles see huge potential in CRAMS due to Indias strong research expertise. Companies led by Dr Reddys Laboratories are generating a turnover in excess of Rs 10 crore from such services and this nascent market is only expected to look up in the years to come.																								Gupta pointed out that while there is a growing preference for herb-based drugs or phytomedicines, the company expects to develop net chemical entities (NCEs) based on phytochemistry. Lupins strategy is aimed at delivering cost-effective solutions as a complementary therapy to allopathic medication, he said. 																								We will cater to both the domestic and global markets with a wider range of products. Our herbal range includes medicines for digestive disorders, general tonics and cardiac disorders, he added.																								Lupin is transforming itself to meet the challenges of change. It has set targets for greater efficiencies across the entire value chain. While a cross-functional team has taken a hard look at processes and systems, the company is trying to build a knowledge-centric organisation with globally benchmarked information and process infrastructure. 																								To give a fillip to NCE research, Lupin has established strategic collaborations with leading institutions across the country and it is also participating in the New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) programme on the discovery of novel anti-TB compound.																								According to Gupta, the research project on development of prophylactic treatment for migraine has now entered the pre-clinical phase. The formulation has a botanical origin. The company is also focusing on novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) products. These are in multiple stages of development and the company plans to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) with USFDA soon, he added. 																								Additionally, Lupin has filed Abbreviated New Drug Aplications (ANDAs) for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime in the last financial year and two more for cefixime in the current year in the cephalosporins segment. The combined market size for these products is over $ 850 million. In the current year, Lupin is looking at filing five more submissions for the advanced markets. 																								Lupin has so far filed 82 patents including 14 in the US, nine in Europe, 15 in PCT and 44 in India. Three of the patents filed are in NCEs, 45 in process research, 13 in formulations, eight in natural products and the rest in others. The total number of patents granted is 46, which includes 11 in the US, seven in Europe and 28 in India.

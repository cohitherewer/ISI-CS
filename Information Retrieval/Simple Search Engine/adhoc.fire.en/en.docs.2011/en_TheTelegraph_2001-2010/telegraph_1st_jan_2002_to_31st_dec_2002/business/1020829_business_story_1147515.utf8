(AFP)																								Canberra, Aug. 28 (AP): Telstra Corp, Australias largest telecom company, today announced a 9.8 per cent slump in annual net profit to $ 2 billion.																								The figure for the year ending June 30, 2002 fell short of market expectations. Analysts had forecast a net profit of about $ 2.1 billion.																								The company said the disappointing result came on the back of a 9.5 percent fall in total revenue to 20.8 billion australian dollars (dlrs 11.5 billion).																								After the announcement, the stock fell to $ 2.66.																								Telstra said total revenue and net profit had fallen only because in the previous fiscal year they had been boosted by significant one-time items such as gains from asset sales.																								The company said that underlying sales revenue, which excludes once-only items, grew 1.7 per cent to $ 10.37 billion during the year.																								Telstra declared a final dividend of 6 cents a share, unchanged from a year ago.

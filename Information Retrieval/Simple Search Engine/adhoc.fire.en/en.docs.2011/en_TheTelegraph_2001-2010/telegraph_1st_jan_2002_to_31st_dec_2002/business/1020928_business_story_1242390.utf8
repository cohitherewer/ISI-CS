 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 27: Samsung, the Korean consumer durables major, today announced its entry in the audio systems arena with the introduction of eight models ranging from Rs 5,490-36,000. The company has a huge range of air-conditioners, microwave, refrigerators, televisions and other home appliances.																								With our entry into the audio segment, we expect to do business worth Rs 600 crore between September to December. We expect the basic VCD-MP3 player combination of the range to be a hit with the young generation, vice-president marketing and sales Ravinder Zutshi said.																								In the period between January to August, Samsung has already recorded sales of around Rs 960 crore, with consumer electronics contributing 60 per cent and home appliances accounting for 40 per cent of the total business.																								Along with the new business initiatives, Samsung announced its festival offer to push sales. The coconut offer of Samsung, Phod ke Dekho, has come back, albeit with a little touch of cricket. In addition to a silver coin in each coconut, there will be a key chain shaped like a cricket bat that will have the gifts engraved on it.

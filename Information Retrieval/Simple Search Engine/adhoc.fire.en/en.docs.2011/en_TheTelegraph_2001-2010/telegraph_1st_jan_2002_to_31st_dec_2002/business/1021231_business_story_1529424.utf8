 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 30: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) will organise its first biotechnology exhibition, Biotech India 2003, in the capital in February. It also plans to take an Indian biotechnology delegation to the US in June 2003. 																								Last month, CII and the US India Business Council together launched the US-India biotech alliance in the presence of US ambassador Robert Blackwill and under-secretary Alan Larson of the US department of state. The alliance will co-ordinate with the US-India Science and Technology Forum, a part of the US-India economic dialogue that President George Bush and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee initiated last year.																								The biotechnology exhibition in India is expected to draw a large US delegation. Besides, the Indian delegations visit to the US in June will coincide with a bio-convention in Washington DC.																								Both India and the US are coming together to help reduce the use of chemicals in agriculture . Addressing a session on biotechnology, Christopher Bond, senator for Missouri and member of the Senate Biotechnology Caucus, said, The government should ensure a science-based regulatory process in the biotechnology sector.																								He added that some activists were against the use of genetically modified products. They are putting pressure on the government to prevent biotechnology use in agriculture. But those who opposed this could not point to a single stomach ache, he said.

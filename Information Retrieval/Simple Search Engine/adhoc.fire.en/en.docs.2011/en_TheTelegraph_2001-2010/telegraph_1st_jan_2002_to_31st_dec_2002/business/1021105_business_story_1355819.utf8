The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, November 05, 2002 				 Dull Diwali on Lyons Range
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 4: Lyons Range wore a deserted look today as a handful of brokers logged on for mahurat trading on the Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE). The exchanges hall, which buzzed with life even a few Diwalis ago, was remarkably empty this year.																								Very few people trade on the Calcutta Stock Exchange these days and even fewer traded today. A day like this reveals the decrepit state of the 125-year old exchange, which has provided livelihood to several generations. Now we must look beyond, a former Calcutta Stock Exchange president said.																								Besides the exchange, the citys broking community too is going through tough times. The police investigation into the March 2001 payment crisis and the arrest of 12 people so far have driven many brokers from the city.																								Its not merely the main accusedDinesh Kumar Singhania and Ashok Kumar Poddarwho are on the run. Many of their associates have also fled the city for fear of being detained by the police.																								Making matters even worse, members of the bourse are at loggerheads with the administration and a showdown between the brokers and the management is likely at the forthcoming annual general meeting.

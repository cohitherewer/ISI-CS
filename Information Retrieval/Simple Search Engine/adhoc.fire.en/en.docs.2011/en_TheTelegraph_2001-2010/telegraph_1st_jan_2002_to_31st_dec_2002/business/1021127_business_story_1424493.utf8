 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 Moodys likely to bring down domestic rating
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rutherfurd: Plain-speak																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: Moodys may have to lower Indias domestic rating because of the countrys rising fiscal deficit, even though it was looking at improving the countrys external rating due to its burgeoning foreign exchange reserves.																								Speaking at the plenary session of the two-day WEF meet which concluded here today, Moodys president and chief executive officer John Rutherfurd Jr, co-chair of the India Economic Summit said, If India meets its challenges then we would like to increase its domestic currency rating with time. 																								Standard amp; Poors has already downgraded Indias domestic credit rating in the past citing similar reasons.																								Lord Charles Powell of Bayswater, another co-chair of the India Economic Summit 2002 and a key aide of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, cautioned that foreign investors wanted to see stability and they were turned away by communal violence and IndoPak tension. Investors get switched-off by seeing political, social and economic instability, said Powell.																								However, he recognised the present governments efforts to improve relations with the United States of America. This, he said would improve investors image of India. He added that Indias position would be enhanced if it worked successfully with the multilateral trading system.																								Infosys chief and another co-chair of the India Economic Summit N. R. Narayana Murthy, said the country needs to make manufacturing more efficient by removing the inefficiencies in the supply chain, including those in the customs clearances and in ports. India also needed to benchmark itself against global best practices.																								On the part of the government it is essential to reduce inefficiencies in the supply chain by ways of issuing licensing and having a flexible labour policy, he said, adding on the other hand, industry should help improve quality processes, benchmark themselves and work towards higher productivity.																								India Inc as a whole did less grumbling than usual at such gatherings over tariff barriers crumbling, and instead saw the future as a more open world where industry would have to gear up to face imports at zero customs duty.

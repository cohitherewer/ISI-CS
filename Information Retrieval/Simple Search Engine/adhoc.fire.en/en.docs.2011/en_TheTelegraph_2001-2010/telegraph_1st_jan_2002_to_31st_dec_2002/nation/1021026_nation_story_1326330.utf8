		 Saturday, October 26, 2002 				 Delhi rejects NCERT texts
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 25: The Delhi Cabinet today decided not to introduce the new history and Hindi textbooks brought out by the NCERT in Classes IX and XI.																								Delhi education minister Raj Kumar Chauhan said the government took this decision because it did not want to put an additional burden on students who have already completed seven months of this academic session. 																								If the new texts are introduced now, it would be impossible to complete the syllabus this session, he added. 																								The Delhi government runs 1,000 CBSE schools but, unlike many other states, does not have its own education board. 																								The minister said there was no possibility of a clash with the CBSE because schools hold internal examinations for Classes IX and XI. The CBSE has no role in these, he stressed. 																								All schools in the capital have been teaching students of these two classes from old NCERT books. 																								The Delhi Cabinet has also decided that a committee of experts should be set up to examine whether these books can be introduced in the next session. 																								All Congress-ruled states had taken a political decision at a chief ministers conference here early this month not to introduce these textbooks. 																								After NCERT revised the texts, Opposition parties and academics had accused the BJP-led government of saffronising education. The Supreme Court, however, cleared the new textbooks.

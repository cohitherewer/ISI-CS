		 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 Fifth time around, thorns out of Kaante way
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Amitabh Bachchan at the Kaante premiere in Mumbai. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Dec. 17: Kaante, the most talked about film of the year, is finally set for release this Friday.																								The film, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Sunjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty, Lucky Ali, Mahesh Manjrekar and Kumar Gaurav, has been postponed four times, from the time the transcripts of the Sunjay Dutt-Chhota Shakeel tapes exploded in the media.																								The film, which is directed and co-produced by Sanjay Gupta, will be released through the largest number of prints ever for a Hindi film.																								We will have 1,000 to 1,200 prints, said Pritish Nandy of Pritish Nandy Communications, another partner of Kaante.																								In Bollywoods darkest year, which has seen only two hits, Raaz and Devdas, Kaante is the most eagerly awaited film, expected to set the cash boxes ringing. 																								But Kaante is also the most troubled film of the year. 																								Nandy said the film was ready for release since all the problems have been sorted out. There were two types of problems, financial and technical, but they have been taken care of, he said.																								Nandy denied that Raju Patel, another producer of the film, had seized the prints of the film as was reported.																								But the major problem for the film was the people involved.																								Sunjay Dutt, Mahesh Manjrekar and Sanjay Gupta were allegedly in conversation with Chhota Shakeel in the tapes released by the police.																								The controversy shook the country, indicating the depths to which Bollywoods links with the underworld go.																								Following that, the film was not released in August. Then there was a Diwali release lined up, which did not happen.																								The films music has been doing very well. According to Nandy, Kaantes music, released on T Series, is the second biggest hit of 2002.																								Then there was talk of its release on December 6 and then December 13.

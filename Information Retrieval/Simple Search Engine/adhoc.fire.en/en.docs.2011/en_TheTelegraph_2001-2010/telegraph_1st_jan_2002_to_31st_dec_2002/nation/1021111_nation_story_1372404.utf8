 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Patna, Nov. 10: A 24-year-old inebriated man sneaked into Laloo Prasad Yadavs bedroom at 1, Anne Marg, the official residence of the Bihar chief minister, last night. He was initially let off by security, but later arrested. 																								Laloo Prasad alerted guards at 12.30 am when he felt somebody massaging his legs. He, however, let Arvind Kumar, alias Kundan, go after rebuking him. Kumar drove off in a waiting Maruti van. 																								Later, Rabri Devi called senior officers and asked them to investigate into the incident. Kumar was then arrested from his Kadamkuan residence. 																								The superintendent of police, O.P. Bhaskar, said action would be taken against the security personnel at the chief ministers house.																								Senior intelligence officials met today in the wake of the security breach. A fresh look is being taken at security arrangements at 1, Anne Marg. 																								Laloo Prasads partymen played down the incident, stating it was just hero-worship.

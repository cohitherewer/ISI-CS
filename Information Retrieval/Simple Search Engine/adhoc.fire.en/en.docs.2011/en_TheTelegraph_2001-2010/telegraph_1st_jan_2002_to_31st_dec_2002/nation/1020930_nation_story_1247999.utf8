		 Monday, September 30, 2002 				 IFS officers shuffle ahead
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 29: Changes are in the offing in the external affairs ministry with Meera Shankar, the joint secretary (North), likely to become the director of the Indian Council for World Affairs.																								Shankar is likely to be promoted as additional secretary in the next few days along with Nirupama Rao, who is now the spokesperson of the ministry and the joint secretary of the external publicity division.																								Rao, who is slated to be replaced by Navtej Sarna, is likely to be posted as additional secretary in the ministry in charge of administration.																								Shankar will replace Partha Ray, who will become the countrys ambassador to Malaysia. 																								Santosh Kumar, who was the ambassador to the country, has returned to New Delhi to take over as the dean of the Foreign Service Institute.																								The promotion of Rao and Shankar, both from the 1973 batch of the Indian Foreign Service, was stalled after Harish Dogra, who belonged to the previous batch, went to the Central Administrative Tribunal on being overlooked for promotion.																								Although Dogras fate is not yet known, the files for promotion of the 1973 batch officers are now with the Prime Ministers Office.																								Indications suggest that the names of these officers will be cleared for promotion in the next few days.

		 Sunday, October 06, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Manisha, Nair seek out-of-court deal				 																																																	 Mumbai: After the hullabaloo in court, contempt notices and a ban, actress Manisha Koirala and director Shahsilal Nair have decided to settle out of court their dispute over deletion of certain objectionable scenes in the film Ek Chhotisi Love Story, reports our correspondent.				 																																																	Koirala and Nair told Bombay High Court on Saturday that they were working on ways to reach a mutual understanding. Manisha had filed a case in court saying the release of the film should be stalled till Nair deletes certain scenes that she found objectionable.				 																																																	The actress had contended that the semi-nude scenes done by her body double Jessica Choksi were included in the film despite her protests. Nair, she said, went back on his promise to show the final shots to her before the films release.				 																																																	Nair also apologised to the court for taking the matter to a third party. Both he and Manisha had approached Balasaheb Thackeray for a resolution to the controversy while the case was pending before the court. The court has served contempt notices to Manisha and Nair for taking their fight to a third party.				 																																																	Taking into account the latest development in the case, the high court has now adjourned to October 17 an appeal filed by Manisha, challenging an earlier order that had dismissed her plea to delete the scenes she had found objectionable.				 																																																	Manisha, who is in hospital with a hip fracture, has been told she can file her affidavit by October 10.

SC on priest eligibility 				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that Brahmins do not have monopoly over performing puja in a temple and said a non-Brahmin, trained and well versed with rituals, could be appointed a pujari.				 																																																	As long as anyone well versed and trained and qualified to perform the puja in a manner conducive and appropriate to the worship of the particular deity is appointed as santhikaran or pujari, no valid or legally justifiable grievance can be made in a court of law, the court said, upholding the appointment of a non-Brahmin pujari in a Shiva temple in Ernakulam in Kerala.

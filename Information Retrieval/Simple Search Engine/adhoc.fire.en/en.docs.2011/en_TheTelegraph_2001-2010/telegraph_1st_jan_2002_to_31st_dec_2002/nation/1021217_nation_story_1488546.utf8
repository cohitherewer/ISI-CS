		 Tuesday, December 17, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Centre rules out FDI in retail trade				 																																																	 New Delhi: The Centre on Monday told the Lok Sabha there was no proposal to permit foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail business, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The existing policy, being followed since 1997, is that the government is not going to permit FDI in retail trade, disinvestment minister Arun Shourie said in response to Congress chief whip Priya Ranjan Das Munshis statement.				 																																																	During zero hour, Das Munshi said differences over the issue had cropped up in the government. The Planning Commission, he said, had opposed FDI in retail business and the tenth plan had recommended it.				 																																																	If the ban on retail FDI was lifted, it would hurt employment and destroy prospects of the business in the country, Das Munshi said. 				 																																																	CPM MP Hannan Mollah backed Das Munshis contention.				 																																																	Shourie assured them that the issue never came up before a Group of Ministers on FDI. He, however, said he would get the matter examined. 				 																																																	Shourie recalled two companies being given special permission in specified areas of retail trade before 1997. No FDI was allowed after that, he said.				 																																																	Information and broadcasting minister Sushma Swaraj said India could become a printing hub for Asian editions of technical and speciality magazines after the decision to allow 74 per cent FDI in non-news and non-current affairs publications.				 																Stray cattle owners to be fined				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): Concerned by the pollution and obstruction of traffic by stray cattle in the capital, Delhi High Court on Monday ordered imposition of Rs 1,000 as fine for each animal set free on the streets by its owner.				 																																																	A bench of Justices Anil Dev Singh and r.s. sodhi issued a series of directions to the Delhi government, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the New Delhi Municipal Corporation to tackle the menace.				 																																																	Owners who let their cattle roam the city streets freely would be prosecuted under Section 289 of the Indian Penal Code.				 																																																	The section provides a minimum jail term of six months and maximum of one year and imposes a fine on the owner if he fails to prevent his cattle from causing any probable danger to human life, or a probable danger of grievous hurt to any other person.				 																																																	Directing the authorities to employ adequate staff to deal with stray cattle and locate their owners, the court said a humane approach should be adopted while dealing with the animals.				 																4 held in flesh trade racket				 																																																	 Sonepat (PTI): With the arrest of four people, including three women, Haryana police on Monday claimed to have busted a gang engaged in flesh trade here.

Acting on a tip-off, police sent a decoy customer and once the amount was settled Devinder showed him three women. The police arrested these women along with Devinder.

																								Lucknow, Nov. 14: Speaker Kesari Nath Tripathi has accepted a petition filed by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati against rebel legislator Jai Prakash Yadav, reports our special correspondent.																								Tripathi gave the Bahujan Samaj Party MLA time till November 20 to explain why his meeting the Governor and demanding a special Assembly session for a trial of strength should not be treated as anti-party activity amounting to voluntary resignation.																								Tripathi has already issued showcause notices to the 10 BJP rebels who had sponsored the candidature of arms dealer Suresh Nanda for a Rajya Sabha byelection. The BJP sought their disqualification, saying their action and other recent ones amounted to voluntarily quitting the party.

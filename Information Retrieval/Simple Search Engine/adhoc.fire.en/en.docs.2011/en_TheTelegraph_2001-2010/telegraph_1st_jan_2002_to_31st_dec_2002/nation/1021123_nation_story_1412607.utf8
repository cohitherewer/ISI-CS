The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 Fault in House, not occupants
																								Calling it an architectural blunder from the utility angle and the vastu angle, Bansal said the main fault of the building designed in 1921 by Lutyens and completed in 1927 is that it is round at the base and the top whereas the structures in other countries are either rectangular or square at base and square at the top. 																								Bansal said that in order to deliver good governance, a new Parliament with a square or rectangular structure has to be built. 																								His suggestion is to convert the current building into a national museum and construct a new one at a cost of Rs 50 crore, or convert the Parliament annexe or Vigyan Bhavan, both vastu-friendly, into Parliament.																								The sitting arrangement inside the House is also faulty. The Lok Sabha chamber is shaped like a D, which is not good in vastu. Our Prime Minister sits in the northwest. It is the zone of air, and air has the quality of movement which creates pressure. He should sit in the middle, which is currently occupied by the ADMK and the TDP members and considered the best.																								He said the Speakers chair is right under the press gallery and that is why he is unable to control the members. In the Rajya Sabha, the chairman sits in a more vastu-friendly position without a gallery above him.																								In the Lok Sabhas semicircular arrangement, some of the ruling NDA members face east, some northeast and still others north. 																								Bansal sees the root of division within the ruling combine in the seating arrangement. The Opposition, too, is split for the same reason.																								In the UK, ruling and opposition party members sit facing each other, which is considered perfect. In Russia, all members of the ruling party face one direction.

(Reuters)																								Srinagar, Dec. 10 (PTI): Jammu and Kashmir Human Rights chairman Mohammad Ahsan Untoo tried to set himself ablaze today.																								Police took him into custody after they doused the flames. Untoo burnt two fingers and a bit of his hair. He was protesting against alleged human rights violations in the state on International Human Rights Day.																								Last night, Untoo evaded attempts of the police to take him in to preventive custody.																								Around 10.30 am today, he reached Red Cross Road in an autorickshaw. There he sprinkled himself with kerosene and set himself ablaze, the police said.																								A case has been registered against Untoo and if convicted, he could go to jail for a maximum of three years, sources said.																								Although arrested on a non-bailable warrant, Untoo can secure his release from a court tomorrow, they added.																								Untoo is a militant-turned-human rights activist. 																								He has been campaigning to put an end to alleged human rights violations and has demanded a probe into such cases.																								He had threatened to immolate himself if the state government failed to concede his demand.																								After the protest, several other separatist activists were released from various police stations in Srinagar, the sources said. 																								Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front vice-chairman Javid Ahmad Mir, detained last night, may also be released.

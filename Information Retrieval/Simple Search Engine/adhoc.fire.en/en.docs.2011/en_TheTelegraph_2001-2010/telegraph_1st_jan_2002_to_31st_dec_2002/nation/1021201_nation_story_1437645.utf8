 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Nov. 30: Three days ago, 22-year-old Nunna Subramanyam Kishore of Visakhapatnam was a hero. Local newspapers announced his inclusion in a Microsoft core team working on upgrading Windows.																								Today, Kishore is behind bars on charges of impersonation and cheating. 																								His claim of being one of the three new members of the nine-member Microsoft team, made at a news conference in an upscale hotel in Visakhapatnam, has been found to be false. An identity card showing him as a third year student of the local Geetham Engineering College has turned out to be fake. So has the visiting card identifying him as a senior director in the Satyam group. 																								The youth was arrested yesterday after both Satyam and the engineering college denied he was ever associated with them. 																								Kishore was produced before the media by the Visakhapatnam commissioner of police, B. Prasad Rao, bringing down the curtains on yet another con game in Andhra Pradesh. The first to hit the headlines was the story of alleged Euro Lotto winner Kola Krishna Mohan, who duped several banks with fake DDs drawn on a London bank. 																								Last week, Kishore told the media that he had created the Visual Basic software at 17 and had met Bill Gates in Washington in 2000 while he was an intermediate student. The dumbfounded Microsoft chief had then presented him a copy of the Pentium 4 processor, he claimed.																								The college dropout said he had generated 32 software tools for IT companies the world over, according to a report in a leading vernacular paper. He also said that Gates and a New Zealander were the other two members to join the Microsoft core team with him. 																								During his recent visit to Hyderabad, Gates had sent a helicopter to pick him up and had then chosen him to be part of the core team, Kishore said. He claimed that he was to leave for the US on November 29. Instead, the youth landed in police custody.																								After his arrest, the 22-year-old confessed to the police that all his claims were false and that he had dropped out of college after the intermediate level. I did this to earn the respect of my family members and my friends, who always teased me as a failure, he said. Kishores family lives in a village.																								Kishore was seen driving a silver Indica, which was later found to be hired, with a number plate that had a Government of India label and a blue light on top. I have not cheated anyone or collected any money offering jobs, an emotionally exhausted Kishore defended himself. But the police have refused to accept his argument, pointing that he is guilty of impersonation as a government official, a Satyam man and a software engineer.

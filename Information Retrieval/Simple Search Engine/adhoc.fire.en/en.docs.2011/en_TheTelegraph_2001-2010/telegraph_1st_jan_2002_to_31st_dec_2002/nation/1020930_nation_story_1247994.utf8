The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, September 30, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Death penalty altered for reform				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has commuted the death sentence awarded to a man who had killed the families of his two brothers, including four children. 				 																																																	Bachhittar Singh, with help from others, had murdered his elder brothers, Sukhwant Singh, Bhupinder Singh, and their family members to grab their land.				 																																																	A trial court had awarded him a death sentence, which was upheld by the high court. The Supreme Court, however, commuted the sentence to life imprisonment, saying the convict should be given a chance to repent for his act.				 																																																	No doubt the crime was committed in a heinous and brutal manner but viewed from the facts and circumstances, it would be difficult to hold that the case falls within the category of rarest of rare, a bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and H.K. Sema said on Friday.				 																																																	he bench considered the question of sentence and said: On a perusal of evidence and material on record, we find that apart from the solitary incident in question, there is no evidence on record either oral or documentary, which would suggest about the misconduct of the appellants in the past. 				 																																																	riting for the bench, Justice Sema said: There is also no evidence on record to suggest that the appellants would be a menace and a threat to the harmonious and peaceful co-existence of society. At the same time, there is no reason to believe that they cannot be reformed or rehabilitated. 				 																																																	he bench added: We are of the opinion that the appellants must be given a chance to repent, for what they have done is neither approved by the law nor by society and be reformed or rehabilitated to become good law abiding citizens.				 																																																	In the facts and circumstances of the case, we would think that sentencing them to rigorous imprisonment for life would meet the ends of justice.				 																Woman stripped after petty duel				 																																																	 Amritsar (PTI): A middle-aged Dalit woman was allegedly stripped and paraded naked on Saturday evening in the Sultanwind area over a petty dispute.				 																																																	Police said on Sunday that after a heated verbal duel with the victim, the accused, Nandu, and his henchmen tore off her clothes and thrashed her. The victim was then dragged naked in public.				 																																																	After giving vent to his anger, Nandu left the scene while none of the onlookers dared to stop him and his goons.				 																																																	Immediately after the incident, women encircled the victim and covered her with their shawls.				 																																																	The police arrested Nandu late on Saturday night only after a gherao at the police station by Dalit women, who raised anti-police slogans.				 																Isro poised for moon mission				 																																																	 Bangalore (PTI): Indian Space Research Organisation is better poised to undertake its lunar mission after placing a geostationary satellite on board a modified polar synchronous satellite launch vehicle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, October 04, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																GRE computer test on hold for Indians				 																																																	 new york (PTI): The US-based educational testing service has cancelled the graduate-level computer science test for Indian and Chinese students because some Asian websites had posted answers to earlier papers, but said the general test has not been restricted in any manner in India.				 																																																	Some misunderstanding had arisen among Indian students who mistakenly believed that the GRE general test has been cancelled, the Educational Testing Service (ETS), based in New Jersey, said.				 																																																	The confusion, ETS said, followed its instruction to the GRE board to cancel its computer science test in India and China for the year 2002-03.				 																																																	Students who had registered for the test would be refunded in full the money they had deposited, it said.				 																																																	ETS said it expects to resume the test in the fall of 2003.				 																																																	In the absence of GRE computer science test scores, the board says applicants to graduate programmes in computer science are to highlight their other key credentials like grade point average in relevant courses, work experience, and letters of recommendation.				 																																																	The GRE board is also informing computer science test score users that students from India and China will not have an opportunity to take the computer science subject test and that institutions should use other evidence presented by the applicant in their decision-making process.				 																HC to hear Priya murder case				 																																																	 mumbai (PTI): The bail pleas of Vivek and Ketan Anand, sons of filmmaker late Chetan Anand and undergoing jail terms in the murder of actress Priya Rajwansh, will come up for hearing on Friday before Bombay High Court.				 																																																	On July 31, the sessions court had found the Anand brothers guilty on the charges of entering into a conspiracy to murder Priya and hiring their servants to execute the crime.				 																																																	The duo said they were on bail throughout the trial and there were no allegations that they had misused their liberty.				 																																																	The case of the prosecution was that Chetan had left a will in which he bequeathed equal shares in his bungalow to his two sons and his friend Priya. After Chetans death, the accused allegedly ill-treated Priya as she had demanded her share. The prosecution contended that Ketan and Vivek conspired with others to kill her. Priya was strangulated to death on March 27, 2000.				 																																																	The Anand brothers have argued that the evidence of witness Suresh Arumugam should not be believed because his version was exaggerated. His evidence was also doubtful because he had not seen the accused killing Priya, they said.				 																Woman set on fire for dowry				 																																																	 muzaffarnagar (PTI): A young woman was allegedly strangulated and set ablaze by her in-laws for not bringing in sufficient dowry in Hiranwara village of the district, police said.

		 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 Pilfer-proof code for number plates
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 12: High security number plates, a must for vehicles getting registered from February 28 next year, will have three layers comprising tamper proof specific codes, the Rajya Sabha was informed today.																								The government has given vehicles registered before the February 28 deadline two years to switch to the new plates.																								Replying to a supplementary during question hour, minister for road transport and highways B.C. Khanduri said of the three layers, two would be ordinary but the last one would contain specific security codes, which could not be stolen. It would break if attempts were made to flick it away, he said.																								The minister denied that the high security plates would contain the Ashok Chakra. Some people had even gone to court over this, he said, but the courts had firmly ruled it out. 																								The Supreme Court has directed high courts to transfer to themselves all petitions relating to the numberplates.																								Khanduri said the Centre had framed the broad guidelines, but it was for state governments to float tenders and select the suppliers. He added that technical specifications for the number plates had already been notified and agencies authorised to grant type approval.																								Allaying worries that they would be very expensive, Khanduri said a comparative cost benefit analysis of the old and new numberplates had been done by a committee set up four years ago. Ultimately, the price would depend on market trends, he said.																								The minister said that since the number plates contained several security features, duplication and counterfeiting would be difficult. This would prevent misuse and check theft of vehicles.

		 Wednesday, November 13, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Amendment relief for rape victims				 																																																	 New Delhi: The Cabinet on Tuesday approved an amendment to the Evidence Act of 1872, in a decision that would go a long way in sparing a rape victim further humiliation in court, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	From now on, it will not be permissible to cross-examine a victim on her immoral character which defence lawyers have been doing to justify the assault.				 																																																	Loose character has been an oft-used adjective to portray victims to establish a link between her behaviour and the offence. The womens relationships with other men are then brought out as evidence against her.				 																																																	Since the early 1980s, womens groups have been asking the government to amend the law and stop such unrestrained questioning that can destroy a victims reputation and self-respect. Womens groups and the Law Commission agreed that there was no reasonable connection between a sexual assault and the character of a victim. 				 																Scotland Yard post-blast tips				 																																																	 New Delhi: Londons metropolitan police, New Scotland Yard, is in the country to impart specialised training on handling bomb blasts scenes to officers of the Central Bureau of Investigation, paramilitary forces and police personnel, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The first batchs five-day training that New Scotland Yard terms bomb-scene management started yesterday at the CBI Academy in Ghaziabad. 				 																																																	It aims at creating forensic awareness among investigating agencies to help them carry out searches of buildings, vehicles and other objects with greater precision, said a CBI release.				 																																																	New Scotland Yard sleuths would impart training on how to handle hi-tech equipment to examine the finer points of criminal cases.

The first course is being attended by 15 officers from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Bihar, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa, said an official release.				 																																																	Eight CBI officers are also undergoing the training. Officers of the ranks between sub-inspectors and superintendents of police have been selected as it is mostly them who visit the blast spots.				 																British officer in visa row				 																																																	 London (PTI): A British immigration officer was suspended pending an inquiry into charges that he wooed an Indian woman seeking a visa and work permit and fathered her child.				 																																																	A home office spokeswoman said Paul Margison,37, was put under suspension on Monday and an investigation was launched into his alleged relationship with Rekha Taneja of Jalandhar.				 																																																	Rekha came to Birmingham in 1997 and was issued a one-year visa. She moved to London and applied for fresh documents and developed a relationship with Margison during their processing.

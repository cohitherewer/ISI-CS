		 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 Beatification
																								New Delhi, Oct. 17: Close on the heels of Pope John Paul IIs decision to beatify Mother Teresa, another nun who has worked in India will be declared blessed, reports our special correspondent.																								Mother Mary of the Passion, who founded the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary in 1877 in Ooty and has worked for children, the poor and lepers, will be beatified by the Pope at a special ceremony in the Vatican on October 20, said a press statement of FMM today. The declaration of being blessed is considered as a step towards canonisation. This beatification is of special significance for India and the over 1,400 Indian sisters of this congregation, it said. 																								Daughter of a noble in Brittany and christened Helen de Chappotin, she came to India in 1865 at 26 and joined the Marie Reparatrix congregation. 																								She later set up FMM, her own congregation.																								In India, the FMM sisters number around 1,400. Besides tending to the lowest strata of the society, the nuns work in premier institutions like Stella Maris College in Chennai, Maris Stella in Vijayawada and Mater Dei School in Delhi. 																								In October 2000, seven sisters of the congregation, who were martyred in China a hundred years ago, were raised to sainthood.

After more than two hours of acrimonious debate, Congress legislature party leader S.R. Balasubramoniyan said the Oppositions intention was not to slam the Tamil Nadu government but to make it roll back the hike. As the government is sticking to its guns, we are walking out in protest, Balasubramoniyan, who was the first to give notice on the motion and spoke last after food minister Dhanapals reply, said. The Assembly erupted as he led party members from the House, with DMK legislators on their feet and those of the PMK, the CPI and the CPM also trooping out.				 																																																	Speaker K. Kalimuthu immediately declared that since the Congress leader, who was the first to sponsor the motion, had walked out, I rule that the motion is not pressed.				 																																																	Apart from Balasubramoniyan, Ponmudi of the DMK, the PMKs G.K. Mani, CPM leader J. Hemachandran and the CPIs G. Palanichamy spoke on the motion. Their common refrain was that Jayalalithaa, during her Andipatti byelection campaign and later in the Assembly also, had assured that price of rice under PDS will not be tinkered with. 				 																																																	Can the sanctity of that assurance be violated? they asked and said the hike, coming on top of a drought, has made it unbearable for the toiling masses.

Singh said a showcause notice was also being issued to Dara Singh for his removal from the commission as he was a government nominee. 				 																																																	He is amongst the three (Dara Singh, Kashmir Singh and Raghbir Singh) whom my government had reinstated after the Congress came to power, he said.

		 Saturday, October 26, 2002 				 Charges filed in Shivani case
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 25: Delhi police today chargesheeted senior IPS officer R.K. Sharma and five others in the journalist Shivani Bhatnagar murder case.																								A Delhi police crime branch team led by deputy commissioner Mukund Upadhaya submitted the chargesheet in metropolitan magistrate J.P. Naryans court this afternoon. Shivani was found killed at her east Delhi flat on January 23, 1999. 																								Apart from the suspended Haryana inspector general, the five others accused chargesheeted are Sri Bhagwan, Satya Prakash, Pradeep Sharma, Ved Prakash Sharma and Ved Sharma. All of them are in judicial custody. 																								Though the police officials refused to divulge the details of the chargesheet, special public prosecutor S.K. Saxena said there were two motives of killing Shivani. 																								One was that she was allegedly threatening R.K. Sharma that she would spoil his life and career. 																								Second, Shivani allegedly refused to return some classified documents which the IPS officer had passed on to her while he was posted as Officer on Special Duty in Prime Minister I.K. Gujrals office. 																								The next hearing will be on October 31.																								The accused have been booked under various sections of CrPC, including murder (302), criminal conspiracy [120(B)], disappearance of evidence (201) and dishonest misappropriation of stolen property (411).																								Pradeep Sharma was charged with substantive murder, since he was the person who executed the killing, Satya Prakash for destroying the evidence. 																								Prakash had destroyed the Sim card of the mobile phone he had used to inform Sri Bhagwan that Shivani was dead. 																								Ved Prakash and Ved alias Kalu were both charged with taking a camera and gold chain from Shivanis flat.

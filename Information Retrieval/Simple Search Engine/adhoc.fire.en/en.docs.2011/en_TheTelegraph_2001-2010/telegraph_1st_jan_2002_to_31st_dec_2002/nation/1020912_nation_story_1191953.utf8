		 Thursday, September 12, 2002 				 Christian plea
																								Chandigarh, Sept. 11 (PTI): The All India Christian Council today sought global action against the alleged religio-political terror unleashed against minorities by the Sangh parivar.																								The parivar has set up units in Europe and America and is receiving vast sums of money for its violent activities from the West, council president Joseph DeSouza and secretary general John Dayal said on the sidelines of a one-day meet of the community leaders from the region.																								Strongly denouncing the political campaign by Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, the leaders said that the so-called Gaurav Yatra had revived fears among minorities.																								Modi has crossed all limits of human decency and political propriety by his rhetoric, which violates the countrys criminal law and democratic discourse, they said.

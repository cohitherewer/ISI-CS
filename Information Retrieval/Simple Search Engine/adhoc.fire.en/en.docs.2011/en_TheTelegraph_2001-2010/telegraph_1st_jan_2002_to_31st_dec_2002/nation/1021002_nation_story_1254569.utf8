		 Wednesday, October 02, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Barred from exam, three take poison 				 																																																	 Nashik (PTI): Frustrated at not being allowed to re-appear for the first year MBBS examinations for the sixth time, three students consumed poison on the premises of Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) on Monday, police said.				 																																																	Two of them have died and the other is battling for life at Nashik Civil Hospital, police said.				 																																																	The dead were identified as Ashok Deshmukh, 22, resident of Nanded, and Ravikant Ippar, 23, of Kandahar. Balaji Bidve, 23, also from Nanded, is being treated. 				 																																																	The victims were studying in medical colleges at Aurangabad and Latur in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and had failed their first year MBBS examinations for the fifth consecutive time. 				 																																																	As per rules of the Medical Council of India (MCI) and MUHS, they were among the 456 students from different parts of the state who were disqualified from reappearing for the exam.				 																																																	About 150 disqualified first year students had come here on Monday to meet MUHS vice-chancellor Dayanand Dongaonkar, urging him to allow them to re-appear for the exam for the sixth time. But Dongaonkar rejected their demand, saying nothing was in the hands of MUHS as MCI made the rules.				 																																																	Upset over this, the three consumed insecticide inside the MUHS premises. They were rushed to Nashik Civil Hospital where Deshmukh died in the evening and Ippar late on Monday night.				 																Commandos for Karnataka 				 																																																	 Bangalore (PTI): Karnataka is contemplating raising a 500-member commando batallion for deployment in times of exigencies and in operations against militants.				 																																																	State home minister Mallikarjun Kharge said the need for creating such a force has been felt after last weeks experience in operations against militants in Bangalore when police had to work with commandos from Tamil Nadu.				 																																																	In a joint operation by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, five hardcore extremists belonging to the Al-Mujahideen outfit were gunned down in a pre-dawn swoop on their hideout in Bangalore on September 29.				 																																																	Kharge said the government has decided to handpick suitable police personnel for the formation of the commando contingent that would also be used as a Rapid Action Force (RAF). Those chosen would be imparted vigorous training and would get sophisticated arms, he added.				 																																																	A month ago, in response to the states plea for assistance to catch forest bandit Veerappan who has kidnapped former minister H. Nagappa, the Centre has provided it 150 NSG commandos. 				 																																																	In the absence of specific information on the hideout of the brigand, the NSG commandos returned to Delhi after a brief halt in the forests of MM Hills.

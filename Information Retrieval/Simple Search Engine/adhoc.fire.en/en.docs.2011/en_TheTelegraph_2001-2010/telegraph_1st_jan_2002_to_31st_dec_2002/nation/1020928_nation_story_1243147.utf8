																								In another application to the court, Sharmas lawyers requested that he be given special status in jail.																								Pressure had been mounting on Sharma after the police began attaching his properties in various parts of the country. Three flats in Gurgaon, a house in Mussoorie and land in Uttar Pradesh were attached. 																								On September 24, Delhi police filed a caveat in Supreme Court to pre-empt Sharma from obtaining ex-parte anticipatory bail.																								Speaking to newspersons in court, Sharma declined to comment on his wifes allegations against Union minister Pramod Mahajan.																								Madhu said on phone that she had full respect for the judiciary and that justice would be done. My husband does not deserve the treatment he has been meted out. The truth will come out, she said.																								Ambala police sources said it was likely that Sharma had been hiding in his hometown Shahbad in Kurukshetra since August, when Delhi police launched the manhunt against him. 																								He has remained either in Delhi or in close proximity of the capital all the while when police teams were raiding places in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, a senior Haryana police officer said.

																								Jammu, Dec. 25 (PTI): In the wake of the recent killing of an MLA and the threat perception to other VIPs, Jammu and Kashmir police have reviewed the security cover of legislators and other prominent persons and issued guidelines to them.																								The 41-point guideline advises VIPs to avoid visiting places of worship or any other place at the same time on a regular basis and keep changing the route of their journey, police sources said.																								The guidelines come within five days of the killing of Peoples Democratic Party legislator Abdul Aziz Mir by militants while he was coming out of a mosque in Srinagar after offering Friday prayers.																								Visualising the vulnerability of the VIPs, the police have recommended that a personal security officer (PSO) always accompany them. A warning has also been given against disclosing details of VIP movement to any unwanted person and protected persons have been advised to avoid visiting isolated and unprotected areas for walks, jogging or recreation even with a PSO.																								While moving out, VIPs have been advised to take mobile escorts, sufficient fuel, travel only on main roads, maintain a steady speed of their vehicle, keep windows shut and avoid roadside stops. The guidelines advise against receiving gifts from strangers and recommend a thorough check of all packets before they reach the person concerned. The police have advised the VIPs family members to avoid accepting any hospitality, lift and casual conversation with strangers. They should also avoid a routine pattern for shopping, walking or visiting religious places or relations, the guidelines say.																								At their residences, the VIPs have been asked to have proper fencing, keep only one gate for entrance and exit and disallow entry of any person before establishing his identity. They have also been warned against going out of their houses to receive visitors or seeing anyone off.

		 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Modi defies Godhra diktat
																								Deodhar, (Banaskantha), Nov. 29 (PTI): Flouting Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees appeal to refrain from using Godhra as an issue, caretaker chief minister Narendra Modi today said it was impossible to forget the killing of innocent people.																								Kicking off the 10th and final leg of the Gaurav Yatra from here, Modi, however, said that he did not want votes in exchange for forgetting the Godhra incident.																								Launching a vitriolic attack on the Congress for raising a hue and cry over violence in the state, Modi charged the party with being hand-in-glove with the Godhra accused and terrorists.																								I want to ask the Congress why the Godhra issue should not be raised? Are they partners in crime that they are so apprehensive? Modi asked.																								Continuing his tirade against the Congress, the chief minister said: Can they forget the assassination of Indira Gandhi and forget the sight of her dead body? Then how can I forget the sight of several innocent children crying besides the bodies of their dead parents at Godhra station on February 27?																								Addressing a gathering here from his specially-designed chariot, Modi repeatedly asked the Congress to clarify its apprehensions on raising the Godhra issue. 																								Till they do not answer, I will continue asking this question, he said.																								The chief minister added that the BJP government was committed to punishing the culprits of the Godhra carnage.

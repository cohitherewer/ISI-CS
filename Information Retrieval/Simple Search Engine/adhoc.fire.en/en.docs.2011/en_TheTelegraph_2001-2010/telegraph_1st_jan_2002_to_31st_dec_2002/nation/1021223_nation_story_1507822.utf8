For a bottle of beer a compensation of Rs 2,000 by no stretch of imagination can be treated or termed as inadequate. The commission said the complainant had failed to satisfy as to how the compensation of Rs 2,000 was inadequate.				 																																																	Earlier, the Shalimar Bagh district forum had found Som Distilleries and Breweries, the makers of Black Fort beer, guilty of deficiency in service and of harassing the complainant by selling the bottle containing a dead insect (worm).				 																																																	S.P. Upadhayay in his complaint had claimed that on noticing the dead insect in the bottle that he had purchased on April 21, 2001, he took it back to the seller, who expressed his inability to help him. On May 7 Upadhayay sent a complaint to the beer makers, who also turned a deaf ear.

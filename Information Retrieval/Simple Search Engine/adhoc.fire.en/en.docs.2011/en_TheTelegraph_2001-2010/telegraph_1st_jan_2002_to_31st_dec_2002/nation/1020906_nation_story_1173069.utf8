		 Friday, September 06, 2002 				 Slip a clue in bandit box, get a prize
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Sept. 5: The Special Task Force combing the Sathyamangalam forest areas in Tamil Nadu in search of Veerappan have set up information boxes to get information on the bandit without rubbing tribal people the wrong way.																								At least 60 STF information boxes have come up in the forests in the past week, ensuring informers both protection and money commensurate with the information provided to catch the outlaw.																								As the kidnapping of former Karnataka minister H. Nagappa entered the 12th day today, the STF also put up posters of Veerappan with two associates, Sethukuli Govindan and Chandre Gowda, informing people that a reward of Rs 1 crore has been announced for information leading to the bandits arrest.																								The STF has made it clear that it is not necessary for those furnishing information on Veerappan to write their names and addresses. They could slip a card into the information boxes if they have any knowledge of the whereabouts of the bandit and his gang. The force has also assured that the identity of those who are keen on the cash award will be kept secret.																								All our teams are positioned inside the jungle, coordinating with the Karnataka STF and we are just waiting for a breakthrough, Tamil Nadu STF additional director general of police Nataraj told The Telegraph at the Sathyamangalam camp this evening said: He denied a report that Veerappans gang was sighted recently near Gundal.																								Second cassette																								Veerappan had sent a second cassette to Nagappas family, Karnataka home minister Mallikarjun Kharge said today, according to PTI. The contents of the cassette were not known, the minister said after a meeting with chief minister S.M. Krishna and senior officials this evening.

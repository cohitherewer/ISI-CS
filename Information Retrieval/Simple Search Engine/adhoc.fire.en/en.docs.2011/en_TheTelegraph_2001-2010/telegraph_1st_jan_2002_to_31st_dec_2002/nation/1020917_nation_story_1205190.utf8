		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Live bullets in parcel for President
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Sept. 16: Two live cartridges in a parcel addressed to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam sent intelligence agencies and Delhi police into a tizzy before they found that the sender was a demented resident of Bihars Arwal district.																								The 30-year-old, who calls himself Chandrasekhar Azad after the freedom fighter, has already been to Arwals Akbarpur police station a couple of times in his desire to interact with Delhi police on his theory of global conspiracy against the nation.																								To judge the veracity of his statements, a police team from Delhi is arriving here tomorrow, according to B.K. Gupta, joint commissioner of police, New Delhi.																								Sanjay Singh, SP Arwal, said Azad has been writing to ministers and bureaucrats to draw attention to his theories ever since he stumbled on 11 spent cartridges while going to Asansol by train. He even called up a minister to say that (Osama) bin Laden is hiding in Bihar, Singh said.

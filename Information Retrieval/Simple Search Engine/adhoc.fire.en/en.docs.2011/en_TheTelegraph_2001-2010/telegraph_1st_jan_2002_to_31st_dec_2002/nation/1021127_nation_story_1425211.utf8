																								Bhopal, Nov. 26 (PTI): Actor-director Raja Bundela, who was named an accused for allegedly stage-managing an assault on himself on November 17, surrendered before Shyamla Hills police chowki. He was granted bail there itself, police said.																								Superintendent of police Arun Pratap Singh told newsmen that Bundela, who was to arrive on Monday night by a flight from Mumbai, later changed his plan as he wanted to evade media attention. He arrived by road from Indore on Tuesday morning. A police contingent was deployed at Bhopal airport on Monday night but Bundela did not show up.																								Three persons were arrested on November 17 for their involvement in the assault on Bundela after the press preview of his film Pratha, but they were let off on bail the next day.																								The director had refused to press charges against the accused. 																								The police named the actor an accused after they claimed to have gathered sufficient evidence that pointed towards his involvement in the conspiracy.

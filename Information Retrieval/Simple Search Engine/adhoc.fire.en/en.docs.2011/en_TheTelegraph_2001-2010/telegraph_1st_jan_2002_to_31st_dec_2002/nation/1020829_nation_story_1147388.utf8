		 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 Wedding hits yatra
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: The much-touted show of unity the Gujarat BJP was to have put up on the first day of Narendra Modis Gaurav Yatra has run into trouble with former chief minister Keshubhai Patel deciding to stay out of it.																								Patel has left for Antwerp to attend a wedding and will not be around for the September 3 yatra that he was supposed to flag off. The BJP has now asked its general secretary and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Rajnath Singh to kickstart Modis road show. The BJP had hoped that Patels presence would send a positive message to the cadre about unity in the parivar before the Assembly elections. 																								With controversies dogging the yatra  it was called off the first time Modi had planned it  BJP sources admitted central leaders were wary of being openly associated with it. L.K. Advani was to have inaugurated the first yatra, slated to take off in July. However, after the Opposition and human rights groups protested, the Prime Minister intervened and forced Modi to call it off.																								The high command also considers Modis diatribe against J.M. Lyngdoh an embarrassment and fears it can fuel perception that the party is in a confrontationist mood against constitutional bodies. 																								Delhi has, therefore, decided to stay away and let Modis show remain all-Gujarat affair.																								Sources close to Modi, however, sought to downplay Patels absence, saying Singh would send the right signal to the Kshatriya constituents of Phagvel in Kheda district from where the yatra is set to roll. The area, which is a stronghold of Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela, was chosen deliberately to prove that Modi has caused a dent in his following. 																								Gujarat BJP sources, however, said the presence of Singh, a Rajput from Uttar Pradesh, would mean little to the Kshatriyas. Singh is yet to make a mark nationally, one of them pointed out.

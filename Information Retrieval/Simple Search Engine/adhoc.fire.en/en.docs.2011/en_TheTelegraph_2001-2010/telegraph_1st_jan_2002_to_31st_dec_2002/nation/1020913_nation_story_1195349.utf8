		 Friday, September 13, 2002 				 River bandh peaceful
																								Bangalore, Sept. 12: The governments of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu heaved a sigh of relief today as the Bangalore bandh called by Opposition Janata parties and farmers groups to protest against sharing of Cauvery waters passed off peacefully, reports our special correspondent. 																								The law enforcement agencies remained alert as anti-Tamil emotions had run high during the past few days following the Supreme Courts and Cauvery River Authoritys orders to release water to Tamil Nadu. Activists of farmers groups had even entered the Krishnaraj Sagar dam and blocked the flow of water to Tamil Nadu.																								The fact that a similar bandh in 1991 on the same issue had left about 50 people dead had also worried Bangalore police.

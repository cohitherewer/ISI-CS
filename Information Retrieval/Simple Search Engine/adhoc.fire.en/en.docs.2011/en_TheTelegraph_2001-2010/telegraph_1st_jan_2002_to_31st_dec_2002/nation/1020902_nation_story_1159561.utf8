		 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Rights rap for UP, Bihar
																								Patna, Sept. 1 (pti): Uttar Pradesh tops the list of states in human rights violation followed closely by Bihar, National Human Rights Commission chairman J.S. Verma said today.																								While he did not give the figures of human rights violations in the two states, Verma regretted that the Bihar government had not paid any heed to NHRCs repeated reminders for constitution of a state human rights commission. I once again request the state government to set up the commission at the earliest, he told reporters here.																								He also mentioned that constitution of the state panel would not serve its purpose unless the law enforcing authorities acted in a free and fair manner.

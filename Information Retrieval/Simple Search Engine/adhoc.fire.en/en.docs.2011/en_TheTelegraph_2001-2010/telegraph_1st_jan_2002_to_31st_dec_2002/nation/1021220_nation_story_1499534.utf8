		 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Jail for lustful kiss
																								New Delhi, Dec. 19 (PTI): A lustful kiss has landed a youth in jail. A city court sentenced 21-year-old Mukesh Kumar to three months rigorous imprisonment for forcibly kissing a schoolgirl. 																								Holding that the shoe-shop salesman had kissed the girl deliberately and intentionally not out of love and affection but out of lust, the court said he was guilty of assault or using criminal force on a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty. 																								Delivering the verdict within 10 days of the offence, the court said the increasing lustful behaviour of the youth nowadays has become a menace to the safety and integrity of young women and girls while going to public places. 																								Kumar, who works in a shop in South Extension, had kissed the girl on December 9 near the Shiva temple in Mandoli village of east Delhi. The accused was arrested from a nearby street after the girl raised an alarm. 																								Kumars counsel contended that his client was not apprehended from the scene of crime, and that no person was cited as witness while the arrest was made. 																								The accused claimed that the girl was in love with him and was implicating him at the behest of her parents.

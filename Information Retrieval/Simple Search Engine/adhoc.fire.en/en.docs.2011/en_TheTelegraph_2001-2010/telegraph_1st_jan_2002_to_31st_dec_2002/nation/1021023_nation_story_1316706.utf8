		 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 SC on prostitution
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 22: The Supreme Court today directed the Central government to file its reply within six weeks on a petition seeking implementation of various schemes and laws to check child prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation of women and children.																								A three-judge bench of Justices V.N. Khare, Ashok Bhan and Arun Kumar issued the directive on a petition by a non-government organisation, Shakti Vahini. The petition contended that the recommendations of the 1988 Action Plan for prevention of sexual exploitation of women and children were not implemented at all.																								On an earlier directive of the court, the Centre had constituted a Committee on Prostitution, Child Prostitutes and Children of Prostitutes and Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking and Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Women and Children.																								This committee had, in 1998, prepared a report containing an action plan based on which the department of women and child welfare under the Union human resources development ministry made many recommendations.																								NGO counsel Ranjit Kumar told the court that the recommendations included legal reforms, law enforcement and rehabilitation of the victims. However, not a single recommendation was ever implemented, he said.																								According to the counsel, there were about one million women and child prostitutes but the government had neither conducted any study nor collected any data about them.

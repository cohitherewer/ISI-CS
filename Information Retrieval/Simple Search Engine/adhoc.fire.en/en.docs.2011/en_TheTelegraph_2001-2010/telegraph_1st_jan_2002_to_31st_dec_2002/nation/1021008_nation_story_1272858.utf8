																								New Delhi, Oct. 7 (PTI): Portuguese authorities have cancelled the work permits of underworld don Abu Salem and his associate, starlet Monica Bedi, sources said.																								The Portuguese government has been cooperating with India and, so far, there has been nothing negative to suggest that the efforts to bring back Salem from Lisbon have suffered a setback, they said.																								CBI director P.C. Sharma has dismissed last nights reports that the exercise to get Salem back had run into rough weather. He said senior CBI officials had fruitful discussions with their Portuguese counterparts.																								The team of additional director Vijay Shanker, superintendent of police O.P. Chatwal and head of the CBIs legal cell S.K. Sharma, which concluded discussions with officials in Lisbon, arrived here today.																								Salem, a key accused in the 1993 blasts that killed several hundred people, and Bedi had performed sham marriages with Portuguese nationals to get stay and work permits, the sources said, adding that authorities in Lisbon may take legal action on the marriage issue, too. 																								The sources said that the cbi team would brief deputy prime minister l k advani on their talks in lisbon.																								The task to bring back salem may take a little longer, they said, adding that cbi still has time as the don and bedi are detained in portugal for three months.

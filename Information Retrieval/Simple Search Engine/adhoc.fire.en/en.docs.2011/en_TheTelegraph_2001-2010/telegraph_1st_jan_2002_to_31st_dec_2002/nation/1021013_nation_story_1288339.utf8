The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, October 13, 2002 				 Victory over Windies
																								Incidentally, Harbhajans second innings seven for 48 is the second best by any off-spinner against the West Indies.																								The top figures remain credited to former Australian captain Ian Johnson, who took seven for 44 in Georgetown, back in the mid-Fifties.																								Rhythm ka sawaal hai... Rhythm rehne se, bowling zaroor acchi hogi... If I may add, support from the fielders is a must. In this Test, particularly today, everybody was brilliant. Naye wicketkeeper ne bhi bahut acchi keeping kari, Harbhajan remarked.																								Harbhajans mood, though, got soured when he lost his India cap while interacting with the media.																								Amid the chaos, a regular feature on such occasions in these parts, an outsider walked off with something held very dear by all national players.																								The Man of the Match award, by the way, went to Virender Sehwag.																								Its a first for this fantastic strokemaker, forever willing to shoulder any responsibility.

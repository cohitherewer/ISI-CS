 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Sept. 24: The police sub-inspector leading the patrol that shot dead Agra medical college intern Sonali Bose in July surrendered yesterday in a Mathura court.																								Sub-inspector D.B. Singh, the station house officer of Farah police station in Agra, is the third policeman to be sent to prison in connection with the death. Two other policemen involved in the shooting, Dharam and Ishaq, had earlier surrendered to the police.																								Sonali Bose, a final-year student of S.N. Medical College, Agra, was shot dead by a police party on July 16 while returning to the medical college hostel after having dinner at a restaurant in Mathura.																								The policemen claimed that they were acting on a tip-off that some mafia dons were travelling in the car. When Sonali and her friend, Anurag Dhingra, refused to stop the vehicle on being challenged, the policemen started shooting at the car, believing they belonged to the mafia.																								The incident sparked violent protests from the medical colleges junior doctors, who went on the rampage setting fire to the hospitals emergency ward and the principals office.																								 It was only after students of other medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh joined the protest and threatened to go on an indefinite strike that the state government suspended nine policemen allegedly involved in the killing and ordered a magisterial probe.

On October 24, when the Assemblys short monsoon session begins, all minority-run educational institutions will remain closed as part of the second stage of protest.				 																																																	The Bill to turn the Ordinance banning conversions into law is expected to be taken up in the coming session. Churches are demanding total withdrawal of what they describe as an out and out anti-minorities Ordinance. 				 																																																	Nuns, bishops of various churches and functionaries of rival factions of the Muslim League sat on fast here. They raised slogans against the Ordinance and held up placards that said, Do not stoke religious frenzy. Similar fasts were observed in Tiruchirapalli, Madurai, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts where there is a large Christian population. 				 																																																	Chief minister Jayalalithaa defended the Ordinance, saying it was not directed against any particular religion but only against the use of fraudulent means, allurement and force in enticing individuals into changing their religious denomination against their will. 				 																																																	In the turbulent cauldron of Indias multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-class and multi-lingual society, the soft state is not a viable model if our democratic and secular character is to be preserved, she said. The Ordinance seeks to prevent exploitation in the name of any religion.

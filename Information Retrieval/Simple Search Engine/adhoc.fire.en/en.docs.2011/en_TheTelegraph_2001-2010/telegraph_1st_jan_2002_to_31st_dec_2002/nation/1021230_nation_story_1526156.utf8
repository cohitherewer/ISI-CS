		 Monday, December 30, 2002 				 Multiple goof-ups at UGC exam centres
 RAJEEV BHATTACHARYYA																								New Delhi, Dec. 29: Delhi Universitys Rajdhani College today witnessed chaos when research scholars failed to trace their roll numbers at an examination conducted by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Around 70 researchers waited for two hours to write the exam. 																								At another exam centre, there were no question papers for the second half of the UGC-conducted National Eligibility Test (NET). The exam, that selects candidates for scholarships and lecturerships, comprises three papers: the first two clubbed together in the first half and the third in the second.																								We were baffled as our roll numbers were missing at the centre. Even the college principal was unwilling to set the problem right, said Atreyee Sarma, an M. Phil linguistics scholar.																								By the time additional rooms were arranged for the aggrieved candidates and the question papers came from the UGC, it was 11 am. The exam was scheduled to start at 9.30.																								The candidates at VD Institute of Technology in West Delhi were worse off. No question papers arrived for the exams second half. And the question papers they received in the first half were reportedly photocopies. 																								What we received in the first half were photocopies of the original, Sanskrit research scholar Sujit Dwivedi said.																								The police were called in to prevent the candidates from going on the rampage.																								The UGC representative in charge of Rajdhani College, who refused to tell his name, said on the phone that such incidents are rare and these happen when more students than expected arrive at the centre.																								Researchers present at the college, however, alleged the UGC had made it a practice to bungle in the NET exam. Some researchers from the Post-Graduate Womens Hostel of Delhi University, reportedly, never received admit cards. These were issued after they complained to the UGC. 																								The situation is deplorable because of several factors. The UGC is hardly interested in self-appraisals that might help detect administrative errors. And Delhi University has shown little interest in asking the UGC to prevent repetitions of the fiasco, said Sanjay Tiwary, president, Delhi University Researchers Association.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 1: A government publication has claimed that the Pakistan High Commission in Dhaka is the nerve-centre of Inter-Services Intelligence activities, including networking with Islamic extremist elements and northeast insurgent groups.																								The 188-page document, Pakistans Involvement in Terrorism Against India, alleges that ISI operatives in association with the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, the Bangladesh secret service, have made extensive inroads into organisations such as Jamaat-e-Islami, Harkat-ul-Jehad-al-Islami and other anti-Awami League outfits.																								They also provide assistance to various rebel groups in Bangladesh, it added.																								External affairs minister Yashwant Sinha last week told Lok Sabha about ISI activities in Bangladesh and its attempts to foment anti-India passions and provide assistance to insurgent groups based in that country.																								Following the US-led military operations in Afghanistan, al Qaida elements had taken shelter in Bangladesh, Sinha said. A large number of madarsas had also sprung up along the Indo-Bangla border, he added.																								The publication, which was circulated to several Indian embassies, begins with a general introduction on Pakistans involvement in assisting terrorist groups in India and provides maps of training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the northern areas of the country and Afghanistan. 																								Since the past 2/3 months, all major Pakistan-based terrorist groups have been issuing threats to eliminate Indian leaders and destroy vital installations inside India on the pretext of atrocities on Muslims and their leaders in Kashmir and other parts of the country, desecration of Muslim holy places and the recent military exercises by India, the report says.																								It alleges that the strong links between the ISI and Indian insurgent outfits such as the United Liberation Front of Asom, the All Tripura Tiger Force, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland and those belonging to Manipur and Nagaland for several years have now been firmly established.																								Claiming that ISI officers were tutoring rebel leaders and activists on military and psychological warfare tactics, the document said many of these rebels possessed travel documents (forged or otherwise) of Bangladeshi origin. Some of these have been prepared with the active assistance of ISI operatives in Bangladesh.																								The publication also lists Sikh terrorists still assisted by Pakistan and concludes with a brief outline on Pakistans links with international terrorism and its network in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the United Kingdom.

		 Sunday, November 03, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Snub to Centre on Salem extradition				 																																																	 New Delhi: More than five weeks after Mumbai underworld don Abu Salem was arrested in Lisbon, the central government is still struggling to work out a legal framework to seek the dons extradition, reports our correspondent. 				 																																																	Government sources said Portuguese authorities have turned down Indias request to notify the 1892 Surrender of Fugitive treaty. Signed between British India and the then Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu, this treaty was proposed to Portugal by the Indian government as an option to tackle Salems extradition. 				 																																																	The 1892 treaty does not exist, so there is no question of notifying it to make it applicable for present times, the Portuguese authorities reportedly told their counterpart here. 				 																																																	The rejection has come as an embarrassment to India as it reflects how well prepared the ministry of external affairs (MEA) was on an important international issue. The government is not happy with the MEA on the Portuguese response, government sources said. 				 																																																	CBI director P.C. Sharma had also met a representative of the Portuguese government at Interpols 71st general assembly session in Cameron late last month. During the meeting the duo exchanged information on what was happening with regard to Salems extradition. 				 																																																	Now the government is left with two options. Give a solemn assurance to Portugal that if it starts extradition proceedings against Salem, it would also reciprocate with whatever help is required in this or other criminal matters by Portugal. 				 																																																	India has this sort of internationally accepted diplomatic arrangement with other countries.				 																																																	India could also explore the idea of entering into a fresh extradition treaty with Portugal.				 																Murderers proved innocent				 																																																	 New Delhi (pti): A city court discharged two innocent persons who were arrested on charges of murder, after the man they had allegedly murdered resurfaced.				 																																																	Metropolitan magistrate J.P. Narain discharged Afsar Ali and Sadhu, who were held on charge of murdering Rakesh Kumar. Rakesh was produced alive in court on Friday. The magistrate left it to the duo to initiate appropriate legal action against police officials resposible for their agony. Ali and Sadhu had been remanded in judicial custody after the police said they had disclosed their guilt.				 																																																	If the disclosure statements of the accused were obtained by any police official by force, then they are at liberty to take appropriate legal action against the concerned police officials, the court said.				 																Free e-mail for Dubai Indians 				 																																																	 Dubai (PTI): Indians in a labour camp here can stay in touch with their relatives through a free e-mail service, which was inaugurated by the Indian consul general, George Joseph, as a gift to people on the occasion of Kerala Day.				 																																																	The labourers in the camp can submit their letters to an e-mail facility in the camp. The letters will be scanned and sent to an e-mail box run in Kerala by a Malayalam daily.

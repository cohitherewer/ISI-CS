		 Tuesday, December 10, 2002 				 Nalco says no to bidders
																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 9: Workers and trade union leaders of the National Aluminium Company (Nalco) today declared that they would not allow any of the 15 prospective buyers in Angul and Damanjodi for due diligence (evaluation), reports our special correspondent.																								The aluminium majors are coming solely for the huge bauxite deposits in Damanjodi. Their only aim is to ship the bauxite out and use it in their own concern. We are ready for a bloody battle on this issue, said Lalit Patnaik, an engineer and member of the Nalco Co-ordination Committee, which was formed to oppose the proposed privatisation of the aluminium public sector unit.

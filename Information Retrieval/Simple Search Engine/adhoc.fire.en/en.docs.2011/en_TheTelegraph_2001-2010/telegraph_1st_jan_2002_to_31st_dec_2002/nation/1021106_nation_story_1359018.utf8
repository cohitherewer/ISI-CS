The decision on the fee to be charged must necessarily be left to the private educational institution that does not seek or is not dependent upon any funds from the government, an 11-judge bench headed by Chief Justice b.n. kirpal said in the landmark majority judgment pronounced recently.				 																																																	A private unaided institution should have maximum autonomy in the day-to-day administration as bureaucratic or governmental interference in the administration of such an institution will undermine its independence, Justice Kirpal said.				 																																																	The Chief Justice of India wrote the judgment for himself and for Justices g.b. pattanaik, s. rajendra Babu, k.g. balakrishnan, p.v. reddi and Arijit Passayat.				 																																																	However, the bench said as opening of educational institutions were for the purpose of charity, the fee charged could not amount to profiteering.				 																																																	It also said that for the purpose of ensuring educational excellence, the government could frame guidelines even for private unaided educational institutions.				 																																																	he bench said: We, however, wish to emphasise one point, and that is that inasmuch as the occupation of education is, in a sense, regarded as charitable, the government can provide regulations that will ensure excellence in education, while forbidding the charging of capitation fee and profiteering by the institution.

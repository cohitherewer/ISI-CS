		 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Badal a chor, says CM
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chandigarh, Oct. 16: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said today the government was collecting evidence on corruption against Badal to be placed before a court.																								Badal is a chor. He has looted the state. We are collecting foolproof evidence. He will be arrested soon, he said.																								He also termed Badals wife Surinder and son Sukhbir, a Rajya Sabha member, crooks. Preliminary investigations point to their involvement in corruption. We will arrest them also. Badal is a celebrity and I dont want weak charges to be framed against him, he added.																								Why is Badal so worried about his arrest? Why is he running to the Centre and telling them that he would be arrested? Badal seems to be noticing Amarinder behind every bush these days.																								Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has warned of serious consequences, if Badal was arrested on corruption charges.																								Chief minister Amarinder Singh would have to bear the entire responsibility for any disruption of peace in the state in case of Badals arrest, Dhindsa said.																								The possibility of action against Badal follows the arrest of former SSP Gurcharan Singh Pherurai in a corruption case. He is considered close to Badal. He is a valuable link who can provide information on Badals activities, a police officer said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, August 25, 2002 				 Cricket deal 
																								While declining to comment on whether any of the England players are in that conflict-situation, right now, Bevan acknowledged the Indian position was complicated. Incidentally, the Indians representative, Ravi Shastri, has been in contact with Bevan (and Tim May, Ficas joint chief executive).																								Bevan says the ICC has agreed to interact with any representative nominated by Fica or the cricketers body of any country. Its going to be binding on the respective boards, too, to accept that nominee, he said.																								The BCCI has refused to accept Shastris nomination who, however, is unfazed. Dont ask me, ask the BCCI why they wont deal with me, quot; Shastri said.																								Asked if the players intended to make a fresh representation, he answered: Theyve made their stand clear. Today, then, the ball is in the BCCIs court. Let the BCCI and/or the ICC revert. Any move now must come from one or both of them...																								While Indian cricketers received the terms only last month, after the NatWest final, the PCA was aware of what was coming in April. We began negotiations (with the ECB) then itself, Bevan informed.																								It wont surprising if the Indians form (belatedly) a players body  sooner than most expect.

		 Friday, October 25, 2002 				 Advani call to ostracise terror sponsors
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 24: On a day the world was stunned by the hostage crisis in Moscow, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani called for ostracising countries that encourage terrorism.																								Advani did not refer to the Moscow incident but said terrorism has become a major danger not only for India and the US but also for the world community.																								He said it was time the world woke up to this danger and took stringent measures against nations sponsoring and aiding terrorists.																								The world should ostracise nations which support terrorism so that they realise that not only one country but the whole world is against terror, the deputy Prime Minister said.																								He referred to the terrible attack in Bali in Indonesia, saying that reportedly some Pakistanis have been blamed for it. The Indian government has been trying to make the international community take a harder stand on Pakistan.																								Addressing the Indo-Tibetan Border Police force on its raising day, Advani took a potshot at Pakistan. Countries ruled by dictators or militarymen may, under international pressure, say sometimes that they do not believe in terrorism and are combating it. However, actually they feel that if the ISI is used to achieve political objectives, it is not wrong, he said.																								Advani said international pressure on Pakistan will help India in its fight against terrorism but basically, we have to achieve victory over it on our own strength.																								He added that Pakistans proxy war against India has not abated, entailing continued alertness and sacrifices by the security forces.																								Advani cited the Chinese example to point out how other neighbours have been trying to resolve differences. 																								Although Delhi and Beijing have differences over the border, which still remain unresolved, there has been no war after 1962.																								There might have been some incident somewhere and some tension. But both countries have been making efforts to ensure that our cooperation in other areas increases despite the differences, he said.																								Advani congratulated the security forces in defending the country.																								He thanked the National Security Guards for foiling an attempt by enemies to incite communal violence in Gujarat through the attack on Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar.

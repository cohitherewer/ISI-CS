Blackwill on Wednesday gifted a fleet of 20 vehicles to the Narcotics Control Bureau as part of the ongoing cooperation between the two countries against drug trafficking, reports our correspondent.				 																																																	Blackwill officially handed over the keys of 14 cars and six motorcycles to bureau director M.K. Singh in a brief ceremony at the US embassy.				 																																																	Drug trafficking is one area which is against the national interest of both countries requiring close cooperation. Todays occasion is another advancement in US-India relationships, said Blackwill. 				 																																																	The donation took place under the auspices of the Drug Enforcement Commodities and Training Assistance Programme.

The bureau, the nodal agency in the country for the enforcement of drug laws, has been cooperating with the US Drug Enforcement Administration since the signing of a letter of agreement in 1999. The US body works with Indian drug law enforcement agencies to identify, target and dismantle drug trafficking organisations in the two countries. 				 																																																	India fits into the trafficking network by virtue of being located between the major heroin producing regions  the Golden Triangle and the Golden Crescent  which makes it a favoured transhipment point.

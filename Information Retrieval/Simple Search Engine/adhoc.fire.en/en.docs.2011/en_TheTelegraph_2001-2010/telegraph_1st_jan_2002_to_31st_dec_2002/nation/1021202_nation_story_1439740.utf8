 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Dec. 1: South Central Railway has decided to divert express and suspend passenger trains on the Hyderabad-Nadikudi sector following the recent PWG attack on railway property.																								However, trains run by other divisions such as the Falaknama, the Sabari and the Hyberabad-Chennai Express will continue to ply on the Nadikudi sector as usual, said Union minister of state for railways Bandaru Dattatreya here today.																								South Central Railway suspended all passenger trains in the Nizamabad sector five years ago after a train was torched on the route, services on which have been partially resumed this year.																								Dattatreya said all trains could be suspended on the route in view of serious threat to rail properties, including communications equipment, and the lives of local railwaymen, who sought protection.																								Naxalite attacks on two railway stations  Tummala Cheruvu and Pandugala  in the sector caused losses of nearly Rs 1.5 crore, he said, adding it would take several months to restore the railway stations and communication equipment.																								The Narayanadri, the Vishaka and the Narsapur Express would be diverted to the Kazipet and the Vijayawada routes and five passenger trains passing through Nadikudi would be suspended temporarily, the minister said.																								In a related development, PWG activists extended their violence to the north coastal Andhra district of Vizianagaram where they blasted a newly-built police station in Parvatipuram and shot dead a resident of Veldurthi Mandal in Guntur district after labelling him a police informer.																								The PWG also threatened to convert all its seven guerrilla zones into war fronts while observing the Peoples Guerrilla Armys foundation day yesterday. The Naxalites also appealed to literate youth to join the PGA and the creation of revolutionary peoples councils.																								The extremists also vowed to create guerrilla zones in Bengal and Orissa.																								PWG central military commission member Basavaraj said his outfit planned to seize weapons and train youths with a target of recruiting at least 2,000 of them prior to the summer camps of 2003.																								We shall not leave the enemy alive if he dares to enter our guerrilla zone, he added.

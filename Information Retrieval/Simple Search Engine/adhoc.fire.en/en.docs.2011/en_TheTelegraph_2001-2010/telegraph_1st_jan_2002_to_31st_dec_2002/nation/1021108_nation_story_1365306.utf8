		 Friday, November 08, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																TN bandit force leaves Karnataka				 																																																	 chennai: Tamil Nadu has pulled back its Special Task Force contingent from joint operations in the Karnataka forests to nab forest brigand Veerappan and the former is now confined to keeping vigil within Tamil Nadus borders only, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Disclosing this here on Thursday, Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa said the STF pullout had been done nearly a month back, following a request by Karnataka to withdraw our contingent from the forest areas in Karnataka.				 																																																	The decision has implications for efforts to rescue the former Karnataka minister, H. Nagappa, who was taken hostage by Veerappan on August 25 last. Asking for the STFs withdrawal has been one of Veerappans key demands in past abductions before agreeing to meet any emissary for negotiated release of his hostages.				 																																																	Jayalalithaa said since her last meeting with Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna in New Delhi on August 27, when they discussed the Nagappa crisis, Tamil Nadu had received no further information on what steps Karnataka had taken so far to rescue Nagappa from Veerappans clutches.				 																																																	Referring to the meeting Nagappas family members had with Jayalalithaa here on Wednesday, the ADMK chief said she had, at no point during their discussion, given any assurance on consulting legal experts on the question of sending the Tamil activist, Kolathur Mani, currently lodged in a Bellary prison, as an emissary to negotiate with the brigand.				 																Bomb-launcher amid houses 				 																																																	 dindigul (PTI): A bomb-launcher was recovered from a residential area here on Wednesday causing panic among residents, police sources said.				 																																																	The launcher was found near a sugar mill. The sources said the area was immediately cordoned off and the bomb disposal squad of the army was alerted. They took the weapon away, the sources added.				 																																																	The police did not rule out the possibility of the launcher being dropped inadvertently by some scrap dealer. There are several scrap shops in the area. Three persons were killed in the area early this year when a bomb exploded as it was being cut open by some scrap workers for its metal content.				 																Police rescue bonded boys				 																																																	 dindigul (PTI): Two boys, who were allegedly working as bonded labourers at a sweet shop at Surban in Surat district of Gujarat, have been rescued, police said. 				 																																																	The boys were taken to the town by a broker to whom the boys parents owed Rs 10,000. They were forced to work long and given two bare meals and paan masala to ward off hunger and sleep. The boys had managed to write to their parents and the police action followed.				 																Guard suicide				 																																																	 Jodhpur (PTI): A security guard at the residence of a Rajasthan High Court judge shot himself here on Thursday.

Child-kill charge				 																																																	 sriganganagar (PTI): Police arrested a 60-year-old man on Thursday for allegedly killing a boy to settle scores with his father. The nine-year-olds body was recovered with multiple injuries from a field near the Suratgarh-Padampur bypass on Monday. Investigations revealed he was last seen with the accused, a distant relative. The killer has confessed, the police said.				 																Mystery leak				 																																																	 sonepat (PTI): Two persons had to be hospitalised after some unidentified poisonous substance leaked from a tanker on the Old DC Road here on Wednesday. The leakage triggered panic as people started fleeing to safer places, police said. Deputy commissioner S.N. Roy gave orders to block the road and asked people to keep off. Health and fire officials rushed to the site.				 																Wine-sellers dead				 																																																	 madurai (PTI): Two employees of a wine shop were found dead in the shop at Rayappanpatti in Theni district on Wednesday.

Hostess school				 																																																	 dehra dun (PTI): The Air Hostess Academy has opened a branch in Dehradun for students aspiring to join travel, tourism and aviation sectors and hotels. The institute will offer two courses.				 																																																	A state-of-the-art visual and performing arts academy named after litterateur P.L.

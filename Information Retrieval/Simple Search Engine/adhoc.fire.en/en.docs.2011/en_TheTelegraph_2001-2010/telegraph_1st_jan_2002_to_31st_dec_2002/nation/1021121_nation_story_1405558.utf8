		 Thursday, November 21, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																30 killed as bus catches fire				 																																																	 jabalpur (PTI): At least 30 people were charred to death and 26 wounded when a bus caught fire after turning turtle near a village, 40 km from here on Thursday evening, police said.				 																																																	Additional superintendent of police B.S. Chauhan said the private bus, with a seating capacity of 80, overturned on the Jabalpur-Dindori road at Paharkheda village in Mandla district when one of its tyres burst. Soon, the bus was engulfed by a blaze set off by two petrol-filled drums kept inside the vehicle.				 																																																	Chauhan said 30 bodies have so far been extricated from under the mangled remains of the bus.				 																																																	He said many passengers of the bus fled after the blaze broke out and declined to confirm reports that the toll was as high as 70.				 																																																	The injured were admitted to hospitals in Jabalpur, where the condition of two was stated to be critical.				 																																																	Senior civil and police officials have rushed to the mishap site to supervise rescue and relief operations.				 																Director in dock for fake assault				 																																																	 bhopal (PTI): Three days after actor-director Raja Bundela allegedly stage-managed an assault on himself, police on Wednesday named him an accused in the case.				 																																																	The incident occurred on Sunday in front of a cinema hall where Bundelas film Pratha was being screened.				 																																																	A case has been registered and the director has been named an accused on the basis of evidence collected during investigations, superintendent of police Arun Pratap Singh said.				 																																																	Bundela will be asked to surrender before the police, he said. In case he fails to turn up, a police team will be sent to Mumbai to arrest him, Singh added.				 																																																	Suspicion arose after Bundela refused to file a case and press charges against the three persons arrested after the incident, Singh said. 				 																																																	The trio was let off on bail on Tuesday with one of the them giving a written statement that he was Bundelas friend and the incident had been stage-managed.				 																US relaxes travel warning				 																																																	 washington (AFP): The US on Thursday further downgraded warnings to Americans travelling to India.				 																																																	In a public announcement, the state department said although it could not rule out the risk of a return to the situation in which India and Pakistan appeared to be on the brink of war earlier this year, life in India had mostly returned to normal. 				 																																																	The department notes that the high level of tension between India and Pakistan that existed at the end of May and the beginning of June has further subsided, it said. The department, however, cautioned that military units were still in place along the Line of Control in Kashmir.

		 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 				 BJP meet on Kelkar report
																								New Delhi, Nov. 25: A committee, specially constituted by the BJP to study the recommendations of the central task force headed by Vijay Kelkar, adviser to the finance ministry, will hold its first meeting tomorrow and formalise the partys views on the proposals for tax reforms mooted by the task force, reports our special correspondent.																								So far the BJP has not come out with a considered view on the subject although privately many members, especially those from the poll-bound states of Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have voiced their unhappiness with the Kelkar recommendations for being too harsh on the salaried class.																								The committee is headed by BJP general secretary Rajnath Singh.

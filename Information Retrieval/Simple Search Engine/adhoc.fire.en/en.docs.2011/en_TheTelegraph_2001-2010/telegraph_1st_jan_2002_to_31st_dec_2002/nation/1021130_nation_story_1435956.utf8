		 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Champarans Lallu shot
																								Patna, Nov. 29: Lallu Yadav, a dacoit who lorded over the hilly forests of Bagaha in Champaran for over two decades, was killed in an encounter today, reports our special correspondent.																								Lallu would often say that he was the Bihar strongman in Champaran, much to the embarrassment of Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								Opposition politicians allege that a section of local Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders was in league with the Lallu in Bagaha.																								The dacoit is believed to have been responsible for over 100 murders, more than double the number of abductions and repeated attacks on backward caste members who refused to be loyal to him. 																								Director-general of police R.R. Prasad said several raids had been launched in the past to capture Lallu, but he always managed to escape, helped by his intimate knowledge of the area.

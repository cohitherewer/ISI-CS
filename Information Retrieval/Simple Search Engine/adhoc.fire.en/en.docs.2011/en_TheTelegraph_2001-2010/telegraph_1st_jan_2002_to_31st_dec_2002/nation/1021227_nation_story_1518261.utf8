 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Fatehgarh Sahib, Dec. 26: Chief minister Amarinder Singh today said the Punjab government was zeroing in on Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal for corruption during his tenure.																								We are zeroing in on Badal, Amarinder said, maintaining that the state administration was in no hurry to arrest Badal and that he had directed the vigilance department to ensure that investigations against Badal were carried out meticulously. 																								The chief minister said his crusade against corruption would reach its logical end only after Badals arrest. 																								If Badal and his colleagues treat his anti-corruption drive as an attempt to settle political and personal scores, then Badal was living in a fools paradise, Amarinder said. The Congress had promised to root out corruption in its manifesto, he added.																								Amarinder, who was addressing a mammoth gathering here to mark the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singhs two sons, Zorawar and Fateh, criticised Badal for his unstinting support to the Hindutva ideology of the BJP during the Gujarat election.

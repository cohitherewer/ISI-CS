 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Sept. 6: The Opposition has taken the Mayavati government to task for dilly-dallying on the constitution of the human rights panel in the state despite the directives by the National Human Rights Commission and the Supreme Court.																								Raising the issue, Samajwadi Party leader Reoti Raman Singh said the rights panel must be constituted immediately if the government was serious about checking atrocities on women, Dalits and the poor, which were continuing unabated in the state.																								Congress Legislature Party leader Pramod Tiwari alleged the government was deliberately ignoring the Supreme Court directive. If 11 states can set up commissions abiding by the directives of the National Human Rights Commission and the Supreme Court, then why not Uttar Pradesh? asked Tiwari.																								Opposition MLA Sanjay Garg said he failed to understand why the government was against setting up the panel. The previous government had even sought a panel of judges to select a chairman, chosen a place for the office in Jawahar Bhavan and also decided to employ 50 persons to man the office, he pointed out.																								Out of 71,685 human rights cases reported from all over the country, 41,984 were from the state, the MLA said. Still the government was not in mood to set up the commission. Had the commission been set up, the state would not have topped in human rights violations, Garg said.																								Garg said about 17 Dalits were killed in fake encounters by police at Bhawanipur in Mirzapur district, but the government, instead of taking action against the police personnel, rewarded them. Twelve adivasis and dalits in Sonebhadra and 14 in Chopan had been arrested under without reason under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, alleged Garg.																								Parliamentary affairs minister Sukhdeo Rajbhar countered that cases involving violation of the rights of underprivileged were being dealt with by the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes Commission. He refused to fix a deadline for constituting the human rights panel.

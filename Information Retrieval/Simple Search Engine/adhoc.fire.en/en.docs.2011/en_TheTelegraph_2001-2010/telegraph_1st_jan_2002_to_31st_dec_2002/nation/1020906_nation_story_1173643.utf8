		 Friday, September 06, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Naidu minister quits over graft				 																																																	 hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh panchayati raj minister P. Srinivas Reddy, at the centre of a storm over stationery purchase scandal in his department, resigned on Thursday, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Investigations revealed that his relatives used his clout to make superintendent engineers of the department purchase items worth crores of rupees. Chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has forwarded Reddys resignation to Governer C. Rangarajan.				 																																																	Reddys resignation came hours after he defended himself at a press conference. Although he had met Naidu on Wednesday night to explain his stand, Reddy had no choice but to resign following vigilance raids on officials of his department and their confessional statements.				 																																																	Earlier, officials of the anti-corruption bureau raided the residence and office of the superintendent engineer of the panchayati raj department in Kurnool and seized cash and jewellery worth Rs 1 crore. Similar raids were conducted on several other engineers of the department over the last two days on Naidus instructions.				 																																																	It may be recalled that a relative of the minister had billed the department stationery worth Rs 32 crore by compelling superintendent engineers of all the zones to make purchases for nearly the next 15 years.				 																																																	This is the second instance of financial irregularity during the Naidu regime after the scholarship scam in which Rs 82 crore was released to bogus educational institutions. However, no minister was blamed for that scandal.				 																CBI move to extradite Andersen				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): Days after a Bhopal court turned down the CBIs plea for diluting charges against former Union Carbide chairman Warren Andersen in the Bhopal gas tragedy case, the agency said extradition proceedings against the accused would be initiated soon.				 																																																	We will be soon be going back to the government and seek permission for initiating extradition proceedings under Section 304 (culpable homicide), said CBI director P.C. Sharma. 				 																																																	The CBI has filed chargesheets against 12 people, who include Anderson, two foreign companies and nine Indian citizens. While charges against nine of them were diluted from culpable homicide to negligence in the Supreme Court, the CBI had decided to change the charges of Anderson from Section 304 to Section 304-A (death due to negligence). This was rejected by the Bhopal court.				 																																																	he Bhopal court had rejected CBIs application for dilution of charges against Anderson saying: There is no sense in reducing the charges since Andersen, who has been declared an absconder and against whom a permanent arrest warrant has been issued, has not appeared in any court. 				 																Population panel meet				 																																																	 calcutta: The first full meeting of the 46-member West Bengal population commission was held at Writers Buildings on Thursday, nine months after it was formed.

Stress will be on public awareness and an integrated approach, involving panchayats, municipalities, NGOs, the media, students, and self-help groups for women, Bhattacharjee said.

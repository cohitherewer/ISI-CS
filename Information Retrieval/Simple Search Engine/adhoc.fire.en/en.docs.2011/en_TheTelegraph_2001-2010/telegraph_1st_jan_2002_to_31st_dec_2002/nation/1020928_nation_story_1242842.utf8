		 Saturday, September 28, 2002 				 Sangh boss in capital comeback
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 27: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief K.S. Sudarshan has decided to end his two-year self-imposed exile from the capital instead of confining himself to the Nagpur headquarters and other places.																								In what is being seen as a welcome back reception, the Delhi RSS has planned to organise a shubha agaman (auspicious welcome) for Sudarshan on October 2.																								The Sangh has proposed to invite the capitals thinking class for an interactive session with the RSS chief during which Sudarshan is expected to spell out his views on how challenges facing the country should be handled.																								Sudarshan had returned to the capital when the controversy over the disinvestment of HPCL-BPCL was raging. The RSS opposition to the divestment plan played a role in shaping the governments decision to defer a settlement by three months. 																								RSS sources were, however, quick to clarify that Sudarshans presence in Delhi would not spell trouble for the government. The sources added that the general secretary in charge of the Sanghs political cell, Madan Das Devi, would continue being its main interface with the government and the BJP.																								The sarsanghachalaks post has a lot of sanctity. His word on any matter is taken as the final one. So naturally, Sudarshan would not intervene on each and every issue unless it is very critical, the sources maintained.																								Sudarshan had shifted to Nagpur because after becoming the chief, he made negative statements on government policies and was also critical of certain senior members in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO).																								It was felt that Sudarshans interventions were hampering the governments working, especially in the economic and business sectors. He was advised by veteran RSS members to stay away from the capital for some time. Since then, for the past two years, Sudarshan has been barely seen or heard.																								Sangh sources said Sudarshan finally decided to make up with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and not subject him or the government to any discomfiture. A statement he issued on the Gandhinagar temple siege reflected the changed mindset in that he toed the official line and blamed Pakistan for the attack instead of local Muslims. Sudarshan also counselled restraint.																								It will be a fatal mistake if Pakistan thinks that it can realise its monstrous designs of swallowing Kashmir by indulging in such reprehensible acts in different parts of India. Let it also realise that it will have to pay a heavy price for this sooner than later, Sudarshan said.																								While it was natural for the nation to express its hurt feelings, this should be done through democratic means only and in such a way that it would demolish the evil machinations of Pakistan to spread unrest all over the country, he added.																								The Sanghs militant wing, the VHP, however, went on the front foot and castigated the Vajpayee-led government for not doing enough to tackle terrorism. VHP vice-president Acharya Giriraj Kishore demanded war on Pakistan and called for a liberal issuing of arms licences to people and temple staff.																								The attack on Parliament, the Raghunath temple in Jammu and now the Akshardham temple has proved that this government has not only failed to check terrorism but is also not competent to deal with it, he alleged.																								The BJP has had to deal with similar views expressed by its own members at its national executive meeting yesterday. But sources dismissed Kishores rantings as predictable, and said: Sangh cadre do need a forum to express what they really feel about the attack and the VHP is one.

		 Wednesday, November 06, 2002 				 Naidu turns down names for Governor
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Nov. 5: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has reportedly rejected the names suggested by L.K. Advani as replacement for Governor C. Rangarajan, whose term expires in the last week of November.																								According to sources in the Telugu Desam Party, the deputy Prime Minister discussed the issue with Naidu during his recent visit to Hyderabad. This was the second time they held talks on the subject following their earlier discussions in Delhi.																								It appears Naidu had recommended that either agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan or defence adviser R. Chidambaram take the place of Rangarajan, whom Naidu had chosen to replace Krishan Kant in 1997 when the latter became Vice-President.																								Sources said the BJP leadership, looking for an opportunity to find berths for several veterans who have been in political wilderness, suggested a few names but Naidu rejected them. He also rejected the second list of probable replacements brought by Advani last week.																								The names of Nanaji Deshmukh, Soli Sorabjee, Sikander Bakht, H.V. Seshadri and Jagannath Rao Joshi were among those suggested by Advani.																								Rangarajan has brought a sea change to the culture of the post. The office of the Governor had hit the headlines during the tenure of Kumud Ben Joshi, who floated several voluntary organisations under the umbrella of Raj Bhavan for personal popularity.

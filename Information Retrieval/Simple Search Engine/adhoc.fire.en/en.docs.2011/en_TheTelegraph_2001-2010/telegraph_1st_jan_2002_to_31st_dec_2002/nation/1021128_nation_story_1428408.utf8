Police sources said the assailants barged into the residence of Jajati Keshari Sahu, secretary of the BJDs Rayagada unit, around midnight and asked all family members to assemble in the courtyard.				 																																																	After beating up Sahu, the Naxalites dragged him to a secluded spot and shot him dead from point-blank range, the sources said.				 																																																	Sahu, a former chairman of the Padmapur block committee and member of the zilla parishad, had celebrated his engagement just two days earlier. He was 35.				 																																																	Rayagada superintendent of police R.K. Sharma reached the village on Wednesday to take stock of the situation. He said the combing operation would continue till the killers were arrested. Sources said the assailants were probably members of the Naxalite group led by Sabyasachi Panda. The group is active in Rayagada and Gajapati districts. Six policemen were killed in a blast triggered by Naxalites at Gothalpadar in Rayagada district three months ago.				 																Slain cops family awaits justice				 																																																	 New Delhi: A dead constables family has joined the hordes of Delhiites who dont subscribe to the Delhi police motto: With you, for you, always. 				 																																																	Traffic police constable Anoop Singh died under mysterious circumstances on January 29, last year. A week later, the family recovered his body from a hospital mortuary where it was lying unidentified, reports our special correspondent. 				 																																																	The police offered little help to the family to determine the cause behind Anoops death and they had to shuttle from one police station to another. Although the Rohini police station had earlier registered a missing complaint, it subsequently closed the investigation, claiming the constable had died in a road accident.				 																																																	The police did not even bother to probe the leads provided by us, Anoops elder brother Diwan Singh, a Railway Protection Force constable, told The Telegraph. 				 																																																	The dead constables family is suspicious of Anoops wife, Mamata. Diwan alleged that Mamata had turned up for her husbands funeral after much coaxing from her in-laws and her reactions were unlike that of a widow. He said the family had written to the police commissioner for a probe into Anoops mysterious demise and for the pension benefits to be withheld from Mamata, but nothing had happened. 				 																HC questions Ansal witness				 																																																	 New Delhi: Delhi High Court questioned Hari Krishnas claim to being a witness to the Ansal Plaza encounter, while disposing of the writ petition filed seeking an independent inquiry into the killing of two militants in the basement of Ansal Plaza on Diwali eve.				 																																																	Chief Justice Devinder Gupta and Justice A.K. Sikri directed the doctor, who had challenged the Delhi police version of the encounter, to appear before the South Delhi assistant commissioner of police, Ranbir Singh, at 4 pm on Thursday to record his statement as a witness, reports our special correspondent.

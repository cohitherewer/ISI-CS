 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 21: Passengers on the Shatabdi Express bound for Ranchi had a narrow escape this morning when a track fracture was detected near Belur station just before the train was to pass through.																								The crack was spotted by railway inspection staff at 6.10 am and they informed the cabinman at Belur station. 																								The Shatabdi, which left Howrah at 6.05 am, was due to pass the spot in about 10 minutes. The train was halted for an hour while the fracture was repaired. Eastern Railway sources said track fracture was a common feature at this time of the year due to temperature variations.

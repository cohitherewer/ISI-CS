		 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Court fixes date for Ansal hearing 
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 18: Delhi High Court today fixed November 20 for hearing a petition of the homeopath who claims to be a witness of the November 3 Ansal Plaza encounter.																								Hari Krishna, who has alleged that the encounter was staged, has sought a court order to quash a police notice asking him to record his statement under Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 																								Krishna alleged that policemen had shot dead unarmed and unresisting persons and not terrorists, as they had claimed. 																								He had also said the November 3 encounter should be investigated by an independent agency as the police, being an interested party, could not be expected to be impartial and unbiased.																								However, it is not yet known why Krishna is refusing to record his statement as per the requirement of law. 																								His counsel Surat Singh told a division bench of Justices Dalveer Bhandari and H.R. Malhotra that the police were pressurising Krishna to give a particular type of statement and hence, the refusal. 																								My client has apprehension that the police might proceed against him under Section 174 of the Indian Penal Code. The police notice to him was merely to cover up their action, Singh told the bench which fixed the date of hearing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, November 20, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Digvijay missive on Bhopal case in US				 																																																	 bhopal (PTI): Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh has urged Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to ask his ministers to maintain a close watch on a case relating to the Bhopal gas tragedy being adjudicated in the US.				 																																																	Singh has written to the Prime Minister in the light of a ruling by the US court of appeals on November 15 that additional environmental claims apply to both Union Carbide and Anderson, an official release said.				 																																																	In effect, the court has ruled in favour of the Bhopal gas victims, the chief minister said. 				 																																																	The out-of-court settlement of the case in India does not cover the damages to the environment of Bhopal and a lower court has been directed to decide on the matter.				 																																																	The judgment of the American court may have an implication in making available substantial resources as compensation in lieu of environmental damages caused in Bhopal.				 																Punjab youths in Pakistan jail				 																																																	 gurdaspur (PTI): Over a dozen youths, who paid huge sums to travel agents to settle abroad, are languishing in Quetta Jail in Pakistan.				 																																																	A letter from one of the youths in jail to his uncle at Sohal in this district brought the issue to light. 				 																																																	Satnam Singh wrote to uncle Gurdial Singh that instead of settling in Greece as promised by his travel agent, he and his friend are languishing in Quetta. 				 																																																	He added that over a dozen youths are with them in jail for months.				 																																																	Gurdial said Satnam and his friend paid Rs 3 lakh to a travel agent to migrate to Greece. 				 																																																	They were flown to Oman first and taken to Lebanon from there. 				 																																																	They later went to Turkey and from there to Iraq, allegedly with fake visas. The duo was arrested in Iraq and deported to Pakistan.				 																																																	Seeking the Centres intervention in getting Satnam deported to India, Gurdial said he feared Satnam might be implicated in a false case in Pakistan and held back.				 																Police allege murder by burial				 																																																	 alibag (PTI): Police in Pen have charged a woman with killing an infant by burying him. 				 																																																	Gangubai Yashwant Ughada was waiting at the Pen bus stand on Monday with nine-month-old son Harishchandra when another woman wanted to feed him. She took the child and never returned. He was found buried at Ambagaon. The police said it appeared to be a case of blind faith.				 																Salem absconder				 																																																	 bhopal (PTI): Don Abu Salem, his wife Rubiya Baig and girlfriend Monica Bedi were declared absconders by a local court and their bank accounts with deposits worth Rs 12 lakh seized. Acting on a crime branch petition, the judge declared them absconders in a case of forgery, making false passports and attempt to murder. Salem and Monica were recently arrested in Portugal. 				 																Cauvery meet				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): The Centre is mulling convening a meeting of the Cauvery River Authority on November 29 in another attempt to resolve the row over sharing of the river water by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Besides the Prime Minister, the chief ministers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry comprise the authority. 				 																Tourism slide				 																																																	 guilin (PTI): India, which held the top spot on the list of the fastest growing travel and tourism economies in the world in 2000, has yielded the position to Turkey. China is surging ahead to take the top spot in 2003, a tourism expert predicted at an international tourism conference here.				 																Leonid shower				 																																																	 nagpur (PTI): Skywatchers in the city were treated to a feast of the Leonid meteor storm between 4 am and 6 on Tuesday. This is probably the last celestial firework display for at least three decades.				 																Quattrocchi case				 																																																	 kuala lumpur (PTI): A sessions court judge hearing Ottavio Quattrocchis extradition case here on Tuesday said he needed two weeks to announce his judgement on objections raised by the Italian businessmans counsel against his extradition to India.

The show is part of the World Heritage Week starting Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, October 02, 2002 				 Train tickets on Net
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 1: The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation today launched an Internet ticketing facility for Calcutta and the districts. Only credit card holders will be able to take advantage of the facility. 																								Eastern Railway chief commercial manager Ashok Gupta said users can avail of the facility daily at the usual ticketing hours. 																								The tickets should be bought two days prior to the journey so that they can be sent by courier to the buyers residence. The tickets have a service charge of Rs 50 per purchase for upper classes and Rs 30 for sleeper class, he said. 																								All modifications or cancellations will, however, be over the counter. 																								The service is at present limited to the city, but the IRCTC plans to extend the facility soon outside greater Calcutta and to Howrah. But the users in these places would have to collect the tickets from a dedicated counter in Calcutta. We will not be able to courier to destinations in other districts, but they can avail of the Internet facility and collect their tickets before the journey, Gupta said.																								The facility already exists in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. It is nothing but an additional facility that we are offering, Gupta said. The railways expect to start this home-delivered, online system in all state capitals shortly.

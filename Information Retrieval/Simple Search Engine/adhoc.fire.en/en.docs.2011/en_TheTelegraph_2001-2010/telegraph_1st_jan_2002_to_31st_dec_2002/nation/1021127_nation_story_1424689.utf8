		 Wednesday, November 27, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Candidate fined for false plea 				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court dismissed the petition of defeated candidate in the Haryana Assembly elections, Mahendra Pratap, and imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 for seeking recounting of votes on false grounds. 				 																																																	Justifying the imposition of fine, a bench of Justices M.B. Shah and D.M. Dharmadhikari said unless such deterrent action was taken, attempts to pollute the judicial process would be made through frivolous petitions. 				 																																																	In election petitions filed with prayer for recount of votes, the court had always insisted on a high standard of proof or grounds, as would persuade the court to grant the prayer, Justice Dharmadhikari said.				 																																																	Where false facts are pleaded and false evidence is produced to mislead the court into interfering with the peoples verdict of election, the misconduct of the parties to the election has to be viewed seriously, he said.

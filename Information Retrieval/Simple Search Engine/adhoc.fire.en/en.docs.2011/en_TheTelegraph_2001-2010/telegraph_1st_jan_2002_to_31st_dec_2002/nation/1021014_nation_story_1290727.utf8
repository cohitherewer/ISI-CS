		 Monday, October 14, 2002 				 Karnataka dithers over bandit envoy
																								Bangalore, Oct. 13 (PTI): With barely a day left to meet Veerappans eight-day deadline to send two emissaries of his choice to negotiate H. Nagappas release, Karnataka was yet to decide on the bandits demand, official sources said.																								Veerappan, who sent an audio cassette, the third since the kidnap, had demanded that jailed Tamil activist Kolathur Mani and local JD (U) leader Ponnachi Mahadevaswamy be sent as emissaries in eight days, failing which he would harm the Janata Dal (United) leader.																								The government had declared that it had no objection to sending Mahadevaswamy, if he was willing to go. The bandit accepted him as emissary, as there were legal impediments in deputing Mani.																								Mani is in Bellary jail, facing five cases. Karnataka High Court adjourned hearing on his bail applications to next week.																								Police were yet to establish contact with Mahadevaswamy. They could not say if he had gone incommunicado after the bandit sought him as emissary.

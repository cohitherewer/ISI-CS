 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 29: The Khaleda Zia government today reassured India that it would not allow its territory to be used for carrying out anti-Indian activities, following reports that the al Qaida and armed rebel groups of the northeast were setting up bases in Bangladesh.																								The assurance came from Bangladesh Rifles chief Razaqul Haider during his meeting with home secretary N. Gopalswamy here this afternoon. 																								The Bangladesh government and BDR has carried out intensive search and combing operations. I can reaffirm that the soil of Bangladesh will not be allowed to used for any kind of insurgency operation against any country, Haider said. He is heading the 17-member delegation at the annual conference of heads of two border forces.																								On the last years border clashes, Haider said: As long as we see them as local problems and do not allow them to spark elsewhere, I think we will be able to do a good job. 																								Border Security Force director Ajai Raj Sharma was also present at the meeting.																								Earlier, Sharma told the Bangladeshi team that continued influx by illegal migrants from across the border and activities of militants of northeast operating from Bangladeshi soil have become a matter of serious concern. He stressed on the need for coordinated efforts between the two sides to tackle this problem.

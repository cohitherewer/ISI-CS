The A-310 plane was emptied and its 178 passengers and their baggage thoroughly searched after an anonymous caller told the Hong Kong immigration authorities that the passengers, whom he identified as Paramjit Kaur and Pawan Kumar, were planning to blow it up at the Chinese port city. 				 																																																	However, there were no such names on the passenger list, an airline spokesperson said.				 																																																	Flight A-I 303, which arrived here from Mumbai at 7.55 am on its way to Hong Kong, finally took off at 12.40 pm.				 																																																	This was the fifth such incident in the past week.

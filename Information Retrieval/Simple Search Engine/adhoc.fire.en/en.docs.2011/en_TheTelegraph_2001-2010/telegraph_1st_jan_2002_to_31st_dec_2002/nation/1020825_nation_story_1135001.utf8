 MUKHTAR AHMAD 																								Srinagar, Aug. 24: Suspected militants gunned down a dozen villagers in three separate strikes in the two hilly districts of Rajouri and Doda in Jammu since last night, just a day after the notification for the Assembly polls was issued. 																								Police said gunmen forced into the dwellings of nomadic tribals in Dhudhassan village, nearly 185 km from Jammu, in Rajouri district late last night and sprayed bullets on the sleeping residents. 																								Eight persons died on the spot and the gunmen escaped under the cover of darkness, said a police official in Jammu. 																								When news of the massacre reached Rajouri early this morning, senior police officials rushed to the village with additional forces. No group has claimed responsibility. 																								In Hayatpora village near Manjakote in the same district, gunmen shot dead two more villagers in the early hours of the morning and escaped.

The escalation in violence follows the notification for polls issued by the Election Commission on August 22.

 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, Aug. 23: Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala today ordered the suspension of Ravi Kant Sharma, senior IPS officer and prime suspect in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case.																								Chautala had said yesterday that the IPS officer should give himself up so that truth might prevail. He had added that that those holding high office should follow the rule of law.																								Indian National Lok Dal sources said Chautala was under intense pressure from the Centre to suspend Sharma before the officers bail application came up for hearing in Delhi High Court. 																								The Haryana government had earlier removed Sharma as IGP (Prisons) for abstaining from work after the expiry of his leave.																								Delhi police crime branch personnel have been camping here since August 3 with a non-bailable warrant against Sharma. Sharmas wife Madhu was questioned by the team members yesterday.																								They (Haryana government) must have taken the right decision. They must have followed the rules, Madhu said today. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

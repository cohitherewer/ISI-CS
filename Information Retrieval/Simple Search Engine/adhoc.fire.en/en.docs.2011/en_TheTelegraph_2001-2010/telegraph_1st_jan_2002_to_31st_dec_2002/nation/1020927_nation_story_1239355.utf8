RBI regional director M.D. Jha said here that police had refused to register 6,000 cases relating to forged notes during the last five months citing shortage of investigating officers to tackle such a large number of cases.				 																																																	Jha said the police had also not completed investigations into over 5,000 FIRs lodged by the RBI in the last four years. He said the RBI had received about 6,000 fake notes through remittances from various banks. The RBI, he said, detected about 10 cases of fake currency at its counters on an average every day in Bihar.				 																																																	A neighbouring country is engaged in supplying fake currency notes to different parts of India through Nepal, he added. 				 																																																	Jha said the RBI was providing training to bank personnel to detect fake currencies. It has also given instructions to all banks not to harass innocent people cheated by anti-social elements circulating the fake currency.				 																																																	The RBI has also installed a currency verification and processing system that can process 60,000 currency notes per hour, besides detecting fake ones, Jha said.				 																HC transfer salvo at fire brigade				 																																																	Allahabad (PTI): Does growing long hair and beard amount to indiscipline and warrant transfer of people in the fire department?

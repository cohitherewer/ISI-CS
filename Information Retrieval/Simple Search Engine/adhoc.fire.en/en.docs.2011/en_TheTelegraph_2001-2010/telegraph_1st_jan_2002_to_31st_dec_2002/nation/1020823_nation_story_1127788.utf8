		 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Joint-scan scheme resurrection on Delhi agenda
 SUJAN DUTTA				 	 Armitage in Sri Lanka on Thursday. (Reuters)																								New Delhi, Aug. 22: India is likely to make an offer to coordinate with Pakistani security forces to bring down infiltration across the Line of Control in talks that are to be held with visiting US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage tomorrow. 																								Armitage is expected to meet national security adviser Brajesh Mishra, defence minister George Fernandes and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee  though the appointment with the Prime Minister is not yet confirmed  in New Delhi tomorrow. 																								A possible Indian offer for coordination comes despite Vajpayees proposal for joint patrolling of the LoC having been all but buried. Neither did Islamabad take to the proposal made by the Prime Minister in Almaty nor did New Delhi follow it up in a structured manner. 																								The security establishment in New Delhi had concluded, after Vajpayee had made the proposal, that it was unworkable in the current situation. 																								Early this year, army chief General S. Padmanabhan had said that the nature of the border in Kashmir is such that even if joint patrolling is carried out, infiltration cannot be brought to a stop. The same conclusion was reached by intelligence agencies and it was conveyed to the political leadership after Vajpayees proposal in Almaty. 																								An assessment within the security establishment indicates New Delhi will tell Armitage that the US can consider using its offices to influence Islamabad on taking demonstrative action to curb infiltration. This was all the more important, sources said, after Musharraf said earlier this week that rogue elements may continue to cross the LoC. 																								The Indian side is likely to point out during the talks tomorrow that though the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in the North Western Frontier Province (NWFP), Federally Administered Territorial Areas (FATA) and Provincially Administered Territorial Areas (PATA) was more porous, the patrolling and monitoring of these stretches by the Pakistani forces had brought down traffic across these borders. 																								A similar operation should be mounted by Pakistan for the LoC, too, New Delhi is likely to suggest. 																								Pakistani aircraft do make surveillance sorties every four hours in the lower areas along the LoC  mostly opposite Poonch and Mendhar  but this was not enough. 																								Sources in the security establishment say India will also want greater interaction between he Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) and even between sector commanders on both sides. 																								However, these would be contingent on Islamabads political will to check infiltration. The perception here is that such coordination would also enable New Delhi to measure whether the infiltration that might still take place was due to wilful negligence or due to inability of the Pakistani forces.  copy;  Copyrights 2002.

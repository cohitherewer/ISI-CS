Health minister Tilak Raj Behad was taking a stroll in front of his house in Yamuna Colony when the shootout occurred, police said. The minister was not injured.

Ministers to hold Nagappa meet				 																																																	 bangalore: In a clear signal that renewed efforts are on to get former minister and Janata Dal leader H. Nagappa released from the clutches of forest brigand Veerappan, two Karnataka ministers have fixed up a meeting with Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa on November 18, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The sole agenda of the meeting  to be attended by Karnataka home minister Mallikharjun Kharge and minister of state for primary and secondary education B.K. Chandrashekar  is the discussion on the hostage crisis, which has been going on for the past 81 days. 				 																																																	Karnataka made a request for a meeting with Jayalalithaa after Fridays meeting between Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna, Kharge, Chandrashekar and top police officials.				 																																																	Central to the discussions on the 18th could be a request from Karnataka to tone down the operations of the Tamil Nadu Special Task Force against Veerappan. 				 																																																	Indications are that Tamil Nadus insistence that it will not tone down its operations against Veerappan is standing in the way of fruitful negotiations to secure the release of Nagappa.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 22: First he impersonated an MP and lost his job. Now he is behind bars for forging two letters from deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani.																								The CBI has booked former Central Reserve Police Force constable Satyendra Tewari for forging two letters from Advani to get back his job.																								Tewari, a constable in the CRPFs 3rd battalion, had joined the force in April 1990. He was dismissed from service on March 28, 2000.																								Posted at Mokama Ghat in 1999, Tewari got marching orders after a departmental inquiry showed that he had impersonated an MP and made malicious allegations in writing against his senior officers.																								Another complaint was that, after availing casual leave, he allegedly did not make necessary entries in the record books.																								To wrest back his job, Tewari invoked Advanis name in the two forged letters to order the CRPF to reinstate him, CBI sources said.																								The first of the forged letters, of December 11, 2001, was addressed to CRPF Bihar sector inspector-general of police Shahid Ahmad. The second, addressed to director-general Trinath Mishra, came on February 20, 2002.																								According to the sources, the letters also directed the CRPF to post Tewari at Muzaffarpur with immediate effect.																								The CRPF cross-checked the letters from Advanis private secretary with the man himself. He confirmed that Advani never wrote any such letter.																								Tewari was slapped with a case last month after the CRPF registered a complaint against him.																								The CRPF then sent assistant commandant V.P. Singh to contact Tewari at his village, Naya Jaipur, in Jharkhands Palamu district.																								When Singh asked him about the official letters, Tewari pleaded ignorance. According to the CBI, the former constable said Braj Mohan Ram, an MP, was pleading his case with the Union home minister.																								The CRPF being on his trail, however, did not deter Tewari from forging another letter, this time from CRPF inspector-general (personnel) P.P.S. Sandhu. The letter directed Sandhus counterpart in Bihar to reinstate Tewari.																								According to a CBI officer, specific instructions in the forged letter said Tewari be given a Muzaffarpur posting. When asked, Sandhu said he never wrote such a letter.

		 Sunday, December 29, 2002 				 Preparations for testing BrahMos
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: Senior officials of the Defence Research and Development Organisation are now in Chandipur, preparing for an important missile test, defence ministry sources confirmed today.																								One official said preparations were on at the Interim Test Range to test-fire the supersonic cruise missile, BrahMos, jointly produced by Indian and Russia.																								However, a PTI report from Balasore said the test-firing of the indigenously-developed Prithvi was re-scheduled.																								The experiment has been postponed for the second time in two days because of a technical problem in its sub-system, PTI said, quoting ITR sources.																								The sources did not divulge the nature of the problem nor did they say when the surface-to-surface missile would be test-fired again. 																								It was not immediately clear why the Prithvi should be test-fired now. In Delhi, defence sources did not explain why the missile, which has already been inducted into the army and was even operationally deployed during the stand-off with Pakistan, should be tested now. The DRDO has already conducted 16 trials of the army version of the missile.																								The BrahMos, too, was flight-tested at Chandipur in June this year. DRDO sources said the missile will be put through more tests before it can be declared ready for induction. The joint venture BrahMos is produced by the DRDO and NPO Mashinostroyenia.

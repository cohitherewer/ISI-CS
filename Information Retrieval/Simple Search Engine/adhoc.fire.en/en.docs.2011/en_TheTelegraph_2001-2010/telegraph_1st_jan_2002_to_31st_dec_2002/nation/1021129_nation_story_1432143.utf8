		 Friday, November 29, 2002 				 Turner set to launch movie channel
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 28: With HBO moving out of the Zee-Turner stable, Turner is keen to get its own movie channel in.																								It is not clear what the identity of the channel will be, but industry sources said Turner is likely to introduce Cinemax, its international movie channel, to India from early next year.																								HBO, the movie channel, announced the decision to move out of the Zee-Turner bouquet two days ago and joined the Sony platform, while Zee-Turner had the business news channel CNBC as an addition.																								We are looking into opportunities, said a Turner spokesperson, but did not disclose details of the new movie channel. She did not deny, though, that a new channel could make an entry.																								Turner had its own movie channel, Turner Classic Movies, but it was pulled off two years ago. TCM was aired during the night and Cartoon Network on the same channel during the day.																								But it was found that there was a viewership for Cartoon Network for 24 hours, said the Turner spokesperson.																								The new movie channel, if it finally comes in, will add to Zee-Turners platform that has all the Zee channels, Turners CNN and Cartoon Network. It will have to contend with two strong competitors in India: STAR Movies and HBO.

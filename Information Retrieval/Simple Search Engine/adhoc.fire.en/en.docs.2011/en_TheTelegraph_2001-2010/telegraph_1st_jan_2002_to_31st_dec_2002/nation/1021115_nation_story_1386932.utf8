Raghu, 19, a tenth-standard dropout, used to frequently fight with the five students of the locality where he stayed with his father  a small-time betel-leaf trader. Police sources in Salem said these quarrels always began as he tried to assert his ego. 				 																																																	The five students of a government higher secondary school at Mettur in Salem district, were angered by their domineering friend and decided to teach him a lesson. 				 																																																	The assailants, all under 20, invited Raghu for a round of drinks in a class room last night and humoured him with too much rum. Soon, Raghu fell unconscious and the boys pounced on him with knives. They stabbed him repeatedly before slashing his throat. 				 																																																	The drunk teenagers were not able to keep the noise down, and awakened neighbours alerted the police. They rushed to the school and caught four fleeing students  Senthil Kumar, a Plus II student, Natarajan, Naresh and Sankar. 				 																																																	They were lodged in Salem jail after being remanded in judicial custody on Thursday evening. Sources said the fifth culprit would soon be apprehended.

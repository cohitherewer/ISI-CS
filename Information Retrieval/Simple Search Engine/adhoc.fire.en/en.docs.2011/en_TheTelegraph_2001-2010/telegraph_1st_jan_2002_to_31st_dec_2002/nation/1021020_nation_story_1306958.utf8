		 Sunday, October 20, 2002 				 PM team calls on Maran
 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, Oct. 19: Union health minister Shatrughan Sinha today led a special team sent by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enquire about Murasoli Marans health.																								The Union industry and commerce minister is suffering from a serious heart ailment. He has been battling for life for nearly a month now.																								Sinha, accompanied by director general of health services S.P. Agarwal, first called on the DMK leader, who was admitted to Apollo Hospital on September 23. The health minister then met DMK chief M. Karunanidhi and Union ministers T.R. Baalu and A. Raja at the hospital.																								Maran had undergone an emergency mitral valve replacement on September 25 after fungal infection developed on the valve replaced in July at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi.																								The minister was then put on dialysis as the fungal infection spread to other organs, including his lungs and kidney, hospital authorities said. Subsequently, Marans condition improved slightly but then began to rapidly deteriorate. He was then administered a new drug imported from the US on the advice of specialists in Apollo and abroad.																								Sinha, however, did not express any anxiety about the files that have reportedly been piling up in the two key ministries under Maran. 																								The Prime Minister is very concerned about Marans health and we have been specially sent from Delhi, was all that Sinha was willing to say.																								Sinha assured all possible central assistance to Maran, including facilitating procurement of anything that may need to be imported. 																								We all wish, hope and pray that he will come out of this crisis, he said.																								Agarwal and Apollo Hospitals chairman P.C. Reddy said Marans condition is still serious but stable.																								When a reporter asked the health minister about the controversy over the treatment given to Maran at AIIMS, Reddy appealed to the people not to politicise professional decisions. No doctor would want to do harm to any patient, he added.																								Sinha also virtually ruled out taking Maran abroad for further treatment now, saying the DMK leader is in safe hands with the best of doctors and treatment attending on him.

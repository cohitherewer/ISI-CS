More than 25 pilots were killed and the damage has been estimated to be worth more than Rs 1,100 crore. 																								What is more, the members said, even the upgraded aircraft  that are treated as new by the force  had crashed. Flying ace Squadron Leader Prashant Bundela succumbed to injuries after a crash earlier this year.																								The MiG-21s form a bulk of the air forces fighting force with an estimated 20 squadrons. The MiG-21 is originally of 1960s vintage but the Bison variant is of the 1970s.

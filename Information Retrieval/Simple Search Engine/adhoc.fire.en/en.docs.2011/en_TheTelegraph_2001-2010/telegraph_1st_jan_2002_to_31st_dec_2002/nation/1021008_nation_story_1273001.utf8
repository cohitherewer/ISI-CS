 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Ram Vilas Paswan																								Patna, Oct. 7: Ram Vilas Paswans loyalists have finally got even: they have wiped Nitish Kumars name off the face of East-Central Railways spanking new Hajipur headquarters.																								Cut up because Kumar allegedly stole their leaders thunder --- the Hajipur project was conceived when Paswan was rail minister but Kumar got it cleared by the Centre and inaugurated the premises on October 1 --- suspected Paswan supporters have pinched a marble plaque with the rail ministers name inscribed on it.																								The plaque, saying that Kumar had laid the foundation stone of the building, was found missing on Sunday morning, sources at East-Central Railway said. Nowhere did it mention Paswans name nor acknowledge the project as his brainchild.																								Close to the spot from where the plaque went missing, a slogan was found scribbled in Hindi: Ramvilas ka naam nahin, to koi nahin (If not Ram Vilas name, then nobodys name). This has led authorities to suspect that Paswans men could be involved.																								The incident has raised temperatures between the rivals. Paswans camp has been agitating over attempts by Kumars loyalists to control the East-Central Railway administration and quietly shift some departments to Patna.																								Paswan today took the fight to Kumars lair, announcing that he would hold a massive rally in Barh --- the rail ministers constituency --- tomorrow. His loyalists have already begun mobilising support for the rally, at which Paswan plans to unmask Mr Nitish Kumar politically.																								Kumars supporters have condemned the plaque theft as an uncivilised move to malign a minister. The office of the Hajipur acting chief PRO, A.K. Chandra, confirmed that the plaque had been stolen and would be replaced soon.																								Sources in Paswans camp in Hajipur said the plaque was removed in retaliation to East-Central Railways move to wipe off Paswans name from the Hajipur complex though he first laid its foundation stone.																								A spokesman of Paswan, who was informed about the theft, said Hajipur locals could be angry over the alleged attempt by Kumars Samata Party to insult Paswan. The Lok Janshakti Party leader had recently spoken of Kumars ugly political designs and said he had cancelled the jobs of 137 Dalits who Paswan had recruited.																								 in Hajipur. Paswan had then warned that the people of Hajipur would never tolerate this.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, November 22, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Tigers under threat in Sariska reserve				 																																																	 jaipur: Felling of trees, lopping, mining and degradation of water bodies have resulted in a sharp decline in the number of tigers in the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan, according to a study by the Institute of Environment Education and Sustainable Development.				 																																																	The tiger population in the reserve rose from 17 in 1982 to 45 in 1988. However, the number fell to between 26 and 28 in the 2001 census, reports our correspondent. 				 																																																	M.L. Jhanwar, who led the study sponsored by the Indian Council of Social Science Research, said not a single tree with a diametre of more than nine inches was found in the sanctuary. This, Jhanwar claimed, endangered the population of big cats in the sanctuary.				 																																																	Other hazards to the tiger reserve include illicit mining, tourism, poaching and soil erosion  all of which result in loss of vegetation cover and water levels. Water bodies covered 16.9 sq km of the reserve in 1988. 				 																																																	However, this figure declined by more than 50 per cent to 7.23 sq km by 1994. In the same period, the area under mining increased from 1.2 sq km to 8.48 sq km  an increase of 600 per cent. According to Jhanwar, mining affects at least 20 times more area than leased.				 																SC question mark on Sidhu case				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): After the resignation of Ravinderpal Singh Sidhu from the post of chairman of the Punjab Public Service Commission in the wake of corruption charges, the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the government whether its was necessary to go ahead with the inquiry for misconduct as requested by the President.				 																																																	A bench of Justices S. Rajendra Babu, P.V. Reddi and Arun Kumar asked attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee to take instructions from the government and inform the court on January 9 about the need for going ahead with the presidential reference to inquire into the charges against Sidhu.				 																																																	In view of his resignation from the post and as his tenure has come to an end in September this year, nothing survives in the matter, the bench said.				 																																																	Sidhu, facing charges of corruption before criminal courts, had filed a written submission before the apex court saying he has given up all claims to the retiral benefits, including pension, for the post of chairman, PPSC.				 																																																	However, he had reserved the right to defend himself before the trial court and establish innocence. Sidhus resignation came in the wake of a scam in which it was alleged that big money was exchanged for jobs in the Punjab government.

The organisers said they were not worried about the Jayalalithaa governments Ordinance and that similar diksha mahotsava would be held every year on October 14, the day B.R. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism at Nagpur in 1956. They also said those who embraced Buddhism had done so voluntarily.

Fifty bhikus (Buddhist monks) were present at the ceremony to commemorate the 46th anniversary of the great dhamma diksha mahotsava, which was led by Satyapal, a Delhi University professor of Buddhist studies.				 																																																	Over 10,000 Dalits had converted to Buddhism last year on November 4, when Ram Raj, chairman of All India Confederation of SC/ST Employees, had organised a mass conversion ceremony to protest caste discrimination in Hinduism and counter propaganda by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Ram Raj himself adopted Buddhism and changed his name to Udit Raj at the same function.

		 Monday, December 30, 2002 				 Exam panel chief axed
																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 29: The chairman of the Orissa Public Service Commission, Hadibandhu Mirdha, has been placed under suspension on charges of violating rules governing the state civil service examination, reports our correspondent.																								Mirdhas integrity came under a cloud when he cleared the candidature of his two daughters for the state civil service examination last year without informing his colleagues. His daughters, however, withdrew their applications.																								Pratibha Ray, a member of the commission, formally filed a complaint with the government, which, in turn, sought the Governors intervention.																								A public interest petition was simultaneously filed in the Orissa High Court, seeking steps to set the commission in order. 																								The results of the preliminary civil service examination, 2001, were declared 11 months ago, but the main test has yet to be conducted. Mirdha had fixed December 18 as the date for the examination.																								Bibekananda Patnaik, a retired IAS officer, replaces Mirdha as the chairman of the commission. 																								A couple of legislators had raised the issue at the just-concluded winter session of the Assembly. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik informed the members that the Mirdha case had been forwarded to the President.

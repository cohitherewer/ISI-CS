A bench of acting Chief Justice Devinder Gupta and Justice A.K. Sikri stayed the operation of Paragraph 18 of the court order issued in early 2002 quashing the Centres 1962 notification that exempted air guns and air pistols from being included under the licensed category weapons.				 																																																	The earlier order making it mandatory to acquire licences for these weapons, passed on the petition of former Union minister Maneka Gandhis People For Animals, was sought to be reviewed by the National Rifle Association of India and the Small Arms Manufacturers Association on the ground that it would affect the promotion of shooting sport in the country.				 																																																	The associations also stated that the order was passed without they being made party to the case and that it would affect their interests adversely.				 																																																	The court had quashed the notification exempting air guns and air pistols from acquiring licence under the Arms Act after accepting the PFAs contention that these were being misused for killing small birds and reptiles.				 																																																	The associations said there were sufficient provisions under the Wild Life Protection Act to take action against people found misusing toy arms like air guns and air pistols.

The arms and ammunition were concealed inside a special compartment constructed underneath the vehicle, he said.				 																																																	The consignment, including 13 different weapons and over 10,000 cartridges, were meant for supply to the PWG and the Ranbir Sena, the officer said, quoting preliminary interrogation of the arrested.				 																																																	He said 12 fake arms licences issued in Bihar, Assam and Jharkhand were also recovered from the vehicle.

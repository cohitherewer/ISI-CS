		 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 Friends at Centre, foes in state
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 19: The Janata Dal (United) today released a list of 25 candidates for the Gujarat elections. A partner in the Central coalition, the party said it would not ally with the BJP and would campaign against both the Congress and its NDA comrade.																								Most of the seats the party is contesting are in the tribal areas of Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Panchmahal, Chhota Udaipur and Bhavnagar.																								Dal (U) president and Union food minister Sharad Yadav and vice-president Vijay Mallya, who is also chairman of the UB group, will be the main campaigners. The party is likely to release a second list of five candidates.																								Dal (U) national secretary Javed Raza said his party has decided not to have any electoral tie-up with any other outfit, including NDA partners. JD (U) is part of the NDA only at the Centre and not in states, including Gujarat, where it had been fighting the Assembly elections separately in the past, Raza said.																								Asked if the party would campaign against the BJP, he said the campaign will be against both the Congress and the BJP. The manifesto will be released on November 29 at Vadodara.																								The Dal (U) won four seats in the last Assembly elections but three of its MLAs joined the Congress. Chhotibhai A. Vasava, who remained with the party, has been re-nominated for the Jagadia (reserved) seat.

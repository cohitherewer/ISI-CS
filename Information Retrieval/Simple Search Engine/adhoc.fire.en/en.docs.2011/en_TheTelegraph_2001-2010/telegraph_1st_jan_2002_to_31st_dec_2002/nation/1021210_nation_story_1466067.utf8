This shocking incident brings to light the urgent need for the two states to work together to capture the brigand, Jayalalithaa, who inaugurated a three-day conference of district collectors and police officers here, said.																								Last night, after news that Nagappas body had been discovered in the Changdi jungles near the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, both states had announced the resumption of the joint operations of the Special Task Force.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 Britain on Pak
																								Mumbai, Sept. 19: British deputy Prime Minister John Prescott today rejected the idea of isolating Pakistan in the international coalitions fight against terrorism, citing the recent arrests of al Qaida activists by Pakistan to buttress his support for President Pervez Musharraf, reports our correspondent.																								The arrests just show that different nations can make substantial contributions in fighting the menace (of terrorism), Prescott said at an award function. Talking of isolating a country is too much.																								Prescott, however, was quick to add that his one-to-one discussion with Advani was very fruitful. He also expressed Britains happiness at the election process in Kashmir.																								In India for the first time, Prescott dodged questions on whether Advani had broached the issue of extraditing Ayub Thakur, a supporter in Britain of Kashmiri militancy.

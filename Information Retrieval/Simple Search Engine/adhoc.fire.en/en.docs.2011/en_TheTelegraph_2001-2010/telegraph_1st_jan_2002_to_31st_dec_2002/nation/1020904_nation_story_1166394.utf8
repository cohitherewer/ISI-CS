																								Chandigarh, Sept. 3: Stormy scenes were witnessed in the Haryana Assembly today after chief minister Om Prakash Chautala berated state Congress president Bhajan Lal for sitting outside the room where then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Harchand Singh Longowal were signing the Punjab accord, reports our correspondent. 																								Bhajan Lal was chief minister of Haryana then. Rajiv Gandhi was signing an accord which concerned Haryana. Kitni sharm ki baat hai ke jab Haryana ke hiton ki baat ho rahi thi to chief minister maujood nahin the, Chautala said. 																								The statement followed a calling attention motion by Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and four others on the delay in the construction of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal.

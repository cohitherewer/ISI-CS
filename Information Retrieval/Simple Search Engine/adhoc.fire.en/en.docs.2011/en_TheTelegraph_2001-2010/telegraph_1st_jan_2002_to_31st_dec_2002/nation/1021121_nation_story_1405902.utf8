		 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Lufthansa to double flights to Chennai
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: German airline Lufthansa will double its flight frequency between Chennai and Frankfurt to six a week from April 1.																								Lufthansas decision seems to have been prompted by Air-Indias plan to launch a thrice-a-week Delhi-Mumbai-Frankfurt service on December 3.																								With the new flights, Lufthansa will operate 23 flights a week out of India. By deciding to concentrate on Chennai and giving the southern city six flights a week, Lufthansa has shown its readiness to swamp the market as it already operates daily out of Delhi and Mumbai. This will prove an effective counter to Air-India, said Debasish Chatterjee of CTI Travels.																								He added that Air-India may now have to fight a fare war with the German rival. The prevailing fare for a one-way ticket to Frankfurt is Rs 30,000.																								However, the German airline did not ascribe its frequency addition to any threat from Air-India. The additional frequencies are reflective of the market demand in the Indian subcontinent, said Manfred Reimer, vice-president of the airlines Asia-Pacific region. The increase in flight frequency is also a result of the bilateral negotiations between the governments of the two countries, the official added.																								The flight (LH 759), a Boeing 747-400, will leave at 1.20 am from Chennai and reach Frankfurt at 7.45 am. The return flight timings are 10.40 am from Frankfurt and 11.10 pm at Chennai.																								The flight offers a three-class configuration, with 16 seats in the first class cabin, 64 in business and 310 seats in the economy class, airline officials said.

		 Monday, October 28, 2002 				 Hollywood piracy notice to govt
																								New Delhi, Oct. 27 (PTI): Delhi High Court has issued a notice to the information and broadcasting ministry after eight Hollywood producers accused the government of failure in cancelling the licences of errant cable operators.																								The producers, which include several Hollywood heavyweights, have charged some cable operators with regularly beaming pirated VCDs of new films.																								Justice C.K. Mahajan, who issued a notice to the communication ministry, too, has restrained the Delhi-based Home Cable Network, its franchisees and distributors from exhibiting pirated version of films whose copyright lies with the eight Hollywood producers.																								The eight producers are Time Warner Entertainment Company, Columbia Pictures, Disney Enterprises, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Paramount Pictures, Tristar Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp and Universal City Studios.																								They had alleged in a suit that unauthorised duplication and exhibitions of new titles by cable operators were causing them irreparable harm and injury.																								Counsel for the Hollywood studios Chander M. Lall had submitted that the I amp;B ministry, which regulates the cable networks, has been renewing their licences without inquiring into their record. 																								Despite such largescale piracy being perpetuated by the cable networks in blatant violation of the programming code as prescribed under the Cable Television Network Rules 1994 and Cable Television Network Act of 1995, the cable operators continue to enjoy their registration under the provision of the Act, he said.

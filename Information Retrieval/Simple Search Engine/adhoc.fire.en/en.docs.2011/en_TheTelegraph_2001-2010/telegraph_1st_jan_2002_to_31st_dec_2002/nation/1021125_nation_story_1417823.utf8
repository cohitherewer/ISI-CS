The Dalit leader also floated the Justice Party for integrating the marginalised people of the country into the mainstream. I have christened our party as Justice Party because it will be our endeavour to secure social, economic and political justice for all countrymen, he said at a rally at the Ram Lila Ground in Delhi.				 																																																	Our political party would be primarily for compulsory and equal education for the poor, as well as the abolition of the caste system, Udit Raj added.				 																																																	The Dalit leader said he quit the government job to discharge his social, religious and political responsibilities in a more effective manner. 				 																																																	Now I will fully work for overthrowing the divisive and communal forces and will see to it that the NDA, headed by the BJP, is dislodged from power in the 2004 general elections.				 																																																	The hate campaign launched by the Hindutva brigade should be checked at all levels, otherwise the people will have to pay a price for it, he said at the rally in Old Delhi.

		 Friday, October 04, 2002 				 MLA in net collapses in court
				 	 Congress MLA Shobhana George comes out of her residence after the arrest. (PTI)																								Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 3 (PTI): Congress MLA Shobhana George, arrested this afternoon in connection with the forged intelligence report case, fainted on the court premises here and was rushed to the government general hospital. 																								The MLA, named the third accused by the crime branch in its investigation report, collapsed on the ground floor of the court complex at Vanchiyur in the city when the crime branch, which arrested her on a non-bailable warrant, brought her to court. She was immediately taken to a restroom and a doctor was summoned. She was then admitted to a hospital.																								Armed with a non-bailable warrant, a crime-branch team led by superintendent Natarajan arrested Shobhana from her residence in the city. The MLAs husband, Isaac George, daughter Remya, and mother followed her in a separate vehicle to court. However, no Congress leader was present when she was taken to court.																								The MLA is suspected to have played a role in the conspiracy behind the alleged forgery of the intelligence report linking Kerala tourism minister K.V. Thomas with a hawala racket.																								Immediately after her arrest, Shobhana said she would prove her innocence in the court of law. There will be a resurrection after crucifixion, she told reporters present at her residence during the arrest. Shobhana reiterated that she was not involved in forging the report and regretted statements she had made about party leaders.																								The case relates to the telecast of a story by Surya TV in June regarding an allegedly forged intelligence report, purportedly sent by the DGP intelligence to the chief ministers office. The report linked Thomas with the Rs 336-crore hawala racket being probed by Central agencies.																								The government ordered a crime branch investigation to ascertain the conspiracy behind the forged document.																								She was slapped a show-cause notice by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Muraleedharan yesterday asking why action should not be taken against her for making statements defaming the party.																								Surya TV reporter Anil Nambiar was initially named the sole accused in the FIR. Last week, Sobhanas personal assistant, Anil P. Srirangam, was arrested and a lookout notice was issued against a former journalist R. Jayachandran, also wanted in the case.

The prohibitory orders were promulgated to restrict my movement, but I do not want any conflict  especially when the local officials have assured me that the razed house will be rebuilt, Priyanka told Congress workers at Gauriganj before returning to New Delhi.																								However, before leaving, Priyanka shot off a memorandum to Uttar Pradesh Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri demanding an impartial inquiry into the incident. I request you to conduct a probe at your level to ensure justice to the Dalit family, the representation handed over to a district official in Gauriganj said.

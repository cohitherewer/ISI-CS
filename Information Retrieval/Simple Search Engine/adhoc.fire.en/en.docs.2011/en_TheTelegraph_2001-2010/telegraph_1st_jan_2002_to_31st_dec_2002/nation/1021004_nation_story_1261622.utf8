		 Friday, October 04, 2002 				 Film fest gates close for Adoor
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 3: Prominent filmmakers at the 33rd International Film Festival of India here are facing embarrassment because the Directorate of Film Festivals has either not given them escorts or has not briefed officials manning the desks.																								Well-known filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan, a regular at film festivals, was today asked to prove his credentials before he could be handed over publicity material on the films being screened.																								Are you from the press or are you a delegate? Gopalakrishnan was asked after he sought literature on the festival. When he said he was not a journalist, the official brusquely asked him to go and look for the material elsewhere.																								Gopalakrishnans latest film, Nizhalkkuthu (Shadow Kill), is not being screened at the festival as it was not sent before the May 30 deadline.																								In a bid to mollify other Indian filmmakers, the directorate today decided to host them for a week in the 10-day festival.																								Indian filmmakers had grumbled that the directorate has not given them the same hospitality it extended to foreign delegates.																								An official of the information and broadcasting ministry said it has now been decided to host the filmmakers for seven days instead of four. The festival began on October 1 and the Indian filmmakers were initially given hospitality till October 4.

		 Friday, December 27, 2002 				 BJP uses Nagappa to lift fortunes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Bangalore, Dec. 26: The BJP in Karnataka has targeted the Congress government and fellow Opposition party, the Janata Dal (United), over H. Nagappas abduction and murder in an obvious attempt to lift its sagging fortunes in the state. 																								The party organised a huge rally in Bangalore today, demanding the resignation of the S.M. Krishna-led government for failing to protect Nagappa, and its members created a ruckus in the Assembly leading to their eviction and suspension from the House. 																								Through this manoeuvre in the Assembly, party leaders claimed, the BJP has scored a point over the Dal(U), which meekly sat through the government-sponsored debate on Nagappas abduction and death. 																								The BJP members, who blocked proceedings in the House for the second consecutive day, have been suspended till the end of the session  probably December 31  by Speaker M.V. Venkatappa. 																								The BJP has also accused the Dal (U) of being hand-in-glove with the Congress to hush up the truth behind the death of the former Dal (U) minister.

In April, Chandrashekhar and Amit of old Delhis Sadar Bazar area were trying to sneak into the Rashtrapati Bhavan premises by climbing the boundary wall and crawling beneath the barbed wire when they were nabbed by an alert security guard.				 																																																	The brothers were chargesheeted under the Indian Penal Code for criminal trespass and intention to enter the high security Rashtrapati Bhavan. The accused were initially tried by the criminal court, but on their counsels request, the court transferred the case to a Lok Adalat.				 																																																	Metropolitan magistrate Sanjay Garg, who presided over the Lok Adalat, found the brothers guilty and fined them after a brief trial recently.				 																																																	The duo had entered the premises from the 11 Murthy side, north of Rashtrapati Bhavan, and they were apprehended by the security personnel after a brief chase. The chargesheet was filed after the accused were jointly interrogated by the Intelligence Bureau (Special Cell) and police.				 																Sunjay to appear in court today				 																																																	 Mumbai (PTI): Altogether 122 accused  including film star Sunjay Dutt  charged with conspiracy in the 1993 bomb blast case, are scheduled to appear before a special court on Monday in keeping with a judicial directive. 				 																																																	Designated judge P.D. Kode had exempted the accused from appearance a month ago and directed them to come to the court on September 2. Dutt and others are likely to seek exemption again till Diwali as oral arguments in the case have come to an end, defence lawyers Subhash Kanse and Farhana Shah said.				 																																																	The accused were exempted on conditions that they would not maintain any contact with the ones who were absconding and would not leave the jurisdiction of the court.				 																																																	The judge has directed accused Parvez Qureshi to surrender on September 19 after his interim bail expired. Qureshi has been granted liberty to undergo treatment for peptic ulcers.

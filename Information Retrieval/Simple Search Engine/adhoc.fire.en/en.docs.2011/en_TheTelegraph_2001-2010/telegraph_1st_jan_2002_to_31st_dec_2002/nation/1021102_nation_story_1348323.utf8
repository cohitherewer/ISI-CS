		 Saturday, November 02, 2002 				 Save India Front throws hat in Gujarat poll ring
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov.1: The confederation of SC/ST organisations and the Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind have planned to contest 75 Assembly seats in Gujarat under the banner of the Save India Front.																								The SIF was floated after the Godhra carnage and the consequent communal violence to forge social and political unity among Dalits and Muslims.																								Announcing the decision to contest the elections, Dalit leader Udit Raj, also the convener of the SIF, said a conclusion on the number of seats will be taken later. He said though the SIF would like to have an alliance with the Congress to defeat the communal forces, the main Opposition party was yet to respond. The SIF will later be converted into a full-fledged political party, he said.																								He said the SIF has been able to convince Dalits and Muslims of the need to live in peace and harmony and not to fall into the Sangh parivars trap. It is up to the Congress to understand the ground situation and support us, Raj said.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 4: Campaigning for Delhi University Students Union polls turned violent today, with a vice-presidential candidate being shot at and injured in southwest Delhi.																								Lok Janshakti Party nominee Rishi Thakran was shot at twice by a lone assailant on a motorcycle in Mahipalpur on Delhi-Gurgaon National Highway around 10.30 am, police said.																								Thakran, 23, a BA Part-1 student of Shradanand College, was wounded in his right leg while on his way to a college in south Delhi for campaigning. He was rushed to Safdarjang Hospital.																								A walk through Gwyer Hall, the post-graduate hostel in the north campus, reveals posters glued everywhere, from the garage to bathroom mirrors, in violation of the code of conduct. 																								Contestants also admit to spending about Rs 5 lakh on canvassing, as compared to the prescribed limit of Rs 10,000.																								Classes are usually suspended till after the elections. 																								The basic reason behind this hullabaloo lies in the flouting of the code of conduct which among other things bars posters, the use of more than two vehicles, participation of outsiders in the campaigning and expenditure of over Rs 10,000. Leaders from both the NSUI and ABVP  the two main contenders in the election  admit that the expenditure on each candidate, that is borne by their respective parties, is always around Rs 5 lakh.																								.

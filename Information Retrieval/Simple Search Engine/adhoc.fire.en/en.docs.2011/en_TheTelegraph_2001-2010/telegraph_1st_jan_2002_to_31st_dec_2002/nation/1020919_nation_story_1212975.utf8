		 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 Training for train rescue 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Sept. 18: Minister of state for railways Bandaru Dattatreya today admitted that there was a lack of skilled personnel to handle rescue operations in the event of train disasters.																								Speaking to reporters here, Dattatreya said the Railway Board has decided to appoint a consultant to prepare a plan of action for training employees in disaster management skills.																								He, however, dismissed RJD chief Laloo Yadavs accusations following the recent Rajdhani tragedy as baseless. Laloo had said the accident was a result of careless maintenance of bridges.																								Stressing that the derailment was an accident, Dattatreya said about 51,000 bridges were more than 100 years old and 526 had already been declared distressed. 																								He said the railway has taken up measures to set up a safety fund of Rs 17,000 crore for replacing wooden sleepers with fibre-reinforced plastic ones.

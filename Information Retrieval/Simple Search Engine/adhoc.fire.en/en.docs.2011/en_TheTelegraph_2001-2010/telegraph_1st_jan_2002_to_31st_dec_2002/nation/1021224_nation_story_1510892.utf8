		 Tuesday, December 24, 2002 				 Judge arrested on dowry harassment complaint
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 23: Police arrested on Sunday an additional district judge, Onkarnath Gupta, at Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh on charges of torturing his daughter-in-law Ruby Gupta, who hails from Calcutta.																								The judge was produced before the Mainpuri district court, which directed the accused to surrender before the Calcutta chief metropolitan magistrate on January 3.																								The police had earlier arrested the judges wife and son on a complaint lodged by Ruby.																								The police said Onkarnath, along with his wife and son, had demanded Rs 10 lakh as dowry from Rubys father. They started beating Ruby as her father did not accede to the dowry demand, the police said.																								The Gupta family used to torture the woman both physically and mentally. They would also ask her to commit suicide, said an officer of the Posta police station in Calcuttas trading hub.																								According to the police, Ruby, the 22-year-old daughter of a businessman from Posta, had married Amar Nath Gupta, the judges son, on January 25, 1999. Since then, Amar and his parents  Onkarnath and Manorama  started torturing Ruby, the police said.																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said after seven months of marriage, Ruby was driven out of her in-laws house. She then came to her parental house on Baikuntha Nath Lane in Posta. Rubys family initially tried to settle the matter. But the Gupta family was not ready to accept her, Mitra added.																								Ruby complained against her husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law before the chief metropolitan magistrate. Accordingly, the court directed Posta police to investigate the case and take legal action against the accused.																								The city police registered the case on April 16, 2000, and the detective departments womens grievance cell started a parallel probe.																								As soon as we received the complaint, a team of four policemen was sent to Mainpuri. After four days, our officers arrested the husband, Amar Nath, and his mother, Manorama. The mother and son were produced before the local court there and then brought to the city. Now both of them are out on bail, Mitra added.																								The detective department sent a three-member team to Mainpuri two days ago to arrest the judge. As soon as Onkarnath reached his chamber yesterday, our officers arrested him. We produced him before the district court of Mainpuri. But the judge released him on condition that he will appear before the Calcutta court, Mitra said.

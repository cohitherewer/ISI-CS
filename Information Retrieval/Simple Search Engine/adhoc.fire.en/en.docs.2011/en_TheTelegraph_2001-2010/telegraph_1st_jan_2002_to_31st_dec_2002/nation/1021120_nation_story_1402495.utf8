		 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 Court seeks govt view on PM house
																								New Delhi, Nov. 19 (PTI): Delhi High Court has sought the Centres view on the need for a completely secured permanent official residence for the Prime Minister.																								The desirability of having a complete secure residence for the Prime Minister cannot be underscored, Justice Manmohan Sarin said while suggesting to the government why it should not consider making Teen Murti bungalow, where Jawahar Lal Nehru lived for 18 years, a permanent residence.																								The court, which was hearing a petition by Gymkhana Club next to A.B. Vajpayees official 7, Race Course Road residence, asked additional solicitor general K.K. Sud and standing counsel Upamanyu Hazarika to submit the governments reply by November 22.																								The club has challenged the Centres move to attach a portion of its land, including several servants quarters, to the prime ministerial residence. 																								The clubs counsel, Vikas Singh and Samita Pandey, had alleged that the decision to attach its land was not prompted by security reasons but aimed at converting the area into a green belt. Sud made a strong case for securing a portion of the clubs land, saying that the large number of visitors, especially to the servants quarters, posed a threat.

				 	 Masood																								At a ceremony to commemorate the first death anniversary of Ahmed Shah Masood, Pakistan was blamed not only for assisting those who killed him but also for the assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai.																								Except for the Pushtuns, who are still a bit reluctant in blaming Pakistan for the woes of their country, no one minces words in criticising their southern neighbour. Thus, Prof. Mohammad Akbar Popal, the president of Kabul University and a Pushtun, is very careful about apportioning blame for the attempt to assassinate President Karzai. 																								Choosing his words carefully, he says: Any organisation or organisations against democracy and freedom could be behind this. At this stage, I wont accuse any foreign country. But everything is possible.																								His friend, Miandad Panjshiri, an adviser to the ministry of agriculture and a Tajik, laughs, slapping Popal on the back saying: He wont tell you. He is very political. I will tell you who tried to murder Karzai  the al Qaida, the Taliban elements and the Hizb-e-Islami of Hekmatyar, assisted by Pakistan. They are also responsible for the bomb blasts in Kabul. They dont want a stable Afghanistan. 																								Of course, nobody has any evidence but the point is that Pakistan is seen as an enemy.																								In contrast, India is seen as a loyal ally. An Afghan diplomat said: Only India is cutting through bureaucratic red-tape to help us. Our people see this and recognise who is their friend.																								In July this year, India gave a cash subsidy of $10million for the Afghan budget, 19 doctors and paramedics were sent to Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif for medical assistance, 95 tonnes of medicines and artificial limbs/Jaipur Foot were sent for amputees at the Kabul Military Hospital. 																								A local area network (Lan) access via V-sat was provided to the Afghan foreign ministry to access the Net through VSNL, three Airbus aircraft were gifted to Ariana Afghan Airlines, 50 buses were provided to restart the public transport system and 51 airline staff, 40 diplomats, 250 policemen and 15 journalists are being trained in specialist institutions in India. And there is much more in the offing. This is Pakistans worst nightmare come true, says a western expert on Afghanistan. 																								India has been smart about providing aid which is highly visible  aircraft, buses that are seen plying in Kabul, teachers for schools and doctors. They make a tremendous impact. India is already training Afghan diplomats, flight crews and the police. And the day is not far when Afghans will go to India for military training. Can you imagine what this does to Pakistanis when they see Indian influence growing in their neighbourhood? he asked.

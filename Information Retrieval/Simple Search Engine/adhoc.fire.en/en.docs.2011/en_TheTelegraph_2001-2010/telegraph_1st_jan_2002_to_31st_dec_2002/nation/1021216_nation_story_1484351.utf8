		 Monday, December 16, 2002 				 Now, some respite for CBI
																								New Delhi, Dec. 15 (PTI): The CBI today got a breather when Portugal extended gangster Abu Salems judicial remand by three months.																								This was done because Indias extradition request for Salem, to face trial in the 1993 Bombay blasts case, is still pending.																								Highly-placed CBI sources said the judicial remand, due to end tomorrow, has been extended by three months. 																								The CBI wants Salem in some forgery cases, too. 																								The remand extension comes close on the heels of the CBI sending an official to Portugal with a formal extradition request.																								The investigative agency has listed in the request Salems involvement in three CBI cases, four Delhi police cases and two Mumbai police cases.																								The news is some consolation for the CBI, which had just taken two blows  first in the Ottavio Quattrocchi extradition in Malaysia in the Bofors payoff case, and second in Anees Ibrahims deportation from Dubai in the 1993 Bombay blasts case.																								According to sources, the authorities in Lisbon may take up Salems extradition request tomorrow.																								The request includes an executive assurance to Portugal that Salem will not be awarded capital punishment if he is convicted in India, the sources said.

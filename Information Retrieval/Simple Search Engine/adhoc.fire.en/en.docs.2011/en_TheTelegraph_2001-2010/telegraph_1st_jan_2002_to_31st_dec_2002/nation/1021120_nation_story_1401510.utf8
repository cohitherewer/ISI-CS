		 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 Globalisation twist to terror
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sadako Ogata (AFP)																								New Delhi, Nov. 19: Globalisation has adversely affected the sovereignty of states and given an impetus to internal conflict and international terrorism, according to former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata.																								Ogata, the renowned Japanese human rights professor, has been chosen the winner of the Indira Gandhi prize for peace, disarmament and development for 2001.																								At a function organised in the capital today, President A.P.J Abdul Kalam handed over the prize to her. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Congress president Sonia Gandhi were among those present at the ceremony.																								Sovereignty of states has become much more permeable due to globalisation, Ogata said at a discussion on Human security in post-conflict situation at the CII headquarters.																								She added that the free flow of capital and advancement in transportation and communication that has accelerated population movement as well as networking of people across international borders have added to internal conflict and terrorism.																								Ogata felt that those sections in the society who felt marginalised, deprived or angered by the injustices caused by poverty and inequity were now trying to regroup themselves and looking for new ways of giving vent to their frustration.																								Ogata, who had worked in Afghanistan as the UN High Commissioner for refugees, is now the special envoy of the Japanese Prime Minister to the war-ravaged country. After working in several conflict zones and helping rehabilitate displaced people, Ogata decided to focus on Afghanistan.																								She pointed out that because of the September 11 terrorist strikes, Kabul has again been put on the international centrestage.																								Ogata said though she was devastated by the tragedy of the World Trade Center, she was happy for the people of Afghanistan as the fast-paced developments over the past year have brought new opportunities to them.																								She expressed satisfaction over the two-front approach undertaken by the international community for the rehabilitation of the state of Afghanistan as well as its people.																								She added that the world should keep Afghanistan at the top of its agenda as without reconstruction and humanitarian aid, the war-ravaged country cannot stay afloat.

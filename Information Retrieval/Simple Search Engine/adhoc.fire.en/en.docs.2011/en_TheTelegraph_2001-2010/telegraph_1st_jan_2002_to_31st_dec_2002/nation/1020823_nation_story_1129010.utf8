		 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Cong, Mulayam close to deal
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Amar Singh and Sonia Gandhi 																								New Delhi, Aug. 22: In a spirit of forgive and forget, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party today gingerly inched closer to forming an alliance in Gujarat.																								Senior Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh called on Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath today, offering to extend his partys full support to the Congress. Sonia reciprocated, underlining the need for a broad secular alliance to checkmate the BJP. 																								Sonia has decided to put behind her the occasion when Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav ruined her chances of becoming Prime Minister in May 1999. 																								The Samajwadi Party has decided to overlook the Congress reluctance to back Mulayam in Uttar Pradesh, leading to the installation of the Mayavati government.																								Sources said the softening in the Samajwadi Partys stand had to do more with the fluid political situation in Lucknow than Mulayam and Amar Singhs desire to strengthen the Congress in Gujarat. 																								Congress leaders said Mulayam was still eyeing Uttar Pradesh, hoping a section of Bahujan Samaj Party members would switch loyalties. In such a scenario, the Congress 25 MLAs would come handy in putting together a secular alliance.																								Sonia is pleased at the prospect of winning over the Samajwadi Party, which has continued to be her biggest critic among non- NDA groups. 																								If the Samajwadi Party agrees to a seat adjustment with the Congress, it would also be a setback for Sonia rival Sharad Pawar. 																								Pawar has floated a third front for the Gujarat polls which includes the NCP, the Gujarat Jana Congress and the Lok Jan Shakti. 																								He was also eyeing the Samajwadi Party. Pawars third front has plans to focus on Saurashtra, a region that has traditionally been a Congress stronghold. 																								But the Gujarat Congress is not too pleased with the prospect of going with the Samajwadi Party. State unit leaders have asked AICC functionaries how the Samajwadi Party would be able to strengthen the Congress. 																								A Gujarat Congress leader pointed out that the Samajwadi Partys most powerful leader, Jaspal Singh, had managed only 3,000 votes in the recent Shahjigunj Assembly bypoll. 																								In terms of seats, the Congress is prepared to concede two to three to the Samajwadi while Amar Singh is eyeing eight. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

		 Friday, December 06, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Centre in no hurry for PM residence				 																																																	New Delhi: The Centre has assured Delhi High Court that the search is on for a house for the Prime Minister. Unlike other countries, India does not have a official address for the Prime Minister, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Indian Prime Ministers stay in the house of their choice though 7, Race Course was home to Narasimha Rao, I.K. Gujral, H.D. Deve Gowde and now, Atal Bihari Vajpayee.				 																																																	The court, however ordered the government to look for a permanent residence, an address which will become officially associated with the Prime Ministers office like 10, Downing Street in Britain, or even the White House in the US.				 																																																	The issue is being discussed at the highest level. It is more than what has been stated in the order (by the court), additional solicitor general K.K. Sud told the court on Thursday.				 																																																	The issue came up in the court of Justice Manmohan Sarin, who is hearing a writ petition by the Delhi Gymkhana Club, which challenged the move to attach a portion of its land to the existing residence of the Prime Minister for security reasons.				 																																																	Despite the governments assurance, the decision to look for alternative accomodation for the Prime Minister is not being seriously considered. The court asked the government why Teen Murti, where Jawahar Lal Nehru stayed, should not become a permanent official residence for the Prime Minister.				 																																																	There is no way that this Prime Minister will dismantle the Nehru memorial museum and library and convert Teen Murti into his official residence, a senior government official said. For him 7, Race Course will remain. Maybe at a future date, some other leader will make the move, he added.				 																Age twist in Delhi rape case				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The medical college student gangrape case took a new turn on Thursday with main accused Rahul producing before a Delhi court a Municipal Corporation of Delhi birth certificate claiming that he was a minor.				 																																																	As soon as the proceedings began, Rahuls counsel Ajay Digpaul submitted the certificate according to which Rahul was born on October 10, 1985, at the Girdhari Lal Memorial Hospital in Kamla Market here.				 																																																	Metropolitan magistrate Bharat Parashar, while taking the said proof on record, directed police to verify its authenticity from the MCD records and file a report before the court on December 13.				 																																																	He also directed the police to conduct an ossification test on Rahul from Safdarjung Hospital or RML Hospital to put the age controversy at rest. The test relates to the bone condition. On a similar claim by co-accused Amit, the court asked the police to verify it and inform the court.

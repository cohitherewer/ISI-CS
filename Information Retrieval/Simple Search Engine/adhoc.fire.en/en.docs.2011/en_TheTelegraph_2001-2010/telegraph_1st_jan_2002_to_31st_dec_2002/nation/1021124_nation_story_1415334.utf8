Chuthurdarry Manna Nehore, a 70-year-old mango farmer, was found gagged and strangled with his hands and feet tied at his Hazlemere home near Verulam on Friday, police said.				 																																																	Nehore was brutally assaulted by unknown intruders when he was apparently fetching mangoes, they said, adding that two buckets of ripe mangoes were found near his body. The miscreants ransacked the farmers wood-and-iron house and stole his firearm and cash, the police said.				 																																																	This was the third time that Nehore had been attacked at his farm. His attackers must have caught him unawares during the latest attack, said police spokesperson superintendent Reuben Govender.				 																																																	Nehores murder has come in the wake of the recent killing of two farmers  Raju Naicker, 62, and his brother Chinsamy, 52  inside their farms at Doringkop, near Stanger in the north coast.

Indians convicted for theft in UK				 																																																	 London (PTI): Five persons of Indian origin have been convicted by a court in Surrey for varying terms in connection with the robbery of more than 3 million pounds at Heathrow airport in March.

After the robbery, Sundeep told the police that two Asian men had been hiding in the back of the van. They forced him to drive out of the airport and then fled with the money.

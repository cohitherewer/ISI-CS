 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 29: The BJP has decided to project to its cadre and supporters the positive aspects of the Supreme Courts advisory opinion on the Presidential reference on Gujarat elections, to counter the perception that the ruling has gone against the party.																								A meeting of the partys intellectual cell today proposed to release literature to emphasise how the court actually ruled in the BJPs favour by advising that elections be held within six months of an Assemblys dissolution and that it was silent on the Election Commissions stand that Central rule should be enforced in case a new Assembly did not come into being in that time.																								The BJPs twin gains, claimed sources, were that its stand forced the EC to call for elections in December instead of February, as the Congress had expected and, secondly, Narendra Modi would continue as the caretaker chief minister now that the use of Article 356 was ruled out. Rajya Sabha MP L.M. Singhvi explained the gains at the meeting, attended by BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu and 25 others, including heads of many cells.																								To demystify the NDA governments achievements, the meeting also suggested that the party should rewrite them in language the cadre would understand so that they got talking points before the Gujarat elections and the others that would follow. Sources said there is little point releasing the literature prepared by the ministries in its present form because the language and presentation were insipid and incoherent.																								The meeting decided that the literature would be despatched to the state units, which would cull out the relevant portions and repackage them. The reworked publicity literature, said sources, would be distributed to attract new members to the BJP as part of the ongoing membership enlistment drive. 																								Contentious issues like Ayodhya, which do not figure on the NDA agenda would not be mentioned in the publicity package. It would focus on the governments achievements in the area of population, water, food and civil supplies, public distribution system and communications.

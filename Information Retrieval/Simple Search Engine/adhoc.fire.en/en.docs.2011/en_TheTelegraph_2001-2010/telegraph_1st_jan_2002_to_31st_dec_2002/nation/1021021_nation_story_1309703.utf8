		 Monday, October 21, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Salman to appear in court today				 																																																	 Mumbai (PTI): Salman Khan, charged with culpable homicide in a hit-and-run case, will be produced before a magistrate on Monday. 				 																																																	Police are also likely to file a chargesheet against him on that day as investigations in the case are almost over, prosecutor M.R. Raut said, adding that Salman had been interrogated at length in jail. 				 																																																	On September 28, Salman had rammed his vehicle into a bakery, killing one person and injuring four. 				 																																																	Police are likely to seek extension of the actors remand in judicial custody, which is ending on Monday. A magistrate had earlier held that he had no jurisdiction to hear the actors plea for liberty as the alleged offence by Salman was triable by a sessions court. Aggrieved, he moved a sessions court, which rejected the plea.				 																																																	The actor may urge for bail before a sessions court again or can even move the high court with a fresh bail petition, legal circles said. However, his lawyer refused to comment.				 																																																	Salmans bail plea has been rejected thrice since his arrest. It was turned down on the same day by magistrate S.Y. Sishode and once again rejected on October 7 when he was re-arrested for a more serious offence under the IPC.				 																																																	A sessions court had also rejected his bail petition on October 16 as the prosecution opposed his plea on the ground that the probe was incomplete and he might tamper with witnesses as injured persons were still in hospital.

She later made her way into the aircraft, which had arrived from Dubai en route to Hyderabad.

The police are investigating how the woman gained entry into the complex. 				 																Trader robbed on highway				 																																																	 Rohtak (PTI): A Delhi-based businessman was robbed of his car and his servant was shot dead by three armed miscreants on the national highway at Kharkara village.

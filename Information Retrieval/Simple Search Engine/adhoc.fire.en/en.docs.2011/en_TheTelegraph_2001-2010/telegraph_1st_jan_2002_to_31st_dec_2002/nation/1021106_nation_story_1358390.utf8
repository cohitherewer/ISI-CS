		 Wednesday, November 06, 2002 				 BJP swings into poll high-gear
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 5: The BJP has gone into election mode, convening a three-day meeting to select candidates and announcing rallies at Godhra and Baroda on November 11, the day Sonia Gandhi plans to flag off the Congress campaign from Karamsad, Sardar Patels birthplace. 																								The party said former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, who is anti-Narendra Modi and has been sulking, has agreed to join the fifth leg of Modis Gaurav Yatra.																								After finalising the candidates by November 8, the state election committee and state-level leaders will have separate meetings at Gandhinagar on November 10 to draw up the list. 																								The three-day meeting from tomorrow will discuss candidate profiles.																								 These meetings are part of the exercise by the party to distribute tickets for the Assembly elections slated for December 12. The state leaders would discuss the report of the district units for this purpose, spokesman Arun Jaitley said.																								Selection of candidates would be based on reports of state leaders at the conclusion of the three-day meeting on November 8, Jaitley added.																								The BJP accused the Samajwadi Party of dragging the Uttar Pradesh Governor into an uncalled-for controversy and threatened to take the issue to peoples court.																								We strongly condemn the attempt of the Samajwadi Party to drag Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri into an uncalled-for controversy. 																								The Governor is certainly not responsible for either the failure of the Samajwadi Party to get Congress support or to mobilise the requisite figures to demonstrate its strength, Jaitley said.																								He said the attempt by the Samajwadi to drag a constitutional figure into a controversy is a condemnable act. 																								Last week, Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav had demanded that the Governor, Vishnu Kant Shastri, convene a session of the House and ask chief minister Mayavati to prove her majority in the wake of some rebel MLAs withdrawing support. 																								Mulayam had said in Lucknow that his party had expected the Governor, being a learned person, to discharge his constitutional duties in a proper manner.

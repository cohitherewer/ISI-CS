		 Tuesday, October 01, 2002 				 Union home secretary
																								New Delhi, Sept. 30: Culture secretary N. Gopalaswamy is tipped to take over from Kamal Pande as Union home secretary.																								Colleagues of Gopalaswamy, a Gujarat cadre officer, speak of his low-key style of functioning and added qualification in the home ministry under deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani.																								He is a simple man and had no airs about being boss. Every employee can walk in and talk to him about any problem. He is not the typical formal IAS officer, said one.																								In his current job, he has been able to keep three ministers with different styles of functioning happy. Gopalaswamy has earlier worked with both Anant Kumar and Maneka Gandhi.

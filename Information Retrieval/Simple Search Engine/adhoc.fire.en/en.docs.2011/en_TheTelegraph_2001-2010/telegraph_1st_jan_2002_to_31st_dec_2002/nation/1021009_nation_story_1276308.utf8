		 Wednesday, October 09, 2002 				 Israeli radars for LoC
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 8: The defence ministry is set to buy more than 1,000 short range mobile radars from Israel for use along the Line of Control to detect intrusions in a deal estimated to be worth Rs 350 crore.																								These radars are to be used together with ground sensors and other equipment which are designed to make detection of infiltration and surveillance of the LoC easier. Sources said the army had been evaluating such sensor-cum-radars from several European companies too but has finally settled on the Israeli equipment, found to be more adaptable to local conditions during experimental use.																								It is understood that the army has also been trying out US-made sensors on the LoC. The consensus among officers dealing with these systems is that they are, at best, an aid to manual patrolling of the LoC. The Israeli radar sensors are reported to have a range of about 10 km each. Sources said use of sensors on the LoC had already enabled the army to inflict casualties in militant ranks.																								The systems will be used together with sophisticated sighting equipment such as night vision devices and thermal imagers. 																								Another Israeli company, Elbit systems, is likely to be contracted for 300 termal imaging devices. Thermal imagers are also to be used on the T-72 tanks, the first lot of which have been received from Russia.																								The Indian Air Force is also understood to be building up an inventory of Israeli Searcher Mark II Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The air force is also likely to by air defence systems worth $ 14 million from Thales of France. (ENDS)sd/08102002/1920

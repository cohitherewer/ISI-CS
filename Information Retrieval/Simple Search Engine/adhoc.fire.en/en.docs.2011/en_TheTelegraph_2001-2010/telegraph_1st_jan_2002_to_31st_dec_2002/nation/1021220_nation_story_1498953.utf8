		 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Health cloud on Polaris chief
																								Chennai, Dec. 19 (pti): Polaris Software Labs today said its ceo Arun Jain, under detention in Jakarta since Saturday, has become weak and may require medical attention. 																								The legal counsels of Polaris who have been able to maintain tenuous contact with Jain and the companys senior vice-president, Rajiv Malhotra, at the detention centre have expressed concern for their well being, a Polaris press release said.																								In Delhi, infotech minister Pramod Mahajan said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would speak to Indonesian President Megawati if the Polaris executives were not released soon. 																								Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha yesterday urged his Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirayuda, to ensure their immediate release.																								Reports from Jakarta suggest that though the duo maintain outward appearance of good health, one week of being in a police detention centre has taken its toll, the release said. Jain is understood to have become weak and may require medical attention if the detention continues any longer, it added.

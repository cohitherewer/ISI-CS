		 Monday, September 09, 2002 				 Ranbir Sena gets new chief
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Sept. 8: The Ranbir Sena last night elected Samsher Bahadur Singh as its new mukhia in the absence of its supreme commander Barmeswarnath Singh.																								A handout sent to media offices here today said Sena office bearers unanimously elected their new chief at a secret meeting of the central executive committee, convened at an undisclosed hideout in Bhojpur. At least 57 district- and state-level commanders had attended the meeting.																								The new supreme commander is expected to revamp the setup of the outfit and work out its future strategy.																								Immediately after the election, Samsher Singh warned Naxalite groups of a suitable retaliation if peasants face any threat from them. The organisation would continue its legacy of fight against the ultra left organisations to protect the farmers.																								Samsher Singh is believed to be a trusted man of former chief Barmeswarnath Singh, popularly known as Mukhia. Arrested by Patna police, Mukhia is facing 36 cases in which over 400 persons had been killed. In his absence, Samsher Singh would work on his oral instructions conveyed through people meeting him in jail.																								Samsher Singh, a confidant of Mukhia since the formation of the group in 1994, was also a spokesman of the organisation for the last eight years. 																								Sena sources said he might go in for a fresh violent strike in the central districts of the state to command loyalty from district chiefs.																								The Naxalite response to the decision has been cold. A PWG spokesman said this was an attempt by the outfits remaining commanders to regroup.

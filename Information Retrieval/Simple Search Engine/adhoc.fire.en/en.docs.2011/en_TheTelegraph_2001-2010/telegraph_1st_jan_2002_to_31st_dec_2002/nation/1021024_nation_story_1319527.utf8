		 Thursday, October 24, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Vague police reply in Salman case				 																																																	 Mumbai (PTI): Pulling up police for filing a vague reply to the bail plea of Salman Khan in a hit-and-run case, a sessions court has directed the investigating officer to explain his stand in writing and deferred the arguments until Thursday.				 																																																	Sessions judge P.V. Bavkar decided to hear Salmans bail plea on Thursday as he wanted to go through the chargesheet to find out what statements witnesses had made to the police. 				 																																																	The judge also asked Salmans lawyer, Harshad Ponda, to submit rulings of the Supreme Court and high courts on which he would rely in his arguments.				 																																																	The court expressed its anguish over the written reply of the investigating officer who had stated therein that the chargesheet had been filed against Salman and appropriate orders may be passed on his bail petition. What are you suggesting? Are you opposing his bail or not? Give a definite answer in writing, the judge said.				 																																																	Prosecutor R.V. Kini submitted that the officer had left it to the courts discretion to grant bail to Salman. 				 																																																	The actor pleaded that he may be enlarged as investigations were over and a chargesheet had been filed against him.				 																																																	This is the fifth time Salman had urged for the bail. His plea for liberty was rejected four times since his arrest on September 28 after the actor had allegedly rammed his vehicle into a bakery, killing one person and injuring four.				 																HC blow to contract workers				 																																																	 Allahabad (PTI): Allahabad High Court has ruled that an employer has the right to terminate the services of a temporary employee without an inquiry after expiration of the terms of contract.				 																																																	The ruling was passed on Tuesday by Justice Rakesh Tiwari on a writ petition filed by R.R. Shah, a temporary clerical grade employee in the Uttar Pradesh education department, challenging the termination of his service.				 																																																	Dismissing the petition, the court said that in case of a temporary employee, the employer has a right to terminate the service at the end of the terms of contract of the service. It also said the employer is not required to conduct any inquiry before terminating the service of a temporary employee in case of charges of misconduct against such an employee.				 																																																	The petitioner lost his job in 1990 after he failed to submit a certificate of intermediate examination, a necessary qualification for the post. He also failed to reply to a showcause notice issued by the department.				 																Woman set on fire				 																																																	 Rohtak (PTI): A woman was set on fire allegedly by her in-laws in the district on Tuesday, police said. 				 																																																	The police booked the victims in-laws on the basis of her statement before a local magistrate. Reena, in her statement to the first class judicial magistrate, said her husband, Suneel, and in-laws had been harassing her for dowry since her marriage about three years ago.				 																Building blaze				 																																																	 Chennai (PTI): A fire broke out on the fourth floor of a multi-storeyed building in Teynampet area, but no casualty has been reported, fire brigade sources said. Over half a dozen fire tenders were engaged to douse the fire. The cause of fire was not known.				 																Fake currency haul				 																																																	 Rajkot (PTI): A gang involved in printing fake currency notes of different denominations was busted and eight persons were arrested in Surendranagar district on Tuesday. Police raided an STD-PCO booth in a shopping centre of a hotel on the highway and caught the culprits printing the notes. They recovered 14 fake notes of Rs 100 and Rs 50 denominations.				 																MiG crash probe				 																																																	 Jodhpur (PTI): A court of inquiry has been set up to probe into the crash of an air force MiG-21 aircraft that crashed about 6 km from the Utarlai air base in Barmer district, official sources said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec.10: Police action on agitating farmers here yesterday, in which Janata Dal (United) MP Devendra Prasad Yadav was injured, rocked the Lok Sabha today forcing Speaker Manohar Joshi to order setting up of a House committee to inquire into the matter.																								The 15-member committee will be headed by V.K. Malhotra of the BJP and give its report before the end of winter session.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani regretted the incident and directed the police to release the arrested farmers. 																								Advani came under fire from Opposition parties as well as BJP allies Samata Party and JD(U) for telling the House that he had no information on the basis of which he could fix responsibility on the police officials.																								Yadav said he had informed minister of state in the Prime Ministers Office Vijay Goel about the farmers march and sought to meet the Prime Minister to submit a memorandum on their plight. But Goel said he was not aware of the rally.

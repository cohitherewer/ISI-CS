		 Wednesday, October 09, 2002 				 Hot seat snub for Patel, support for Modi
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Keshubhai, Modi, Naidu, Advani and Rajnath at the BJP workers meeting in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. (PTI) 																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 8: BJP big guns L.K. Advani and Venkaiah Naidu today splashed cold water on Keshubhai Patels aspirations for chief minister, making it clear that the hot seat belonged to Narendra Modi.																								Speaking at the state-level workers convention, the deputy Prime Minister endorsed party chief Naidus statement that the BJP would sweep the Assembly elections and that Modi will remain the chief minister.																								The statement comes as a huge public snub to the former chief minister  on the dais with a galaxy of BJP central leaders  who had recently voiced reservations about Modis attempts to project himself as future chief minister. The chief minister is elected by MLAs. So the MLAs, not Modi, will decide who should be the chief minister, he had said.																								South Gujarats strongman Kashiram Rana had echoed Keshubhai. Both are aspirants for the hot seat, which, Advani today said, belongs to Modi.																								Exuding confidence about the BJPs poll prospects, he said retaining power in Gandhinagar was not the partys ultimate objective. We should be able to provide a model government, to give Gujarat its rightful place and take India into the league of developed nations, Rana said.																								Strongly defending Modis Gaurav Yatra  undertaken to restore the states pride after the February riots  Advani said no one should get carried away by its success.																								Underlining the importance of the Gujarat polls as it would affect the BJPs prospects in the 2004 general elections, Advani said: Our target is to win 300 Lok Sabha seats. But even after getting a clear majority, we would like to abide by the coalition dharma. We would like the NDA alliance to remain in place, to ensure that all regions are adequately represented.																								On a days visit to Ahmedabad, Advani expressed pride in Modi continuing as chief minister even six months after the dissolution of the Assembly. He slammed Modis detractors for demanding imposition of Presidents rule.																								Hitting out at pseudo-secularists for criticising Modi and maligning Gujarat, he said no efforts had been made to control the 1984 riots in Delhi but effective measures had been taken after the Godhra flare-up. Advani contended that India was secular because it was a Hindu-majority state. While Pakistan declared itself a theocratic state after Partition, the Constituent Assembly of India did not do so as it was in keeping with our cultural traditions, he said.																								Till 1997, the BJP attracted people by its ideology but after coming to power we have added new dimensions --- coalition dharma and development, he said.																								BJP president Naidu echoed Advani on the Gujarat polls setting the tone for 2004. The Assembly polls are very very crucial to us since the entire world will be watching us, he said.																								Naidu, too, voiced confidence that the BJP would come up trumps, but asked partymen not to become cocksure. Party workers should not go to Gandhinagar or but to villages to meet people, he said.																								The convention adopted a resolution reiterating faith in Modis leadership. It termed Modi the best chief minister who had proved his competence to the world by successfully handling situations from Godhra to Akshardham.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, November 08, 2002 				 Hospital dresses up
																								Director of medical education Chittaranjan Maiti visited the hospital after leaving his Writers Buildings office late this evening. At an impromptu meeting with senior hospital officials, it was decided that the Union minister  on his first official visit to this Opposition-ruled state  would be shown around two wards (both paediatric medicine) on the second floor of the hospital.																								It was decided that the minister would be taken around wards no. 6 and 7, a senior hospital official told The Telegraph. It has also been decided that both wards would get a fresh coat of paint on Friday, he said, adding that the exact modalities  how patients would be shifted around to make way for the work  were being worked out.																								But the other wards  now being repaired one by one on a rotational basis  would not get such shock therapy, officials admitted. We do not know whether the minister will ask to be shown around wards that we have not included in the itinerary but, even if he does, its not possible to paint every ward now, one of them said.																								But the exterior is getting a refurbishment and, going by appearances, Sinha is not going to see another ugly facet of the health scenario in the state  trade union activities  when he comes calling.																								Group-D staff of the hospital say most of them have been taking a less-than-usual interest in visiting the hospitals two union rooms (one belonging to the CPM-affiliated Citu and the other to the Congress-affiliated Intuc). Though union leaders insist that they have not shut down the units there, ground-level staff admit that the transfer of erstwhile superintendent Anup Mandal has made them rather shaky. There is no question of shutting down our unit, coordination committee secretary Smarajit Raychaudhuri said. But we dont usually open the rooms during office hours, he added.																								Intuc leader Pramathesh Sen echoed his political opponents. We open the union rooms even during office hours in case of emergencies, he claimed.																								Sinha, however, is not going to miss the freshly-painted grills  which have got a garish blue coat  and the suddenly-bright boundary walls (which have got a less gaudy combination).																								Officials, however, are apprehensive. Ministers who are not career politicians are generally not known to stick to the beaten path, one of them explained. Given Sinhas penchant for good copies in the media, officials say they cannot do anything except keeping their fingers crossed.

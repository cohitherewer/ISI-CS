		 Friday, November 01, 2002 				 Advani fires terror hub salvo at Pak
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Oct. 31: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today said Pakistan had usurped the status of being the centre of terrorism from Afghanistan, which was brutally tamed after the September 11 attacks in the US last year.																								Advani contended that, in its campaign against India, Pakistan had the backing of some Muslim countries, which have a wrong impression of the secular nature of India.																								There has been a change of opinion among Indias critics and the people of Kashmir after the Assembly elections in the state, Advani contended while addressing the state council meeting of the BJP in Andhra Pradesh. Even the attitude of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has altered, though not his actions, he added.																								The BJP leader said the partys a major contribution to the country has been the success of the coalition government at the Centre. From 13 days to 13 months to now three years, the BJP-led coalition is in power. What began as an experiment in 1989 has been made real by the BJP, which once upon a time was an untouchable in Indian politics, Advani said.																								The deputy Prime Minister said there was an urgent need to popularise the achievements of the NDA government. Our achievements in these days will be milestones of the philosophy we practised, he asserted.																								Advanis two-day visit to the state, however, ended in embarrassment for the state government. Security was beefed up in Tirupati and Hyderabad ahead of his visit to the Balaji temple, following several threats of bomb attacks. But lack of co-ordination among various departments left the Black Cat commandos accompanying the deputy Prime Minister from Delhi stranded on the tarmac at Begumpet airport, even as the VIPs left. The Black Cats finally left 30 minutes after the politicians.																								Earlier in the day, the deputy Prime Minister attended a function at the National Police Academy, where 33 IPS probationers, including one from West Bengal and six from the northeast, passed out of the institution. Advani also visited the Central Industrial Security Forces national centre and the campus of Greyhounds  the states elite anti-Naxalite force.																								He, however, missed the much-publicised dinner meeting with chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.

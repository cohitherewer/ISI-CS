		 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 Sydney court bar on womans return to India
																								Sydney, Sept. 19 (PTI): A high court here has barred a divorced Indian woman from relocating to Mumbai because of visitation rights of the father to their Australian-born eight-year-old daughter, raising questions over the Family Law Act in Australia.																								A seven-judge bench with only two dissenting judges confirmed the family courts recent decision that the daughter cannot be taken to India to live with the mother. 																								The mother has worked in London as a shipbroker but could only find casual clerical and data-entry jobs in Australia. She has been living on welfare.																								No family court in any democratic state should subscribe to a policy of entrapment of a custodial parent, especially when it is detrimental to the best interests of the child, and where there has been no denial of access to the non-custodial parent, said the woman, an Indian with permanent residence in Australia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, September 23, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																15 killed in UP tempo blast				 																																																	 Lucknow: Fifteen persons travelling in a tempo were killed when a powerful bomb exploded on Hardoi-Kanpur Road inside the vehicle on Sunday, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	A state police official said the bomb, which was kept inside the tempo, went off near Farhat Nagar railway crossing, about 40 km from Hardoi, killing 14 of its occupants on the spot.				 																																																	There were only three survivors and one of them later succumbed in hospital. The condition of another injured is stated to be critical.				 																																																	Police officials here do not think it was a terrorist strike. Although the explosion was powerful and was heard up to three kilometres, we do not think the explosive was RDX, said deputy inspector general of police Arun Kumar.				 																																																	Senior officials have rushed to the spot. The police suspect that some of the passengers were carrying large quantities of explosives for making firecrackers and it somehow triggered off the explosion.				 																Doctors flash beautician alert				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): A gathering of skin specialists on Sunday warned that unqualified beauticians could be bad in the long run and called for a regulatory mechanism to ensure that only qualified people and tested cosmetics are allowed in the profession.				 																																																	The myth we seek to explode is that cosmetology belongs to a class of ill-defined experts called beauticians. We have very little knowledge of the processes, materials and the practices of these beauticians, said Dr D.M. Mahajan of Moolchand Hospital.				 																																																	Mahajan said another popular fallacy is that herbal remedies used by the unqualified practitioners do not cause side-effects and other complications. 				 																																																	The ill effects of many herbal remedies are well known. When a person can be allergic to a food item, he can very well be allergic to herbal products, he said. 				 																																																	Mahajan added that only a qualified dermatologist is conversant with the scientific treatment needed for those who seek cosmetological solutions. Hence the need for regulation, he said.				 																Shakeel gang hitman killed				 																																																	 Mumbai (PTI): Usman Bora, a top shooter in the Chhota Shakeel gang, was killed in an encounter on Sunday in south Mumbai.				 																																																	Following a tip-off, a trap was laid to apprehend him at Nagpada. When the gangster was asked to surrender, he opened fire, forcing them to retaliate, an official said. In the exchange of fire, Usman was injured and rushed to J.J. Hospital, where he was declared brought dead.				 																Police station blast 				 																																																	 Anantapur (PTI): A newly constructed police station was blasted by Naxalites of the Peoples War Group at Dharmavaram. Six Naxalites of the Ganapathi faction came to the police station and asked the watchman to leave the building. They planted mines in the walls and triggered the explosion with a remote control. 				 																Cop in kidnap case				 																																																	 Faridkot (PTI): Police have registered a case against an assistant sub-inspector for allegedly kidnapping a woman. In the FIR police said the ASI abducted Sukho (not her real name) a few months back. Following a complaint by the womans parents, the district police chief began an inquiry. Police official Gurjant Singh was produced in court regarding the case. He was sent to police custody for one day. 				 																Lankans held				 																																																	 Tiruchirapalli (PTI): Three Sri Lankans who attempted to fly to Sharjah with boarding passes of three Indians were held by airport security men. Two Indians who aided them were arrested. Two more are absconding. 				 																Policeman jailed				 																																																	 Dehra Dun (PTI): A policeman in Champawat has been sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment for raping his daughter. The district and sessions judge upheld the charge against him.				 																Woman kills self				 																																																	 Dubai (PTI): A woman hailing from Kerala allegedly committed suicide after poisoning her six-year-old daughter in her flat. Police detained her husband, Satish, 30, and another man, Chandran, who shared the flat with the family. 				 																																																	A majestic gurudwara, claimed to be the largest and the first of its kind in Europe, with ability to accommodate 4,000 devotees, is getting finishing touches in Southall, west London. Costing over 17 million, it has a covered area of 1,00,000 square feet.

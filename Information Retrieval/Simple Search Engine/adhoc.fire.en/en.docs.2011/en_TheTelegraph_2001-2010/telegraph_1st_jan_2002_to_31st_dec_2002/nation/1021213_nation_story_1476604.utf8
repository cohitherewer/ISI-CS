		 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 Pervez claim
																								Islamabad, Dec. 12 (AFP): India spent nearly $1.5 billion in its military standoff with Pakistan but achieved nothing, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf claimed today.																								India has wasted Rs 80 billion ($1.4 billion ) on the escalation, as it could not achieve its objectives, Musharraf claimed at a function in Attock.																								Neither Pakistan nor India has released figures on its own costs for the military buildup.																								He said Pakistan did not succumb to the pressure from India. This is due to faith in Allah, the courage of our armed forces and our conventional deterrence, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Musharraf as telling troops at the function.

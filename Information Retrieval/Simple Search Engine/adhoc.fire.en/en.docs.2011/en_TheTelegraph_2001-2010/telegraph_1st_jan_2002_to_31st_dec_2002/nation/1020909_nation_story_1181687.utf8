		 Monday, September 09, 2002 				 Cauvery water slash irks TN
																								New Delhi, Sept. 8 (PTI): The Cauvery River Authority today slashed the quantum of Cauvery water release from Karnataka, pegging it at 9,000 cusecs (0.8 tmcft) per day, a decision Tamil Nadu said it will challenge in the Supreme Court soon. 																								I hope this arrangement will reasonably meet the requirements of the basin states in the present critical situation and is fair and just to all parties concerned, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who heads the authority, said in his concluding remarks at the emergency meeting convened yesterday. 																								But this was rejected by Tamil Nadu finance minister C. Ponnaiyan, who told reporters after the meeting that the state will file a case against the decision in the apex court in a day or two. Last week, the Supreme Court had directed Karnataka to release 1.25 tmcft of water to Tamil Nadu daily till the authority met and decided on a distress-sharing formula for the current season. 																								Following Karnatakas inability to release 1.25 tmcft of water, the Prime Minister directed at todays authority meeting that the state should release 9,000 cusecs, amounting to 0.8 tmcft, per day at Mettur in Tamil Nadu accounted on a weekly average basis for September-October. 																								Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna welcomed the decision and thanked Vajpayee for showing a statesmanship-like approach. It showed that he was really concerned about inter-state matters, he said.

		 Saturday, September 28, 2002 				 Boy death fingers pointed at jawans
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Sept. 27: The parents of a 17-year-old student who was allegedly stoned to death by Railway Protection Force jawans in Chhapra have decided to approach the National Human Rights Commission for redressal.																								Umashankar Prasad, who claims that his son, Satish Kumar, was killed in a macabre manner at Techniwas station near Chhapra, has also decided to file a separate petition at the Chhapra chief judicial magistrates court so that a criminal case can be initiated against the accused jawans.																								Satish, who was travelling by the Maurya Express on September 16, was to disembark at Kopasamhauta station in Chhapra. When the train stopped abruptly at Techniwas station, the teenager got down on seeing others in the compartment doing so.																								The teenager reportedly fell in a pond while running away with passengers. Six RPF jawans who were trying to apprehend the passengers for pulling the chain allegedly picked up stones and hurled them at him. The student allegedly bled to death in the pond. Prasad alleged that the jawans continued pelting stones at his son despite Satish shouting that he had not pulled the chain.																								The boys death has led to an uproar in the area against the railway police and local Samata party leader Hem Narayan has shot off a petition to Union railway minister Nitish Kumar on the incident.

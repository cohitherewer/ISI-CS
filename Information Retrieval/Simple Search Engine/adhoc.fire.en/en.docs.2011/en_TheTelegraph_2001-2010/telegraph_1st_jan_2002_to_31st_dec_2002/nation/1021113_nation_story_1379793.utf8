		 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 It is nothing but nasty, asserts Lyngdoh
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, Nov. 12: BJP leaders today met Chief Election Commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh in Rajkot and asked what he had meant by nasty while describing the situation in Gujarat. 																								Comparing the situation in Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir, Lyngdoh said yesterday: The situation in Gujarat is not as dangerous as Jammu and Kashmir, but it is nasty. 																								Lyngdoh stuck to his stand today, saying the situation in Gujarat is nothing but nasty. It is the only appropriate word to explain the riots, the non-availability of drinking water in some relief camps and the mudslinging match parties are engaged in in Gujarat, he asserted.																								The chief election commissioner said Central paramilitary forces will be deployed in the state on November 20. The commission has called Gujarat DGP K. Chakravarthi to Delhi on November 18 to give a presentation on how he plans to deploy the forces to ensure that the minority community can vote and elections are free and fair. 																								Candidates facing criminal charges would have to file affidavits with their nomination papers, he said. The affidavits will be available with district collectors and sold at a nominal fee. 																								On the VHPs proposed yatra from Godhra on November 17, the chief election commissioner said: I have asked the state government to submit a report in a day or two. He said strict action will be taken in case of tension.																								Modi respect vow																								Narendra Modi said in Vadodara district today he had great respect for the poll panel and would comply with its directives.																								The BJP was not interested in a change of schedule of elections on December 12, he said.																								Denying Laloo Prasad Yadavs charge of fanning communal tension in Gujarat, the caretaker chief minister asked trouble-makers to go to Bihar, where they will be able to carry out their nefarious activities.																								At a meeting at Padra, Modi warned that unless these elements stopped their activities in the state, they would be strictly dealt with. 																								Laloo Prasad claimed in Patna: Modi is indulging in making inflammatory statements detrimental to peace and communal harmony in the riot-hit state. The election commission should debar him from contesting the elections for violating the model code of conduct. 																								The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief said: Modi should be put behind the bars immediately for disturbing peace and amity.																								Launching the second leg of the ninth phase of the Gaurav Yatra in Vadodara, Modi challenged Congress president Sonia Gandhi to have a public debate on his speeches in any language  Hindi, English , Gujarati or Italian  in the presence of prominent journalists on the issue. None of his speeches in the last one year were inflammatory, he said.																								Asked from where he would contest the Assembly polls, Modi said the central election committee of the party will take the decision. I can contest from any of 182 constituencies, barring reserved seats. If the party asks me to go to Himachal Pradesh, I will just pack off.																								Modi had contested from Rajkot II Assembly seat in February after becoming chief minister. This time, he wants a new constituency, as Rajkot is no longer considered safe.

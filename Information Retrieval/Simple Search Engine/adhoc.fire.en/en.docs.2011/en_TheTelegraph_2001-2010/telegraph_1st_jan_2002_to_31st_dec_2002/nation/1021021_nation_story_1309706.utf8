		 Monday, October 21, 2002 				 Murdoch proposal
																								For instance, if a publisher is applying for permission to start a speciality magazine on fashion, the committee will co-opt an official from the textiles ministry, likewise for health and medicine. 																								The guidelines will also lay down that there must be a specific application for every journal/periodical that a publisher may want to bring in. An omnibus application from a publisher with foreign equity holding will not be entertained.																								This means that even if publishers such as Macmillan, Oxford University Press, Sage, Orient Longman have foreign equity partners they will still have to apply separately for every foreign journal or periodical they may want to print and distribute in India.																								Swaraj said she expected the guidelines for the news and current affairs category to be out by the middle of November.

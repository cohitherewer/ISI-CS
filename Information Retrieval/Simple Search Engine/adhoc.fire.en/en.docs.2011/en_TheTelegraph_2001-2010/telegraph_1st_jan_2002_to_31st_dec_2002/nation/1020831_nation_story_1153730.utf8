		 Saturday, August 31, 2002 				 Cong to take attack plea to Advani
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 30: The Congress plans to address a letter to deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, demanding an inquiry and action against those responsible for yesterdays violence outside Sonia Gandhis residence.																								General secretaries of the All India Congress Committee gathered at Sonias residence today to take stock of the situation. Congress leaders expressed dismay over the Vajpayee governments indifference towards a serious security lapse. Sonia and Congress functionaries took a serious view of the incident and discussed various options to register their protest.																								The party decided to send a written communication to Advani, seeking action against BJP Mahila Morcha activists who gathered unlawfully outside 10 Janpath. It also wants an explanation as to how the house of an SPG protectee (read Sonia Gandhi) was allowed to be attacked. Congress leaders claimed that there was no police bandobast (arrangements) to deal with the protesters.																								On their part, the Congress denied the BJP charge that some of its Youth Congress activists had attacked the BJP headquarters at Ashoka Road.																								The official Congress line is that two cars belonging to the Youth Congress leaders were passing through the road when BJP goons attacked them. The Congress workers managed to flee but their car, a Maruti Zen, was severely damaged.

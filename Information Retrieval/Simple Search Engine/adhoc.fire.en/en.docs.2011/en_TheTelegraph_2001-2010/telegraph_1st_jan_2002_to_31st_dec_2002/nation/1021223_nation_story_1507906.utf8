 RAJEEV BHATTACHARYYA																								New Delhi, Dec. 22: Two students of Delhi Universitys Hindu College have fled their hostel after they were thrashed allegedly over their caste.																								One of the two Scheduled Caste students has suffered a leg fracture. The other student and a guest are covered all over with bruises.																								Bharat Rohin and Mrityunjay Kumar, both of BA third year, and Vikrant Rohin picked up a quarrel with hostel inmates allegedly over caste issues and for  seeking to turn the hostel into an SC hostel.																								The three have complained to the police though an FIR is yet to be filed. The station house officer has reportedly said no action can be initiated unless the hostel warden complains in writing.																								Abuses along caste lines had begun from September, immediately after the (student) elections, Mrityunjay, also the hostel president, said.																								On one occasion, when it had become impossible to suffer the insults, the (students) union had to expel two students (from the hostel) who led the campaign against us, he said.																								He alleged that there were constant threats to re-enact Jhajjar in Hindu College. We were so scared that we never divulged the facts to the police and chose to call it an accident in the hospital, Mrityunjay said.																								Things came to a head when the expelled students were readmitted to the hostel. The warden allegedly warned Mrityunjay against complaining to the police about any hostel inmate.																								Three days ago, 15 inmates locked up the three boys in their rooms and thrashed them for hours together. Of the 15 who attacked us, only three were (hostel) residents. The others were day scholars and outsiders whom we havent seen before, Bharat said.

Police stopped the activists, led by Swami Pragyananda of the mahamandal, from reaching Qutab Minar, which the activists claim was constructed by demolishing 27 Hindu and Jain temples.				 																																																	Around 150 activists who had gathered here demanding the right to perform puja were stopped from entering the protected monument and later arrested, additional deputy commissioner (south) Praveer said.				 																																																	Swami Pragyananda of the Dev Sthan Mukti Yagna Samiti accused the government of showing double standards by stopping the volunteers who were agitating peacefully and allowing only Muslims to perform namaz at the monument.				 																																																	The minar has been built by demolishing more than 27 temples and Hindus have a legitimate right to perform puja at the site, VHP general secretary Ram kishan Gaud said, adding that our organisation will carry on the struggle.

IPCL public relations officer Devendra Amin said the gas leak is completely under control and the plant is ready to function. 				 																																																	The exact cause of the leak is being investigated. No sabotage or mischief has been detected and it appears to be a technical fault, Amin said.

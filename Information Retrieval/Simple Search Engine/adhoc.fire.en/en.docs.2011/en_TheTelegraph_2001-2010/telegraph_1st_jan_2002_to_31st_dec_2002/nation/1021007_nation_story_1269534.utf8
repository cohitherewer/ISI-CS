Gangster kin denied passport				 																																																	 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has directed underworld don Chhota Rajans brother Deepak Nikalje to implead the city police as a respondent to his petition which urged the renewal of his passport.

Lodha and Dilip Bhonsale, who decided to hear the police on October 17, as Nikaljes passport had not been renewed on the basis of adverse reports from the police.				 																																																	On September 26, the Union government had justified its decision to not renew Nikaljes passport as there were adverse police reports against him and that he was Chhota Rajans brother.

		 Tuesday, December 31, 2002 				 BJP trashes rath remarks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 30: The BJP today objected to VHP working president Ashok Singhals criticism of deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis rath yatra and attempts by the RSS to embroil President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in a controversy for proposing to inaugurate Jesuit conference in Calcutta.																								Reacting to Singhals charge that Advanis campaign had done little more than politicising Hindutva, BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said it was unnecessary.																								We dont agree with the remark, said Naqvi. 																								At a time when other political parties, notably the Congress, were trying to suppress (the) peoples sentiments, Advani, as the leader of a responsible political party, spearheaded the yatra.																								He did it not for any political benefit or religious objective, but only to strengthen the roots of cultural nationalism, he said.																								On RSS chief K.S. Sudarshans reported remark on Kalam, Naqvi said: It is not proper to drag the Presidents office into a controversy. The President will use his conscience to decide which programme he wants to attend. The BJP has no problem with that. Sudharshan had allegedly called Kalams Jesuit meet inauguration as very unfortunate.

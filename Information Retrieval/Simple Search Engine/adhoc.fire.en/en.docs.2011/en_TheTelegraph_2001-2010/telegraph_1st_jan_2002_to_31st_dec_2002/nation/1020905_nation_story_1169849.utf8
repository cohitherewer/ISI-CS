		 Thursday, September 05, 2002 				 CBI taps Denmark in Purulia case
																								New Delhi, Sept. 4 (PTI): Two senior CBI officials are in Denmark to convince the authorities to extradite Kim Davy, the main accused in the Purulia armsdrop case, or try him there if his extradition is not possible.																								CBI director P.C. Sharma said additional-director Vijay Shankar and deputy inspector general Lok Nath Behera were in Denmark to explain to the authorities the grave crime that Davy, alias Niels Christian Nielsen, had committed.																								There is no extradition treaty between India and Denmark and, according to Danish law, none of its citizens can be extradited. Kim Davy is one of the 11 most wanted criminals in the world today and there is a red corner warrant pending against him, Sharma said. The CBI team will explain to the Danish authorities about his importance in cracking the entire conspiracy behind the case.																								Davy is wanted in connection with procurement of weapons and purchase of an An-32 aircraft, which was used to drop the arms and ammunition over Purulia in West Bengal in 1995. Believed to be a follower of the Anand Marg sect, Davy had escaped to Denmark after the sensational airdrop of four tonnes of arms.																								We have a case and we hope to achieve some positive results, an optimistic Sharma said.																								But if Denmark refuses to hand Davy over, we will provide all evidence to the Danish authorities to facilitate his trial in that country only, the CBI director added.																								The Central Bureau of Investigation had intensified efforts to secure Davys extradition in March this year after he appeared in a television show in Denmark. The efforts gained momentum after a meeting between Jaswant Singh, who was external affairs minister then, and his Danish counterpart Per Stig Moller here.																								Sharma said the investigating agency had furnished all evidences to the Danish authorities and the Denmark unit of Interpol had also confirmed to the CBI that he was in Copenhagen.																								The CBI and the foreign ministry are also making efforts to at least get Davy arrested, pending an extradition trial.																								Officials here said a letter rogatory to Denmark was sent in 1996. The same year, a red corner notice was issued by the France-based Interpol which was still valid.

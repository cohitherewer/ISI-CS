 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 1: Ahmedabad police today claimed that a Jaish-e-Mohammad operative is being interrogated in connection with a plot to assassinate Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.																								Joint commissioner of police (crime) P.P. Pandey said the Jaish operative, Sameer Khan Pathan, 30, was arrested on September 27 from the Gita Mandir area of Ahmedabad and had come with the intention of assassinating the chief minister during the Gaurav Yatra. Modi had recently declared he would not accept additional security during the fourth phase of the yatra, come what may. 																								The police also swooped down on six others in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh for helping Pathan. 																								According to the police, investigating authorities are also trying to ascertain if Pathan and the six accomplices had anything to do with the attack on the Swaminarayan temple.																								The police revealed that Pathan had left Ahmedabad for Pakistan in 1997 and was trained by the Harkat-ul-Ansar and the Jaish. Pathan, the police said, had seen action in Mansera, on the Afghanistan border, and in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.																								According to the police, a person called Rizwan, who heads the Indian operations of Jaish, had sent Pathan an e-mail detailing the modus operandi for killing Modi.

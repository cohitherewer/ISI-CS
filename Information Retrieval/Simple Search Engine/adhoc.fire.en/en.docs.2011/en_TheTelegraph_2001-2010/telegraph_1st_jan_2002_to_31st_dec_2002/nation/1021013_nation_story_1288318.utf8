		 Sunday, October 13, 2002 				 Stars fight Cauvery war
 M.R. VENKATESH 																								Neyveli, Oct. 12: Tamil Nadus filmdom today converged on the Neyveli Lignite Corporation to demand that supply of power to Karnataka from the Central plant be stopped in response to the neighbouring states refusal to release Cauvery water.																								Scores of actors, directors and technicians marched from a village outside the NLC complex to the rally venue, where top stars, including Kamalahasan, made emotive speeches late this afternoon at an open-air dais opposite the power utilitys corporate office. Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishnas violation of the Supreme Court order to release Cauvery waters to Tamil Nadu should be condemned by one and all, said Kamalahasan.																								The artistes, led by director Bharathiraja under the banner of Kalaiulaga Cauvery Agitation Forum, wore black badges and demanded stopping power supply to Karnataka.																								The tit-for-tat threat was, however, merely symbolic as the Neyveli power plant feeds the entire southern grid from which the states in this region, including Karnataka, draw their share. Sarath Kumar clarified that we have not come here to cut off power supply to Karnataka, but only to express our feelings.																								By making the demand, the artistes sought to underline the need for reciprocity in resource-sharing among neighbouring states, Bharathiraja said. We are only agitating in a peaceful and democratic manner to get our rightful share of the Cauvery waters, he asserted.																								As the rally had the blessings of all parties, particularly the ADMK, thousands thronged the venue. At Cuddalore prison, the inmates  led by Tamil nationalist leader P. Nedumaran who has been jailed under the anti-terrorism law observed a fast today. 																								Though the rally started well beyond its scheduled time, the stars did not disappoint the audience with their words.																								Karnataka has been testing our patience beyond limits, said Vijayakanth to thundering applause. Kamalahasan added that though the rally was meant to show Tamil sentiments have been deeply hurt we should not forget that we are Indians first, then Tamils and Kannadigas.																								People lined the roads to cheer the stars as 200 buses and luxury cars ferried the artistes and technicians from Chennai early this morning. A massive makeshift kitchen with 136 cooks was set up on a polytechnic campus en route to prepare lunch.Though the rally started well beyond its scheduled time, the stars did not disappoint the audience with their words.																								Karnataka has been testing our patience beyond limits, said Vijayakanth to thundering applause. Kamalahasan added that though the rally was meant to show that Tamil sentiments have been deeply hurt we should not forget that we are Indians first, then Tamils and Kannadigas.																								Finally, it looked more																								like a leisurely paced star-night evening, than a																								serious protest rally over the Cauvery waters issue. 																								 The star-packed procession, with some of the																								leading artistes on a tractor-trailer, to protest																								against Karnatakas denial of Cauvery waters was																								delayed by several hours this evening. Due to lack of																								proper coordination, it was finally flagged off by																								actor Vijayakant at 1735 hours at a village near here.																								 The delay in the rally was partly due to the																								artistes departure from Chennai itself being delayed																								by several hours, and many of them had to go without																								food due to lack of proper arrangement at a																								Polytechnic en route where they were scheduled to halt																								for lunch. 																								 It was also speculated that the rally was being																								delyaed so that many of the artistes would not be able																								to return to Chennai in time for the fast by the																								superstar Rajnikanth in the State capital tomorrow. 																								 As darkness began to engulf the open maidan																								where several top stars were scheduled to address,																								people who had gathered in large numbers since the																								afternoon began to return in disappointment. The																								meeting may go on till late in the night though																								Mr.Bharathiraja and others have submitted their																								memorandum to the NLCs Chairman and Managing Director																								at its corporate office here.																								Star Speaker at the rally here																								tonight, actor Kamal Hasan said that the Karnataka																								Chief Minister, Mr.S.M.Krishnas violation ot the																								Supreme Court order to release cauvery waters to TaMil																								Nadu should be condemned by one ane all. quot;It goes																								against the grain of the National mainstream quot;, he said																								though the rally was to express how Tamils sentimetns																								have been deeply hurt, quot;we should not forget that we																								are Indians first, then Tamils and Kannadagas. quot;																								In a blistering attack against																								Karnatakas attitude, the President of the South																								Indian Film Artistes Association, actor Vijayakanth																								said Tamil Nadu people have been so large hearted to																								let people from other States quot;make a living here quot;. quot;I																								am NOT talking secessionsim, but Karnataka has been																								testing our patience beyond limits, quot; said Vijayakant,																								and asked amidst thunderous applause quot;are not there																								Kannadigas also in Chennai ? quot; 																								 The DMK MP and actor Sarath Kumar made clear																								that quot;we have not come here to cut off power supply to																								Karnataka, but only to express our strong feelings																								over the Cauvery issue. quot; The film fraternity should																								stand united and go in a delegation, meet the																								Karnataka Chief Minister, S.M.Krishna, the Prime																								Minister, Mr.A.B.Vajpayee and the Congress President,																								Mrs.Sonia Gandhi, to quot;convey what we deeply feel. quot; 																								 While the AIADMK M.P.,and comedian S.S.Chandran																								wondered how justified Karnataka was in denying Tamil																								nadu the cauvery waters when India shared the Indus																								waters with Pakistan and the Ganga waters with																								Bangaladesh. 																								 Noted Director K.Bhagyaraj, whom MGR had called																								him as quot;his heir quot; in the field of Cinema, made the																								point that todays huge rally by the Tamil film																								artistes was only a reaction to the Kannada film																								artistes taking to the streets in Bangalore seeking to																								block Cauvery waters to Tamil Nadu. 																								 The Agitation forums President and well known																								director, Bharathiraja said, quot;we are only agitating in																								a peaceful and democratic manner to get our rightful																								share of the Cauvery waters.

		 Tuesday, December 24, 2002 				 Gujarat BJP leader held for graft
																								Surat, Dec. 23 (PTI): Senior BJP leader in Gujarat and Surat Urban Development Authority chairman Arvind Godiwala was arrested today on charges of accepting Rs 5 lakh as bribe from a city-based builder.																								Godiwala was caught by sleuths of the anti-corruption bureau while allegedly accepting the bribe on Saturday for the allotment of reserved land on the outskirts of Magdalla, official sources said.																								Bureau sources said the money was recovered from Godiwalas residence during a search. 																								He was arrested by investigating officer P.K. Chaudhary under Sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and produced before district judge M. D. Shah, who remanded him in two days judicial custody till December 26, when his bail application will come up for hearing. 																								Godiwala said the sum was being collected for the partys political fund. But city BJP chief Kishore Wankawala denied his claim. We have not authorised him to collect the funds for the party at local level, he said, adding, however, that the BJPs Surat unit was unaware if the high command had given any instructions directly to Godiwala. 																								Godiwala put in his resignation to chief minister Narendra Modi immediately after arrest.

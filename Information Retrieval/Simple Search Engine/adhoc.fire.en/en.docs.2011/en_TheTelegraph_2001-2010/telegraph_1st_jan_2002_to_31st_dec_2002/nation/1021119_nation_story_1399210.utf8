		 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Fake cloud on director assault
				 	 Bundela being roughed up on Sunday. (PTI)																								Bhopal, Nov. 18 (PTI): Three persons were arrested in connection with the alleged assault on actor-director Raja Bundela yesterday even as police said the incident was stage-managed.																								One of those arrested is a close friend of Bundela, said superintendent of police Arun Pratap Singh.																								Early yesterday, around 25 Bajrang Sena activists allegedly beat up Bundela at the local Lily cinema after the media release of his film Pratha. It had apparently shown Hindu priests in bad light.																								There is a strong possibility that the whole incident was stage-managed by Bundela himself, Singh said. He added that investigations into the case were on and it was possible that more arrests would be made soon.																								Tiwari had made a statement last night that he was Bundelas friend and the incident had been stage-managed, Singh said.																								Bundela has neither filed any complaint with the police about the incident nor is he ready to press charges against the three arrested, the officer said.																								However, taking cognisance of the incident that occurred in public, the police have registered a case. Bundela might be afraid that if he files a complaint with the police, his involvement in the incident may come to light, said Singh.																								Ashutosh Mishra, Amitabh Dube and Rajeev Tiwari were let off on bail this afternoon. They spent last night at the Jehangirabad police station lock-up, said additional superintendent of police Vivek Sharma. They were not produced in court and were granted bail at the police station itself as their offence was not serious, Sharma said.

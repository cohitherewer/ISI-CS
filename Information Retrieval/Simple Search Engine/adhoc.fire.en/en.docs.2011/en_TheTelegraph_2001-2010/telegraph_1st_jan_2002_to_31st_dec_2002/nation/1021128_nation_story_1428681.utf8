		 Thursday, November 28, 2002 				 Indira portrait
																								Indira Nehrus time at Oxford was spoilt by bad health and a fear of exams, especially in Latin which was compulsory in her time. She switched from an honours degree in history, which she had initially wanted to read, to a diploma in social and public 																								administration, a non-degree course. 																								However, on her doctors orders, she had to abandon the course and did not return to Oxford to complete her studies.																								She had difficulty getting in because passing Latin was necessary in her days but the college was keen to have the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru among its intake in 1937. She cut a lonely figure who seemed out of place among the jolly, hockey-stick brigade from British public schools. 																								Katherine Franks biography of the Indian prime minister says of the young Indiras arrival at Oxford: With piles of luggage, Indira arrived at Somerville College, on a cold, rainy Thursday afternoon in October, feeling terribly nervous and agitated.																								Like the other girls, she wore tweed jackets, skirts and sensible shoes. She matriculated  the formal induction ceremony  wearing her academic gown, cap, a white blouse, black tie and black skirt.																								She took part in the activities of the Indian Majlis or the Labour Club but her attentions were distracted by her developing affair with Feroze Gandhi and the troubled political situation back in India. According to Frank, Indira remained acutely aware of her role and stature as Nehrus daughter when she was at Oxford, but she was a political presence rather than leader.																								After unveiling her mother-in-laws portrait on Friday, Sonia Gandhi will move on to the Centre for Islamic Studies. 																								She is expected to speak for 45 minutes to an hour, said Hassan Abedi, a spokesman for the centre. We hope she will then take questions.																								Sonia Maino, as the Congress leader was known as when she was a student at a language school in Cambridge in the 1960s, met her future husband, Rajiv Gandhi, when he was an undergraduate at Trinity, Nehrus old college.																								The only Indian whose portrait hangs at Trinity is its current Master, Amartya Sen. His wife, Emma Rothschild (a don at Kings College, Cambridge), was an undergraduate at Somerville, disclosed Dame Caldicott.

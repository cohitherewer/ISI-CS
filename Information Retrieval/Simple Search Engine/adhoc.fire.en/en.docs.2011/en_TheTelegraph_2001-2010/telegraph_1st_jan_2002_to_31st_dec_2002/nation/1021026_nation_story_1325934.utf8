		 Saturday, October 26, 2002 				 Flight pact for small towns 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 25: Indian Airlines and Air-India have entered into an agreement to jointly operate 23 hub-and-spoke flights weekly. According to the understanding, Indian Airlines will fly Air-India passengers via A320 Airbus on 23 scheduled flights every week. 																								The flights will operate between Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Cochin, Bangalore, Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram.																								Through this hub-and-spoke arrangement, the state-owned airlines will attend to the connectivity needs of smaller cities to international flight hubs. 																								The Indian Airlines flights will operate with Air-India flight numbers from the international terminals and will ferry passengers between smaller towns and Delhi and Mumbai.																								The timings for the hub-and-spoke flights have been co-ordinated with Air-India flights between Delhi and Mumbai and New York, Chicago, London, Riyadh and Jeddah. The cooperation comes after years of bickering between the carriers over Gulf routes and consequent hindrance to proper hub-and-spoke partnerships. 																								It had started in 1994. But at present, the number of such operations between the airlines is restricted to four flights a week.

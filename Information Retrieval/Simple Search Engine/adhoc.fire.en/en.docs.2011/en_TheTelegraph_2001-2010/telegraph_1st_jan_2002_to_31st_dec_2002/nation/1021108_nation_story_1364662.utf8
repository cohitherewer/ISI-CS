		 Friday, November 08, 2002 				 George, Jaya break three-year ice
 M.R. VENKATESH 				 	 George Fernandes with Jayalalithaa at the Tamil Nadu secretariat. (PTI)																								Chennai, Nov. 7: Defence minister George Fernandes today called on chief minister Jayalalithaa, ending a three-year stand-off since she demanded his dismissal from the Cabinet in April 1999 and pulled down the A.B. Vajpayee government. 																								A cheerful Fernandes, who was here for a conference, made a 30-minute courtesy call to Jayalalithaa at the secretariat. The NDA convener said: I have not come here with any signal. 																								Fernandes defended the Samata Partys call for a review of the divestment process, particularly when the nations interests are involved. 																								Denying that the Samata or party general secretary Shambu Shrivastwa had attacked the Vajpayee governments divestment policy, Fernandes said the former had merely expressed an opinion favouring a mid-term review of the policy.																								Although the controversy erupted after two letters he had written to the Prime Minister on the selloff were leaked to the press, Fernandes asserted: I never released these letters at any point of time. 																								The Samata had yesterday attacked the procedure and speed of disinvestment, particularly in the sale of Mumbai-based Centaur hotel and IPCL. Releasing the resolutions passed at the partys national executive in Rajkot, Shrivastwa said the selloffs had raised doubts in the publics mind. 																								With this meeting, Fernandes finally managed to keep an appointment he had sought with Jayalalithaa in July. He had rushed back to Delhi then without meeting Jayalalithaa, citing urgent summons from Vajpayee at the height of the Gujarat crisis. The two leaders had not met since she demanded his dismissal over allegations of corruption levelled by former navy chief Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat.																								The rapprochement, though long in coming, was clearly indicated yesterday in Patna when Fernandes defended the Tamil Nadu law banning forcible conversions, saying there was nothing wrong with it. 																								The NDA convener struck a balance by going to Apollo Hospitals to meet ally DMKs senior leader and Cabinet colleague, Murasoli Maran, who has been under treatment for over a month for a serious heart ailment. 																								But he could not meet DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, who was waiting for him in the hospital. Karunanidhi left around 1.30 pm as the defence minister was late. 																								Replying to queries about the Jaguar crash at Ambala, Fernandes reiterated that it was one of the finest and safest aircraft, adding that it is only an accident.

		 Tuesday, November 05, 2002 				 Mufti raps Farooq
																								Jammu, Nov. 4 (PTI): Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today mounted a veiled attack on the previous Farooq Abdullah government, blaming its autocratic rule for the states ills.																								The ills of the prevailing situation lies in the autocratic pattern of governance of the previous government. Under the new dispensation, the people will be masters of their destiny, Mufti told a rally here, his first since assuming power.																								Promising to address the root cause of peoples disenchantment and evolve a mechanism for grievance redress, he hinted at bringing an accountability Bill that could bring in its purview persons holding high public offices starting from the chief minister. 																								Ruling out trifurcation of the state, the chief minister said all the three regions of the state have to flourish together and Jammu region which has not played its due role since 1947 will now be required to play one. The time has come for its legitimate aspirations to be fulfilled, he said.																								Mufti said no region must nurture an impression of being ignored as the coalition government is determined to provide equal opportunities to all areas. Referring to the appointment of the deputy chief minister from Jammu, he said the move will go a long way in satisfying the people. Mufti said no discrimination will be made against either Ladakh or Jammu region and that collective decision was imperative to steer the state to prosperity. 																								He called for a national consensus to address the problems of the state and said all parties must rise above party lines.

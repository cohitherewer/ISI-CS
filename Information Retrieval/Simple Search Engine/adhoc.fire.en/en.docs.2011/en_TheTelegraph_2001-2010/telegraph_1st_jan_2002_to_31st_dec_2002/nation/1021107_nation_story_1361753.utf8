		 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 Nagappa wife looks to Jaya
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Nov. 6: The wife of former Karnataka minister H. Nagappa, who has been kidnapped by forest brigand Veerappan, today sought the assistance of Jayalalithaa for her husbands release.																								Accompanied by son Preetham, daughter Pavan and son-in-law Kiran Patel, Parimala met the Tamil Nadu chief minister for over 30 minutes at the secretariat a day after Karnataka rejected Veerappans demand to send one of the ministers, Raju Gowda, as emissary to negotiate the release of his hostage.																								With the government firmly declining to send any emissary or scale down the operation of the special task force (STF) against the brigand, Parimala requested the chief minister to make a reciprocal gesture to secure Nagappas release. 																								She updated the chief minister on her husbands health condition and the intervening developments.																								Parimala is also understood to have requested the Tamil Nadu government to halt its STF operations, but there was no official word on this. 																								Later, Preetham and Pavan told reporters that they had sought the fullest cooperation of the chief minister to resolve the issue. 																								We dont know what else to do as Karnataka has refused to send Raju Gowda as an emissary, they said. 																								Jayalalithaa said she would consult the issues involved with legal experts.

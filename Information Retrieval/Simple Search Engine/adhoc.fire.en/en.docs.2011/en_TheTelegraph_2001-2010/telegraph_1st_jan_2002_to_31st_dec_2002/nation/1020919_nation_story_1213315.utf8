A government spokesperson said the Cabinet deferred a decision on raising the ceiling on foreign direct investment in sectors like telecom, insurance and civil aviation.				 																																																	The proposal to raise the sectoral FDI caps and a VRS scheme for ONGC came up for discussion at the Cabinet meeting but they will be brought back for re-consideration, the spokesperson said.				 																																																	The Institute of Actuaries is proposed to be established on the same lines as the apex bodies for chartered accountants, cost and works accountants and company secretaries, established through respective Acts.

The project will provide 1020 MW peaking power to the Eastern Grid of India.				 																India, Pak defence expenses high				 																																																	 islamabad (PTI): India and Pakistan were the two major defence spenders in Asia and it was their long-range missile delivery systems which were responsible for preventing the two countries from going to war, defence experts have said.				 																																																	The military expenditures of the two nations accounted for 75 and 17 per cent respectively of the total expenditure in South Asia between 1992 and 2000, defence experts said at a seminar organised by the Pakistan defence ministry in Karachi on Tuesday. 				 																																																	They also pointed out that though military expenditure around the world had shrunk significantly between 1992 and 2000, defence spending in the Asian region had increased by more than 15 per cent for the same period.				 																																																	The continuous increase of military expenditure in Asia was mainly contributed by the increase in South Asia, though expenditure in East Asia increased more slowly and reduced sharply in Oceanic countries, Dr Sang-jin Lee of South Korea said at the seminar.				 																																																	Some seminar participants were of the opinion that the key reason which prevented war between India and Pakistan was actually the weapons of mass destruction. Had it not been the long range weapons, there may have been another 1965 or 1971 style regional war, said Haroon J. Qureshi of Pakistan. 				 																																																	The long-range delivery systems have also changed the role of strike aircraft. the reliance on deep-penetration delivery aircraft has been greatly reduced, he added.

There was a close link between Gandhi and accused Ottavio Quattrocchi and inference could be drawn about his (Gandhis) involvement, CBI counsel N. Natrajan said.

		 Saturday, November 09, 2002 				 Sati village aid ban challenged
																								Jabalpur, Nov. 8 (PTI): Madhya Pradesh High Court has admitted a public interest petition challenging the state governments order to stop aid and other development grants to Patna-Timoli village, where a 65-year-old woman allegedly committed sati recently.																								The petition  filed by Anandilal Chaurasia and Shankar Prasad Chaurasia  challenged the August 25 Cabinet order stopping aid and other grants as a punitive measure following Kuttu Bais sati on August 6.																								After a preliminary hearing of the petition, the court issued notices to all the three respondents, including the state government, asking them to file their replies within six weeks.																								The court also listed the petition on November 28 to consider whether an interim stay could be granted restraining the operation of the order.																								Alleging that the governments order was arbitrary, excessive and one-sided, the petitioners claimed that all development works in the village will be stopped following the order imposed as a punishment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, November 14, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Markers on drugs for animal extracts 				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): Upholding the citizens right to information under the Constitution, Delhi High Court has ruled that all cosmetic products and non-life saving drugs (NLSD) with animal extracts must indicate the presence of these extracts clearly.				 																																																	Since the government has already laid down rules for compulsorily indicating on every packed food item the presence of animal extracts, a bench of Justices Anil Dev Singh and Mukul Mudgal said the same principle would apply to NLSDs as well as all cosmetic products.				 																																																	Directing that a specifically designed red mark be inscribed on every cosmetic product which has animal extracts, the court said a similar green mark should be put on NLSDs.				 																																																	However, the court also added that life-saving drugs would be out of the purview of its order, considering the fact that a more important question of saving the life of a person was involved.				 																																																	The order came on a public interest litigation filed by Ozair Hussain, who had sought a directive to the government to frame guidelines on indicating the presence of animal extracts on the packages of food items, cosmetics and drugs to protect the interests of vegetarians, who have the fundamental right to know about the nature of the product they are consuming.				 																																																	The court directed the director-general of health services to issue a list of life-saving drugs within two months so that they were kept out side the purview of its order.

The sources said the actor, who is staying in Nashiks Taj Residency Hotel for a shooting, left for Deolali railway station where the days shoot was scheduled. His private security personnel and bodyguard followed in another car.				 																																																	Near the station, Salmans driver applied brakes suddenly due to some obstacle on the way and a car coming from behind hit the actors vehicle.				 																																																	Salmans car, which was damaged in the collision, was later removed by a crane.				 																Accused scribe turns himself in 				 																																																	 Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): Former journalist R. Jayachandran, the fourth accused in the forged intelligence report case, surrendered on Wednesday after absconding for over a month.

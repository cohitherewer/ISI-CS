 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 20: Allaying Opposition fears that the inquiry into the Tehelka expos would be wound up, the government today announced in the Lok Sabha that it plans to continue the probe.																								The Centre will appoint a new judge to head the commission within a fortnight, parliamentary affairs minister Pramod Mahajan announced shortly before the winter session of Parliament was adjourned sine die.																								Agitated Opposition members had raised the issue yesterday in the House, alleging that the government was trying to cover up the investigation. Some even demanded a joint parliamentary committee probe. Deputy Speaker P.M. Sayeed had assured the House that law minister Jana Krishnamurti would make a statement on Friday. 																								Mahajan today apologised to the House on behalf of Krishnamurti, saying he was hospitalised yesterday and, therefore, could not make the statement. 																								The governments intention is to continue with the inquiry commission on the Tehelka expos. The government in the next fortnight will appoint a new judge to continue the probe, Mahajan said.

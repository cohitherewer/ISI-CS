(AFP)																								Srinagar, Nov. 1 (PTI): A militant accused of kidnapping the daughter of Jammu and Kashmir chief minister-designate Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was released on bail today after spending 12 years in jail.																								Showkat Bakshi, 35, was produced before a sessions court that granted him bail. Bakshi was arrested on April 8, 1990, here. 																								He was charged by police with kidnapping Rubaiya Sayeed, the daughter of Mufti, the then Union home minister. Rubaiya is a doctor.																								The release of the militant, who was also charged with hatching a conspiracy and carrying out an attack on Indian Air Force officials that killed five, came a day before the Peoples Democratic Party chief takes over as chief minister.																								As a Class VIII student, Bakshi was involved in digging up the cricket pitch in 1987 during a West Indies-India one day international match. 																								Mushtaq-ul-Islam, another accused in the abduction case who is also in jail for the last 12 years, was sent to 14 more days in judicial custody. His bail application will be heard on November 16.

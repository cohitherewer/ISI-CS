		 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 Nalco selloff protest in Delhi
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Nov. 19: The Orissa PCC is planning to stage a demonstration in front of Parliament on Friday against the Centres decision to privatise Nalco. 																								PCC president Sarat Patnaik today said there was no reason to privatise a company that had been making an average annual profit of Rs 500 crore. He said PCC members, legislators and MPs would meet Sonia Gandhi to urge her to take up the matter with the Centre.																								Former chief minister Giridhar Gamang yesterday filed an 86-page petition in the Orissa High Court, seeking steps to prevent the privatisation of Nalco. Off-loading of Nalco shares is illegal, arbitrary, malafide and unconstitutional, he said.																								Two other Congress leaders had filed a similar petition recently. On November 8, students of about half-a-dozen colleges of Cuttack had boycotted classes in protest against the move to sell off the aluminium major. Students of Ravenshaw College, Stewart Science College, Sailobala Womens College, JKBK College, Indira Gandhi Womens College and Christ College were among those who boycotted classes.																								Six days earlier, students from Dhenkanal, Angul and Talcher had blocked rail and road traffic in protest against the selloff.

Ramamurthy was his usual jovial self and chatting with friends this afternoon before suddenly complaining of chest pain, family sources said. He breathed his last around 5 pm. 				 																																																	Vazhapadi, as he was popularly known, is survived by his wife, two sons and daughter. 				 																																																	Ramamurthys body will be kept at Sathyamurthy Bhavan, the Congress headquarters here, tomorrow morning before being taken to his residence.				 																																																	rime Minister A.B. Vajpayee said Ramamurthy had worked hard throughout his life towards ameliorating the condition of the working class. In her condolence message, Sonia Gandhi said: He was one of the stalwarts in Tamil Nadu politics and was extremely popular among his followers and friends. 				 																																																	Ramamurthy was labour minister in the Narasimha Rao ministry in 1991, but resigned just 39 days later over the Cauvery issue. He subsequently quit the Congress and floated the Tamizhaga Rajiv Congress in 1995. 				 																																																	Ramamurthy was again catapulted to the Union Cabinet in 1998 when he became the petroleum minister in the Vajpayee government.				 																Suicide rate rising in Kerala 				 																																																	THIRUVANANTHAPURAM (PTI): Faced with the problems of a transitional society, the suicide rate in Kerala is on the rise touching 31.5 per lakh a year against the national average of around 10 per lakh.				 																																																	Mental health experts and social scientists say growing incompatibility between income and needs, break-up of joint families, unchecked alcoholism and drug abuse are major factors contributing to the death wish gripping the countrys most literate state.				 																																																	Disparity between income and needs is the main factor that drives people to kill themselves in most cases, said Suraraj Mony, secretary of the State Mental Health Authority. 				 																																																	The authority figures show that in 1990s, suicide rate in Kerala stood at 27.1 per lakh a year against the national average of 9.2. Besides, cases of family suicide are also on the rise with 59 cases reported in 2000 alone. 				 																																																	Although the progress Kerala made in health education and service sectors are remarkable, its reflection is missing on the economic front. Steadily dwindling industrial investment and an ever-shrinking agricultural base over the last three decades had a telling impact on the income profile of the state.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 7: A Toyota Land Cruiser, bearing a Parliament car park sticker in the name of Rajya Sabha legislator D.P. Yadav, hit and ran twice in 20 minutes last night, injuring four persons.																								Police said the Land Cruiser  DL-5CB 3455  first knocked down a motorcyclist in the Kailash Nagar area of South Delhi. Twenty minutes later, it banged into an auto-rickshaw ferrying a 53-year-old British national and his sister-in-law.																								The police have not been able to establish whether Yadav  the controversial MP from west Uttar Pradesh whose son is facing trial in a criminal case  owns the Land Cruiser or whether he was in the vehicle when the mishaps took place.																								The Land Cruiser is registered in the name of one Ibrahim Abdul Salem, allegedly a resident of A3/90 of Yamuna Vihar. But the police have found on verification that no person by that name exists.																								The car hit Sunil Kumar Bhadurias motorcycle around 9.30 pm near the government Senior Secondary School in Kailashnagar and sped away. Bhaduria escaped with minor injuries.																								Around 9.50, the vehicle banged into an auto-rickshaw DL1-RF-7364  at a red light on Maharishi Raman Marg in New Delhi, the police said. Under the impact of the crash, driver Daya Nand Pandey, British national Andrew James and his sister-in-law were thrown out of the auto-rickshaw. Pandey was hurt in his head and eyes. James has been admitted to the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences with a fractured right leg.																								Though the police claim that a police control room van chased and intercepted the car at Aurangzeb Lane, James told reporters the driver had abandoned the vehicle and fled. The police seized the vehicle from the spot after a motorcyclist informed the control room, he alleged.																								James  who was going to the market  has been in India for the last six years and is married to a Nashik-based Kendriya Vidyalaya teacher. He had come to Delhi to celebrate Id-ul-Fitr and was staying at his in-laws place in Defence Colony, a posh South Delhi residential area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, December 27, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Relatives blamed for most rapes				 																																																	 new delhi: Delhi police said relatives of victims were involved in 90 per cent of rape cases.				 																																																	Almost all eve teasers were well-educated married men, said Delhi police commissioner R.S. Gupta at an annual press conference, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	A study of rapes revealed that only 10 per cent of them were committed by strangers.				 																																																	Interestingly, no college student was involved in eve-teasing, the commissioner said.				 																																																	We found an unusual trend during the case study. In the 381 cases of eve teasing registered since August 15 this year, those involved were found (to be) well educated, well-employed and married persons, Gupta said.				 																																																	He also claimed Delhi to be among the safest capitals for women, where crime had declined due to pro-active policing, preventive measures, professional investigation and public participation.				 																																																	Gupta said the number of heinous crimes had come down by 11 per cent. Non-heinous crimes and cases under the Indian Penal Code also declined by 9 per cent each.				 																																																	This year, only 383 cases of rape were recorded, as against 384 last year. Police nabbed 41 militants, including five Pakistani nationals and two Bangladeshis.				 																Court rap for medical council				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has rapped the Medical Council of India and the Directorate General of Medical Education of Uttar Pradesh for playing with the career of 32 aspiring doctors despite its orders to admit them in other colleges after closure of their institution.				 																																																	These students were admitted in Azamgarh Medical College after passing the pre-medical entrance test. 				 																																																	However, a year later, the council ordered the closure of the college noticing some deficiency in its infrastructure.				 																																																	Left in the lurch, the students approached the apex court, which directed the council and the directorate to accommodate them in appropriate institutions. 				 																																																	However, they did not honour the courts order. Both the medical council and the directorate took the plea that they were helpless as no institution was allowed to take students over and above the annual allotment of seats.				 																																																	 bench of Justice S. Rajendra Babu and Justice P. Venkatarama Reddi said: The authorities are squarely to be blamed in this matter in not having ascertained the position before allocating the students to different colleges. We gave enough time to both the council and the directorate general of medical education of Uttar Pradesh to work out an appropriate solution in this regard. They have failed to do so.				 																Abusive mail to Modi				 																																																	 ahmedabad (PTI): Apparently failing to get college admission in medical science, a teenager sent an abusive email to Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi for the states defective education system.				 																																																	Director-general of police K. Chakravarthy said the teenager, whose has been identified, sent an email to Modi complaining about the education system. The police chief, however, did not disclose the name of the boy and added that the anti-terrorist squad was interrogating him.

Clash claims 1				 																																																	 bhopal (PTI): One person was killed and three injured in a clash in Jamuniya village in Raisen district over the raising of a wall adjacent to a Jain temple, police said.

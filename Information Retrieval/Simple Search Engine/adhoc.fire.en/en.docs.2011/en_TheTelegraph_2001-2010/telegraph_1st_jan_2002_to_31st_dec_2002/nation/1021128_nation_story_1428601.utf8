		 Thursday, November 28, 2002 				 House votes in right to education
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 27: In a rare show of solidarity, Lok Sabha members cutting across party lines closed ranks and unanimously voted in favour of the 93rd Constitution Amendment Bill, making education a fundamental right.																								Speaking in one voice, MPs from almost all political parties welcomed the legislation as a step towards the universalisation of elementary education.																								The Rajya Sabha has already passed the Bill, which seeks to provide free and compulsory education to all children aged between six and 14 within the next 10 years and childcare support to those below six years.																								The financial burden of such a move, estimated at an annual Rs 9,800 crore, will be shared by the Centre and the states. It will be the obligation of parents to provide opportunities of education to their children, the Bill states, prompting a section of educationists to mobilise some MPs to vote against the Bill because of certain drawbacks in it.																								Those opposed to the legislation also wanted the government to lower the age limit of children who would benefit from the right to free and compulsory education to include all children in the 0-14 age group. The other apprehension they expressed was with regard to the provision that made it obligatory for parents to send their children to school.																								They also protested against the allocation of financial resources, saying it was inadequate for the task at hand.																								The Centre, however, assured that parents unable to put their children in schools because of socio-economic handicaps would not be penalised.																								Human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi has said that the Bill will give the Centre the legal backing it requires to make the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a policy for the universalisation of education, a success.

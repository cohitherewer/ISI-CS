		 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Basu mass contact sting
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Nov. 20: Jyoti Basu today expressed concern that mass contact of the CPM workers is on the decline nowadays. 																								Our workers are increasingly going to the people only when an election happens to be round the corner. This is not the manner in which a party like ours, which works in the interest of common men and women, should carry out its public relations exercises, Basu said. 																								The former chief minister was speaking at the partys Calcutta district office at a meeting organised in memory of former labour minister Shanti Ranjan Ghatak, womens leader Supriya Acharya and former CPM state committee member and Citu activist Pran Krishna Chowdhury. Party state secretary Anil Biswas was also present at the meeting. 																								Recalling the sacrifices of leaders like Ghatak, Acharya and Chowdhury, he said mass contact was better maintained in the past because the party was going through a critical phase of struggle and mass mobilisation.																								Many of our dedicated workers went underground when the undivided CPI was banned by the government. Leaders like Supriya Acharya donated their golden ornaments to the cause of our party. Shanti Ghatak led an exemplary life and never for a moment allowed bourgeois vices to adversely affect his spartan living. As communists, we should be austere and insist on plain living and high thinking. The ordinary people, our real strength, will find it more and more difficult to identify with our agenda otherwise, Basu cautioned.																								Meanwhile, Arun Chowdhury, editorial member of Desh Hitoysee and leader of the library movement died in Calcutta on Wednesday. senior party leaders including Jyoti Basu and chief minister Buddhadev Bhattacharya mourned the death of Chowdhury.																								Ends.

																								New Delhi, Aug. 25 (PTI): Delhi High Court has issued a showcause notice to the Centre on a writ petition alleging victimisation and arbitrary and unlawful running of the Centre for Policy Research (CPR).																								Notices have also been sent to the CPR and the Indian Council for Social Science Research. The petition has been filed by Brahma Chellaney, strategic expert and senior-most professor at the centre.																								Justice Vijender Jain, while issuing the notices, also restrained the CPR from terminating Chellaneys services.																								Chellaney alleged that some persons on the centres governing board loyal to its former president Vishwanath A. Pai Panandiker had captured the public institution and have made it into their private empire.																								Alleging mismanagement, the petition named P.K. Dave, chairman of the executive committee, and alleged that he was heading the centres unofficial power structure.																								The high court had in January declared illegal Panandikers continuance in office beyond the age of superannuation and cancelled his order terminating Chellaneys services.																								Alleging that efforts were on to circumvent the high courts decision, the petition filed by counsel Manmohan said the members on the CPRs governing board had recently divested institutional members of their voting rights in society meetings.																								This was to ensure that there is no challenge to their stranglehold over the institution, Chellaney said. He appealed for an order to implement the governments grant-in-aid rules.																								Chellaney also sought a court directive to the Comptroller and Auditor General to scan the CPRs accounts.

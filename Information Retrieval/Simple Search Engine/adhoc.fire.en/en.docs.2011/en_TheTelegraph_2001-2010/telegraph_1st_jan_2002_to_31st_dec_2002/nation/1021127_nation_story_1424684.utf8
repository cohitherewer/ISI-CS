 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: Senior CPM parliamentarian Somnath Chatterjee is convening a meeting of Opposition parties on Thursday to step up attack on the BJP both in and outside Parliament. 																								We feel the Opposition should co-ordinate its strategy to keep the focus sharp on the series of developments  from the BJPs efforts to scuttle the Tehelka probe to the attack on the Raghunath temple in Jammu and the Gujarat elections, Chatterjee said at a news conference today. 																								Pointing to the recent exchanges between the Congress, the main Opposition party, and the Samajwadi Party, Chatterjee said: We should not waste our energies trying to attack each other. Instead, we should mount pressure on the BJP.																								This is not the first time that Chatterjee is convening a meeting of the Opposition parties. He began the exercise especially with the aim of bringing together the Congress and the Samajwadi when they were striking different stances on key issues on the floor of the House.

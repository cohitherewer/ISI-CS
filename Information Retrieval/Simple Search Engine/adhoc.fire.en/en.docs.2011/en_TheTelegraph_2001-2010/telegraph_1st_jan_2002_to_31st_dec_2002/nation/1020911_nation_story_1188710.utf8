		 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 Power cuts hit hospital
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Gaya, Sept. 10: Over 40 injured passengers of Rajdhani Express have been admitted at Gaya Medical College and 22 at the railway hospital.																								Seventy-two were taken to the district hospital in Aurangabad and two to the military hospital. Ten patients have been moved to private nursing homes by their relatives.																								The corridor of the medical college has been converted to a temporary ward to accommodate the injured. However, patients and relatives at Gaya Medical College complained that treatment has been hampered due to frequent power cuts.																								Hospital authorities conceded that patients are having a hard time. We are doing our best to treat patients promptly. Most injuries we have seen so far are of orthopaedic nature. Many of them have suffered head injuries or collar-bone fractures, said superintendent Srikant Prasad Singh.																								Fearing unrest, police have been deployed in large numbers on the medical college premises. As the Aurangabad hospital is not equipped to conduct post-mortem of all victims, some bodies were sent to other hospitals.

		 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 Badal rallies flock for war
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, Nov. 26: Shiromani Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal today called upon all Punjabis to join tomorrows launch of the decisive struggle against the government led by Amarinder Singh.																								Akali supporters will kick off their fight against the Congress dispensation in Punjab with a jail bharo agitation and Badal will lead his men in courting arrest. The Akali activists will block roads and have also threatened to stop trains across the state. 																								The chief minister has vowed that he will not allow anyone to disturb law and order. 																								But Badal was bent on taking the warpath against the corrupt government. Every government office reeks with bribery and corruption of all kinds, making a mockery of the tall claims of transparent administration made by the chief minister. His own name is yet to be cleared in the disappearance of Rs 2 crore from (former Punjab Public Service Commission chairman) Ravinder Pal Singh Sidhus lockers. But he has become so drunk with power that he does not deem it necessary to tell the people of Punjab what actually transpired and why he was forced to transfer all the honest officers who were initially responsible for unearthing the recruitment scandal, Badal said.																								The former chief minister called his fight the decisive war against the anti-people government, which has already played havoc with the socio-economic and religious fabric of the state. 																								We challenge this government to name even one section, other than criminals, land-grabbers, power-brokers and self-seekers, happy with the present set-up. The Shiromani Akali Dal deems it its moral obligation to help the Punjabis get rid of this structure of injustice and tyranny, Badal said. 																								He blasted Amarinder for bringing disgrace to the office of the chief minister by indulging in unethical practices. The whole state is rife with reports of how the chief minister and a handful of self-seekers around him have treated the chief ministers office  as an instrument of fulfilment of greed, revenge and personal and immoral pursuits. Even independent reports indicate that there is not a single individual whose hands are not soaked in corruption, Badal said.

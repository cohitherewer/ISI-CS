		 Saturday, November 09, 2002 				 Brand Madhuri to mom to be
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Madhuri Dixit at the product launch in Mumbai. (Reuters)																								Mumbai, Nov. 8: Madhuri Dixit the brand has got a new lease of life.																								At a glittering event last night, where she unveiled a range of herbal beauty products named after her, the actress agreed that she had turned into a new brand in her latest avatar, mom to be. The glow on her skin, which seems to be the direct by-product of her new stage in life, has rubbed off on the brand she is endorsing, and everyone is aware of it, including the actress.																								Though reporters were asked not to ask personal questions, the event was like a baby shower in media glare. In answer to a query, a glowing Madhuri, resplendent in a white sequinned lehenga-kurta, said: Yes, as mom to be, I have become a new brand. Along with her range of products, Beauty Secrets by Madhuri, she had a message for all would-be mothers: take good care of your health.																								Since the announcement of her pregnancy this week, there has been a media blitzkrieg with a flood of articles on Madhuri, in which the actress, who flew down from the US this week, speaks of the glory and fulfilment of impending motherhood. This underlines the fact that if the ambassador is good, no aspect of her life need be untouched to promote the brand, media watchers feel.																								Organisers denied that the event, attended by M.F. Husain, Govinda, Smita Thackeray, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Isha Koppikar, Adnan Sami and a host of other Bollywood personalities, was made to coincide with the announcement of the actress pregnancy. She has been the brand ambassador for over two years and the national launch of the beauty products was planned from before, said an Emami spokesperson.																								But the timing of the launch did the brand no harm, with everyone talking only about the new turn in Madhuris life.																								With this range of products, Madhuri is the brand herself, because they have been named after her. But yesterday, she was looking so beautiful, different from before. Even my wife Sharon Prabhakar commented on how beautiful she looked, said advertising consultant Alyque Padamsee, who compered the show. He added that this brought another dimension to Madhuri the brand.																								Another advertising expert, Prahlad Kakkar, who was also present on the occasion, said this was the right moment to start the re-packaging of Madhuri into a different brand. Madhuri has the attention of a huge number of middle-class women in the country who aspire to be like her. From now on, she can evolve herself into the confidante/mother kind of person for her audience and extend her brand value, said Kakkar.																								With her pregnancy, she is looking beautiful like never before. At this stage, all she needs is a good manager who can transform her like the way Amitabh Bachchan was turned into a different brand for KBC, he added.																								In her speech, however, Madhuri focussed on her product range, saying she has put in her own experience into the making of the beauty products, having culled different ingredients from different parts of the planet: like Ginkgo, a 5000-year-old wonder herb from China and Charmomile, a herb from Germany.

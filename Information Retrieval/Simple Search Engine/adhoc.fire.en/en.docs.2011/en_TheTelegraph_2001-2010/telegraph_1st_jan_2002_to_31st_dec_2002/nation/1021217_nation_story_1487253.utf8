		 Tuesday, December 17, 2002 				 Mulayam to lead cane crusade
 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, Dec. 16: Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav will lead his partys protest march tomorrow to Munderva (Basti) where three cane growers were killed in police firing last week during a demonstration by farmers outside a sugar mill.																								The Uttar Pradesh government is determined to stop Mulayam from going to Basti, but the Samajwadi today indicated that its workers would not take the arrest of their leader lying down. The BSP-BJP government in Uttar Pradesh already stands exposed and we are all set to launch a state-wide farmers agitation against it, party MP and Mulayams son, Akhilesh Yadav, said.																								The MP lashed out at the Mayavati government for ignoring the interests of sugarcane farmers and urged the government to ensure that cane growers have a share in the profit made by sugar mills from the sale of molasses. Akhilesh Yadav said it was time the government formulated a policy to provide cane growers with a share in the profits.																								The profits are a thousand times more than what the farmers get from the sale of sugarcane, pointed out the Samajwadi leader. 																								If a new policy is not formulated, the farmers should seek back the molasses from the mills after the crushing and production of sugar, he said. It is time the common farmer took note of the money earned from the sale of by-products.

		 Wednesday, October 30, 2002 				 Sceptic Hizb greets Mufti
																								Srinagar, Oct. 29 (PTI): Pro-Pakistan militant outfit Hizb-ul Mujahideen today termed the promises of would-be Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed to wind up Special Operations Group and not to implement the Prevention of Terrorism Act as seemingly heart-warming, but insisted that these would not help resolve the basic problem.																								Mufti is being projected as a well wisher and sympathiser of Kashmiris and that his ascent to power would bring some relief to the people through non-implementation of (the) Pota and winding up of (the) Sog, Hizbs operational commander Saiful Islam said in a statement faxed to the local Nafa News Agency.																								Though these steps seem to be heart-warming, these do not constitute the solution to the basic problem, Islam said.																								The solution to the Kashmir problem was in implementation of the UN resolutions or tripartite talks between India, Pakistan and Kashmiris, he said. Otherwise, this government would suffer the same fate as that of Farooq Abdullah government.																								The commander, however, expressed doubts over Muftis will to fulfil his promises, saying: He has not started a struggle for the end of the Pota and release of political prisoners. People of the state are well-versed with his deeds since the time he was Union home minister, when innocent killings were a common thing.

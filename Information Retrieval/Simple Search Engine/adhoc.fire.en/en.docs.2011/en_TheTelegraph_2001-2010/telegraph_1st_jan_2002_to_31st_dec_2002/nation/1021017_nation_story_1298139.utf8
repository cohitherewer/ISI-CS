		 Thursday, October 17, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Salman denied bail again				 																																																	 Mumbai: Salman Khan was denied bail for the third time in a row on Wednesday, reports our correspondent.				 																																																	He was told by sessions judge P.V. Bavkar that police have made out a prima facie case against him in the hit-and-run accident and that his bail plea had to be dismissed in the interest of the case. Salman had on October 13 applied for bail at the sessions court after metropolitan magistrate S.Y. Shisode ruled that it was outside his jurisdiction to grant it. 				 																																																	The Bollywood star has been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 (II) of the IPC, a non-bailable offence that comes with 10 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine or both.				 																																																	The sessions court said investigations were still incomplete and that the actor  because of his status and wealth  may tamper with evidence by influencing the witnesses undergoing treatment at a city hospital. Salman has been remanded in judicial custody till October 21.				 																																																	Incidentally, the prosecution had not opposed Salmans bail at the metropolitan court and said that the police custody, too, wasnt necessary and it was up to the sessions court to grant him bail. Today, however, the prosecution argued that investigations were still on and until the chargesheet was filed, the actor should not be granted bail.				 																																																	To the defences argument that Salman was involved in an accident that fell under Section 304 A, causing death by negligence, a bailable offence, the prosecution said he had full knowledge as defined in Section 304 (II). Prosecutor R.V. Kini asserted that even Salmans police bodyguard, Ravinder Patil, had cautioned him not to drive as he was under the influence of liquor.

		 Monday, October 21, 2002 				 Austerity with natural light
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chandigarh, Oct. 20: The Haryana government has directed all its administrative secretaries, chairmen and managing directors of boards and corporations to examine the electricity needs of their offices and identify areas where natural light can be used.																								While stating this here today, a spokesman of the non-conventional energy sources said they have been asked to motivate the employees to depend more on daylight. 																								They were directed to install circuit switches to cut off electricity as soon as the office was closed and ensure inspection of electrical wiring for insulation failures to prevent arcs or sparks through loose contacts.																								He said they have also been asked to introduce a system of switching off lights and fans, when they need not be used. 																								The departments were advised to nominate a person to ensure switching off water coolers and air conditioners, when not in use and to curtail their operating hours by at least one hour each in the morning and evening. 																								The canteens should use gas or kerosene stoves instead of electric heaters or kettles. The staff should be educated to be careful about gas and electricity wastage as an area of management concern. 																								Sun-films should be used to cut down insulation losses while planning for exterior glazing.																								While constructing government buildings, special care should be taken to make use of natural energy to the maximum and avoid dependence on conventional sources of energy. The building designs should conform to energy efficiency designs.																								The spokesman said all departments, boards and corporations have already been directed to achieve 30 per cent reduction in the present consumption level of electricity in their organisations in the next two years. The departments should ensure that suitable measures were initiated to achieve the target of 30 per cent reduction in energy consumption, 15 per cent in the current year and another 15 per cent during the next financial year.																								He said the departments were suggested to take several other measures, including replacement of conventional bulbs with fluorescent tubes or compact fluorescent lamps in a phased manner, replacement of existing resistance controlled electric fan regulators with electronic regulators, placement of separate single control switch near the door of each room or hall for switching off all the electrical gadgets, installing of solar water heating systems for hot water requirement in all government buildings, housing complexes, jail barracks and canteens. They have also been asked to install community-type solar cookers for meeting the cooking needs in large canteens, community centres and kitchens.																								He said the departments had been advised that the energy conservation measures should be planned for short, medium and long terms. Short-term measures included modification in operation and maintenance procedures that required little or no investment and could be implemented immediately. Medium to long-term measures included extensive modifications and retrofitting that might entail investment. Typical energy conservation measures could be grouped into housekeeping and operational improvements, thermal system improvements, electrical system improvements, waste heat recovery and modification or retrofitting.

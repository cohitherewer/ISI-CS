The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Cong washes hands of liar
																								Coimbatore, Sept. 1 (PTI): Declining to join issue with Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa over her clarification on support to the Congress, state president E.V.K.S. Elangovan today said his party did not want to reply to each and every remark made by a person who is hellbent on lying.																								The letter (given by the ADMK in 1999 to the then President) was clear on the support to the Congress and there was no point in replying to a person who is hellbent on lying and playing with words, he said.																								Congressmen, who drove out the British from India, and for that matter the nation as a whole, need not learn English and grammar from her, he added.																								Asked why the Tamil Nadu chief minster chose to raise the issue of Sonias foreign origin at this juncture, Elangovan said: It is very obvious. She wants to please the Delhi bosses and keep them in good esteem, to save her from corruption cases, particularly the Tansi-related case.																								Asked if this would not amount to contempt and casting aspersions on the judiciary, the state president said that even questioning her foreign origin would amount to the same.																								On former Karnataka minister Nagappas abduction, he said without making it a prestige issue, both Tamil Nadu and Karnataka governments should make joint efforts to rescue him and also arrest forest brigand Veerappan.																								On the statement made by the ADMK chief linking DMK chief M. Karunanidhi and former minister Durai Murugan to Veerappan, he said: She is dreaming about the links.																								On his challenge to Jayalalithaa to face the elections by dissolving the Assembly, the state unit chief said: she is not ready to accept it.																								On Cauvery, he said: A mere walkout would not solve the problem. Concerned officials and ministers should sit across the table and discuss the statistics and the quantum of water released to get a clear picture. 																								When asked about the Congress workers burning the effigies of Jayalalithaa, Elangovan said the party had not asked the workers to protest. They were only showing their anger over the remarks made against their party supremo, he added.																								To a question about the Congress after the merger of the Tamil Maanila Congress, Elangovan said the party had become stronger and gained confidence to fulfill its goal of bringing back the Kamaraj (Congress) rule.																								Asked about factionalism, he quipped: There is only one Congress, that of Sonia.

		 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 Advani concern on baby deaths
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 3: Expressing concern over the death of 30 children in a Bengal hospital in the last one week, L.K. Advani said he would ask the Union health ministry to look into the matter while Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi demanded that the chief minister take the charge of the portfolio and re-organise the health administration.																								Quoting Advani, Trinamul Congress leader Sudip Bandopadhyay said the deputy Prime Minister was shocked and perturbed when he saw the newspaper reports.																								Bandopadhyay, who had a 30-minute meeting with Advani, said that though it is a state subject, he took the matter with him because the state government was trying to white wash the deaths of children. Advani, he said, assured that he would direct the health ministry to get details about the happenings in B.C.Roy memorial hospital.																								The Trinamul MP said the deaths had taken place due to gross negligence on the part of government, mainly due to shortage of oxygen cylinders in the hospital and appealed to Advani for immediate intervention of the Centre.

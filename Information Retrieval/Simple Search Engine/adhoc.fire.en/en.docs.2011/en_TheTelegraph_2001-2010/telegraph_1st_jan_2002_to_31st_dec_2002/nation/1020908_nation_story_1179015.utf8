		 Sunday, September 08, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Salman plea to quash charges				 																																																	 Jodhpur (pti): Salman Khan has petitioned Rajasthan High Court to quash the chargesheet against him for poaching protected wild animals.				 																																																	Filing a special petition in the court here on Friday, Khan said the judicial magistrate had erred in taking cognizance of the chargesheet because the same was not submitted under a section of the Wildlife Protection Act.				 																																																	Police had filed only the final report under a Section of the IPC and, as such, the chargesheet should be quashed, Khans counsel argued before Justice Harbans Lal.				 																																																	The government counsel, however, contended that since charges under the Wildlife Protection Act and the Arms Act had already been framed against the accused in different cases, it was not necessary to place before the lower court a separate report under a Section of the Wildlife Protection Act and there was nothing objectionable in submitting a police report.				 																																																	Since examination of witnesses has already begun in two other cases of poaching, a judicial intervention was not desirable now, he added. The next hearing of the case has been fixed for September 17.				 																Police hunt for constables body				 																																																	 hyderabad: Police forces of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have launched combined operations to trace the body of the constable who was killed by the Peoples War Group, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Constable Chittibabu was kidnapped from Anakapally and later killed by the Naxalites after a mock trial last week. He is the second policeman killed by the Naxalites, whose body is yet to be found. Three years ago, sub-inspector S.V. Rama Rao was killed by the PWG under the Cherla police station area of Khammam district.				 																																																	Chittibabus killing has created panic in the state police, with the majority of tribal policemen wanting to quit. The PWG has already issued an ultimatum to tribals to give up the police jobs.				 																																																	Chittibabu was punished according to tribal laws. The tribal praja court had indicted him, PWG leader Chalapathui had said recently in a statement.				 																																																	Following the constables murder, the police forces of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh launched combined combing operations to snuff out the Naxalites. The Andhra government also opened channels for talks with the PWG. The government, however, does not favour a ceasefire before the talks.				 																2000 teachers in custody 				 																																																	 Chennai (pti): Over 2,000 teachers of primary schools in Tamil Nadu were taken into custody on Saturday for violating regulatory orders in effect in the city.

He drew loud support from the Opposition benches, with several CPM, CPI, Congress and RJD members trying to shout down Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Najma Heptullah.				 																																																	She was trying to stop Nirupam from elaborating on the issue and taking swipes at the Centres disinvestment policy.				 																																																	Heptullah stood her ground, saying that disinvestment had already been discussed in the House, so the same issue could not be raised in the Rajya Sabha after question hour.				 																																																	The Oppositions protests failed to move Heptullah, who insisted that Shourie need not answer Nirupam.				 																																																	Shourie sat through the din silently, apparently in no mood to answer the Shiv Sena MP.				 																																																	With Heptullah putting up a determined defence of Shourie, Nirupam had to back down. Finally, the Left members walked out, but Nirupam and the Congress MPs stayed put. Nirupam asked when the privilege notice against Shourie would come up for discussion. You will be informed when this will come up, Heptullah said.

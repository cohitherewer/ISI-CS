 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Rakhee																								Mumbai, Dec. 10: The mysterious death of a Gladrags Mega Model has shaken the modelling circuit here. Although police are saying that prime facie, it seems to be suicide, there are whispers that foul play cannot be denied. 																								Gladrags Mega Model, 2002, Rakhee Choudhari was found dead in her Oshiwara house last week. Rakhee, 23, police officials said, was found hanging from a nylon rope attached to the ceiling fan in her room. 																								The body of the model was found on Saturday evening by her sister, Ruchi, when she came calling as her sibling had not communicated with her for the last few days. Ruchi and her husband had broken open the door to Rakhees flat with the help of a locksmith. Primary investigations have shown that the model may have killed herself on Wednesday or Thursday as there was a strong smell of decomposition in the house.																								Rakhees parents, who separated some months ago, cremated her on Sunday after reaching here from Bangalore. Rakhee had shifted to Mumbai in August.																								None of the models neighbours had any clue to what had happened. Residents of her Yamuna Nagar apartment told the police that being a model, Rakhee kept erratic hours and nobody suspected anything when her house remained locked for three-four days. In fact, most of her neighbours claimed they didnt know her at all. 																								After winning the Gladrags competition, Rakhee had gone to Germany to represent India in the Miss Intercontinental contest. She came fourth.																								Commenting on the death, Maureen Wadia, managing editor of Gladrags, said the model had been very depressed because her parents separated. She added that Rahkee had been very attached to her mother. Rakhee, those close to her said, had even started putting on weight because of the depression. 																								Wadia, who said Rakhee had a very bright career ahead in modelling, added that she would have been on her way to Malaysia towards the end of this month for another beauty pageant. Her contract with Gladrags had also been extended by another year. 																								Rakhee got in touch with me last Tuesday, but when I tried getting back to her regarding an assignment, her mobile was switched off. On Sunday, I heard that she had committed suicide, she said. 																								Police said investigations had been initiated on the premise that it was a suicide.

		 Thursday, October 24, 2002 				 Confession claim in Dum Dum murder case
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 23: Investigators probing the murder of South Dum Dum municipality chairman Sailen Das have sought to build back their case by citing the confession of an alleged conspirator.																								Police said Bachchan Singh, who was arrested yesterday, had corroborated their claim on the involvement of Sudhir Bhattacharya, a former CPM leader and an erstwhile chairman of the municipality.																								Bhattacharya was arrested earlier on charges of masterminding the murder. But a court had granted him bail after raising several questions about the charges levelled by the police. He could not be contacted today for comments.																								The police said Singh, who was arrested from Baguiati, gave a blow-by-blow account of the conspiracy that was hatched before Das was gunned down.																								Das was shot dead when he stepped out of his house on the morning of August 13 last year. Two men shot him from point-blank range and escaped. The two-wheeler they left behind was the only clue that helped the police track down the suspects.																								Police sources who preferred anonymity quoted Singh as confessing that he was promised a permanent job in the municipality and Rs 1.5 lakh for eliminating Das.																								The police sources claimed that Singh, too, was present at the site of the crime. He was absconding for some time. We finally caught him from Jangra in Baguiati, an officer said. Only one accused, Chhottu, is still absconding.

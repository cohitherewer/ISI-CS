		 Friday, September 13, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Court guideline for job termination				 																																																	 allahabad (PTI): Allahabad High Court on Thursday ruled that the termination order of an employee cannot be passed with retrospective effect and if such an order is passed, it shall be deemed illegal.				 																																																	Justice Rakesh Tiwari gave the ruling on a writ petition filed by one D.C. Dwivedi challenging his termination of service by an order dated May 31, 1993 and June 1, 1993 with retrospective effect from January 31, 1990.				 																																																	Dwivedi contended that the termination of service order was passed wrongly as there was confusion over his date of birth and the actual retirement age. The date of birth in his promotion letter (January 15,1936) did not match the date in his service record, January 15, 1937.				 																																																	The Uttar Pradesh additional registrar (administration), cooperative societies, had passed the termination order on the basis of the report of a deputy registrar that cited Dwivedis date of birth as January 31, 1932, and said he was past 58 years.				 																																																	Setting aside the termination order, the court indicted the deputy registrar for changing the date of birth without giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. 				 																Land allotment rap on govt				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): Bombay High Court has come down heavily on the Maharashtra government for granting a plot of land to the Shankarrao Chavan Charitable Trust in a prime locality of the city at a throwaway price. The court has sought the states response on whether it is prepared to come out with a policy on such allotments.				 																																																	While hearing a petition by Bhrashtachar Nirmoolan Sanghatana on Wednesday, Justices Ajit Shah and Ranjana Desai observed that the state was expected to follow transparency in such deals and issue advertisements inviting bids for allotment of plots.				 																																																	he petition alleged that chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had gifted the 2,057 square-metre plot to the trust on a lease of Re 1 per annum though its market value was Rs 16 crore. The court said: It seems all past chief ministers are given plots. We do not say that they were not able chief ministers but questions are bound to be asked if a plot worth Rs 16 crore is given away for Re 1. 				 																																																	The bench said the trust had come into being a year ago and questioned the credentials of its trustees. Revenue minister Ashok Chavan, who allotted the land, is son of Congress leader S.B. Chavan.

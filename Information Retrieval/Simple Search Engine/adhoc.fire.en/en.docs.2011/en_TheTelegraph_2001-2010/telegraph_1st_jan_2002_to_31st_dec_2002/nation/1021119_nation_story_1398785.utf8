		 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Delhi and Danapur alert after wanted MP goes missing
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pappu Yadav 																								Patna, Nov. 18: The Rabri Devi government has filed FIRs in both Delhi and Danapur on the mysterious disappearance of two MLAs and an MP  all three arrested on criminal charges  from two hospitals in the capital where they had been sent for treatment on court orders.																								The three undertrials, including MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, were to be admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Safdarjung Hospital on November 5. 																								But Yadav was found missing during a police enquiry on November 15, while the MLAs did not report in the hospital at all.																								Yadav, facing trial for the murder of CPI(M) legislator Ajit Sarkar in Purnia, was supposed to be resting as he was officially undergoing treatment at AIIMS. 																								However, he was not there when the subdivisional police officer of Danapur, Md Hasnan, visited the hospital.																								Uttar Pradesh-based don Suraj Bhan and his sharpshooter Rajen Tiwari were wanted in connection with several crimes in Bihar. 																								They were arrested and got elected as MLAs while being detained in Beur Jail. The duo had obtained court orders to be treated at Safdarjung Hospital. 																								But a police verification report said they had not turned up.																								The Patna district administration had provided a security cover of 21 police officers for their trip to Delhi. 																								Patna senior superintendent of police Sunil Kumar has sent a report to the Bihar director general of police (DGP) R.R. Prasad. We have suspended all 21 policemen and a search has been launched to find out their whereabouts, the DGP said. 																								We have sent a DSP-rank officer to Delhi for an on-the-spot report. The DGP said if necessary, his men would seek the assistance of the Delhi police to locate the missing undertrials.																								Official sources today said, of the two FIRs filed in Delhi, one was lodged at the Defence Colony police station and another at Sarojini Nagar on November 15. 																								The FIRs were filed under Section 224 of the Indian Penal Code for absconding from custody and Section 225, against the police, for helping the three escape. 																								The FIRs were backed by a report of the medical superintendent of AIIMS, R.K. Sharma, which said Yadav used to step out of his cabin at 9 am and return only after 1.30 am. 																								However, in the case of Bhan and Tiwari, they had never reported at Safdarjung Hospital, Hasnan said in his report. 																								The disappearance of the high-profile MLAs and MP has sparked fear among senior police officers in Bihar that they might commit more crimes during their absence without leaving any evidence.																								Adding a fresh twist to the incident, Yadav has sent a fax message to newspaper houses here, saying he has gone abroad on doctors advice. 																								However, police sources said no undertrial could go abroad without court orders. Pappu Yadav is trying to mislead the police, they said.																								The three were initially lodged in Beur Jail from where they were shifted to the medical unit of the prison pleading illness. 																								They had been enjoying considerable freedom here, and there were reports of their escapades outside the prison walls, too. The jail administration, however, remained aloof about this. 																								According to insiders, the MLAs were taking advantage of former home secretary U.N. Panjiyar and the jail administration. Last month, the Bihar home department had sent a note to the jail administration about the prolonged disappearance of the MLAs and the MP from prison, asking it to step up security. New security personnel were deployed, but things failed to improve, sources said.

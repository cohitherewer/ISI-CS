		 Monday, November 18, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																CBI seeks to rope in accountants				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Central Bureau of Investigation has sent a proposal to the government for empanelling chartered accountants in cases of increasingly complex white collar crimes and other financial irregularities like money laundering, insider trading and price rigging in the capital markets.				 																																																	We have sent in a proposal to the government to allow empanelment of chartered accountants into the CBI and are awaiting a response from them, CBI director P.C. Sharma said.				 																																																	The move by the countrys premier investigating agency comes after the number of financial frauds were on the rise and there was a growing need to untangle the various finance, banking and corporate law-related issues.				 																																																	Once a nod is received from the government, the CBI is likely to sign a memorandum of understanding to this effect with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.				 																																																	An empanelment exercise of chartered accountant firms will be undertaken for this purpose so that the work given by the CBI can be allotted to these firms. 				 																																																	The CBI, after the liberalisation of economy, has to deal with many cases involving manipulations of finances and other irregularities that require certain level of skills to understand the fraud committed by an accused during transactions. 				 																Dacoits killed, forester freed				 																																																	Gwalior (PTI): Six dacoits of the Pappu Gurjar gang, including Gurjar, were killed in a police encounter near Kheli village in the district, leading to the release of a forest official held hostage by them since November 14, police said.				 																																																	Acting on a tip-off, the dacoits were surrounded near the village and the encounter took place, killing all the six dacoits. Deputy forest ranger Deepak Sharma was then released, the police said.				 																																																	The gang had on November 14 kidnapped three persons, including the officer. The dacoits later released two of them with a ransom note of Rs 1.5 lakh for Sharmas release.				 																																																	Dabra inspector Ashok Bhduria was injured in the encounter, the police said, adding that a bullet was removed from his thigh after an operation at a local hospital.				 																Uproar delays army selection				 																																																	Nashik (PTI): Police resorted to light lathicharge to contain the uproar by youths who had gathered for an army recruitment drive at the Deolali camp near here on Saturday. The authorities postponed the recruitment drive by a day.				 																																																	Around 5,000 youths from different parts of Maharashtra had gathered at the venue, when a few of them, apparently irked by the delay in the process, hurled stones and footwear at the army officials interviewing them, Nashik Road police said. The recruitment process resumed on Sunday, army sources said. 				 																Graft arrest				 																																																	Kota (PTI): A deputy chief medical health officer has been arrested by the anti-corruption bureau for allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 2,000 for registering a sonography machine, official sources said. On a complaint by a nurse, bureau sleuths laid a trap and caught him red-handed.				 																Girl raped				 																																																	Hissar (PTI): A 10-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her uncle, police said.

Contempt notice				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): The Supreme Court has issued contempt notices against municipal commissioner of greater Mumbai K.C. Srivastava and other civic officials for evicting thousands of hawkers from footpaths in violation of the apex court orders.

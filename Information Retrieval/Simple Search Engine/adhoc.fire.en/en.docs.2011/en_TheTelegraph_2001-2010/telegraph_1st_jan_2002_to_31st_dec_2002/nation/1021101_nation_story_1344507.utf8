																								Mumbai, Oct. 31 (PTI): Salman Khan, charged with killing one person and injuring four in a hit-and-run case, was today exempt from appearance by a local court even as he sought the return of the Toyota Land Cruiser involved in the mishap.																								Magistrate S.Y. Sishode exempt Salman (in picture above) for the day and adjourned his plea till November 16.																								Salmans lawyer H.S. Anand had appealed for the actors exemption from personal appearance as he was preoccupied with work.																								Police have objected to the return of the vehicle saying it was not registered in Salmans name but in the name of one Mohammed Abdul Rehman Hussainar.																								Anand said Salman had purchased the vehicle from Hussainar but it was not transferred in the actors name. He also told the magistrate that the first owner of the vehicle might appear before the court on the next occasion. 																								Salman had allegedly crushed to death one person and injured four in Bandra on September 28. The actor was arrested and freed on bail after 17 days of captivity on October 24.

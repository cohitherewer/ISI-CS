		 Wednesday, October 30, 2002 				 Strike row in TN Assembly
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Oct. 29: The Tamil Nadu Assembly today shelved a resolution on the Cauvery issue but a showdown over a government employees strike churned the House.																								The special resolution was deferred in view of the Supreme Courts decision to take up on November 1 the contempt case against Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna.																								As the short monsoon session is scheduled to meet for another two days, the government motion on Cauvery, which was listed for discussion tomorrow, would not be taken up now, Speaker K. Kalimuthu told reporters.																								But the House did witness high drama in which DMK members who had squatted in dharna were evicted for disrupting proceedings.																								The Assembly was thrown into turmoil as the DMK legislators sat before the Speakers podium. They raised slogans denouncing the governments handling of the week-long strike by employees and teachers demanding more dearness allowance and benefits.																								Almost the entire Opposition was on their feet demanding that chief minister Jayalalithaa invite representatives of employees and teachers for talks.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Salman Khan																								Mumbai, Oct. 3: Salman Khan might not have a driving licence at all. 																								According to Mumbai police, who wrote earlier this week to the Regional Transport Authority to suspend the actors licence, the transport body has said it has no record of a licence issued to Salman. The reply has come from the Andheri branch, which would have the authority to issue the licence. 																								After Salmans car ran over five pavement dwellers, killing one, the actor had told police that he had misplaced the licence.																								Police are also checking with other branches to see if any of them has issued the licence. We have written to other RTAs to verify whether Khan had been issued a licence from their offices and are still awaiting their response, said joint commissioner of police Ahmed Javed, who is heading the inquiry into the case. 																								Another police officer has been reported as saying that Salman does not have a licence. Subhash Jadhav, assistant commissioner of police, Bandra division, has been quoted as saying: How can the RTA suspend Salmans licence? The man does not have a licence at all. 																								Javed said there would be no fresh charges against Salman if he was found not to have a driving licence as he was already booked under the Motor Vehicles Act for not possessing the licence on the day of the accident.																								Picket at cinema hall 																								Seventy-five bjp activists were arrested in Malegaon in north Maharashtra for staging a demonstration in front of Vaibhav theatre, screening a Salman-starrer, Hello Brother.

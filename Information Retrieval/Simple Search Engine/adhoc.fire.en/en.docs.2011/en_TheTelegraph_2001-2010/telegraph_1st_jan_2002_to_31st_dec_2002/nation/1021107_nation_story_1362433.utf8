		 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 CVC complaint bar
																								Chennai, Nov. 6 (PTI): The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) will no longer entertain anonymous complaints to keep open channels of communication with the complainant, its chief said today.																								Describing the step a major decision, chief vigilance commissioner P. Shankar said a complainant had the right to request that his name be withheld but the name and address has to be provided so that the commission had access to that person.																								To avoid the kind of controversy generated by his predecessor on publishing the names of persons facing investigations following complaints, Shankar said the commission had decided to publish only the names of people punished and not the names of those being investigated.																								It will be unfair to give out names before a person is found guilty and punished, he said. 																								Asked if there was adequate transparency in the functioning of the Central government and its undertakings, Shankar said: Definitely we can do with a lot more of transparency.																								He said the right to information act could also be implemented in a better way.																								The CVC is also focused on identifying sources of corruption and finding ways to eliminate the problem. 																								It had last year received about 17,000 complaints on its web site and in writing, but several of these were beyond its jurisdiction.																								The other complaints pertaining to corrupt officials of state government were forwarded to the respective governments, he said.

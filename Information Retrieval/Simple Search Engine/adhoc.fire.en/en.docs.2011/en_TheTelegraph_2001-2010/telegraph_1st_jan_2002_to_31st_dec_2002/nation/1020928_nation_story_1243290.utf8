 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 (From left) Sadiq, Ishtiaq and CP Rai in police custody. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Sept. 27: There is more bad news for underworld don Abu Salem  now in detention in Portugal  with three members of his gang being picked up in the capital late last night and being questioned by Delhi police.																								The gangsters luck seems to be running out. Investigators are hoping to get detailed information about his network in India, particularly Delhi and the northern states, from the arrested gang members who are from Salems home state of Uttar Pradesh. 																								Though the arrests of the trio will give an indication of the criminal network established by Salem, it is unlikely to provide the authorities with fresh ammunition for his extradition to India.																								Sadiq and Ishtiaq (from Azamgarh) and C.P. Rai (from Mau) were arrested last night from South Delhi. A Mauser, another pistol and a revolver with several rounds of cartridges were recovered from them, said police officials. 																								The three were in the capital to demand money from a Delhi businessman. Salems gang is known for extorting money from Bollywood stars, producers and builders in Mumbai.																								So far little was known about Salems activities outside Mumbai, but he apparently also has links with Delhis thriving business and trading community.																								According to the police, Salem had demanded money from the Delhi businessman, whose name has not been disclosed. When the businessman refused to pay, the three men had come to the capital to make him pay up. 																								Police say the businessman could have been killed if he refused to give in.																								Police claim that Rai is the main organiser of hitmen for Salem.

		 Thursday, October 10, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																7 jawans blown up in strikeback 				 																																																	 Ranchi: Retaliating against the arrest of some of its hit squad members a fortnight ago, suspected Peoples War extremists on Wednesday blew up a vanful of Jharkhand Armed Police jawans ferrying salaries for their colleagues, reports our correspondent.				 																																																	Seven jawans were killed when their vehicle ran over a landmine close to a bridge near Kenda Ghati in Palamau district. The explosion, which occurred around 10.30 in the morning on the Daltongunj-Aurangabad highway, was so powerful that the van was flung several metres into the air. Two jawans were critically wounded.				 																																																	Inspector general of police (operations) R.C. Kaithel said the PW appeared to have taken revenge against the arrest of 14 of its men by Palamau police, but the extremists did not touch either the money or the arms of the jawans. The injured have been taken to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences. The reprisal strike came within a few hours of the Naxalites setting ablaze a panchayat building in Vishrampur police station area late on Tuesday night. This is the fifth landmine explosion in Palamau and its adjoining Garhwa district this year. 				 																Joshi raps MPs on tech seats				 																																																	 New Delhi: Human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi pulled up colleagues from his own party, when they demanded a berth in the decision-making committees of National Institutes of Technology, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Soon, there will be 17 NITs to give quality engineering education. Twelve institutes have already been established and five are in the pipeline.				 																																																	The exchange between the Union minister and the BJP MP took place during Tuesdays consultative committee meeting when S.P. Gautam asked Joshi why MPs were not included in the committees. Gautam argued that members of Parliament represented the people and it was strange why not a single one of them was on the NIT committee.				 																																																	Joshi, however, refused to consider the suggestion. Instead, he turned the tables on the MP, saying he would like to know how many of them took serious interest in a subject like human resource development. According to sources, the minister said the presence of 12 MPs of a total of some 32-odd consultative committee members indicate the level of interest members of Parliament have in the subject.

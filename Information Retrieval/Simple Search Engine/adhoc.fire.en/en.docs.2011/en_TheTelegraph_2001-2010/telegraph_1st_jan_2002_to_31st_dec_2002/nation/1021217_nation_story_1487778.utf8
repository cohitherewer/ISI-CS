Since Modi will be sworn in as Gujarat chief minister on December 22, the party executive will now meet on December 23 and 24. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and the BJP brass is expected to attend the function in Gandhinagar to celebrate a major victory  the partys first in a long time.																								Flush with the Gujarat success, the two-day meeting is expected to review in detail the performance and go into the regional variations as many seats were lost in Kutch and Saurashtra, which were its strongholds.																								BJP sources said the meeting would also assess the role played by second-rung leaders in ensuring the Gujarat victory. It was the first big election in which veterans like Kushabhau Thakre, Kailashpati Mishra and Pyarelal Khandelwal  the pracharaks who formed the organisational backbone, as it were  were kept out.																								BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley, Modis closest confidant, oversaw the exercise despite a note of scepticism expressed by none other than Vajpayee. 																								The Prime Minister, sources said, had wondered aloud if the inexperienced Jaitley could pull it off.

		 Friday, October 04, 2002 				 US leader blames loss on Indians
																								Washington, Oct. 3 (PTI): A US Congresswoman accused of being anti-Indian has blamed Indian-Americans for her defeat in the Democratic primary in Georgia in her bid to stand for re-election. Cynthia McKinney alleged that Indian-Americans had launched a campaign against her.																								I am beginning to get over the disappointment that I will no longer be able to serve the people of Georgia in the next Congress. However, there were some alarming things about the campaign to defeat me that I think my colleagues of both parties should look for, she told The Washington Times. I am not talking about the Republicans who crossed over to vote for my opponent but the very heavy involvement of Indians in the primary.																								Earlier this year, I was one of the 42 members of the Congress who wrote to President (George W.) Bush to urge the release of Sikh and other political prisoners in India. Apparently this irritated the Indians because they invested heavily in the effort to defeat me, she said.																								Asked if she was saying 41 other Congress members were in danger because they, too, had annoyed the NRIs, she said: To my colleagues of both parties who have also been involved in the effort to expose Indias brutal record, I say watch out: they are coming after you too.

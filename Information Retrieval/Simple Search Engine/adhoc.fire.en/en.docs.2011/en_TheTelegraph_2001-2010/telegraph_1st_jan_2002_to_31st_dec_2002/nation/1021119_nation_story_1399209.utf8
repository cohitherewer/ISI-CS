 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Patna, Nov. 18: The Peo- ples War Group has decided to expand the scope of its guerrilla war in a resolution adopted at the meeting of its Central Military Commission over the weekend. 																								The commission, an apex body of outfits that have been carrying out attacks on class enemies in Bihar, Orissa and Bengal, apart from Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, met at an undisclosed destination near one of the guerrilla bases.																								In a written statement, the commissions spokesman, Samar Sen, said the PWG has urged its armies to annihilate the enemy in a big way. 																								This is a departure from the outfits earlier policy to go for selective targets, mostly security forces.																								In a policy that may have been influenced by the outfits recent proximity with the Maoist Communist Centre  another extreme-Left outfit  the PWG has now decided to direct its cadre to use traditional weapons like spears, swords and daggers along with grenades and landmines. 																								The MCC militants have only used traditional weapons in their fight against the priv- ate militia of the upper castes, Ranbir Sena, over the past decade. 																								In massacres, the MCC cadre slit throats of enemies with a sharp-edged weapon, perceived to be a symbol of the movement of backward castes.																								However, the PWG has been specialists in the use of sophisticated landmines, including pressure-activated devices.																								As revolts are increasing, military attacks have become the order of the day, the statement said.																								It added: So far, we have mainly attacked the forces that entered our guerrilla zones but the impact of faraway targets is also equally powerful.																								The commission, there- fore, has resolved to push back the enemy from various areas.

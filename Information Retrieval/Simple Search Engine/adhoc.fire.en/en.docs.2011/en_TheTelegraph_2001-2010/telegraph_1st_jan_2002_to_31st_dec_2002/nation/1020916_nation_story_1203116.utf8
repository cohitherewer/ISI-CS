The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, September 16, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Doctors on strike over power crisis				 																																																	 Kanpur (PTI): Junior doctors at the government-run Halet hospital have gone on strike in protest against an acute power crisis which caused the death of three patients in the last 72 hours, senior doctors said on Sunday.				 																																																	Unconfirmed reports said four persons died as they were denied admission because of the strike. The strike began on Saturday, as the power crisis, combined with generator failure, badly affected the functioning of the hospital for the last three days. Two patients died in the surgical ward and another in the ICU. Emergency services have been hit in the hospital as a result of the strike, they said.				 																																																	Hospital director S.P. Singh and principal of the medical college within the hospital premises A.K. Gupta were not available for comment. The junior doctors gheraoed the residence of a senior executive of the Kanpur Electrical Supply Company and returned only after getting an assurance about early restoration of power supply. 				 																Delhi tops crime census				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The national capital continues to top the crime chart among mega cities in India, registering 20.1 per cent of the 2,55, 276 reported cases of crime, according to a report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). 				 																																																	Mumbai, with 11.5 per cent of reported crimes, comes second said the report, Crime in India-2000, released by the bureau earlier this week.				 																																																	The NCRB defined a mega city as one having a population of more than 10 lakh as per the 1991 census and included both A and B class cities based on population, male workforce engaged in non-agricultural activities and density of population.				 																																																	Of the 2,620 murder cases reported in the 23 mega cities, Delhi reported 18.2 per cent. Here again, Mumbai came second with 11.9 per cent. 				 																																																	The report said the high crime rate in mega cities was due to problems of unchecked migration, illegal settlements, socio-religio-cultural disparities and uneven distribution of income. Organised groups, gangsters, professional criminals and even youth find in crime a short cut to the lavish life in cities, the report said.				 																																																	The situation is not helped by the fact that the actual strength of the police is less than the sanctioned 46,835. Delhi police with 43,628 men on its rolls is short of men, according to the report. The gap starts at the level of inspector and sub-inspector and increases as one moves downward.				 																10-year jail for raping student				 																																																	 Baroda (PTI): A school teacher was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years by the district and sessions court at Rajpipla for raping a tribal student in the classroom two years ago.

Mercury spill				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The pollution control committee of the Andaman islands is investigating the spilling of 50 kg of mercury from a lighthouse after an earthquake on Saturday. An official said that fish might be affected by the spill. Central Pollution Control Board chief D.K. Biswas said the probe report will be submitted on Monday. He said mercury turns toxic when methylated in presence of organic material. The possibility of methylation existed due to the presence of organic material in the sea, he added.

The deceased were identified as Vijay Shankar Patil, 30 and Subhash Shingte,32.

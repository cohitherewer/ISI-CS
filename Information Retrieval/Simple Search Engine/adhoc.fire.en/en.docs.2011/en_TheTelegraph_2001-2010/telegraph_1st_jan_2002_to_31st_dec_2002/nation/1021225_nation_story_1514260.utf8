		 Wednesday, December 25, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Court notice to EC on nomination form				 																																																	NEW DELHI (PTI): Disapproving the present system of issuing nomination papers separately from the form for declaring previous convictions, the Supreme Court has directed the Election Commission to issue them together to candidates in all future elections.				 																																																	At present, the returning officer on receiving the nomination papers from a candidate gives him the proforma of an affidavit to furnish information to ascertain whether he has been convicted in any of the offences mentioned in Section 8 of the Representation of Peoples Act. 				 																																																	The affidavit and the nomination papers are taken together for scrutiny on the scheduled date to find out if the candidate was entitled to contest elections or not.				 																																																	uggesting a change in the present practice, a three-judge bench of Justice R.C. Lahoti, Justice Brijesh Kumar and Justice H.K. Sema said: It would be better that for the future the directive may find it feasible to require the returning officer to handover the proforma of affidavit while issuing the nomination paper itself.				 																																																	Rejecting an election petition challenging the result of the byelection from Bhojpur Assembly constituency in Madhya Pradesh, the apex court said the returning officers power to conduct summary inquiry into the antecedents furnished by candidates was independent of the commissions directives.

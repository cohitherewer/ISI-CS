		 Saturday, December 28, 2002 				 CBI plea to trace Ottavio
																								New Delhi, Dec. 27 (PTI): Unable to trace Ottavio Quattrocchi, who reportedly flew to Italy from Malaysia, the CBI has approached Interpol for help in tracking him.																								Quattrocchi, an Italian businessman who is an accused in the Bofors payoff case, left Kuala Lumpur a fortnight ago, after successfully fighting against a case of extradition to India.																								We have received no information about Quattrocchis whereabouts though we have got in touch with the Malaysian authorities to verify his port of disembarkation, CBI director P.C. Sharma said here.																								The investigating agency, he said, hoped that the Malaysia supreme courts order of impounding Quattrocchis passport has been complied with.																								 and Kuala Lumpur would try to find his exact location.																								On media reports saying Quattrocchi is in Italy, Sharma said: We have got in touch with our mission in Rome, which has contacted its counterpart in Italy to find out whether he is there.																								The CBI has also contacted the Interpol headquarters in France to help track down Quattrocchi. A red corner warrant against him is pending.																								On Quattrocchis claim that he would return to Malaysia as per plans, Sharma said: The irony is that when he left India, he said the same thing. Now, when the CBI has secured relief from the highest court in Malaysia, we fear he may repeat history.																								India had gone to Malaysias highest court, the Court of Appeal, after that countrys high court on December 13 rejected a plea to review the sessions court verdict throwing out the extradition case.																								Sharma said the CBI held the Malaysian judiciary in high esteem, but regretted that we were not given a proper hearing and the case was dismissed summarily and in a prejudged manner.																								We have given all documentary and oral evidence after it was vetted by eminent lawyers here. The Italian businessman was chargesheeted after which the court issued a warrant of arrest against him, he said.																								However, there is some confusion, which we intend to clear, Sharma said.

		 Monday, October 21, 2002 				 Samajwadi plea to Cong
																								New Delhi, Oct. 20 (PTI): The Samajwadi Party today appealed to the Congress to take the initiative to form a grand alliance of secular parties in Gujarat to thwart the BJPs attempts to come back to power by exploiting the fragile communal situation in the state.																								A grand alliance of secular parties is needed to prevent the BJP from coming back to power. Being the largest Opposition party, it should be the endeavour of the Congress to take along other parties, party general secretary Amar Singh said here.																								Singh said his party was interested in a tie-up with the Congress, though Sonia Gandhi has some differences on this front. Singh has already held talks with Ahmed Patel and Kamal Nath.																								Charging the Congress with repeatedly putting hurdles in the formation of secular alliances, Singh said the Samajwadi had given unconditional support to the party on many occasions.

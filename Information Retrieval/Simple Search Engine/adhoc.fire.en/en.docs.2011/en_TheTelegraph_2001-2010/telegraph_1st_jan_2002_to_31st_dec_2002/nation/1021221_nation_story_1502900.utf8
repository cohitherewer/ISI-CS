		 Saturday, December 21, 2002 				 Salem papers sent to Lisbon
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 20: The CBI handed over documents seeking the extradition of Bombay blasts accused Abu Salem to the Indian embassy in Portugal early this week, setting the legal process in motion.																								CBI superintendent of police (special task force) O.P. Chatwal gave in the papers a couple of days ago and held a series of meetings with Lisbon authorities, said a senior CBI officer. 																								The Portuguese authorities will seek clarification, if needed, before the case goes to a Lisbon court, CBI sources said.																								Salem and his companion, Bollywood actress Monica Bedi, were arrested on September 16 on charges of travelling with fake documents. They were put behind bars for 90 days, which was extended for three months as Lisbon police could not complete investigations on time. 																								Even if the Lisbon court convicts Salem and Bedi, the gangsters extradition case will run parallel, a senior officer said.																								The agency has also submitted papers relating to the extradition of Mumbai underworld don Anees Ibrahim to the ministry of external affairs for scrutiny. Anees was arrested on December 3 and then let off by Dubai authorities.																								After the documents are vetted by the foreign and Union law ministries, Anees extradition request will be sent to the UAE through diplomatic channels. 																								However, the process is just for the record since the fugitive is not in Dubai polices custody. Since Abu Dhabi Interpol wanted it, we are forwarding the extradition request, a senior officer said.

		 Friday, October 18, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Air force to launch recruitment drive				 																																																	 new delhi: The Indian Air Force is beginning its biggest drive to recruit and will offer up to 7,000 jobs a year beginning December, reports our special correspondent. 				 																																																	The air force now recruits about 2,500 airmen every six months. This is set to go up to 3,500 half-yearly, said Air Marshal Narayanan Menon, Air Officer in Chief (personnel).				 																																																	The force has a strength of 11,000 officers and 1.11 lakh other ranks. In each of these categories, this is 15 per cent less than the sanctioned strength.				 																																																	The air force will also implement fast-track promotion policies. Outstanding airmen will be given commissioned ranks after 15 years of service. This now takes between 20 and 25 years. Branch commissioned officer who earlier could not go beyond the rank of squadron leader (equivalent of major in the army) will can now go up to wing commander (equivalent of lieutenant colonel).				 																																																	The qualifying years of service for a wing commander to be promoted to the rank of group captain (equivalent of colonel) is also being rolled back by two years. Promotion to the Air ranks  air commodore (brigadier level), air vice marshal (major general rank) and air marshal (lieutenant general rank)  which were earlier based on experience will now be merit-based.				 																																																	Air Marshal Menon said this was being done because it was found that in inter-services outfits, IAF officers were junior in rank despite more years in service. Even with these changes, it will take the IAF about four years to keep pace with promotions in the army. He said unlike the army, the IAF does not have a statewise quota for recruitment into the other ranks because induction of sophisticated technology had made it imperative that all recruitment was merit-based.

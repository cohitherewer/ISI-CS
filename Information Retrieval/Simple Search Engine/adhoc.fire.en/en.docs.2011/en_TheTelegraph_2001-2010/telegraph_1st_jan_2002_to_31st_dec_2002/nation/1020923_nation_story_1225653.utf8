																								Mumbai, Sept. 22 (PTI): Cinevistas Limited has snapped ties with noted theatre personality Aamir Reza Hussain and his wife, Virat Hussain, who were directing its film, Kargil  The 50 Day War. 																								The production firm has also slapped an arbitration notice on the duo, claiming Rs 3 crore as expenses and Rs 5 crore as damages. 																								Alleging that the duo had committed breach of contract and misappropriated funds, Cinevistas filed an arbitration petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. It has nominated the retired chief justice of the Supreme Court, S.P. Bharucha, as an arbitrator. 																								Sunil Mehta, Cinevistas managing director, told reporters yesterday that the other side has to respond now. 																								Hearing the arbitration petition filed by Cinevistas on August 28, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud had stayed the production of the film and restrained Aamir Reza and Virat from infringing on the copyright of the script. 																								The Hussain duo appealed in the high court. On September 18, Justice Hemant Gokhale and Justice Nishita Mhatre set aside the earlier order and allowed the Hussains to go ahead with the film. However, the judges held that the portion of the earlier order on appointment of a court receiver for 12,500 ft of exposed film stock and stock used for naval shoot would remain. 																								In a related development, Bombay High Court has set aside its earlier order and allowed Aamir Reza to complete the film before the onset of winter in the Drass sector of Jammu.

		 Thursday, November 07, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Rajasthan rule to curb strikes				 																																																	 Jaipur (PTI): With an aim to discourage its employees from participating in frequent strikes, the Rajasthan government has amended its pension rules by making them more stringent.				 																																																	The state government recently amended the Rajasthan Civil Services (Pension) Rules 1996, which stated that any break in service for more than two years during the service period of an employee would not be condoned while pension would be lowered accordingly, official sources said on Wednesday.				 																																																	The period of strike which an employee participates during his service period will now be considered as break in service, the sources said.				 																																																	Under the amended provision, the appointing officer will issue a showcause notice to an employee for participating in any strike. If it is proved that the concerned employee indeed has participated in the strike and the strike period was not regularised by the state government, his service period before the strike would not be considered as the qualifying service for calculating pension.				 																																																	In case of absence from duty, a similar procedure would be adopted and the appointing officer would decide if the service prior to the break is to be considered qualifying service for calculation of pension or not, the sources added. The amended rules would come into effect retrospectively from October 1, 1996, the sources added.				 																Row over Sangh slur on writer				 																																																	 Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): The objection raised by the Sangh parivars cultural outfit over the Kerala governments decision to award its highest literary prize to noted writer Kamala Suraiyya, who recently converted to Islam, has come in for sharp criticism from intellectual circles in the state.				 																																																	Several writers said Bharatiya Vichara Kendrams protest against Suraiyya being awarded the Ezhuthachan Puraskaram was yet another instance of saffronites pushing their communal agenda in the cultural field.				 																																																	Taking strong exception to the Sangh ideologue Parameswarans statement questioning the propriety of the honour instituted in the name of the father of Malayalam literature, Thunchath Ezhuthachan, being given to Suraiyya, several writers wondered whether the Sangh opposition was due to the writers recent conversion to Islam, changing her name from Kamala Das to Suraiyya.				 																																																	Parameswaran, director of the Bharatiya Vichara Kendram, saw the selection of Suraiyya for the award as most inappropriate alleging that she had nothing to do with the cultural and literary values for which the medieval devotional poet Ezhuthachan stood for.				 																Turkish in urea scam seek bail				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): After spending more than five years in prison, the two Turkish accused in the Rs 133-crore urea import scam have approached the Supreme Court alleging that they have been discriminated by denial of bail which was granted to all Indian accused.				 																																																	Tuncay Alankus and Cihan Karanci, the two executives of Karsan, which had entered into an agreement with National Fertiliser Limited to supply two lakh metric tonnes of urea but could not supply any even after receiving the payment in advance, have been in jail since their extradition to India from Switzerland on October 3, 1997.				 																Jobs on the sly				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi court has convicted 40 people, including three officers of the Staff Selection Commission, for fraudulently adding names of 37 candidates on the final list of those selected for the post of clerks in 1983.				 																Stung to death				 																																																	 Sonipat (PTI): A middle-aged man died after being attacked by a swarm of bees when he had gone to extract honey from a beehive in village Ridho, police sources said. Jagbir, 43, died after he was stung all over the body.

		 Friday, December 06, 2002 				 House quorum
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 5: The elections in Gujarat, the Id-ul-Fitr tomorrow and the weekly holidays of Saturday and Sunday took their toll on Parliament today.																								With several MPs leaving for their constituencies and some for campaigning in Gujarat, attendance in Parliament touched a new low, forcing the presiding officers of both Houses to adjourn them for the day. 																								Tomorrow being a holiday for Id, Parliament will meet again on Monday after a three-day recess.																								Todays attendance was at an all-time low in the House, which has been seeing thin attendances for the past one week. 																								Yesterday, the government faced embarrassment when the IDBI Bill was being introduced and the Opposition demanded a division. 																								The treasury benches turnout was so poor that some Congress members had to walk out of the House to give the NDA benches a majority.																								Business in the Rajya Sabha collapsed today in the post-lunch session for want of quorum, leading to adjournment for the day. At least 10 per cent of the House must turn up for quorum.																								The Lok Sabha was adjourned at 3.40 pm by Deputy Speaker P.M. Sayeed, who was in the Chair.																								This afternoon in the Lok Sabha, the issue of quorum came up during a division on a private members Bill, seeking an amendment to the Constitution to enact a common civil code.																								Sayeed said lawmaker Adityanaths absence would force a division, as the rules call for.																								But before the voting could take place, Sayeed said there was no quorum and the division would have to wait till later. He then adjourned the House till Monday.

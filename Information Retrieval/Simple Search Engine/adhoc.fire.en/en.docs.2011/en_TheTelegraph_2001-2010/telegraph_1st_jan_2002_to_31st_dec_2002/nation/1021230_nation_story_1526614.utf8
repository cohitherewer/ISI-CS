The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, December 30, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Name bloomers in Bihar I-cards				 																																																	Saharsa (PTI): The Bihar state election commission has ordered the preparation of fresh photo I-cards in Saharsa district, following detection of major mistakes in names printed in the cards, official sources said.				 																																																	During the distribution of the cards, it was found that the names were typed in a funny manner. People with Singh as their surname found to their dismay that it had been made Lion, a translation of the word in English.				 																																																	A voter, Saryu Singh, found his name on the I-card as Saryu Lion, while Panchu (fifth) Ram has become Five Ram and Basawan Mukhiya, Basawan Headman.				 																																																	Saharsa district magistrate R.L. Chongathu said a company from Bengal, which had been entrusted with the job, simply translated the names from Hindi to English.				 																																																	The mistake occurred as its personnel were not familiar with the local dialect, he said. The district magistrate detected the mistakes while giving out the I-cards and withheld their distribution.				 																																																	As a precaution, the district administration has appointed proof readers to read names correctly and avoid any ambiguity, he said.				 																Crew stabs captain at sea				 																																																	Singapore (AP): A Canadian ships captain was stabbed to death and thrown overboard by a member of his crew between India and Singapore, but the suspect was not detained because the incident happened in international waters, according to a news report.

Mas body has not been recovered, it said.				 																																																	The crewman, whose name was not given, allegedly told his shipmates that he stabbed Ma in the neck after the captain angrily grabbed him by the collar because the crewman was not maintaining the correct speed, the newspaper said.				 																																																	The Panama-registered ship, MV Jin Bi, arrived in Singapore on December 20 and left on Saturday with the suspect on board, the newspaper said.				 																																																	Singapore police escorted the ship into the port after crew members reported the murder, but said they could not investigate the killing because it happened in international waters, the report said.				 																																																	Stanley Norbert, a Singapore police spokesman, confirmed that the ships crew had reported a murder but did not give more details.

		 Saturday, December 14, 2002 				 Jaya axe on ministers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Dec. 13: Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa tonight sacked two more of her Cabinet ministers.																								Education minister and former deputy Speaker M. Thambidurai and revenue minister Dalavai Sundaram were axed as the chief minister was apparently upset over their alleged irregularities in a land allotment case.																								The Hosur-based Adhiyaman Educational and Research Institution floated by Durai was recently granted post facto permission for over 216 acres already held by the institution. A PIL in Madras High Court had challenged the order that sought to give ceiling exemption for the land. Sundaram was understood to have cleared the file. 																								Last month, Jayalalithaa, in a major Cabinet shuffle, had robbed three ministers of their posts and inducted five others.

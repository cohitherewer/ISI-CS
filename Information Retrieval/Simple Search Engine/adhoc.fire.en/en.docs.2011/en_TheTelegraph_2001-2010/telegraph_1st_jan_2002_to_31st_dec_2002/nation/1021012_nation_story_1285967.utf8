		 Saturday, October 12, 2002 				 VHP limits attack focus
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 11: A couple of weeks after he reportedly attacked Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at a Lucknow meeting, saying how his every decision had damaged his own credibility as well as that of the BJP, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) working president Ashok Singhal climbed down a bit and maintained he was misquoted by the media.																								At a media briefing, Singhal said he had sent a missive to BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu today to clarify that he had not said every decision of the Prime Minister has had a negative impact on his credibility. I only said it in the context of the Ramjanmabhoomi issue, he added.																								But on the Ayodhya issue, Singhal was as harsh as ever. In the letter to Naidu, he stressed that Vajpayee had some hope of retrieving his credibility only if he became more positive on constructing the Ram temple.																								While refusing to reveal the VHPs plans on the issue, Singhal hinted that something major would unfold in the days to come. He said in the recent Margdarshak Mandal meeting the VHP held in Lucknow, the clergy had submitted a plan of action which is such that the government will be compelled to take a stand and say yes or no to it.																								The VHP leader said he had appended Lucknow datelined press clippings of the VHP meeting in the letter to Naidu to prove his point. Singhals alleged attack on Vajpayee prompted Naidu to immediately issue a statement in the Prime Ministers defence, saying the VHP was influenced by religious extremism from across the border.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani reportedly asked the RSS leaders to intervene and prevail on Singhal not to indulge in personal attacks on BJP leaders. Sangh sources, however, insisted that Singhals letter to Naidu was not written at their behest. Ashokji is far too senior a leader to need anyones advice or intervention. He probably thought a clarification was necessary, they said.																								Sources close to Singhal said he was forced to send it after a leading newsmagazine carried a photo of his with an accompanying blurb that quoted his controversial remark on Vajpayee.																								The VHP working president persisted in his tirade against the government. Singhal said the BJPs rout in the Delhi Assembly elections four years ago and more recently in Jammu proved how upset Hindus were for reneging on the commitment to allow a Ram temple to be built in Ayodhya.																								Asked to respond to a statement made by VHP president Vishnu Hari Dalmiya in a TV interview, saying the BJP-VHP ties were on the verge of a breakdown, Singhal said: There is no breaking point. Our message to them (the BJP) is clear: reform yourself and then may be things will change. If you dont, the Hindu samaj will not support you, like in Jammu and Delhi.																								We must remember we have given a solemn pledge to the Hindu samaj (to construct the temple).																								As to what would happen if the government continued to be indifferent, he said, Hindus respond in a silent way. I have told senior politicians that however offended they feel, Hindus will not take to the streets or issue statements in newspapers.																								According to Singhal, all that the government needs to do is take a Cabinet decision to restore the Ayodhya land to the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas (trust). But despite agreeing on everything, they (the government) waited for the one-year deadline given by the Hindu religious leaders to end before requesting the court to expedite the hearing on the issue on a day-to-day basis, he said to support his contention of how tardy the Centre was on the matter.																								Apart from the temple issue, Singhal accused the government of doing nothing to ban cow slaughter or stop work on the Tehri dam. Mayavati (Uttar Pradesh chief minister) has issued an order calling for a blanket ban on the slaughter of cows and buffaloes. Why cant the Centre follow suit? he asked.

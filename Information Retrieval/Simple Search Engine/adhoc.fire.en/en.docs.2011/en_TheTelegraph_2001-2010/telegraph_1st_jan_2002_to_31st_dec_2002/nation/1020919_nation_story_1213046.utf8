		 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 BJP against talks with Hurriyat
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 18: In contrast with the Vajpayee governments line, the BJP today said talks should be held only with elected representatives in post-poll Kashmir and not the separatist Hurriyat Conference.																								Any talks in Kashmir could now take place only with the elected representatives and not those who have boycotted the democratic process and were taking dictates from Pakistan, party spokesperon Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told reporters.																								He said discussions should be held only with those who abide by the Constitution and not those who are taking directions from Pakistan. 																								The elections have exposed the mischievous activities and false propaganda of Pakistan and the world has now begun to take a tough stance on that countrys role in Jammu and Kashmir, he said.																								Asked if the party opposed talks between Ram Jethmalanis Kashmir Committee and the separatists, he said: We should not pin great hopes on dialogue with such persons and organisations. 																								He said BJP was not in favour of granting greater autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir or of trifurcating the state. But it wanted more powers to be delegated to Jammu and Ladakh region.																								Naqvi said Pakistan had gone to the ridiculous extent of claiming that people had been dragged out and forced to vote in a constituency (Lolab) where polls had been countermanded after a candidate was killed.																								On seat sharing with the Jammu State Morcha, a front of splinter parties backed by the RSS, Naqvi said it had been allotted nine seats while the BJP would contest 28 in the Jammu region.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, September 06, 2002 				 Cricket crisis
																								He went to the extent of listing that as the first of four options  its quite another matter he suggested that the BCCI help the ICC by supporting option No. 4 (accepting the Indians demands).																								The second option was to proceed with the Champions Trophy after barring India for failing to field its best team, with option No. 3 being to continue with the event and accept a second-string Indian side.																								Gray has placed on record that the IDI (the ICCs business arm) would be liable for severe damages should any of the first three options be exercised.																								Moreover, nobody is willing to accept India sans the Sachin Tendulkars and Sourav Gangulys  certainly not Sony, for example.																								While all that is fine, what has infuriated the BCCI is something else.																								Had a deal been officially struck tonight, it would largely have been thanks to the face-to-face interaction between the Indian players and the ICC late last evening. 																								Clearly, drama wasnt at a premium when the Big Four (Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble), plus spokesman Ravi Shastri, met ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed and general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson.

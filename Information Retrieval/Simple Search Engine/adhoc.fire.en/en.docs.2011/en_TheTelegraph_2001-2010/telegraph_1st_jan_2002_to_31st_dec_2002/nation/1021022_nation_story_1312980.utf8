		 Tuesday, October 22, 2002 				 Chargesheeted Salman denied bail
 ANAND SOONDAS				 	 Salmans sister and another family member at the court on Monday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Oct. 21: Salman Khan was denied bail for the fourth time today.																								The metropolitan court refused to grant the Bollywood star respite despite the police winding up their investigations and filing a chargesheet against him. Many had believed that Salmans case for bail would be strengthened after the police filed a chargesheet.																								Salman has been booked under Section 304 (II) of the IPC  culpable homicide not amounting to murder  in a hit-and-run case that killed one and injured four people sleeping along a Bandra pavement on September 28.																								In police and judicial custody since October 7, Salman has once again been remanded in judicial custody till October 31.																								Metropolitan magistrate S.Y. Shisode, who had earlier denied Salman bail on October 14, gave the same reason today for dismissing the bail plea and said he had no jurisdiction to grant the actor liberty as only the sessions court was entitled to handle cases referred under Section 304 (II) IPC.																								Unlike earlier, when the actor got agitated with the prosecutions demand for more custody and fought his own case before the judge, Salman today appeared poised and resigned.																								Quiet for much of the deliberations in court, Salman was seen smiling and hugging family members for the 20 minutes that he was allowed to interact with them.																								Giving him support were his father Salim Khan, stepmother Helen, brother Arbaaz Khan, brother-in-law Atul Agnihotri and actor friends Puneet Issar and Kishen Kumar.																								The actor, who has been sent back to Thane jail, has been charged with 10 offences under the Indian Penal Code.																								Apart from the charge under Section 304 (II)  a non-bailable offence with 10 years rigorous imprisonment and fine  he has also been booked under various provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and the Prohibition Act.																								Salman has been provided a copy of the chargesheet and will be filing for bail at the sessions court once again.																								When his bail petition was first dismissed, the actor had been told that investigations were on and granting him bail could jeopardise the inquiry because he may tamper with the evidence using his power and status. He has been barred from meeting the victims or their families.																								Later, he was told that only the sessions court could grant him bail because he was being tried for culpable homicide. On October 16, the sessions court sent him to judicial custody saying some more time was needed for investigations to be completed.																								Police sources in Thane said that behind bars Salman spends most of his time praying, exercising and chatting with constables on guard.																								While he was in the Bandra lockup and, later, in the Crawford Market cell of the Crime Branch, Salman had been confined with other offenders, mainly petty criminals, with whom he spoke to occasionally.																								In Thane, the actor is in a cell all by himself with only wardens and police constables for company.																								It has been reported that policemen in Thane have been making a beeline for the actors cell, asking him to sign autographs for their wives and children.																								Salman is happy to do it, said an official on duty, adding: It gives him a chance to interact with others when he wants to. Otherwise, he is quiet and reflective.																								Policemen would not confirm if the moody actor has refused an autograph to any of them.

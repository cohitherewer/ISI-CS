		 Tuesday, October 15, 2002 				 Rain deaths in Kerala 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 14: Torrential rains in the past 48 hours have claimed three lives and caused extensive damage to crops and property in Kerala.																								Rains, accompanied by thunder and lightning had claimed 10 lives last week. Though the casualty rate has not touched double figures in the past 48 hours, the intensity of rains is much more than what it was last week. Central and northern districts of the state have had unstinted rain during this period. 																								Deaths have been reported in the past 24 hours from Kasaragod district in northern Kerala. Two people have been reported missing from Kasaragod and Kannur since Sunday night. 																								The rains also caused extensive damage to standing crops besides uprooting hundred of areca nut and coconut trees. 																								Several houses were partially damaged in the strong winds, while low-lying areas were inundated in many villages. 																								Local Weather Office said heavy rain was likely to continue in many parts of Kerala and Lakshadweep during the next 48 hours. A low pressure area formed over Lakshadweep four days ago was the reason for the present spell of heavy rain.																								First ten days of October this year reported the highest rainfall (during the period) since 1975. There has been 65 per cent more rainfall than usual said a weather official of the Meteorological Centre at the state capital, Trivandrum.																								The present spell of rains, which could be the forerunner to the North East monsoon (which usually comes around this time of the year), might compensate for the deficient southwest monsoon in June- August but its overall impact need not be positive because of the crop loss. The southwest monsoon registered only 65 per cent of the normal rainfall during earlier years.																								EOM

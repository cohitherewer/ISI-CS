																								Wellington, Aug. 22 (AFP): A maverick nationalist politician has criticised New Zealands first Muslim lawmaker, Indian-born Ashraf Choudhary, for planning to swear his parliamentary oath of allegiance on the Quran.																								New Zealands First Party leader Winston Peters said New Labour Party legislator Ashraf Choudhary was breaking a centuries-old tradition by not swearing the oath on the Bible.																								But Choudhary rejected Peters criticism yesterday and said he should brush up his New Zealand history.																								Choudhary said 19th-century Prime Minister Julius Vogel, a Jew, had sworn allegiance on the Torah. The precedent was broken back in the 1870s by Vogel, Choudhary said.																								Choudhary and the other 119 lawmakers elected at last months election will be sworn in at Wellingtons Parliament House on Monday. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.

We do not want our future generations to be affected with the deadly AIDS virus. So, as a precautionary measure, all the families in the village have agreed to carry out the requisite AIDS tests, village sarpanch Popat Pawar said.				 																																																	As per the resolution, any outsider interested in marrying a person from the village will have to undergo the Elisa test. The rule was also applicable to boys and girls from the village, he said.

HC seeks creamy layer criterion				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has directed the Maharashtra government to declare its policy with regard to the creamy layer among backward classes contesting the civic body elections.				 																																																	The directive was given by Chief Justice C.K. Thakker and Justice Ranjana Desai on two public interest litigations challenging election of two corporators of the Pimpri-Chinchward civic body. The matter has been adjourned to December 11.				 																																																	One petition claimed Prakash Rawale was elected from ward 35, reserved for other backward castes. Rawale was a Maratha, and not Kunbi, as claimed by the corporator.				 																																																	The petition said Rawale was among the creamy layer of backward castes and argued that a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court had held that benefit of reservations should be given to those who do not belong to creamy layer. 				 																																																	While the judgment was related to education and employment, it should also be applicable for elections, the PIL contended and urged the court to inquire into the validity of Rawales caste certificate.				 																																																	Rawales counsel Shashikant Page argued that the caste scrutiny committee had given a certificate to his client and said if the petitioner wanted to challenge the election, he should move another forum and not through a PIL.				 																																																	Another petition filed against Mohan Goswami, a National Congress Party corporator from ward 30, alleged that he had given false document certifying him to be a Gosavi (a nomadic tribe) while he belonged to creamy layer.

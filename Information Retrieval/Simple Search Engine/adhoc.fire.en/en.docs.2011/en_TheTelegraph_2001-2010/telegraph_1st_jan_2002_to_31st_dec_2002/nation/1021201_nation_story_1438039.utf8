 MONOBINA GUPTA 				 	 Shatrughan Sinha																								New Delhi, Nov. 30: There have been more brickbats than flowers for Shatrughan Sinha since he acquired a new profile in Atal Bihari Vajpayees Cabinet. The health minister is clearly not used to such negative attention, having spent years in Bollywood where gushing fans greeted him at every step. 																								The staff in his office, too, are baffled at the criticism pouring in about the ministers casual approach, lack of seriousness, prolonged absences from office and Parliament, and, most important, his failure to come up with a significant policy statement on health and family welfare. 																								Officer on Special Duty Prabhat Ranjan and the ministers personal secretary Satya Gopal are worried about salvaging Sinhas reputation. They want to put together a damage-control plan that will help Shotgun find his feet in the sprawling ministry. 																								Some of Sinhas well-wishers have asked him to cultivate a serious image as opposed to his usual flippant and flamboyant style. But the ministers staff wonder why there could be a problem with his penchant for rhymes. At a recent meeting, Shotgun, hoping to boost the morale of HIV/AIDS patients, said: AIDS is not bad, it is very sad. Thats Sinhaspeak, meaning there is no stigma in having AIDS and one should not give in to depression. 																								When some colleagues in the ministry pointed to the absurdity of the rhyme, Sinhas staff protested, saying the minister put it so nicely. What could possibly be wrong with rhyming messages? Earlier, at a news conference, the minister had rhymed most of his answers, clearly indicating his inexperience in handling a press meet. The bureaucrats fielded all the questions and provided the necessary information. 																								An official said that by now, Sinhas office should have advised the first-time minister to change his style. Instead of pinpointing Sinhas vulnerabilities, the ministry grapevine says, his staff are wasting energy on finding culprits  those who are leaking information. 																								Every day, a pile of newspaper clippings with reports on the health ministry and its minister is sent to Sinha. The negative reports, till recently, were dismissed as the result of a conspiracy hatched to defame the minister. 																								Sinha, so far, has been quite brazen in the face of the bad press. He has asked reporters to write what they wished but he would not answer their questions on his innumerable foreign trips. Recently, when the minister went to the US, his staff refused to give details of Sinhas programme. The minister, too, bluntly turned down all questions. 																								Later, his absence from Parliament and his failure to keep appointments with doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Safdarjung hospital again triggered a flurry of criticism, even from MPs. But Sinha and his staff are still at a loss over what the minister is doing wrong. Consequently, they cant figure out a strategy for damage control. 																								But the continuing flow of criticism  the latest volley fired from RSS mouthpiece Panchajanya  is beginning to rile. And Sinhas office is finally waking up to the call of duty, if not common sense.

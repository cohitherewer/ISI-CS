		 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 PWG hand in temple blast
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 22: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani held a high-level meeting this morning to review internal security in the country.																								He also decided to despatch junior home minister Vidya Sagar Rao to Hyderabad to bring back a detailed report on yesterdays blast inside the Shirdi Saibaba temple premises, which killed two persons and hurt 17.																								Rao later said the Peoples War Group was behind the blast. Yesterday, the state police had hinted that Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence could have a hand in it after no one claimed responsibility.																								Though the police are eager to pin the blame on the ISI for everything, the home ministry report points to the PWG which is active in the Warangal region and operates with impunity in the thick forests straddling Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

		 Sunday, November 10, 2002 				 Layoff lesson for Bengal communists 
				 	 A delegate in her traditional dress at the congress. (AFP)																								The Liaoning discussion drew the largest number of mediapersons among five different conclaves in different rooms at the same time. The reason: for both the Chinese party and government, as well as foreign observers, Liaoning has recently been the most crucial test for Chinas toughest new generation of reforms and their most severe pains. The leaders couldnt push them under the carpet any more.																								No other than one of Bos deputy governors, Zhang Xing Xiang, gave it in a capsule: Liaoning has the countrys largest number of state-owned (and sick) industries, the largest numbers of laid-off workers and the largest number of retired (read fired) workers.																								The message from communist China to Calcuttas reform-wary Marxist government which has not been able to close even one of the 64 loss-making public sector units that add to Asim Dasguptas messy finances: in state-owned units in Liaoning alone, 489,000 jobs have been cut in just one-and-a-half years! 																								It is at Anshan city in the province where Chinas showpiece steel unit  Anshan Iron and Steel Group Corporation  is located. Since 1998, 11,000 of the massive workforce of 139,000 have been re-employed (read sacked). Many more thousands are bracing to face the axe. 																								It is much the same story for Liaonings textile workers. Liaoning may be an extreme case, says a foreign diplomat, but its happening everywhere. The textile ministry in Beijing had 500 employees two years ago. Today, the ministry barely exists in the form of a council with just 20 staffers.																								In steel, the countrywide picture is that 103 small steel units were closed down over a year, rendering 129,000 workers jobless. And the government itself announced this last April.																								No wonder Liaoning has become a hotbed of protests by fired labourers. Only last week, several thousand sacked metal and textile workers demonstrated outside the office of the Liaoning city government, sending out a signal to the leaders on the eve of the party congress.																								But those who predict that Liaoning will start the beginning of the end of either the party or the reforms is totally wrong, says an analyst at the China Academy of Social Sciences. According to him, the critics are deliberately suppressing the fact that the reforms are opening up new roads to jobs, as they are downing the shutters on old and sick units.																								Bo could, therefore, relieve the picture of gloom, at least partly, when he told the group meeting that the province had attracted investment worth $3.5 billion last year alone. This should give the macro picture of the countrys total new investment, from other countries, overseas Chinese and the new capitalists at home.																								There is thus little hope of the reforms being stranded at Liaoning or elsewhere. As for the protests, the party bosses are sure they can take care of them.

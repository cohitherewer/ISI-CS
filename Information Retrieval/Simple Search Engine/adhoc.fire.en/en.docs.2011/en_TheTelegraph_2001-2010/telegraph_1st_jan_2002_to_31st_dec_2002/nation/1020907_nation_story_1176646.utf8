Justice k.s. Rathore said no glorification of sati would be allowed at Rani Khemi temple in Jhunjhunu district and Dholi Satiji temple at Fatehpur in Sikar district. 				 																																																	This was reported by R.P. Garg, the lawyer pleading on behalf of the Dholi Satiji Samaj. Any offering during worship would be handed over to the district magistrate and no chunari ceremony would be allowed by any devotee, the court order added.				 																																																	The court also directed all annual ceremonies to be held inside temple premises only.

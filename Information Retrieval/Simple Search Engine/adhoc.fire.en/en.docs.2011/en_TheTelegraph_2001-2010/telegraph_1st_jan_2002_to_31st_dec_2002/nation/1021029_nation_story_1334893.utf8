The PIL seeks the courts directive for initiating criminal action against Togadia, who, it alleges, had made defamatory, vulgar, immoral, contemptuous and illegal remarks against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh.				 																																																	Quoting newspapers reports, lawyer Anel Sirohi said the remarks were made to outrage the feelings of the minorities and to promote enmity between different groups on the basis of religion and place of birth. That is nothing short of imputations and assertions which is prejudicial to the national integration, he alleged.				 																																																	Togadias remarks at public speeches led to widespread protests.				 																																																	Regarding remarks against Sonia, Sirohi said it was not an issue which concerned the Congress president alone. Such public statements are an onslaught on our civilisation, culture and religion, besides the democratic set-up, he added. 				 																																																	The Hindu religions greatest strength comes from the fact that it has maximum flexibility and accepts all kinds of views, the PIL says.

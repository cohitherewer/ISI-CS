		 Thursday, October 03, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Jayanti outrage on Gandhi statue				 																																																	 Meerut (PTI): Unidentified miscreants vandalised a statue of Mahatma Gandhi on his birth anniversary on Wednesday at Meerut College, where students are protesting against the setting up of a police post in the campus, official sources said. 				 																																																	Police discovered the broken statue when the college was to hold a function on Gandhi Jayanti, SSP Mukul Goyal said.				 																																																	The college, which has been witnessing students unrest over the police post and deployment of Rapid Action Force, is closed. 				 																																																	Assistant district magistrate J.P. Singh said the statue was damaged after 4 am. Policemen posted at the college had found the statue intact till then.				 																																																	The college principal has lodged an FIR and investigation is on to identify the culprits.				 																																																	The SSP said the city was calm. There was no tension after the incident. The college principal has decided to replace the statue with a bronze one at the earliest. 				 																																																	Groups of students met the district magistrate to lodge their protest against the incident. 				 																Court rules in employees favour 				 																																																	 Allahabad (PTI): Allahabad High Court has ruled that a confirmed employee cannot be denied the right to explanation or an opportunity of hearing in the event of his being removed from service for taking unauthorised leave. 				 																																																	The absence from duty after expiry of the sanctioned leave, in the present case, might be a case of misconduct but it cannot be magnified beyond all proportions to warrant termination of service, the court in its order said.				 																																																	Justice S.N. Srivastava gave the ruling on a writ petition filed by M/S DCM Limited, proprietor of Hindon River Mill, Ghaziabad through its executive director.				 																																																	Dismissing the petition, the court said the labour court order for reinstatement of the sacked employee Moti Chand was valid and required no further interference. 				 																																																	Chands service was terminated in 1982 after he absented from duty beyond his sanctioned medical leave of 10 days, though he had applied for an extension of the leave. The labour court has rightly awarded full wages to the employee, the court said. 				 																Flutter over Osama I-card				 																																																	 Jodhpur (PTI): An identity card issued by a Dubai-based company owned by Osama bin Ladens father has created a flutter among intelligence officials. 				 																																																	The card in Arabic, issued in the name of Tajjumul Hussain by the company Sehshurah Nijakata, was found lying on the road by a youth, SP Prashakha Mathur said. He gave the card to his father, who handed it over to the police. The card also has the name of the worker in Hindi and his photograph. It has been sent to the police headquarters in Jaipur.

Water trains				 																																																	 Ajmer (PTI): Special trains to supply drinking water to areas suffering from water scarcity have been started in the state.

		 Saturday, November 09, 2002 				 BJP slams rhetoric
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 8: The BJP has objected to Sonia Gandhis attack on the NDA government in the fourth conclave of chief ministers of the Congress-ruled states at Mount Abu and asked her to stop indulging in empty rhetoric.																								Spokesman Arun Jaitley advised the Congress chief to use the meet to take stock of her chief ministers works instead of picking holes in the NDA governments performance.																								Sizing up each major state governed by the Congress, Jaitley said Rajasthan  the venue of the conference  was the worst drought-affected state, followed by Madhya Pradesh, which has also reported as many as 22 deaths caused by starvation so far.																								The Maharashtra government is fragile and riddled with contradictions and Kerala has no money to pay salaries, he added. As for Karnataka, Jaitley said chief minister S.M. Krishna ended up cutting a sorry figure before the people and the Supreme Court, first by defying the courts order to release Cauvery waters to Tamil Nadu and then, abiding by it. 																								On Punjab, Jaitley remarked that the chief minister thought the best way to rule was by oppressing his opponents.																								On Kashmir, he said: They dont know where the contradictions have begun even before they started.																								In her address today, Sonia alleged that the BJP-led coalition was a comprehensive failure and claimed the country was again looking at the Congress to revive economic growth, foster social peace and enhance Indias stature in the world.

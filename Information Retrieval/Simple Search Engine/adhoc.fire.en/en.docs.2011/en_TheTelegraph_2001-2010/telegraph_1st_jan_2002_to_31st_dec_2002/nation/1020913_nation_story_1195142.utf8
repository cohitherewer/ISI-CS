		 Friday, September 13, 2002 				 Vajpayee sends Goel to tick off Modi
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Modi																								New Delhi, Sept. 12: Touched to the quick by Narendra Modis provocative anti-Muslim statements during the Gaurav Yatra, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called from the US to ask minister of state Vijay Goel to meet the chief minister and tell him to stop being so brazen.																								Goel, who is minister of state in the PMO, met Modi in Ahmedabad on Tuesday and conveyed Vajpayees message. He was slated to visit Gandhidham in Kutch for an earthquake relief-related programme on September 11. But Vajpayee told the minister to reschedule his trip and meet Modi.																								Sources close to the Prime Minister said they would closely watch the next leg of the Gaurav Yatra  which resumes on Saturday  to see if the warning has had an impact on Modi.																								Goel, who was in Mumbai today, said the chief minister had claimed he was misquoted. Asked if he was convinced with Modis explanation, the minister said: If he says so, it must be true.																								Modis description of the relief camps housing Muslim riot victims as baby-manufacturing factories was brought to Vajpayees notice by his aides. The Prime Minister had left for the US the day after the Gaurav Yatra began.																								Modis kick-off speech  which was an outburst against Sonia Gandhi and her Italian origin  did not perturb Vajpayee. But the chief ministers improvisation of the family planning slogan Hum do, hamare do to Hum Paanch, Hamare Pachees disturbed him because the context was the BJP-RSS campaign about how Muslims breed in large numbers wherever they settle.																								Though BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu had advised Modi to be more restrained after NDA convener and defence minister George Fernandes protested, Vajpayee wanted to send his own emissary to express his displeasure. 																								A section of the Gujarat BJP close to Modi was reportedly unhappy with the Prime Ministers intervention in state affairs. Its perception was that the chief minister should not be shackled with dos and donts if the BJP was serious about returning to power. 																								BJP sources said the pro-Modi lobby was unhappy being reminded about secularism because, in its view, the word was anathema to most of Gujarats Hindus.																								Modi-backers have conveyed to some Central leaders that if the BJP loses Gujarat, it will be because of its wishy-washy stand on Hindutva, indirectly seeking to blame Vajpayee.

		 Monday, October 14, 2002 				 Jitters over terrorist sneak-in
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 13: Security agencies in Gujarat are in a tizzy over reports that some terrorists have sneaked in from across the border.																								Officials neither confirm nor deny the report. Such information keeps coming every now and then and it could be a hoax, say senior police officers.																								However, the state intelligence department has received detailed information  including the names  of seven terrorists who have entered the state, according to a police source. The anti-terrorist squad has been reactivated to track down the militants.																								The militants, who are supported by a jihadi group based in Bihar, are reportedly waiting for the opportune moment to strike. The terrorists, the source says, might disrupt Navratri festivities or chief minister Narendra Modis Gaurav yatra, the fifth phase of which is to be kicked off at Porbandar on Wednesday.																								During the fourth phase of the yatra, Modi had claimed that he had credible information that at least 12 terrorists had entered the state to kill him. The claim was collaborated by Sharifkhan Pathan, recently arrested by the anti-terrorist squad along with 12 of his associates. Pathan, a resident of Ahmedabad who was trained by the Jaish-e-Mohammad, reportedly told the squad that he was sent to assassinate the chief minister.																								, whose security was stepped up following the attack on the Swaminarayan temple on September 24.

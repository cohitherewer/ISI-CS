 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 14: Police at Mumbai central prison were taken unawares yesterday when an inmate thrashed two of their colleagues for nearly 15 minutes.																								Culprit Sanjay Shrirang Powar, reportedly a Dawood Ibrahim gangster, is accused of murder, attempt to murder and extortion, among other crimes.																								Shivshankar Babasaheb Patil, the prisons cell-in-charge, and his deputy are now recovering at the JJ Hospital.																								Jail officials said trouble broke out last morning when Powar asked to meet certain fellow criminals. They were among the prisoners lined up at the court shed, on their way to the sessions court.																								When the two policemen refused Powars request, he argued. Then Powar thrashed Patil and his deputy as their colleagues, too stunned to move, looked on. Even the officers uniforms were not spared. According to jail authorities, some inmates helped Powar beat up the officers.																								Later, Patil lodged a complaint against Powar at the NM Joshi Marg police station.

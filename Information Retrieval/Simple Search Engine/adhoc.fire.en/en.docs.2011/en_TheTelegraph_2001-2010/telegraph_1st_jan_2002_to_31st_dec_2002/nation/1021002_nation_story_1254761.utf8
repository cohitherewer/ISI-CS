																								New Delhi, Oct. 1 (PTI): The Supreme Court today deferred hearing of a petition challenging the election of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee from Lucknow in 1999.																								A bench deferred the hearing after it noticed that a pending petition in the court challenging the electoral reforms Ordinance had a bearing on this issue.																								Harikrishna Lal had challenged the election on the ground that Lals nomination paper was rejected by the returning officer for non-filing of the affidavit giving information about his criminal antecedents. Additional Solicitor-General R.N. Trivedi contended that Lal, who was not even a voter in Lucknow, did not file the affidavit despite the officer giving him ample time.																								The counsel said Allahabad High Court had dismissed the petition on the ground that he was neither a voter nor a candidate as his nomination application was rejected and hence, did not have the locus standi to challenge the Prime Ministers election.																								However, the bench said a petition filed by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, which was pending before another bench, has challenged the legality of the electoral reforms Ordinance that included the issue of filing of affidavit regarding criminal antecedents of a candidate.																								The court then deferred hearing on the election petition to await the outcome of the PUCLs petition.

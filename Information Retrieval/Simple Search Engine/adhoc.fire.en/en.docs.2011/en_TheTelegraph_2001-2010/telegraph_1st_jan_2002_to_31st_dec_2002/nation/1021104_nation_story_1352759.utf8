		 Monday, November 04, 2002 				 Heat on Bangla migrants
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, Nov. 3: The Haryana government has resolved to initiate action against Bangladeshi migrants residing illegally in Haryana.																								The decision was conveyed by Director General of Police M.S. Malik yesterday at a meeting of senior police officials presided over by chief minister Om Prakash Chautala.																								Last year, police had launched a vigorous drive to identify and deport Bangladeshi nationals living in the state. Over 100 families were deported following reports about the involvement of Bangladeshi youths in several crimes. Most of them operated in the urban sector and lived in towns around Delhi.																								Police sources said at least 200 Bangladeshi families have been identified. They will soon be rounded up, sent to the border and pushed back into Bangladesh either from Bengal or Assam. The state police have launched a combing operation to identify more migrants.																								The Haryana governments decision to deport the illegal Bangladeshi migrants comes in the wake of pressure from the Delhi administration. 																								Delhi police put the number of Bangladeshi migrants in the capital at about 1.5 lakh, though unofficial estimates quote a figure of 5 lakh. Many of them serve as cheap factory labourers or domestic hands. 																								A senior police officer said Haryana alone has over 5,000 Bangladeshis. While many are employed as labourers in factories, some of them have been working on part-time basis as domestic hands. Several women and children even resort to begging at railway stations, bus stands and markets. So far, 212 Bangladeshi adults and 129 minors have been detected residing illegally in the districts of Panipat, Jind, Gurgaon and Faridabad.																								Chautala made it clear in the meeting that the government would not tolerate corruption in administration at any level and those found guilty would invite action irrespective of their official position and social status.																								The chief minister said that in case the government had to amend any Act to retrench the services of corrupt officials, he would not hesitate to get such legislation passed.																								Chautala also directed the police to ensure that their official vehicles were not misused and urged them not to indulge in wasteful expenditure keeping in mind the state governments limited resources. 																								He said a special campaign should be launched to check the menace of recycled polythene as it was causing environmental hazards.

		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 VHP march for Modi
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Sept. 16: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad is planning to lead a padyatra of sadhus across Gujarat in October in support of chief minister Narendra Modis Gaurav Yatra. 																								The padyatra is aimed at exposing Nehruvian secularists and the national media for projecting a negative image of Gujarat. Led by firebrand VHP leader, Acharya Dharmendra, will be a non-stop event unlike the Gaurav Yatra, a weekend ritual. It is expected to cover all important towns and Assembly constituencies in the run-up to the Gujarat elections.																								Though the date of its launch and other details are still being worked out, the purpose of the proposed yatra is to ensure that the passion whipped up by the Gaurav Yatra is not diluted and people dont forget the Godhra carnage, which both the BJP and the VHP cite to justify the riots.																								Taking potshots at Nehruvian secularists, general secretary Praveen Togadia warned Gujarat would become their next graveyard. He blamed secularists  who dont mention Godhra while condemning the post-Godhra violence  for handing over the country to jihadis. 																								Togadia said Jawaharlal Nehru University and Aligarh Muslim University were now on the VHP agenda. It would transform the character of these universities that were promoting anti-Hindu fundamentalism in the guise of Nehruvian secularism. 																								There should be no such thing as a majority or a minority institution in a secular country. We will change its (AMUs) minority status, Togadia added.																								The secular Indian press behaved as if it was the Indian version of al-Jazeera, which reflected the Islamic viewpoint, he said. Our sadhus will expose this mentality during the yatra.

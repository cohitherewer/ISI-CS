		 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 Drought-active Shekhawat sows surprise
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Nov. 12: Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawats move to convene an informal meeting of the task force on drought set up by the Centre has angered Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and caused perplexity in official circles. 																								At a meeting with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today, Gehlot, who has been under attack for his governments tardy response to the starvation deaths in Rajasthan, told him if the Vice-President could seek an informal briefing on the drought, he was within his right to request the Centre for early release of the next instalment of funds to tackle it.																								Official sources said Vajpayee assured him the package was ready, would be to his liking, and would be released by the task force by the end of this week.																								Shekhawats move took not only Gehlot by surprise but quite a few in the BJP too because this was the first time a Vice-President had on his own summoned a high-level body for a meeting. 																								On November 11, he reportedly called deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, who heads the task force, and told him he would like to be kept posted on how the Centre was handling the crisis. 																								Advani and the other members of the task force, including finance minister Jaswant Singh, food and civil supplies minister Sharad Yadav and agriculture minister Ajit Singh, called on him with an entourage of officials comprising the secretary (expenditure) and those of the related ministries. 																								Official sources said as the Vice-President reeled off his queries, Advani kept mum while the other ministers said their departments had done the best they could. 																								Yadav, for instance, said his ministrys granaries were overflowing and the drought-affected states were at liberty to pick up whatever they needed.																								Gehlot told Vajpayee that picking up food allocations was not as simple as it sounded. It called for coordination with other ministries like surface transport and rail.																								He also emphasised that the task force, which was to meet on November 2, deferred the session for no ostensible reason. 																								It is not Gehlots point of view that is causing surprise, but Shekhawat setting a precedent. In the past, only Presidents have summoned Cabinet ministers and high-ranking officials if they wanted a briefing or a clarification on a particular subject.																								In keeping with protocol, they routed their requests through the Prime Ministers Office. Former President K.R. Narayanan, for instance, twice called minister Jagmohan and former minister Madan Lal Khurana through the Prime Minister. 																								The sources said this time, the PMO was unaware of the Vice-President seeking the meeting. He must have approached the deputy Prime Minister directly, the sources added.																								Shekhawats pro-active interventions have been the subject of much speculation in the BJP. On November 8, he said in Mumbai India was ill-prepared to deal with the possible repercussions of the WTO on agriculture and industry.																								The only guess BJP sources are willing to hazard is that having been a grassroots politician for nearly five decades, it is difficult for Shekhawat to fit himself into a ceremonial post.

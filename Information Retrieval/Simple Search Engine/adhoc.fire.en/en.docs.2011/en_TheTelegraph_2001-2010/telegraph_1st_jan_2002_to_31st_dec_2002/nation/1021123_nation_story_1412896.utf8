 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 22: A chilling touch was added to Delhis record as the crime capital with police claiming today that at least one 14-year-old school dropout was among those who raped a medical college student inside a monument along the capitals Fleet Street.																								Delhi police commissioner R.S. Gupta said the girl was raped by 20-year-old Rahul with the help of his brother Amit (19) and their 14-year-old neighbours, Neeraj and Suraj. All the four have been arrested.																								They caught the victim unawares and pushed her inside the monument. While three took her upstairs and committed the crime at dagger-point, one stood below as guard, he said. They are all school dropouts while Amit is an illiterate, Gupta added.																								Rahul is facing trial in two cases of burglary, in which both Amit and Suraj were his accomplices, he said. All the accused belong to low-income groups and have no ostensible means of livelihood.																								The officer said Rahul, who was picked up this morning, has confessed and implicated the other three who were later rounded up.																								The raped girl is a student of Maulana Azad Medical College, situated along the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg which houses a chain of newspaper offices. The MBBS student was raped on November 15 afternoon near Khooni Darwaza, a monument a stones throw from the medical college.																								But the police commissioner did not give a categorical answer to a question whether Rahul had applied for anticipatory bail in a city court yesterday. I think so, Gupta said, referring to reports that a youth had moved court for anticipatory bail.																								The police commissioner said it was a rape-cum-robbery case as the four fled with the victims mobile phone and a small purse carrying Rs 100. The police have not recovered the stolen items so far.																								The police were working on a clue that one of the accused had the name Rahul tattooed on his right forearm. However, the arrested suspect had camouflaged his tattoo with white powder.																								Gupta claimed that the investigation of the case was painstaking as the police had to shortlist 120 suspects by the name of Rahul. The police were also constrained by the refusal of the victim to take a medical test, Gupta said.																								Police have now taken several steps to beef up security around colleges and universities. Major universities and colleges will now have a committee that will include a private security officer, faculty members, students and a local police officer to review the security.																								A suggestion to install a toll-free telephone line was also taken into account. Wide publicity will also be given to these numbers.

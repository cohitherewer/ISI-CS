 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Sept. 3: A total bandh was observed in Mysore today to mount pressure on the Karnataka government to intensify efforts to secure the release of Janata Dal (U) leader H. Nagappa from the clutches of forest brigand Veerappan.																								Even as normal life in the city came to a standstill in this expression of solidarity from the people of Mysore with Nagappas family, the mood in the Secretariat at Bangalore continued to be dominated by confusion. 																								Officials in charge of coordinating administrative and security operations on the Veerappan front said that a common line of approach with Tamil Nadu  which is also involved in the special task force  still eluded them. 																								While Karnataka wanted to initiate steps to send emissaries to Veerappan to seek a compromise, Tamil Nadu, as declared by chief minister Jayalalithaa, would have none of it. 																								Tamil Nadu continues with the refrain that it would carry on with intensive combing operations against Veerappan without harming the personal safety of Nagappa.																								There were apprehensions among law and order agencies that the Mysore bandh would take an anti-Tamil Nadu dimension. 																								However, no untoward incident was reported.																								All shops, hotels, cinema theatres and other commercial establishments downed their shutters in response to the bandh, which was called by the Janata Dal (U), the BJP and the Janata D al (S). 																								Busy commercial centres such as Sayyaji Rao and Devaraj Urs Roads wore a deserted look. City buses stayed off the roads and private schools and colleges remained closed.

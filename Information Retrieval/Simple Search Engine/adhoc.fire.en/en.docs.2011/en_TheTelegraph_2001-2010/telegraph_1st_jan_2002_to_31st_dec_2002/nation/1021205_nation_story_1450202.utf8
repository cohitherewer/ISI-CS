		 Thursday, December 05, 2002 				 Hostage training 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 4: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today informed the Rajya Sabha that a hostage negotiation course has been started at the National Police Academy in Hyderabad.																								Detectives from state police and intelligence agencies are being trained at the academy, taking into account the increase in terrorist activities, specially the recent hostage crisis in Russia, Advani said.																								When Maharashtra MP R.S. Gavai asked whether it was possible for the Centre to have similar institutions in other states, Advani said the academy was the premier institution of the country for training IPS officers. 																								Though law and order was a state subject, the Centre had to take a pro-active step on terrorism and mafia activities that are witnessed all over the country, he said.																								The deputy Prime Minister ruled out the existence of any proposal before the government to constitute a central negotiating division to tackle hostage situations. 																								To another question, Advani said the government was determined to get Mumbai underworld don Abu Salem extradited to India.																								He said the government was completing various processes before the 90 days of Salems remand in Lisbon, Portugal, expired. 																								Soon after receiving information about Salems detention on September 19, a CBI team was sent to discuss the issue of extradition.

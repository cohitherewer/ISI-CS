		 Tuesday, November 12, 2002 				 Probe into judicial sex scandal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Nov. 11: Chief Justice N.K. Jain of the Karnataka High Court has ordered a public inquiry into allegations of a sex scandal involving senior members of the judiciary. The registrar-general of the court, A.C. Kabbin, began the inquiry today.																								The probe was ordered in the wake of media reports stating that legal luminaries were caught in a compromising situation at a resort in Mysore last week. Justice Jain has set Saturday as deadline to get first-hand information on the case though state police has denied the occurrence of any such incident.																								A press note from Kabbin stated: The honourable chief justice has taken serious note of the newspaper reports alleging an incident in a resort at Mysore involving persons from the legal fraternity. The question of whether any such incident took place as reported is under verification. Having regard to the gravity of the allegations, the chief justice desires that any person with first-hand information or material may furnish the same to the registrar (vigilance), Karnataka High Court, on or before November 16.																								According to the note, other than rumours, there has been no evidence to substantiate the allegations till date, even as Mysore police commissioner Chandrashekar iterated that no such incident had taken place. We did not raid any place that day. I categorically state that neither I nor my men are trying to cover up or hush up the incident as is being made out by the press, he said.																								Chandrashekar said the police would investigate if they came across any information on the case. I have already sent a report in this regard to our superiors, he added.																								The high court vigilance team, which visited Mysore to find out whether the alleged episode did take place, is trying to track down a middle-aged lawyer who had reportedly informed the police.																								A lawyer from the Mysore Bar Association was present at the hotel and he, along with some others, complained about the behaviour of certain legal luminaries, sources said.																								The sources said the lawyer insisted that the police register a written complaint and give an acknowledgement. The vigilance team, which questioned the resort owners, is now trying to establish the identity of this lawyer who can (in turn) identify those involved in the incident, they said.																								The leader of the Mysore Zilla Raitha Hitarakshana Samiti, Mallesh, has urged the Supreme Court to take note of the sordid affair and order a high-level inquiry to punish the guilty. 																								Otherwise, we will be forced to file a public interest litigation seeking an inquiry into the scandal, he said.

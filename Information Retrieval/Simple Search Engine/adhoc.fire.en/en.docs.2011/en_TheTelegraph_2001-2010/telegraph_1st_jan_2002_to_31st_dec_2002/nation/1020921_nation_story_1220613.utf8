		 Saturday, September 21, 2002 				 Fissures in TN Cauvery front
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Sept. 20: An all-party meeting on the Cauvery issue, convened by the Tamil Nadu government tonight, rejected the ruling partys proposal to seek the Karnataka governments dismissal for defying directives to release Cauvery waters to the lower riparian state, but said the Centre should take over reservoirs in Karnataka.																								The meeting ended on a low-key note after initial drama with the Opposition DMK and the Indian Union Muslim League boycotting the meeting and the Congress, led by E.V.K.S. Elangovan, walking out to protest the draft resolution seeking the dismissal of the Krishna government for defying orders of the Supreme Court, the Cauvery River Authority (CRA) and the Tribunal to release water to Tamil Nadu.																								DMK president M. Karunanidhi said the party was keeping away from the meeting as the ADMKs approach was not proper and Opposition parties are not slaves to be at the beck and call of the ruling party.																								Chief minister and ADMK chief Jayalalithaa will lead an all-party delegation to New Delhi tomorrow to meet Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								The resolution adopted at the end of the meeting said the delegation would urge Vajpayee to direct Karnataka to immediately release the water.																								It also came down on the state for unilaterally taking a decision to stop further release of water and for openly defying the orders of statutory bodies, including the Supreme Court.																								The resolution also said the rules of the CRA should be amended to enable the Centre to take over the reservoirs in Karnataka and release water to Tamil Nadu.																								Contempt notice																								The Tamil Nadu government has filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court against the Karnataka government for failing to implement the CRAs order on releasing water.

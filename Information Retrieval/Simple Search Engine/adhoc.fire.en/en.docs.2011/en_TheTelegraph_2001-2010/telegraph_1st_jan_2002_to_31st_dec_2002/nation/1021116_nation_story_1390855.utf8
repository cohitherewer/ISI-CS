																								New Delhi, Nov. 15 (PTI): American congressional approvals will not be required for deals of up to $40 million with India involving advanced counter-terrorist armaments.																								At the just concluded three-day meeting of the Indo-US security cooperation group, it has been conveyed to New Delhi that armaments sales up to $40 million wont require mandatory congressional approval, US officials here said.																								It was also conveyed at the meeting, the second in the series of the group, that since October 25 the US had put India on par with Japan, Singapore and others regarding granting of armament export licences. 																								Washingtons step, defence officials here said, would mean that Indian arms system requirements like ground sensors, thermal imagers, devices to neutralise improvised explosive devices and night-vision equipment could go through on fast-track basis. Indian military experts are undertaking preliminary trials of the suitability of US-made ground sensors for checking infiltration from across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.

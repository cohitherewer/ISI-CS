		 Tuesday, November 05, 2002 				 Assault case on MLA
																								Lucknow, Nov. 4 (PTI): The Government Railway Police have filed a case of assault and manhandling against Samajwadi legislature party leader Azam Khan, Northern Railway sources said here today. 																								Khan had allegedly manhandled a coach attendant while travelling from Saharanpur to Rampur yesterday, the sources said. 																								A report in this connection was lodged by the grp at Saharanpur. 																								However, rejecting the allegations, Khan said it was a conspiracy against him as well as the Samajwadi.																								I have no knowledge of any misbehaviour with the railway staff. It is a conspiracy against me and my party. These are third- rate tactics and one should not stoop to such low levels in politics, he said tonight.																								He said an attendant travelling with him had demanded two bed rolls from the coach attendant, who was willing to provide only one.																								 As leader of the Opposition, I am entitled to four bed rolls or even more. It takes only four hours to reach Rampur from Lucknow and often we dont need bed rolls, the Samajwadi leader said.

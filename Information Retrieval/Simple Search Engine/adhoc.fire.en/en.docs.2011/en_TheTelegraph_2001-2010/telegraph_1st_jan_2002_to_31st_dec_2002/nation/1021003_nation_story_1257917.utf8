		 Thursday, October 03, 2002 				 Tamil Nadu wages behaviour battle with Delhi 
																								Chennai, Oct. 2: The Jayalalithaa regime has joined issue with the Centre on what constitutes proper behaviour for a chief minister, reports our special correspondent.																								Former chief minister O. Panneerselvam, who now holds the PWD portfolio, is up in arms after Union water resources minister Arjun Charan Sethi said Jayalalithaas behaviour on the Cauvery issue was unbecoming of a chief minister.																								In a reference to the Karnataka chief minister, Panneerselvam wondered whether wilfully disobeying the Supreme Courts orders and those of the Cauvery River Authority to release waters to Tamil Nadu was becoming of a chief minister.																								Jayalalithaa had only walked out of the Cauvery river authority meeting, he said. This was an established democratic practice, the minister added. 																								Both the Prime Minister and Sethi have blatantly sided with Karnataka, which is highly unbecoming behaviour, Panneerselvam added.

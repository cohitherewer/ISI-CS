 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Dec. 22: An internal rift in the Bihar underworld helped police trap crime lord Umesh Singh, the suspected kidnapper of Exide chairman Satyabrata Ganguly, in Patna on Friday.																								The informer who had tipped off the special task force of Bihar police and state CID about Umesh had shifted his allegiance to a rival gangster, Balmiki Singh, a few months earlier.																								Umesh, along with his two associates Ajay Singh and Ashim Singh, has been accused of kidnapping Ganguly and a businessman, Sajjan Jalan. The detective department of Calcutta police later arrested Ajay and Ashim.																								On Saturday, Umesh was brought to Durgapur from Patna and produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court, which remanded him in police custody for 10 days. 																								Deputy superintendent of police, CID, Tanmoy Roy Chowdhury has questioned Umesh. We have got names and telephone numbers of several contact persons of criminals based in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, an officer said.																								Police claimed that Umesh has given the names of three Calcutta-based businessmen who are said to be close to dons in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The three are suspected to have alerted the gangs about prospective victims in the city.

		 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Gujarat burden on Armitage
 K.P. NAYAR 				 	 Yashwant Sinha with Pakistan foreign secretary Inamul Haq at the Saarc meet in Kathmandu. (Reuters)																								Washington, Aug. 22: A statutory US commission has added one more piece of baggage to the complaints about American policies being carried by a harassed Richard Armitage, US deputy secretary of state, who is arriving in New Delhi tomorrow. 																								The US Commission on International Religious Freedom, which advises President George W. Bush and the US Congress about the state of religious freedom worldwide, has urged Armitage during his visit to New Delhi to express publicly the US governments profound concern about the widespread killing of Muslims in the state of Gujarat earlier this year.																								The commission is miffed that that as far as we know, no senior US administration official has expressed concern over the killings or called for accountability for those responsible, its chairperson, Felice Gaer, said in a letter to Armitage on the eve of his departure for South Asia.																								The panel, which runs a virtual industry from alleged violation of religious rights across the globe, is particularly upset with US secretary of state Colin Powell for having said last month during his visit to South Asia that the violence in Gujarat did not come up in any of the conversations that I had in both India and in Pakistan.																								The letter pointed out that Indias own National Human Rights Commission has detailed evidence of premeditation by members of Hindu extremist groups, complicity by Gujarat state government officials and police inaction in the face of orchestrated violence against Muslims. 																								Clearly, it is important that the US speak out publicly against such religion-based extremist violence, all the more so in view of our countrys war on terrorism.																								The US state departments deputy spokesman, Philip Reeker, sought to gloss over the commissions demand by saying: Human rights is usually a discussion we have in our bilateral dialogue with every country.																								But it is clear that Armitage will be in a quandary when he is India. If he makes a public statement anywhere on the lines of what the panel wants, he will be criticised in India, where memories of Powells remarks about Kashmir and election observers are still fresh.																								If he does not, he will face the wrath of powerful religious interests here when he returns home.																								If Armitage raises Gujarat privately during his talks in New Delhi, he will be politely told to mind his business. Especially in view of the growing perception among the Indian leadership that the US is unmindful of Indian interests in the current war against terrorism. copy;  Copyrights 2002.

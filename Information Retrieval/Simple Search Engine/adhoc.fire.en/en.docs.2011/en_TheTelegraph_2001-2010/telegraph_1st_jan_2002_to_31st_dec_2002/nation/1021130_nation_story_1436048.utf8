		 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Raid raj comes full circle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Nov. 29: Six years after the then DMK administration claimed to have unearthed a treasure trove inside Jayalalithaas house, it was her turn today to reply in kind.																								The directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption today publicised a list of riches found from 14 premises linked to the DMKs former food and cooperation minister K.N. Nehru.																								It also said that the former ministers alleged investments abroad are being investigated.																								The dramatic disclosure came less than 24 hours after the directorate mounted a chain of raids on the premises of several former DMK ministers.																								The raids also covered the premises of one of the most respected Dravidian leaders and Opposition leader, K. Anbazhagan.																								The directorate has accused Anbazhagan, who was once described by Jayalalithaa as panbaalar (man of culture), of irregularities in admissions to the District Education and Training Institute. 																								But the alleged findings after the raids on the houses of Nehru and his relatives have hogged the limelight. The directorate claimed in a statement that the raids unearthed house sites at Tiruchi and the hill-station of Kodaikanal, a Rs 1-crore farm house near Chennai, plots valued at Rs 1 crore and a house built at a cost of Rs 50 lakh in Tiruchi. The statement said the directorate has come across evidence of Rs 5 crore investment in a housing company, allegedly made in the name of Nehrus brother, and a luxuriant life style.																								The statement said Nehrus illegal acquisition of assets during the pervious DMK tenure and his investments abroad (in countries like Germany and Italy) were being probed. 																								The directorate is now headed by a high-profile lady IPS Officer, G. Thilakavathi, whose collection of short stories in Tamil is being released in Chennai tomorrow. 																								In 1996, Jayalalithaas houses were raided by the same directorate.

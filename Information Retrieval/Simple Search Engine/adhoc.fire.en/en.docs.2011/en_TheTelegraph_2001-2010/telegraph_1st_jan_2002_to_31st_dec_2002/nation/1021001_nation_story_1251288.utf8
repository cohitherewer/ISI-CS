 AAMIR ASHRAF																								Karachi, Sept. 30 (Reuters): Pakistani police today paraded a man who confessed to having been trained by Indian intelligence and carrying out bomb attacks in the country.																								State media later quoted police as saying they had arrested another man they described as an Indian terrorist who had planned to sabotage next weeks national elections in Pakistan.																								The first man, who gave his name as Bachal Ramji, said he was a Pakistani national who had crossed into India to be with his family some years ago, but had been forced by Indian intelligence to return to Pakistan to carry out bomb attacks in that country.																								He said he had been arrested in Karachi on Sunday while he was taking photographs of a exhibition centre. I am working for RAW (the Research and Analysis Wing), the man told a news conference in Karachi in Urdu.																								They have given me the target to conduct bomb blasts in Pakistan. I have been blackmailed by RAW. They threatened to kill my family. They forced me to take training for 15 days which was mainly in explosive items. I have conducted one blast in Lahore in 1999 and a second in Peshawar in which the explosion did not occur.																								Six people died on November 20, 1999, when a bomb exploded outside a bicycle repair shop in the eastern city of Lahore and ripped through the narrow market streets.																								It is common for Pakistan and India to parade arrested suspects in front of the media. (In Kanpur, police arrested two ISI agents and seized secret defence-related documents from their possession, PTI quoted a senior officer as saying today.)																								Pakistani police have suggested Indian intelligence agents could have been behind the massacre of seven Christians in Karachi last week. India has accused Pakistan of links to the gunmen who stormed the Swaminarayan temple last week.																								Syed Kamal Shah, police chief of Sindh, told reporters that Ramji, 29, would be handed over to the military for further questioning, and might be tried in a military court.																								State-run Pakistan Television named the second detained Indian as named Charan Singh, who was arrested in the border town of Kasur in central Punjab province.

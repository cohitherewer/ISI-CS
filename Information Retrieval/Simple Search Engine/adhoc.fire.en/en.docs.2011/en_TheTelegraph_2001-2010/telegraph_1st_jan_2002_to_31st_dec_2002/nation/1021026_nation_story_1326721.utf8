																								Recently, Sealdah got a replacement for its RRI system, divisional railway manager D.C. Mitra said. But the one at Howrah  the busiest station of Eastern and South Eastern Railways  has a certified life-span of 20 years and was installed in the 1960s. It has not been fully replaced till date, say officials, resulting in frequent misbehaviour.																								The replacement has been assigned to a German-based firm and things are now moving, a senior Howrah division official said, admitting that some problems were expected till the work was over. The switch-over to the replacement should be over by the end of this year, he said.																								There are other aspects of the signalling system that are equally worrying. Officials admit that the system, employed for about 90 per cent of the railways 82,000-km running track  the absolute block system  does not give any indication of what is happening to a train once it has left a station and is yet to arrive at the next one.																								For stations separated by a 10-km stretch, without continuous track circuiting and the automatic block signalling system, it is impossible to know the status of the train or the track during the journey. We wouldnt know even if there is a kilometre-long gap in the track or if the train has fallen off the rails, a senior Eastern Railway official said.																								At present, automatic block system is used for about 10 per cent of the tracks and track circuiting has been done only on the Liluah-Bandel, Sealdah-Barrackpore, Sitarampur-Pradhankhanta and Tikiapara-Panskura stretches, say officials.																								Internal railway reports concede that the condition of the tracks is such that more than 10,000 km is in need of immediate repair or renewal. 																								Most of the bridges on the tracks dont even have the 5.5-foot-long pre-stressed reinforced concrete sleepers and it is here that the chances of derailment are highest, say officials. Apathy to the real problems has complemented the human-error factor, leading to the recent spurt in mishaps, they said.

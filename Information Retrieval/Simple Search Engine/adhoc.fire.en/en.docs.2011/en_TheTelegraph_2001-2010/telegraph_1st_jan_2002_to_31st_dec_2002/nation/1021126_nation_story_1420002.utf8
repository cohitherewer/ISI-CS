		 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 				 Wanted PMK chief gives up
																								Chennai, Nov. 25: G.K. Mani, president of the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), an ally of the NDA at the Centre, was lodged in Chennai Central jail today after he surrendered before the chief metropolitan magistrate, ending a week-long police search, reports our special correspondent. 																								Mani, also a member of the Tamil Nadu Assembly, along with another MLA, Kaduvetti Guru, and 12 PMK functionaries, were wanted by the police for allegedly assaulting retired judge Thangamani.																								Thangamani heads a trust that manages properties and runs a chain of educational institutions.																								Angry over the inadequate representation of the Vanniyar community, a backward class, in the trusts governing body, Mani and his party members allegedly tried to prevent Thangamani from attending a meeting of trustees.																								The retired judge lodged a complaint and Madras High Court directed the arrest of those involved in the incident. 																								In a surprising move, Mani surrendered before the chief metropolitan magistrate this morning. The PMK leader has been remanded in judicial custody till December 5. 																								 Mani, before being taken to prison, told reporters that the charges against him were politically motivated and claimed that he was not present at the scene of the incident mentioned in the first information report. I have surrendered in this case in the hope that the court will do me justice, he said.

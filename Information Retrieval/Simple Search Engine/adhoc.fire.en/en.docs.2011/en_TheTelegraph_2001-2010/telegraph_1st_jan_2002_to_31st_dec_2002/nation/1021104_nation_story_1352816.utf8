																								Silicon Valley, Nov. 3 (PTI): Nine Indian women have filed a $100 million lawsuit against an Indian-American landlord and restaurateur and his two sons for allegedly smuggling them into the US and forcing them to have sex and provide cheap labour.																								The 74-page civil complaint, filed on behalf of the women in the age group of 17 to mid 20s in the Alameda county superior court in Oakland last week, accused Lakireddy Bali Reddy, 65, and four of his relatives of taking part in an international criminal conspiracy of sex trafficking and forced labour.																								Our suit aims to dismantle the sex traffickers criminal empire in the Bay area and India, the San Jose Mercury newspaper quoted their lawyer Michael Rubin as saying. Hearings in the case begins next month.																								Lakireddy bali reddy is already serving an eight-year term for his role in a scheme to illegally bring young village women from Velvadam in Andhra Pradesh to the bay area to work at his apartment complex, restaurants and construction sites.																								The women were also forced to have sex with Reddy and his sons, the paper said. Last year, Reddy paid $2 million to four victims, after pleading guilty to two counts of transporting minors for illegal sex.																								His son, Vijay Lakireddy, is awaiting sentencing on immigration fraud, and another son, Prasad Lakireddy is scheduled to go to trial in January on federal charges stemming from the scheme.

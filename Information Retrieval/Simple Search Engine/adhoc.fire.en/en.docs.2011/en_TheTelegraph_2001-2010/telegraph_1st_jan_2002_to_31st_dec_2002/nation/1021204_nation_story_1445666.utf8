																								Chennai, Dec. 3: Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa complained of severe low back ache yesterday, prompting doctors to advise her medication and strict bed rest for the next four days.																								The Apollo Hospitals here said Jayalalithaa complained of the back pain while bending last morning at her residence, a likely reoccurrence of the severe low back ache that had afflicted her in the past, reports our special correspondent. She complained of low back ache while sitting and turning to the left or right side, the hospital said. 																								The doctors advised Jayalalithaa to take rest at her residence in order to avoid any further strain, as this would aggravate her problem. The suggestion was made when the chief minister decided to visit the hospital for a medical check-up.																								The hospital described Jayalalithaas condition as asymmetric facet joint of LS-S1 on the left side with degeneration of the inter-vertebral discs at L4-L5 and LS-S1.																								Several colleagues in the state Cabinet organised special puja in various temples, praying for her quick recovery.																								Amma suffered similar symptoms in 1997, when she was administered medication and confined to bed for 24 days.

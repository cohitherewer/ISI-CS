		 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 Power sparks in House
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 18: The Orissa Assembly adjourned thrice today as the uproar over the presence of three officials of the US-based AES Transpower Ltd in the officers gallery continued for the second day. 																								As soon as the House convened, Opposition members stormed the well, demanding the resignation of energy minister Suryo Patra. The pandemonium forced the Speaker to scrap zero hour. With the Opposition in an unrelenting mood, the energy minister expressed regret for yesterdays incident. Tempers cooled soon after. 																								Yesterday, the House was adjourned five times after BJP MLA Balgopal Mishra spotted the AES representatives in the officers gallery and drew the Speakers attention. The House was then discussing the Orissa Power Generation Corporation in which AES holds 49 per cent stake. The members demanded Patras resignation and removal of AES from the power generation sector.

The fire, which broke out at 12.22 pm on the mezzanine floor of the 14-storeyed Manohar Aamdar Nivas in south Mumbai, soon spread to the first floor, gutting the wooden furniture, electric wires and installations stored in the area, sources said.

The hostel is frequented by MLAs from other constituencies as well as government officials. 				 																																																	Two persons, who suffered respiratory problems, owing to the thick smoke were rushed to GT Hospital. Panic spiralled when the lift in the building stopped working and the density of the smoke increased, leading to commotion. 				 																																																	Many women and elderly people were spotted getting down the snorkel or being lifted with the help of cranes. Several people were given breathing apparatus to prevent problems due to the heavy smoke.				 																																																	Four fire engines, four water tankers and an ambulance were rushed to the spot to control the blaze, which was extinguished by 2 pm. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained.

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: The Supreme Court today appointed a watchdog committee to monitor the affairs of the Medical Council of India (MCI), assailed by allegations of corruption, especially in appointments and granting recognition to private medical colleges. 																								A division bench of Justice M.B. Shah and Justice D.M. Dharmadhikari relieved the Delhi High Court-appointed administrator, Maj. Gen. (retd) S.P. Jhingon, and asked MCI vice-president Keshavan Kutty Nayar to head the panel. 																								Elected council president Ketan Desai was removed by the high court after Nayar moved a petition against him. The Supreme Court directed the CBI to file a report on the allegations of corruption against Desai. The judges said the CBI should either file a closure report or chargesheet Desai. Former solicitor-general Harish Salve, the amicus curae in the case, told the court that there was no proper explanation for the gifts received by Desai. 																								The apex court appointed N. Rangabhashyam, neurologist P.N. Tandon, orthopaedic Bhab Sali and former vice-chancellor of the Rajiv Gandhi Health University S. Kantha as members of the watchdog committee. 																								The judges also asked the Centre to take immediate steps to deal with the situation arising out of vacancies in the MCI.

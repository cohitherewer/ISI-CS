		 Tuesday, September 24, 2002 				 Temple plea to Kalam
																								New Delhi, Sept. 23: Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav today urged President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to direct Uttar Pradesh Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri to issue a fresh notification in the Ayodhya case, rectifying the technical fault so that action can be taken against deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, Union ministers Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti and others accused, reports our special correspondent.																								Yadav led a six-member party delegation to Rashtrapati Bhavan and submitted a three-page letter, which alleged that chief minister Mayavati was a puppet in the hands of the BJP-led government at the Centre. We demand that you use your good offices and responsibility to direct the UP Governor that he re-issue the notification issued by his predecessor and at the same time rectify the discrepancies in it, the letter said.																								Lashing out at the Mayavati government for refusing to issue a fresh notification, the letter alleged it was trying to protect the murderers of democracy from the arms of the law, legal proceedings and making a mockery of the Constitution.																								Talking to reporters after meeting the President, Yadav alleged large-scale misappropriation of funds by the Mayavati government in construction of the Ambedkar memorial and park and demanded an inquiry by the CAG.																								He also accused the state government of unnecessarily spending crores of rupees in the name of Bababsaheb Ambedkar while claiming that it did not have funds to provide drought relief.																								The Samajwadi chief, who is trying to warm up to the Congress, also attacked the Mayavati government for grabbing land allotted for the Indira Gandhi Foundation and making it part of the Ambedkar memorial. This can only be the work of fundamentalist elements, he said.																								The Samajwadi described Indira as a woman who sacrificed her life for the secular fabric of the country. In the letter, the party sought the Presidents intervention in getting the land back for the Indira Gandhi memorial.

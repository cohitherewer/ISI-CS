		 Tuesday, October 08, 2002 				 US pastor sparks strike
																								Srinagar, Oct. 7 (Reuters): Kashmirs main city ground to a halt today, going on strike on the eve of the last round of elections over a US preacher branding the Prophet Mohammad a terrorist.																								Shops, businesses and schools were closed in Srinagar during the strike called by the Kashmir Traders Federation and supported by religious and social groups.																								The protest was sparked by a newspaper report quoting Reverend Jerry Falwells comments to the American network CBS.																								The Baptist pastor said he thought Islams most sacred religious figure was a terrorist and had read enough... by both Muslims and non-Muslims (to decide) he (the Prophet) was a violent man, a man of war, a CBS web site report of a 60 Minutes interview quoted him as saying.																								The All Parties Hurriyat Conference described the remarks in a statement as a war against humanity and called Christians terrorists. They wreaked havoc in Vietnam, killed innocent people in Iraq and are responsible for the killings of Palestinians, the Hurriyat said.

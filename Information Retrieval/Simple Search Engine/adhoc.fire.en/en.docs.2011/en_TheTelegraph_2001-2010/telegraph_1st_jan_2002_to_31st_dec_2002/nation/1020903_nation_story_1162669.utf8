		 Tuesday, September 03, 2002  Nation at a Glance				 																Indian schoolgirl killed in Durban				 																																																	 durban (PTI): A 14-year-old schoolgirl of Indian origin has become the latest victim of brutal attacks against the community sweeping the city.				 																																																	The victim, identified as Lovisha Persad of Reservoir Hills suburbs, was stabbed in a park during the weekend. She had almost 40 stab wounds on her body, police said.				 																																																	She was sent by her parents to the local shop when the incident took place, police superintendent Glen Nayager said, adding that the young girl was abducted while she was returning home from the shop.				 																																																	We do not suspect robbery as a motive for the killing as she was still wearing a gold chain and a wrist watch when her body was found, he said.				 																																																	The latest murder has taken the number of people of Indian origin killed in the area over the past two months to 20.				 																																																	The incident follows the murder of three friends by hijackers in Chatsworth in Durban last week. Clive Pillay, Louis Govender and Sandy Pillay were beaten up, stabbed and shot dead after a meeting outside a cricket stadium in the predominantly Indian working class township.

It was during this period he came in close contact with Shakeel, Mohammed said.				 																																																	After this, when the underworld shifted its base to Dubai, Mohammed continued to maintain contact with them and became a full fledged property dealer in 1996.				 																																																	Because of Mohammeds contacts with the underworld, he started dealing in disputed properties and got favourable settlement in favour of his clients, Chand said.

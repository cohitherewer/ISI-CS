 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Nov. 17: Five members of the Peoples Guserrilla Army were killed today in a police encounter in the Ilaram forests of Eturnagaram, about 125 km from Warangal.																								Anti-Naxalite police raided the border villages of the forest range in the early hours on a tip-off that a plenary session of PGA and Peoples War Group activists of Karimnagar, Warangal and Khammam would take place there.																								According to a Warangal police officer, Nagi Reddy, after nearly two hours of exchange of fire, the Naxalites were overcome. While five died, the rest escaped amidst heavy firing. The police seized 11 weapons, including two AK-47s, incriminating materials and several gunny sacks.																								This is the first major encounter since last month wherein the PGA had taken a heavy toll.																								The Committee of Concerned Citizens and the Peace Initiative Committee demanded an end to encounters to create a conducive atmosphere to initiate dialogue with the Naxalites. They urged the state government to take the initiative to resume talks.

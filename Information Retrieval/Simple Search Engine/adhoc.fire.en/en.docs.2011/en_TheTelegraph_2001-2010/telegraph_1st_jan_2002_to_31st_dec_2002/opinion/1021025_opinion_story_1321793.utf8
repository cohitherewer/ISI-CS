				 	 THE DAPURI DRAWINGS (Mapin, Rs 1,950) is the product of as much diligence on part of H.J. Noltie, the immensely talented botanist who brought out (and later investigated) the drawings from the Cuttings Collection of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, as the devotedness of a wife, Mehroo Dinshaw, who prompted the research in the memory of her departed husband. Together, they are responsible for a major work that recounts the history of Dapuri, a short-lived botanical garden in the Bombay Presidency, the life of a pioneering forester, Alexander Gibson, and the 26-month-long work of an unknown Portuguese-Indian artist in 1847-50 whose raw talent continues to fascinate the most discerning lover of art. The calumba here forms part of a rich collection of drawings of plants, mainly Indian but also other exotic ones from afar, that was later arranged to form Bombay Flora by Gibson and Nicholas Dalzell.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, November 08, 2002  Paperback Pickings				 																There will be a huge pyramid in heaven pervez (HarperCollins,  Rs 295) by Meher Pestonji is a novel that spans  the period between the demolition of the Babri Masjid  and the Gujarat carnage. With a great sensitivity, and  some reasonably good writing, Pestonji traces the private  and political maturing of Pervez, a fiercely secular Parsi  whose marriage has failed. This is a deeply well-meaning  book which brings over, from a journalistic career, social  and political values, most of which are in crisis in contemporary  India. But it does have sentences like, Without protests  the steaming communal cauldron would erupt into larger  confabulations. The author then goes on to describe her  protagonist as inwardly raging over the helplessness  of civil society in the face of organised crime. Laudable  sentiments that might redeem Indian society, but perhaps  not Indian fiction.  the corrections (Fourth  Estate,  6.99) by Jonathan Franzen is a rather  weighty bestseller which has been described in superlative  terms all over the front and back covers. But blurbs are  blurbs, and one quickly gets into a long novel set in  one of the gerontocratic American suburbs. Enid and  Alfred Lambert have three grown-up children. Alfred has  Parkinsons disease, and the novel ends with his death.  The recognitions and revolutions undergone by the Lamberts,  especially by Enid, make up the novels great bulk, and  its claim to greatness. Lambent sentimentality  the  hallmark of American popular culture  can be found here  in dollops. Perfect for Hollywood schmalz  with Susan  Sarandon as Enid. She was glad, if nothing else, to have  his body back. Shed always loved his size, his shape,  his smell, and he was much more available now that he  was restrained in a geri chair and unable to formulate  coherent objections to being touched. He let himself be  kissed and didnt cringe if her lips lingered a little,  he didnt flinch if she stroked his hair. god on god (Penguin,  Rs 195) by Scott MacGregor collects a series  of in-depth interviews with god on just about everything  upheld by a conservative, god-fearing Christian society.  Justifying the ways of god to man has occasionally produced  great epics. But MacGregor is not quite a Milton, and  ends up writing a series of happy-clappy Jehovahs Witnesses  type catechisms with a god who is anti-abortion, approves  of sex only when it is practised by a man and a woman  within wedlock, and would thoroughly endorse Operation  Enduring Freedom or Infinite Justice or Smoke Em Out  or whatever it is called at the moment. The Devil must  be fought, and laws may be broken in order to do so. There  is a description of heaven which reminds one of the futuristic  glass pyramid at the Louvre: It is huge  almost unimaginably  huge. It is in the shape of a pyramid, with a base of  nearly six million square kilometres and an apex over  2000 kilometres high...there is a lot of open parkland.  Penguin could perhaps rein in a bit when it comes to such  epiphanies. gods mischief (Penguin,  Rs 275) by M. Mukundan is Prema Jayakumars  English translation of a best-selling Malayalam novel  written by a reputed and prolific contemporary Malayalam  writer. The setting is idyllic Mayyazhi, after its French  colonizers have left. There is of course the ghost of  Malgudi everywhere. This is an important fictional exploration  of colonialism. The sound of the siren from the ship  that carried the whites away had fallen on her ears like  a scream of despair. Father Alphonse slept near her with  his mouth slightly open. His long hair, which resembled  copper wire, lay awry. That night when the history of  the land was being rewritten, he had slept peacefully  like a small child. The children of Mayyazhi gathered  round him in his sleep.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, December 07, 2002  Letters to Editor				 																Reality check				 																																																				Sir  Are the Mumbai police so naive as to expect Shah Rukh Khan and Rakesh Roshan to admit in open court that they received calls from Chhota Shakeel and Abu Salem (Bollywood balks at belling mafia Dec 5)? In order to secure the cooperation of film personalities in any investigation into the underworld, the police would first have to ensure their safety. Much would also depend on whether the stars themselves would be able to give up their greed for money for the sake of justice. Given the completely unethical way in which the film business is run, that seems an impossible proposition.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Maya Sengupta, Calcutta

				 																Strike out				 																																																				Sir  The uncompromising attitude of the striking lawyers is a painful reminder of the time when militant trade unionism used to be rampant in West Bengal. In a democracy, a strike is usually the last resort. The lawyers should have tried to negotiate with the government before taking the decision to cease work. Even now, when the government has agreed to partially roll back the court fees, lawyers insist on first seeing the policy on black and white before they withdraw their agitation (Court fee on tinker table, Dec 6). The issue seems to have already acquired political colour, given the presence of Trinamool Congress leaders at state bar council meetings. Which indicates that despite the government climb down, the strike might persist.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Phani Bhusan Saha, Balurghat

				 																																																				Sir  The ongoing strike of lawyers in West Bengal, pro-testing against the court fee hike has tarnished the image of the judiciary. As the editorial, Fee booked (Nov 25), points out, they have ended up inconveniencing those whose interests they are claiming to represent. Besides increasing the hardship of litigants, the strike has resulted in the piling up of work. Besides, the hike is more than justified given that the state government has not raised fees for more than 30 years and the financial crunch makes it imperative now.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Naren Sen, Howrah

				 																																																				Sir The report, Lawyer strike ignites jail mutiny (Dec 4), bears ominous portents for the future. If the impasse between lawyers and the state government continues, there might be similar disruptions in other jails. Approximately, 10 bail petitions are moved in the city civil and sessions courts every day and about 100 in the Alipore court. The strike has compelled prisoners, who could have otherwise been released on bail, to stay on in prison. This is a violation of the legal and constitutional rights of prisoners. It is imperative that a balance is struck before the situation worsens further.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Mitul Deb, Calcutta

				 																Identity crisis				 																																																				Sir  Despite the introduction of voters identity cards a few years ago, the ration card continues to be demanded as proof of ones identity and nationality. One requires it for opening a savings account in a nationalized bank, or for the admission of ones child in a school. The importance of this card seems a little ridiculous today. 				 																																																				One hopes that the government of India would consider replacing the ration card with a multi-purpose identity card from birth. This could serve as a voters identity card when a person reaches the age of 18. Ration cards could be issued only to people who live below the poverty line to enable them to get subsidized foodgrains and other essential commodities. This would put an end to the misuse of ration cards and help streamline the public distribution system at the same time. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Kanwaljit Singh, 

				 																																																				Calcutta				 																																																				Sir  Recently, I found myself in a situation where I had to provide proof of my identity. However, like thousands of others in this country, I do not have a driving licence, a voters identity card or a ration card. It is shameful that even after 55 years of independence, the people of this country have not been provided with proper citizenship papers as proof of nationality. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V.K. Moorthy, Sandur

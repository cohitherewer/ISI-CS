The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, December 21, 2002  Letters to Editor				 																Why deny a rightful share?				 																																																				Sir  Some set advantages if you happen to be a male  you can deny to have fathered your child, but the law will allow you enough leeways to make up for the sin. You can either pay up later and wash your hands of the matter (as in the case of Steve Bing, I dont want your 1.8m, angry Liz tells Bing, Dec 19) or you can marry the woman you have raped and impregnated (as in the case of Rajendra Mushahary in Assam). But should there not be a law for the prosecution of men who lie in such contested paternity cases? Elizabeth Hurley then would have automatically got the money Bing now so condescendingly gives her.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Choudhury, Calcutta

				 																Smoked out				 																																																				Sir  The report, Bush packs two dozen on CIAs licence-to-kill list (Dec 16), shows that the Bush administration while trying to hide its failure in the war against terrorism, also wishes to give Americans something to look forward to in the new year. Ever since 9/11, the Bush administration has consistently failed to live up to the expectation it has created among the public about smoking out the terrorists involved. The list is just another attempt to prove that it is still working hard at its goal. But Osama bin Laden remains for the United States of America the elusive foe he was before. The Bush administration, apprehending that the citizens will soon demand a justification for the increasing defence expenditure, is merely diverting attention before an accusing finger is raised at it.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bijoy Ranjan Dey, 

				 																																																				Guwahati				 																																																				Sir  George W. Bush may be the president of the worlds most powerful country and deliver lengthy speeches on how America will not spare any terrorist. But this does not compensate for the fact that Osama bin Laden has made him look like a consummate fool. In trying to prove his point, Bush has managed only to ravage Afghanistan. Perhaps Bush should have engaged James Bond to kill the accused in Americas war against terrorism, and perhaps in double quick time.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is sad to see the United Nations become a toy in the hands of the US. The security council has been armtwisted into consenting to the re-inspection of Iraq. And Strobe Talbotts recent statements show that the US is ready to go ahead with a unilateral operation if Iraq slips on any count. This is only a reflection of the fact that the US is obsessed with showing off its power and is looking for excuses to extend its influence to other countries, either through war or imposition of its policies. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Ghulam Rasul, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It was amusing to read Ranganaths views on Sarmila Boses article, Hitlers willing executioners (Hate them not, Dec 18). Perhaps his views are so singularly at odds with that of the rest on the pages of The Telegraph because of his location in the most anti-secular and prejudice-ridden country in the world  the US. Fulmination against leftists, Muslims and secularism characterize his present country to a measure unknown outside of Israel today. Only the other day, the US tried unsuccessfully to scuttle the UN population conference in Bangkok by opposing the use of condoms, ostensibly in favour of abstinence (what planet do Americans live in?). It is already set to attack Iraq over evidence that would prove inadequate even to convict a petty thief. People like Ranganath need India to be like Bushs America, and the sad thing is that their wish just might be granted.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shyamal Bagchee, 

				 																																																				Canada, via email				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  It seems that The Telegraph thrives on biases and prejudices. If Bharat Bhushans article, The specificities of Gujarat (Dec 19), was biased, as R. Chatterjee asserted (A community votes, Dec 20), the editorial, Death row (Dec 20) was equally biased against Bengalis.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Agarwal, Calcutta

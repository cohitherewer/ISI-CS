The Telegraph - Jamshedpur
		 Sunday, December 15, 2002  DIARY
				 																																																																														 Laloo Prasad Yadav has been going places of late. Scripted into the Gujarat campaign on the side of the secularists, Bihars rustic charmer put the fear of Ram into the BJP by using the latters rhetoric against it. Matching Narendra Modi, provocation for provocation, Laloo said he was Lord Krishna on the way to Dwarka to rid the state of Kansa (Modi), and that Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti were Soorpanakhas. The mythology was a bit confused, but the crowds assembled to hear his Bhojpuri-tinged harangue werent complaining. It hasnt, however, been entirely a cakewalk for the Bihari leader. He landed in Ahmedabad airport to a crowded reception arranged by his local acolytes. The rented crowd began dutifully shouting, Desh ka neta kaisa ho  Laloo Prasad jaisa ho, as the visiting VIP walked into the lounge. But the people who put together the crowd must have gone wrong somewhere, or perhaps the crowd had its own sense of humour, for some of them soon began chanting  Jis ke jeb mein paisa ho. But Gujarat has not been the limit of Laloos explorations  he has also been learning all about information technology lately. Taken in by the wonders of the web, Laloo dashed off an e-mail to all MPs. In answer, however, he got a big lecture from a Karnataka MP on the finer points of governance in Bihar. Taken aback, Laloo however, did not lose his wit. But I am no longer the chief minister of Bihar, the states first husband said plaintively, adding that he had expected better general knowledge from net-savvy MPs.				 																																																																														 If you have been chief minister once, its difficult to be satisfied being a mere agriculture minister. Ask Rajinder Kaur Bhattal. But the lady has now found a simple method of getting back at her successor, Amarinder Singh. All invitations, banners, posters, going out in her name describe her as a former CM  nowhere is her current office mentioned. Amarinder is miffed and has even complained to the party high command  only Sonia Gandhi was too amused to intervene. 				 																																																																														 Sonia Gandhi however does not seem too good at keeping her own house in order. On December 9, her birthday, the quiet of the corridors of 10 Janpath was broken by a shrill argument between two women  Saroj Khaparde, a former MP and a blue-eyed girl of Indira Gandhi, and Archana Dalmiya, her assistant. The issue  who should walk with Sonia Gandhi when she held court at 10 Janpath. Catfights again?				 																																																																														 Hotelier Lalit Suri, newly elected to the Rajya Sabha, has already made his presence felt. Call it the enthusiasm of a first-timer, Suri made a few telling contributions to the debate on disinvestment. Carpers, of course, were of the opinion that as one of the beneficiaries of divestment, Suri should have kept his mouth firmly shut. A few days later, he did it again. This time he interrupted Jaswant Singh, as he was answering questions, to ask when the FM would grant the hotel industry some tax relief. The former armyman, turning his patrician nose at the distraction, bellowed, I cannot answer this question, and sat down. Serves Suri right. It does not help to dress up self-interest, at least quite so blatantly, as public service, does it?				 																																																																														 Scribes covering the Gujarat elections were shocked when they reached Mehsana to cover an important rally. Enthusiastic partyworkers gave them an entry pass and an envelope  in which were four crisp Rs 100 notes. Some of them protested at such blatant bribery, but were assured by the local journos that it was standard practice. Unconvinced, some Delhi-based reporters even went to the party office in Gandhinagar to lodge a protest. The office-bearer there was extremely apologetic. But how can that be. There should have been five notes there. Someone has cheated us, he moaned. The complainants could barely keep a straight face.				 																																																																														 An up-and-coming singer in Bollywood is spending sleepless nights these days, worried that he might be losing his voice. The Kumar Sanu-clone cannot afford to do that since he is booked until the middle of next year. He has consulted doctors in Mumbai, but the medicines do not seem to be working. Desperate, he now wants to consult an ENT specialist in home town Calcutta, only he does not have the time to come here. And so he has been calling up doctors, and asking for help. But the doctors plead that they can hardly treat him over the telephone, and anyway the reason is probably stress and he had better stop singing for a while. Now thats one thing our singer cannot afford to do.				 																																																																														 Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has quite a persuasive air about him. He recently rubbed HD Deve Gowda the wrong way when he pipped the former prime minister to ask a question about sugarcane farmers. But the smooth-tongued Priyada soon managed to convince the sulking Gowda that it was beneath his dignity to ask questions in Parliament  he should instead take them up directly with the prime minister. The simple soul that he is, Gowda was convinced.				 																																																																														 The newly-appointed state BJP chief, Tathagata Roy, is not leaving any stone unturned to be accepted by both the rank and file as well as the party bosses who have propped him up. For example, his campwallahs have been spreading the word about how Roy is a sangh parivar guy (in the mould of Swami Vivekananda, perhaps), so deeply religious that he has given up fish. 				 																																													But Roy, whose pet theme has always been ally with the Trinamool to fight the CPI(M), has been lately making rather frequent visits to the administration. The reason  he says he figures on al Qaidas hit list. Roy has apparently even produced letters  in Bengali  to support his demand for greater security for himself and his family. Left leaders are flummoxed. For one, the police can hardly afford to accede to all such requests. And given the recent, rather cosy relation between Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and LK Advani, the left doesnt want to do anything to antagonize Roy. But the entire idea of the al Qaida writing a letter in Bengali is just too hilarious to be taken seriously.

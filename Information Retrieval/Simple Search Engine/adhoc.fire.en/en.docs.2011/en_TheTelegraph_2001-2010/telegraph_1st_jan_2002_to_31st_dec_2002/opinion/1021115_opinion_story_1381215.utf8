The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, November 15, 2002  Paperback Pickings				 																Xanadus of the mind																												on wine and hashish (Hesperus,  5.99) by Charles Baudelaire is Andrew Browns translation of two little gems on addiction, inebriation and creativity by this Parisian master of ennui and spleen  On Wine and Hashish (1851) and The Poem of Hashish (1860). These are ambivalent explorations, in prose, of les Paradis artificiels  Xanadus of the mind, and their relationship with the desolation and complexity of the mundane world. Wine  for which Baudelaire shows a Dionysian enthusiasm  is much less of a problem than hashish. The exotic allure and dangers of hashish take Baudelaire not only to the aestheticist cabal of Le Club des hachichins, but it also pulls him to the Orient. He had actually made an abortive voyage eastwards in 1841, setting out on a packet-boat for Calcutta but returning when he reached Mauritius and Ile de Runion. This voyage may have introduced him to the perils of hashish: Wine elevates the will, hashish annihilates it. Wine is a physical aid, hashish a weapon for the suicidal. Wine makes one good and outgoing. Hashish is isolating.																												one last mirror (Penguin, Rs 200) by Andrew Harvey is a sensitive experiment with fiction as a vehicle of spiritual reflection, even meditation: to look into this last mirror without fear. Harvey is well-read in the writings of Rumi and in Buddhism. He attempts to explore the human implications of these forms of spirituality, especially of the Dhammapada, through the relationship between David, a 20-year-old Englishman in metaphysical despair, and a 70-year-old Sri Lankan woman, Savitri. The novel takes us through a range of voices, from the mystical to the witty, and finishes with a beautifully enigmatic Japanese poem: When, with breaking heart/ I realize/ This world is only a dream/ The oak tree looks radiant.  a  dose of laughter (Penguin, Rs 200) by R.K.  Laxman brings together 100 of this master cartoonists  pieces on doctors, the medical profession and healthcare  in general. These are alternated with a large number of  doctor-related jokes. As expected, Laxmans work is  excellent, although such a prolific cartoonist is bound  to come up with some dispensable work. But the jokes in  this collection are rather poor. They are neither sophisticated,  nor crass, either of which could have made them more bearable:  A doctor was having an affair with a patients wife.  One day the patient rang up sounding frantic. Doctor,  I feel like killing myself, he said. What shall I do?  Without realizing it, the doctor blurted out, Just leave  that to me.

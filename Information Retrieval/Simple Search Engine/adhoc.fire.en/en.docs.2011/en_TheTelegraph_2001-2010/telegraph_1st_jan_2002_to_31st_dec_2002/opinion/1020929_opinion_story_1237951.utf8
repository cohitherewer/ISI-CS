The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, September 29, 2002  Letters to Editor				 																Fixing the suspicion				 																																																				Sir  Being seized by cramps in the middle of destroying his opponents is not evidence enough to infer that a batsman has fixed the match (ICC scanner on retired hurt Gibbs, Sept 27). The International Cricket Council would have to do more than that to convince people that Herschelle Gibbs has been playing truant. Nor can one point a finger at Lance Klusener for being a shadow of his former self, especially when there was the option of leaving him out of the match. What if similar allegations were to be brought against V.V.S. Laxman tomorrow, if India lost a match?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Travel light				 																																																				Sir  I had travelled Air Sahara in the route Mumbai-Delhi-Dibrugarh on April 11 this year. I had booked two suitcases directly from Mumbai to Dibrugarh. On arrival at Dibrugarh airport, I found both my suitcases damaged and lodged a complaint with the ground staff of the airlines at Dibrugarh airport.				 																																																				After repeated reminders, Sahara airlines agreed to repair both the suitcases and I handed them over through a local travel agent, M/S Holidays Travels, Sivasagar, to the airlines office in Dibrugarh on July 23. 				 																																																				Since then, despite repeated requests, Sahara airlines has not returned the suitcases taken for repair, neither has it replied to my reminders. This is hardly expected of a reputed airlines.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  I had taken an Air Sahara flight from Calcutta to Mumbai on August 29. When I reached Mumbai, I found that my bag was missing from the registered luggage. I informed the officer concerned about the missing luggage on the spot and was assured by him that I would be informed by the office regularly about my missing luggage. But every time I have enquired over the phone, I have only been met with a vague reply. 				 																																																				On September 5, I met the manager of the airlines in Mumbai who certified in writing that the Calcutta office had not sent me any bag. The Calcutta office denied that any message had arrived from Mumbai, and requested a weeks time for searching.				 																																																				After a week, the Calcutta office informed me on the phone that Air Sahara would compensate me Rs 2,300 on the basis of the weight of the bag (Rs 450 per kg for 5 kgs). But I had many valuable papers inside my bag, along with Air Saharas cash voucher worth Rs 11,000 and my clothes. 				 																																																				If this is the kind of cooperation and enterprise one finds in an airlines catering to some of the more affluent people of society, it is not hard to guess the plight of the less privileged people in the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Corporate insolence seems to be the trend with the giant airlines of the world, particularly against people from the third world, judging from recent reports.				 																																																				My wife flew British Airways from Sweden to Calcutta via London in September 2001. While in transit at Heathrow, her hand baggage was removed, citing security precautions. After much enquiry, she was assured that the bag would be on the same flight. However, it was not.				 																																																				When she finally retrieved her bag from the luggage bay on September 29, my wife found that most of her valuables had been pilfered. BA, Calcutta discredited her claim and paid a paltry sum a month later, taking refuge under the Warsaw convention. The amount was flatly rejected by us. At that time BA refer- red to the bag as checked luggage.				 																																																				A protest was made on November 20. The general manager of BA apologized for his inability to help and suggested that we write to London, where the problem originated. There has been no response from the customer relations manager in London to my letter dated December 5. Is this the standard of public relations of an international airlines?				 																																																				We were then helped out by an organization, and the BA office in Gurgaon finally admitted that the 7 kg handbaggage was overweight. Was this a case of excess baggage or excess paranoia? After all, BA Stockholm saw no reason for alarm.				 																																																				The attitude of the BA officials is in total contrast to their worldwide campaigns for excellence and warm hospitality. One must be wary of such airlines when travelling, no matter how big and famous they claim to be.

		 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 DEFICIENCIES IN A HEALTH PROGRAMME 
 															- document				 	 Little supervision																								Of six lakh tablet Ethambutal (400 mg) received in August 2000 from Central medical stores, 3.66 lakh tablets were issued between August and November 2000 by the assistant chief commissioner of health (public health and family welfare), Bardhaman. Complaints of reaction like weakness, headache, giddiness, and so on were received and 128,463 tablets were received back by the ACMOH (PH amp; FW). The matter was not investigated into. Again, of 500 patient-wise box, medicines of category I, worth Rs 2.11 lakh, supplied by the government of India between June 2001 and July 2001 for consumption and further issue was stopped on receipt of report from the Medical Store Depot of GOI that the medicines were of substandard quality. Reasons for supply of such substandard medicines were not stated.																								In Howrah, 23 cartons of 7 blister combipack worth Rs 1.70 lakh was lost (June 1997) due to theft. First information report was lodged but final reports were awaited as of July 2001.																								No means were adopted to identify the gap, if any, between chest symptomatic identified during routine visit of the tuberculosis health visitors and the number put under treatment... 																								Monitoring and supervision are of great importance for successful implementation of any programme. Officers of the state tuberculosis cell are required to supervise the district tuberculosis centres once a month and check the activities of district tuberculosis programme rotationally. District tuberculosis officer (ACMOHPH amp; FW) was to visit every quarter all tuberculosis units and block primary health centres in the district. No state level officer paid any visit for the purpose excepting in September and December 2000...ACMOH (PH amp; FW) had never paid any visit to the peripheral health institutes to assess implementation of the national tuberculosis control programme. Regarding the revised national tuberculosis control programme, except in Howrah, nothing regarding monitoring and supervision made by the ACOMH (PH amp; FW), of the reaming test-checked districts were on record. 																								As per resolution adopted in the meeting of the State TB Control Society on December 1, 1000 and June 14, 2000, 4 state level officers were asked to monitor and supervise the TB control programme. Of these, reports of one officer were produced but corrective measure, if any, were not communicated to the districts concerned for taking necessary action. Inadequate monitoring and supervision failed to detect deficiencies, weakness of the programme, if any and to suggest corrective measures for improvement. The matter was referred to the government in October 2001; reply had not been received (January 2002). TO BE CONCLUDED

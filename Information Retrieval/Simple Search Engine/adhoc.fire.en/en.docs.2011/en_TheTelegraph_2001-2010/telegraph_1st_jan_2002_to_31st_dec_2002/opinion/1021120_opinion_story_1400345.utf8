		 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 A COMMITMENT TO SUSTAIN THE INITIATIVE 
 															- Document Extracts from the draft declaration submitted at the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development, September, 2002 Concluded				 	 In all earnestness																								Sustainable development requires a long-term perspective and broad-based participation in policy formulation, decision-making and implementation at all levels. As governments we will continue to work for stable partnerships with the private sector, labour, civil society, and all major groups, respecting the independent and important roles of these social partners.																								We welcome the announcement of a diverse range of new partnership agreements and activities... which form part of the Johannesburg Commitment.																								We recognize that the process of globalization is accompanied by the emergence of leading private sector corporations which have a responsibility to contribute to the evolution of equitable and sustainable communities and societies...																								We therefore agree that there is a need for the private sector to operate within a transparent and stable regulatory environment to reinforce its corporate responsibility and social contribution.																								Accordingly, we agree that the United Nations general assembly should pursue the matter of corporate responsibility and the social contribution of the private sector.																								We undertake to strengthen and improve governance at the local level, for the effective implementation of Agenda 21, the Millennium Development Goals and the Johannesburg Commitment.																								...We agree that womens emancipation and gender equality should be integrated in all activities encompassed within Agenda 21, the Millennium Development Goals and the Johannesburg Commitment. 																								...We urge the promotion of dialogue and cooperation among all the worlds peoples and civilizations, irrespective of race, disabilities, religion, language, culture and tradition.																								We respect human diversity and recognize it as a cause for celebration.																								We reaffirm our commitment to opposing racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination and intolerance.																								We affirm that armed conflict and warfare are inherently inimical to sustainable development.																								We agree to combat terrorism, organized crime and corruption...																								We reaffirm our opposition to foreign occupation and assert the right of all peoples to sovereignty and the control of their natural resources.																								We oppose the denial of food to any people in need, for the achievement of political objectives.																								We further reaffirm the positions contained in the Millennium Declaration regarding the management of UN economic sanctions... 																								To achieve our goals of sustainable development, we need a democratic system of global governance with enhanced and accountable international and multilateral institutions.																								We reaffirm our commitment to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter and international law as well as the strengthening of multi-lateralism.																								We support the leadership role of the UN as the most universal and representative organization in the world, ...best placed to promote sustainable development.																								We further commit ourselves to monitor progress towards the achievement of our sustainable development goals and objectives at regular intervals.																								We stress the need for systematic monitoring of the implementation of Agenda 21, the Millennium Development Goals, and the Johannesburg Commitment...																								We call on the UN general assembly...to institute a follow-up mechanism to facilitate, evaluate and monitor the implementation of the outcomes of the world summit on sustainable development, in accordance with the Johannesburg Commitment. 																								We are in agreement that this must be an inclusive process, involving all the major groups which participated in the historic Johannesburg summit.																								We commit ourselves to act at all levels that are required to save our planet, promote human development and achieve universal prosperity and peace.																								We fully endorse the Johannesburg Commitment on sustainable development and resolve to implement all its elements.																								From the African continent, the cradle of humankind, we declare to the peoples of the world that we are determined to ensure that our collective hope for sustainable development is realized.

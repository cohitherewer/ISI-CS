The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, December 15, 2002  Letters to Editor The other Look at the other side of  the picture  Sir  The front page of The Telegraph showed pictures of two persons who have appeared many times in almost every newspaper (For Gujarat, a time to choose, Dec 12). One of them was once seen begging for his life, tearfully, and the other surely a rioter with his saffron head band and iron rod in hand. While it has been found out that the former is Qutubuddin Ansari,the whereabouts of the latter have not been found out. I wonder why the investigating agencies have not tried to find the latters whereabouts or arrest him. Is it just because he is a Bajrangi?

				 																																																				Sir  However much it may pain secular-minded citizens, the truth is that religion has played a crucial role in the assembly elections in Gujarat. And the person to benefit the most from all this is Narendra Modi. So confident is he of success that he has ignored the central commands diktat to highlight developmental issues. And the BJP leaders, desperate after the debacles in Uttar Pradesh and Kashmir, have given Modi a free run in the state. But if the BJP comes to power this time, it will have to heal the wounds inflicted by Godhra. At least for those few Muslims who voted for it in the last elections. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R.K. Sharma, Kankinara

				 																																																				Sir  Is it not ironical that the party which carried out a pogrom in Gujarat and which shamelessly bragged about its criminal act as the pride of Gujarat, should have the audacity to accuse the opposition of harping on the carnage during the election campaign? The Bharatiya Janata Party is deluding itself if it thinks people will fall for its twisted logic. Hopefully, todays results will prove that Indians are basically peace-loving, though a section may have temporarily acquiesced in the slaughter of innocent citizens of a particular religious belief.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
G. Muhammed, Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir  Vilification has no place in a political campaign (Campaign mud on Gandhi, Nehru amp; Atal, Dec 11). It is people like Dharmendra (I prefer not to add the prefix acharya) who give Hinduism and India a bad name. Dharmendras speech is evidence of the need to ban the VHP.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Gujarat gave us Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, an apostle of peace. Now, 55 years after independence, hate-mongers, openly advocating violence, stalk the state and are even likely to win democratic elections. One can only hope that the preachers of hate will bite the dust in these elections. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
K.R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

				 																																																				Sir  Narendra Modi must remember the fate of Kalyan Singh, who as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh became the champion of communal forces after the Babri Masjid demolition. But he slipped from the political ladder soon after. Though this did not happen to L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti, there is no guarantee that the communal card will ultimately not go against the interests of the National Democratic Alliance government. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Political commentators have been mystified by the Congresss tame reaction to the BJPs hard-line Hindutva stance during the Gujarat campaign. But then secularism has always been a political strategy more than an ideological commitment in Gujarat. 				 																																																				The Congresss appeasement of Muslims has only gone so far as to nominate a few as presidents or vice-president of the country. Babri Masjid is singular proof of how wrong-headed the Congresss practice of secularism has been.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mohammed Noman, Hyderabad

				 																																																				Sir  The English and the electronic media were very enthusiastic about the Gujarat poll campaigns of Sonia Gandhi and Laloo Prasad Yadav. But the audience in Yadavs rallies clearly did not take him seriously. Most had a few laughs and then left. The media also portrayed Sonia Gandhi as powerful enough to stem the Hindutva wave. But the Congress president probably also realizes that the Hindu wave sweeping Gujarat is difficult to resist. That is why senior party leaders were kept away. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

		 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 THE MYSTERY OF UNCLE HO
 							 - Was the real Ho Chi Minh a communist or a nationalist? Mahesh Rangarajan				 	 Revolutions grand old man																								Ho Chi Minh: A Life By William J. Duiker, Theia, $16.95																								When a leading Indian communist asked the ageing Indo-Chinese veteran of revolution why Vietnam had had a revolution but not India, the latter was typically incisive. You had Gandhi, he said, but here I am Gandhi. The charm of Ho Chi Minh has not dimmed more than four decades after his death, even if, as this biography shows, the air of mystery remains.																								Six years after his death, when North Vietnamese tanks smashed the gates of the presidential palace in Saigon, his successors renamed the southern city in his honour. By then, Vietnam had faced down not one but as many as three adversaries: the colonizing French and then the Americans, and never to be forgotten, the Chinese who had for many centuries seen Indo-China as a southern promontory of their cultural zone in Asia.																								More than any other single individual, Ho Chi Minh came to embody that spirit of resistance. In his own lifetime, he had not one, not two, but as many as fifty, aliases. Nguyen Ai Quoc was the most famous, but in 1945, the man himself denied there was any identity, perhaps to confuse his enemies. As a communist in the early 20th century from a colony, he had a tough time making himself heard first in the higher councils of the Soviet-dominated Comintern and then in the echelons of Chinese revolutionaries.																								The latter chapter is explored in this fascinating book for the first time. It shows a Ho Chi Minh who cooperated with and drew from Chinese communists even as he kept his own freedom of manoeuvre. There is a telling comment on how he viewed the choice for Vietnamese nationalists. It was the aftermath of the departure of the Japanese at the end of World War II. The French, he felt, were a lesser evil, while the Chinese if let in through the door would stay on for centuries. But the contest of what he called the tiger and the elephant with the French did not take long to unfold. Using sources unavailable to earlier scholars, Duiker shows how the Vietnamese leadership often wavered before making its choices. But Ho Chi Minhs faith in Vo Nguyen Giap led to the historic surrender of the garrison at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. A little over a decade later, US marines landed at Da Nang in the south, inaugurating a stage of the war that Ho Chi Minh did not live to see to the bitter end.																								He proved a far more adept leader in war and in the struggle for freedom than in his stewardship of the economy. Often, new-fangled Chinese ideas of collective agriculture were pursued top-down with disastrous results. Vietnams own leaders often erred, as Ho did in under-estimating Ngo Dinh Diem who was a capable and ruthless leader of the south, even if overthrown by his American allies and his own generals. What was the real Ho Chi Minh: an ardent nationalist or a communist? The mystery will remain to the end. There is little doubt that a fierce anti-colonialism led him towards Marxism. But there is more evidence now than ever before that he was a tactician of the highest order, willing to modify his ideology to a complex and difficult situation.																								Partly because of his magnetism and charisma, he could bind together diverse factions and play off one great power against another. At significant moments, his personal diplomatic skills were brought to play in dealings with Mao and Stalin, and to far lesser effect, the French. The Fifties and the early Sixties seem a time when he controlled the Vietnamese party and the governmental apparatus. He not only kept the country aloof from the consequences of the Sino-Soviet split, but also prepared it for the coming conflict with America. By the time the underground war in the south really began, the ageing Ho Chi Minh was more a symbol rather than a source of power. But his ability to reach out to the common folk and his iconic status made him more than an empty emblem. The personal picture of his life is in stark contrast to several other leaders of the pantheon of revolution such as Stalin or Mao. He lived simply, with minimal security and extensive contacts with the rural Vietnamese.																								In an irony of history, the party overruled his objections to the embalming of his body. The museum that bears his name was only completed in 1990. Not much later the edifice of the Soviet bloc with which Vietnam was identified in the Cold War came apart. With his own successors taking aboard market reforms, his memory, as a prophet of revolution, is a fading one. The idea of a socialist society in a growing hub of Asian capitalism seems a far cry. Even the one-party state looks more like several other Asian polities and less like a creation of communism.																								In this, Duiker recognizes that for all the painful chapters of his legacy, Ho Chi Minhs life will stand out as unique. His other legacy, of a unified Vietnam and one that is a power to reckon with in Indo-China has outlasted communism. Duiker does not kill the mystery of Uncle Ho but he brings us closer to the man and his life than anyone else has. This is a book that will be difficult to surpass for a long time to come. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

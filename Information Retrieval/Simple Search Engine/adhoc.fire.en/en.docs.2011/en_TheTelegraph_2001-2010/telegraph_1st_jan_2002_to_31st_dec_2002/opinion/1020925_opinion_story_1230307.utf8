		 Wednesday, September 25, 2002 				 THOSE WHO STILL REMAIN ON THE FRINGES
 															- Document Extracts from the report of the CAG of India for the year ended March 2001, Vol 1. (Civil) To be concluded				 	 Outsiders																								For proper implementation of the programme, the state government decided (1988) to place the entire non-formal education section under the school education directorate at the disposal of mass education extension directorate. However, as the deputy director, MEE directorate had no supporting staff and was alone looking after the work of NFE in addition to his duties, the inspection, monitoring and supervision of the non-governmental organizations was totally inadequate and even absent in some areas.																								Malpractices by NGOs: the government of India requested the state government to review the performance of NGOs in the field of NFE while considering further release of grants by GOI. But no such review was performed by the state government in spite of the directives of GOI. Scrutiny revealed the following:																								a) One NGO (Calcutta Urban Service Consortium) received grants of Rs 34.07 lakh from GOI for running 100 NFE centres in Uluberia-I block during 1995-2000. On enquiry it was found by the directorate of MEE officers, Howrah that no NFE centre was run by the NGO in that block which had been corroborated by the block development officer, Uluberia-I and sabhapati, panchayat samity of the block.																								b) In South 24 Paraganas, the DMEEO observed (November 1997) in his inspection reports that in Kulpi block, four centres were found non-functional on the date of his visit. In some other centres, learners were manipulated by collecting them from formal schools where attendance was 25 to 30 per cent of enrolment. Besides the NGO was using its own publication instead of approved books of the government. He further added that the NGO was furnishing fictitious names and figures of the learners present in the centre which at the time of his visit did not appear in the relevant attendance register. However, the DMEEO, South 24 Parganas, could not provide details of the activities of the other two NGOs in the district.																								Performance of NGOs: test-check of nine NGOs in 7 districts  Sri Ramkrishna Satyananda Ashram, Samatat Sanstha, Ichapur Janakalyan Parshad, Basirhat Women Development Society, CUSCON, Paschim Banga Kheria Sabar Kalyan Samiti, Tagore Society for Rural Development and District Resource Units at Bardhaman and Birbhum revealed the following																								i) As per survey report conducted by NGOs year-wise position of illiterate and drop-out learners in the age group 6-14 years, learners admitted in NFE centres and passed out, etc, were as follows: it would appear from above that on an average 79 per cent of the targeted group of learners remained outside the ambit of education. Moreover, the percentage of successful learners in evaluation test was only 62 per cent on an average for 3 NGOs while for the others it was only 2 per cent. Thus, the objective of bringing out of school children under NFE education system and subsequently to bring them under mainstream of formal education was largely unachieved. As the remaining three NGOs started functioning since 1999, the course (primary level) was not completed till 1999-2000.																								(ii) (a) Out of 46,105 successful NFE learners of primary and upper primary level, only 5,412 learners (12 per cent) were admitted in upper primary and formal education as shown below: in the case of SRSA and TSRD, flow of primary level to upper primary level was insignificant.																								(b) Number of learners admitted in formal and upper primary school, out of successful learners of NFE centres, were not furnished by CUSCON and SS.... TO BE CONCLUDED

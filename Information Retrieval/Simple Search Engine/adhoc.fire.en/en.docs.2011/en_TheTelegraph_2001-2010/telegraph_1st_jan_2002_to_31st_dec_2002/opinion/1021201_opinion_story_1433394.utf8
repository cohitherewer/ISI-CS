The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, December 01, 2002  Letters to Editor				 																Surely, you must be joking				 																																																				Sir  Ever since he took over as the tenant of White House, George Dubya Bush has been the worlds favourite butt of jokes. He has probably got a little tired of the whole world laughing at his expense (Want to insult Bush? Take his permission, Nov 28). The Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre, which has asked an advertising agency to ask for Bushs permission before taking a dig at him, might save the American president some embarrassment from being ridiculed in television commercials. But can it save Bush from his legendary gaffes, which add colour to his speeches?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
P. Konar, Chinsurah

				 																Death row				 																																																				Sir  The absurdity of the decisions of the Central government and especially the Union home minister, L.K. Advani, comes to the fore every once in a while. The latest instance is the decision to award death penalty to rapists (Govt. favours rape death penalty, women dont, Nov 27). Wouldnt a higher rate of conviction than the current rate of one per cent be of more use? It is ridiculous to talk about death penalties when most of the convicts manage to get away scot-free. Advani and others like him need to realize that there is an even greater need to be more sympathetic to the victim. Capital punishment will be effective only if there is a simultaneous effort to make institutional changes.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Animesh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  Amidst all the debate about giving death penalty to rapists, one aspect seems to have escaped the Centres attention. Rape is also used by women to frame men against whom they might bear a personal grudge. This could be why the proposal has been opposed by many womens organizations. Besides, since Indian law does not distinguish between various degrees of the crime, it would be unfair to treat all rapists with a common penalty. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
D. Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The underlying purpose of the Centres decision on death penalty seems to be to relieve the society of a heinous crime assumed to be beyond reprieve. However, such a drastic step may well complicate matters further for the victim. Besides, commutation of a death sentence is a time-consuming process, and the president of India could soon find himself spending a considerable amount of time deciding the fate of those convicted. The government has to think of alternative and more practical punishments which can effectively deter the offenders.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																Come a cropper				 																																																				Sir  Environmentalists deserve praise for stalling the cultivation of genetically modified mustard that claims to boost yield (Greens force mustard red light, Nov 8). The multinational company that is promoting sales of this crop will have reasons for harping on its merits. But then, it was the same story for cotton too. It is too early to speculate on the extent of damage the use of this crop will cause to the economy in the long run. 				 																																																				Its benefits will temporarily cloud our judgment, but the problems will show up as soon as we grow accustomed to its daily use. Any genetically modified product is bound to come with adverse side-effects. A boost in yields is only one aspect of the story, several doubts about food, environmental and bio-safety have not been removed satisfactorily. Mustard is a highly consumed food crop in India. This should be reason enough to make the concerned authorities think seriously before giving the green signal for the use of this crop.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Arta Mishra, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  Reports in The Telegraph on contract farming, are full of praise for this vision statement (A future crop, Nov 8). The truth is that only a handful of farmers will benefit from such farming. The average size of farm holding for individuals in west India, and most of India, is very small. The farmer will not be left with much after he gives up most of his land for contract farming. Moreover, capital availability for farmers is minimal due to uncertainty of yields. What is needed now is crop insurance for all farmers. Just as insuring property is essential for protection against accidents, a farmers crop yield, being frequently subject to the vagaries of nature, needs to be insured. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
B. Ghosh, Durgapur

		 Wednesday, December 04, 2002 				 TAKING PROPER CARE OF THEM
 															- Document Extracts from the statement of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, December, 1989 To be concluded				 	 Safe and sound																								Article 20: a child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the state. 																								States parties shall, in accordance with their national laws, ensure alternative care for such a child. 																								Such care could include, inter alia, foster placement, kafalah of Islamic law, adoption or if necessary placement in suitable institutions for the care of children. When considering solutions, due regard shall be paid to the desirability of continuity in a childs upbringing and to the childs ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background. 																								Article 21: states parties that recognize and/or permit the system of adoption shall ensure that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration and they shall: 																								Ensure that the adoption of a child is authorized only by competent authorities who determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures and on the basis of all pertinent and reliable information, that the adoption is permissible in view of the childs status concerning parents, relatives and legal guardians and that, if required, the persons concerned have given their informed consent to the adoption on the basis of such counselling as may be necessary; 																								Recognize that inter-country adoption may be considered as an alternative means of childs care, if the child cannot be placed in a foster or an adoptive family or cannot in any suitable manner be cared for in the childs country of origin; 																								Ensure that the child concerned for inter-country adoption enjoys safeguards and standards equivalent to those existing in the case of national adoption; 																								Take all appropriate measures to ensure that, in inter-country adoption, the placement does not result in improper financial gain for those involved in it; 																								Promote, where appropriate, the objectives of the present article by concluding bilateral or multilateral arrangements or agreements, and endeavour, within this framework, to ensure that the placement of the child in another country is carried out by competent authorities or organs. 																								Article 22: states parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure that a child who is seeking refugee status or who is considered a refugee in accordance with applicable international or domestic law and procedures shall, whether unaccompanied or accompanied by his or her parents or by any other person, receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of applicable rights set forth in the present Convention and in other international human rights or humanitarian instruments to which the said states are parties. 																								For this purpose, states parties shall provide, as they consider appropriate, cooperation in any efforts by the United Nations and other competent intergovernmental organizations or non-governmental organizations co-operating with the UN to protect and assist such a child and to trace the parents or other members of the family of any refugee child in order to obtain information necessary for reunification with his or her family. In cases where no parents or other members of the family can be found, the child shall be accorded the same protection as any other child permanently or temporarily deprived of his or her family environment for any reason, as set forth in the present Convention.

		 Wednesday, September 18, 2002 				 TRACKING DOWN CRIME AND CRIMINALS 
 															- Document Extracts from the report of the CAG of India for the year ended March 2001, Vol 1. (Civil) To be concluded				 	 For the record																								The crime criminal information system launched in 1994-95 with an investment of Rs 2 crore to cope with the increasing trend of crime remained unimplemented for over seven years for want of on-line connectivity, absence of state level monitoring, lack of coordination and inadequate training. 																								To overcome the inherent limitations of the existing manual crime record maintenance system and to check organized crime, the ministry of home affairs approved (August 1987) introduction of an on-line computerized system under Modernization of Police Force to facilitate the law- enforcing agencies for speedy and accurate storing, dissemination, retrieval, exchange, monitoring and coordination of crime and criminal information as and when required. The system envisaged installation of computers at the National Crime Record Bureau, State Crime Record Bureaus and all the District Crime Record Bureaus with on-line connectivity.																								The MHA was to provide funds for the scheme as a separate Central sector non-plan grant. As of July 2001, the NCRB supplied 49 computers valuing Rs 172.67 lakh between November 1994 and August 2000. Besides, the MHA provided Rs 15.48 lakh for infrastructural development to the SCRB, West Bengal, out of which Rs 14.76 lakh were spent by the state.																								The state was responsible for introduction of integrated investigation forms and training for which Rs 10.09 lakh and Rs 3.95 lakh were released respectively as of July 2001.																								The scheme, scheduled to be launched in 1991-92, was launched in 1994-95. There had been delay up to 24 months in installing computers supplied between November 1994 and June 1995 by the NCRB. As of July 2001, 7 out of 22 computers supplied during 1994-95 remained non-functional/non-operational and unattended due to absence of any technical personnel which required to have been formed by the SCRB, West Bengal.																								In August 2000 the NCRB further supplied 27 upgraded Pentium-III computers, with modem. As of July 2001, all those computers could not be utilized for the purpose of the CCIS scheme for want of any on-line connectivity.																								Till June 2001, neither were any of the IIFs introduced nor was the DCRB formed by the Calcutta police. Thus, the expenditure of Rs 30.18 lakh on the purchase of computers and Rs 1.14 lakh for infrastructural development became unfruitful.																								In January 1997, only 2 out of 7 types of standardized IIFs (recommended by the NCRB) were introduced in West Bengal (except Calcutta police). As of July 2001 those were still to be provided to the police stations.																								Besides, the SCRB, West Bengal could never achieve the target fixed for imparting training regarding documentation and management of crime records under the CCIS project during 1994-2001. Only 108 police personnel from 442 police stations were trained in IIFs as of July 2001. The SCRB, WB, spent Rs 3.95 lakh for training purposes during 1994-2001.																								Moreover, the absence of a state level monitoring committee, a full time director in the SCRB, WB, or a deputy superintendent/inspector in the DCRBs and absence of any prescribed periodical report/return for submission by the DCRB/SCRB, were indicative of lack of coordination, control and supervision at all levels for which the scheme remained unimplemented in the state for 7 years since launch.																								Due to non-implementation of the CCIS scheme the desired benefits for efficient use of the crime and criminal related information in control, investigation and prevention of crime could not be derived while the crimes pending investigation were increasing every year (from 23,805 cases in 1996 to 39,189 cases in 2000). Besides, several major crimes involving kidnapping and operation of inter-state criminals gangs were reported in the state. Thus, there is urgent need to operationalize the CCIS.																								The matter was referred to the government in August 2001; reply had not been received (January 2002).																								Skewed deployment of police personnel to combat crime resulted in high incidence of crime. Superintendent of police in a district is responsible for ensuring law and order, security, peace and harmony among various communities and people of the district through police personnel deployed in the police stations in the district. ...Effective deployment of police personnel in crime prone area is necessary.

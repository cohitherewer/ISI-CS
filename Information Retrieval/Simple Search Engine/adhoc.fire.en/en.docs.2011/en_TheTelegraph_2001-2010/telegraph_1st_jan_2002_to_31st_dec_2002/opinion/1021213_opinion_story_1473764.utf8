				 	 Lose ends 																								The Evolution of the State Bank of India: the Era of the Imperial Bank of India, 1921-1955 By Abhik Ray, et al, Sage, Rs 1,100 This is the third and concluding  volume of the history of the State Bank of India. The  project to write the history of the bank was begun, if  one remembers rightly, sometime in the Seventies under  the economist Amiya Kumar Bagchi. It has taken more than  20 years to complete and Amiya Bagchi, after writing the  first two volumes, has disappeared from the project. He  does not even get a mention in this volume and there is  no explanation offered about the time spent on the work.  It must have cost an enormous amount of money as well,  all from the taxpayer. This volume follows the standard  set by Bagchi of piling on fact after fact followed by  tardy analysis. It does nobody any credit, neither the  bank which commissioned the study, nor Bagchi who begun  it or the present group which has done its bit to complete  what was left unfinished. The three volumes will stand  as academic monuments to wastage. Come, enjoy the replay  Collected Plays in Translation By Vijay Tendulkar, Oxford, Rs 595 Vijay Tendulkar is one of Indias  foremost playwrights. He writes in Marathi. This collection  brings together his plays for the first time. Outside  Maharashtra, Tendulkars fame rests on his play, Ghashiram  Kotwal, which was immensely popular wherever it was  played. It was an unforgettable theatre experience. In  Calcutta, he is well known because of Bohurupees production  of Silence! The Court is in Session. Tendulkar  is that rare dramatist who successfully brings together  social criticism and entertainment. His social criticism  is more often than not couched in satire with no visible  ideological overtones. This collection, even though one  suspects much of the bite is lost in translation, will  please all who have loved and enjoyed Tendulkars plays  on stage.  To miss the season altogether																								Imperialism, Nationalism and the Making of the Indian Capitalist Class, 1920-1947 By Aditya Mukherjee, Sage, Price not mentioned																								There was a time in the Seventies when economic history was the flavour of the season for historians. Terms like colonialism, under-development, and so on were common and fashionable. Then things changed. But this book was conceived in that earlier period. Its research is solid, the writing stodgy but its preoccupations are somewhat pass. There is a tendency also to emphasize the Indian capitalist classs contradictions with the colonial state rather than the aspects of collaboration. The Indian capitalist class thus appears in Mukherjees analysis as more nationalist than their pragmatism actually made them. It is a pity that this book has been so long in the making. Twenty years ago it would have been taken seriously. Today it will be read by a handful of specialists and then gather dust in library shelves. The author may take pride in the fact that he does not follow intellectual fashions. But does he like being not read?

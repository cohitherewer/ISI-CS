		 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 A STRUGGLE WITH SILENCE
 Gargi Gupta				 	 For an alternative pattern																								The Imam and the Indian By Amitav Ghosh, Permanent Black and Ravi Dayal, Rs 495																								The 18 essays in The Imam and the Indian were written over a 16-year time span  from 1986 to 2002. Which partly explains the eclecticism of this collection. A translation of Tagores Kshudhita Pashan, two essays on the social anthropology of an Egyptian village, an elegy to the Kashmiri poet, Agha Shahid Ali, a travel piece on the Four Corners, some incidental pieces like A Tibetan Dinner and The Ghosts of Mrs Gandhi  the diversity of genres, subjects, dictions would seem much too heterogenous for compilation in a single volume. But for Amitav Ghosh, connections are of greater importance than disjunctions in the imaginative sphere.																								One of these connections, very obviously, is the fact that the pieces were written in the gaps between the novels and hence trace the evolution of the authors interest and ideas that later were transmuted into fiction. Those familiar with Ghoshs fictional career will run into many familiar themes, motifs and characters here. 																								But more notable is Ghoshs fixation with encounters between cultures and the modes of thought they embody. It could result, at times, in scepticism  the Imams suspicion of the doctor al-Hindi, who comes from the land where cows are worshipped and the dead are burnt. Or, it could give rise to conflict like the one between the Navajos and the early settlers in North America. In most cases, the humans caught up in the clash of cultures are unaware of its historical import. Look at Baburs near dislike for the kingdom that he won in the battle of Panipat and which was to earn him a place in history. 																								In the modern world, however, such encounters are almost always violent and throw up a detritus in the form of an uprooted populace. Like the Tibetan monk Ghosh encounters at a New York charity dinner for the Tibetan cause. Some, like Nabeel, are lost to friends and relations forever. Others, like the Sylheti UN peace-keeper entrusted with clearing the Khmer Rouges mines in Cambodia, learn to cope as best as they can and soon become inured to the brutality around them. And most touchingly, Agha Shahid Ali, a resident of the country without a post-office  Kashmir  who must die of cancer in Northampton, denied the right to go back to his homeland in his last days. 																								What comes in the way of peaceful coexistence between two peoples? And what happens to the people caught in the midst of war or civil violence? Are their any alternative patterns of relations between different cultures  one that does not lead to strife? 																								In the present global scenario, the artist cannot but state which side of the political fence he is on. Thus art itself is a political stratagem. As Ghosh writes in The Shadow Lines, Every word I writeis the product of a struggle with silence. And memories of violence, experienced or heard of, a weapon of defiance that helps to destroy the thickening crust of awareness that is both a sign and a reminder of our unwitting complicity in the evolution of violence. Which is why all fundamentalist regimes consider the destruction of literature and art  a way of ordering memory and human values  an article of faith. As every Kashmiri would say with Shahid: Your history gets in the way of my memory/ I am everything you lost. Your perfect enemy.																								Almost all of Ghoshs novels revolve around violence and its human cost. His first novel, The Circle of Reason, was written while the anti-Sikh riots were raging in Delhi. The violence had the effect of bringing to the surface of my memory events from my own childhood, writes Ghosh in The Greatest Sorrow. The same process of recovering memory resulted in The Shadow Lines, Dancing In Cambodia, The Glass Palace																								But it would be unfair to give the impression that these essays work primarily as companions to Ghoshs fiction. They stand perfectly well by themselves, as lucidly argued and engaging as the novels.  copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

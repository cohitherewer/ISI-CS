		 Friday, December 13, 2002  Paperback Pickings				 																As good as riding a camel				 				 			LALLA ROOKH: An Oriental Romance (Rupa, Rs 195) by Thomas Moore is born out of the Romantic movements fascination with the East. From Purchas to Tavernier, accounts of travels in the Orient would be devoured, and all of them fed into works like Lalla Rookh, since none of the poets had direct knowledge of the East. Moore himself relates how, Colonel Ws (the historian of British India), when told that the poet of Lalla Rookh had never been in the East, remarked: That shows me that reading over DHerbelot is as good as riding on the back of a camel. The claims to authenticity are very much in evidence: while Coleridges Abyssinian maid plays on the dulcimer, Moores little Persian maid sings sweetly to the vina. Only the grandeur and scale of Oriental courts could be commensurate with the high narrative ambitions of the poet. The Enchanted Isles (Hesperus,   5.99) by Herman Melville is a series of sketches  written after Melvilles 1841 tour of the Galapagos islands   incidentally, a year after Darwins visit. The islands,  a cross between Prosperos island and the Bermuda Triangle,  are described as Darke, dolefull, dreary, like a greedy  grave/ That still for carrion carcasses doth crave. But  not without a dash of humour: ...tortoises...are of such  a make that if you but put them on their backs you thereby  expose their bright sides...Enjoy the bright, keep it  turned up perpetually if you can, but be honest, and dont  deny the black. The Alchemist (HarperCollins,  Rs 195) by Paulo Coelho is a modern fable,  in the manner of The Little Prince and Jonathan  Livingston Seagull. The hero is Santiago, an Andalusian  shepherd boy who dreams of travelling in distant lands.  He sets out from his home in Spain and, following the  omens as the King had asked him to do, journeys to Tangiers  and Egypt. It is in the deserts of Egypt that he meets  the alchemist. The story teaches us  no points for  guessing  about listening to our hearts, learning to  read omens strewn along lifes path and above all, following  our dreams.																												The Golden Cage (Sterling, Price not mentioned) compiled by Safia Siddiqi translates 12 Urdu short stories by Asian women in Britain. The writers range from organic chemistry postgraduates to employees of BBCs Urdu Service. Some of the stories give sensitive portrayals of expatriate life. But most are the womens magazine fare. The illustrations, redundant as they are, resemble badly executed Hindi film posters.

		 Friday, October 25, 2002  Paperback Pickings				 																Backwards into the future Red poppies (Penguin,  Rs 295) by Alai is the translation, by Howard  Goldblatt and Sylvia Li-Chun Lin, of a Chinese historical  novel which, after some trouble with publishers because  of its political content, got one of Chinas most distinguished  literary awards. Alai is an ethnic Tibetan born in what  was then the northeastern part of the Tibetan autonomous  region and is now western Sichuan. The novel starts in  the Thirties and ends in 1950 with the arrival of the  Red Army. It is narrated by the idiot son of the powerful  chieftain Maichi, who embodies Tibetan aspirations and  raw and uncultured folk wisdom. The historical transition  depicted in the novel runs alongside Maichis ruinous  enslavement to opium cultivation, all framed by the narrators  wisdom masked by stupidity. Sticky whiteness oozed  from poppy berries and gathered in a jiggly mass before  falling to the ground. The poppies squeezed out their  white sap as if the earth were crying. On the verge of  falling, the teardrops hung on small, shiny green berries  that seemed to be choking on sobs, unable to speak. The weretiger: stories of  the supernatural (Penguin, Rs 250) by Shaiontoni  Bose and others provides a fascinating glimpse into  the varied and interconnected world of the Indian supernatural.  This is primarily a world of stories  folktales, fairytales,  superstitions and customs  peopled with monsters, princes,  sages, peasants gods and demons. Apart from being a series  of compelling yarns, what emerges in this collection is  a social history of wishes, fears and fantasies, set in  all kinds of living conditions and historical moments.  The book is well researched, but the academic framework  never obtrudes, emerging tactfully and readably in the  introduction and afterword. Primitive and modern, urban  and rural, native and colonial are some of the oppositions  shaping these tales. 																												the dividing line (Indialog, Rs 195) by Jean Arasanayagam is a collection of short stories by a Dutch Burgher Sri Lankan married to a Tamil. The thread running through these stories is the long civil strife in Sri Lanka, and the displaced, fractured worlds it creates. We have all become spinners of endless sagas which we read in the silence of our utter loneliness. Surrounded by partings, longing to see each others faces. hear each others voices, we inhabit the world of the exile which lies within the Babylon of ourselves. This is pretty much the tone of most of these stories. india (Rupa, Rs 195)  by Pierre Loti was written in 1901 on the sole  premise (attributed to the Indian sages) that you can  only desire that which is different from yourself, that  which you have not. The inevitable end of such desiring  could only be the discovery that the things you seek  are within you, as a result of which desire would melt  away  in the words of the same sages. This is a dreadful  book, full of soft-pornographic stereotypes, vapid Indian  women with pearly teeth, undulating curves and dusky skin  glimmering from underneath muslin veils. There is also  a great deal of soft mysticism and soft adventure. French  orientalism at its most insufferable. Tthe truth (almost) about  bharat (Penguin, Rs 150) by Kavery Nambisan  is a restless and nervous little novel, set in the neurotic  medley of contemporary India. It is not too badly bitten  by the cleverness bug. The protagonist is Bharat, a heart-broken  teenage philosopher. Speeding backwards into the future.  Trees, houses, slums, shacks and writing-on-the-walls  sped past with reckless glee, mocking my fears. I wanted  to grab those moving objects and tell them Im not afraid,  Im not afraid. But they sped past before I could even  look at them.

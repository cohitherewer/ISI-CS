 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Sept. 30: The districts chief judicial magistrate has ordered a probe into charges that the officer in-charge and three policemen on duty at Raina police station had molested women and tortured an undertrial in the lock up. 																								Sabyasachi Biswas asked the police station to treat undertrial Joydev Das petition to the court as an FIR and start a case against the policemen.																								In his petition to the chief judicial magistrates court, Das had alleged that he and his brother were summoned to the police station on August 25 following a property dispute with relatives. They were forced to sign on blank papers before the police let them go home. 																								Next evening, sub-inspector Vidyasagar Tiwari and four constables raided Das house at Palasan village and arrested him without a warrant. 																								The policemen allegedly abused and molested Das sisters when they protested against their high-handedness. 																								On the morning of August 27, Das was beaten mercilessly in full view of the other inmates of the lock-up by officer in-charge Tarak Nath Karati and second officer Utpal Bhattacharya, the petition alleged. 																								Das was produced in court on the same day and released on bail. He was admitted to Burdwan Medical College Hospital soon after. The hospitals medical report said he had suffered severe injuries in his right thumb, knee and elbow joints. His spinal chord was damaged by blows from lathis or iron rods. 																								When Das was released from the hospital after three days, he could neither walk nor use his right hand.																								Karati denied the allegations. We had detained Das on specific charges and he was produced in the court for trial. He was never beaten up, nor were his sisters abused, he claimed.

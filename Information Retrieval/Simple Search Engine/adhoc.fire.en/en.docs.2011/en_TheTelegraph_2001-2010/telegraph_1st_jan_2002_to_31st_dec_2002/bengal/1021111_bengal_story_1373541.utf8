 Monday, November 11, 2002 				 Police link Trinamul with Peoples War
 OUR BUREAU																								Midnapore, Nov. 10: Police today said there were links between Trinamul Congress supporters and Peoples War activists and that the two parties had jointly masterminded the attack on houses of CPM supporters in Keshpur on September 22. 																								We came to know about the nexus between the Peoples War and Trinamul following the arrest of Rabi Kotal and Chhabi Kotal, both action squad members of the Naxalite outfit, from Contai last night. The couple was arrested from a relief camp run by Trinamul, said K.C. Meena, the West Midnapore superintendent of police.																								Meena claimed that the couple had supplied arms and ammunition to Trinamul supporters for organising attacks on the CPM cadre in Keshpur. 																								The couple was produced before members of the media when Rabi admitted that they had supplied arms and ammunition to Trinamul workers. 																								Trinamul activists Nepal Ghosh and Shakti Mandal were also arrested from the same relief camp. Ghosh is the secretary of the partys Keshpur unit. The duo was paraded in front of the newspersons as well. 																								However, they denied receiving arms or ammunition from the Peoples War. We have never met the Kotals before. We saw them today when the police produced them before you. We were forced to leave our huts by the CPM cadre and were planning to return home on September 22 when we were attacked by unknown people, the Trinamul supporters said in presence of senior police officials.																								Meena, however, displayed the arms and ammunition recovered from the arrested Trinamul and Peoples War activists. He added that activists of the two parties had a secret meeting in Midnapore town to chalk out the plan to attack the CPM supporters in Keshpur. Some district Trinamul leaders were also present at the meeting, the superintendent alleged. Three rifles and eight muskets were used in the attack, he said.																								At a public meeting in Keshpur to mark the November revolution in Russia, Left Front chairman and CPM politburo member Biman Bose hauled up the local Trinamul leadership for trying to create disturbance. Bose echoed Meena in alleging a nexus between Trinamul and Peoples War activists. 																								Dont allow (Trinamul chief) Mamata Banerjee in Keshpur, but forgive those who are now disgruntled with her leadership, he told partymen. 																								House set on fire: Villagers of Noasai in Jhargram today set on fire the house of one Anjali Singh, suspecting her to be a witch. The woman and her children escaped unhurt. Ranjit Kayek, a CPM supporter, and five others were arrested.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Haldia, Sept. 2: Two youths went berserk in a residential complex here today and shot dead their cousin and injured two neighbours with their fathers 12-bore gun following a family dispute. 																								A raging quarrel between the families of Santosh and Gauripada Das, two brothers who live in the same complex, led to the bizarre incident. 																								Around 7 am, Gauripadas son Uttam allegedly abused his cousin Basu for deliberately choking a drain in the apartment. A heated exchange between members of the two families followed.																								When neighbours intervened, Uttams younger brother Utpal, 17, brought his fathers gun out and handed it to Uttam. A volley of shots were fired and moments later, Basu lay profusely bleeding from the head. Two neighbours, Tapan and Swapan Mondal, were injured.																								Enraged by the incident, other neighbours rushed in and beat up the two brothers. The police arrived in the scene to rescue them from the furious mob.																								Haldia sub-divisional police officer Debashis Bej said they have recorded eyewitness accounts that identified Uttam as the killer. Utpal, too, has confessed to the police that he had opened fire when the neighbours were bashing up his brother.																								Gauripada was an employee of the Indian Oil Corporation. The police are trying to verify whether the double-barrelled gun had a valid license.

 VIVEK CHHETRI				 	 Shah Rukh Khan																								Darjeeling, Dec. 3: Wheres Shah Rukh? 																								The question resonated through the hills as King Khan missed his date with Darjeeling for the second successive day. 																								Braving the winter chill, residents poured out onto the streets to welcome the superstar, who was scheduled to arrive here yesterday to begin shooting for choreographer Farha Khans directorial debut Main Hoon Na. 																								But they were disappointed, yet again. 																								St Pauls School, which has been transformed into a college for the film, was made off-limits for the people. With little news filtering through the ring of tight security, rumours began spreading faster than Shah Rukhs dialogues. 																								He has come. Thats why the security, said one eager onlooker. No he hasnt, replied another. Maybe Sushmita is here, he said, hoping that the former Miss Universe, who plays Shah Rukhs love interest in the film, had sprung a surprise. But she hadnt. 																								Sush is expected to reach only by the middle of this month. 																								Their hopes began fading as the hours ticked by. The enthusiasm gave way to disappointment and by noon, most of the people lost their patience and began dispersing. 																								A heated exchange broke out between a senior St Pauls teacher and police personnel manning the gate, when the guards refused to allow him to enter the campus after he had gone out.																								Additional superintendent of police, Darjeeling, Javed Shamim, while justifying the tight security arrangements, said: Had it (the shooting) been in a public place like Chowrastha, the people would not have been restricted but since it is inside private premises, we had to take extra precaution.

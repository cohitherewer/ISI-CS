 Saturday, November 09, 2002 				 RSP threat to leave front cell
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 8: The RSP is mulling a protest against the CPMs hegemony in education by pulling out of the Left Fronts education team if it did not agree to its demand for a greater role.																								The front partner alleged that the CPM has packed educational institutions with loyalists and remains opposed to larger participation in the running of certain institutions. 																								The partners will meet on Monday to sort out differences. The two had also met on October 29, but the talks were inconclusive.																								The education team is virtually defunct and has not met once in a year. Politburo member Biman Bose, who is also the convener of the team and the front chairman, was too caught up to convene regular meetings of the education cell.																								The CPM is believed to be planning to assign one of its state committee members, who is closely associated with party mouthpiece Ganashakti, to assist Bose in holding regular meetings.																								The CPM has lately been sorting out differences with partners in one-to-one meetings. The practice began since Bose took over as front chairman.																								At the October 29 meeting, the RSP leaders had handed over a list of under-graduate colleges from where their nominees were removed by local CPM leadershps. 																								Bose and other senior CPM leaders are aware of this and we will be forced to withdraw our nominees from the rest of the colleges if the issue is not sorted out on Monday, a senior RSP leader said. We feel there is no need for us to continue in the education team, he added. 																								The parties have been fighting bitterly over reconstitution of college governing bodies for the past one-and-a-half years.

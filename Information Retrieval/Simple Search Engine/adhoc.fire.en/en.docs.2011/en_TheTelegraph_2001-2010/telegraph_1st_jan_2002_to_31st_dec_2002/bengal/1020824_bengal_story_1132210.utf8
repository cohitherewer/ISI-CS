 Saturday, August 24, 2002 				 Basu KLO alert for partymen
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 23: Jyoti Basu today described Saturdays attack on the CPMs Dhupguri office by the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation as a deadly one and asked party members to remain vigilant in the wake of the growing activities of the KLO in north Bengal.																								Addressing a gathering on Rani Rashmoni Avenue this evening, Basu said he had drawn the attention of the king of Bhutan two years ago to the way KLO activists were taking shelter in the country after attacking CPM activists in Bengal.																								But the king of Bhutan had expressed his inability to tackle the situation due to inadequate infrastructure in the country. Now, I feel that the situation in Bhutan has changed and that the country would be able to detect KLO activists taking shelter there. However, we have to take up the issue with the Union government also, the former chief minister said.																								CPM state secretary Anil Biswas told newspersons at the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street that the party would launch a fund-raising drive on September 1 to help the families of party cadre and supporters who had died in attacks by militant outfits like the KLO and the Peoples War.																								We had organised a similar fund collection move during the Keshpur violence in which many CPM cadre were killed. Organising such a drive is nothing new for us, said Biswas.																								The CPM secretary turned down a proposal by agriculture minister Kamal Guha to induct leaders of the Kamtapur Peoples Party into the North Bengal Development Council. 																								A couple of days ago, the Forward Bloc minister had suggested that KPP leaders should be inducted into the council to pacify popular sentiment that no development work has been done in the five north Bengal districts during the 25 years of Left Front rule.																								Biswas said it is not possible for the government to induct anyone in the council except MLAs and local representatives. 																								However, we are ready to take up the issue with the Forward Bloc leadership if necessary, he added. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

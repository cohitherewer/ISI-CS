 Saturday, September 28, 2002 				 Doctor bar in medicine shops
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept. 27: As part of its move to improve the healthcare system, the government is set to implement a ban on doctors attending to patients inside small and dingy medicine shops across the state.																								We shall not allow doctors to attend patients inside medicine shops. This goes against the Clinical Establishment Act, said director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee. The health department would soon issue a notification on the issue.																								According to Chatterjee, doctors are entitled to attend to patients only in authorised policlinics with proper ventilation, nurses, toilets and other facilities. A medicine shop measuring only 110 square-feet and having no proper ventilation, toilet or even a waiting room is totally unfit for examination of patients, he said. 																								Chatterjee said the government will cancel the registrations of the medicine shops if the doctors continue to use them as their private chambers.																								We are left with no option but to go for stringent action to stop the rampant irregularities among medicine shopowners, he added.																								Health department sources said the drug controllers office has already supplied a list of shops in which doctors are regularly attending to patients in most unhygienic conditions. The office has been asked to update the list. A team of experts from the department will visit medicine shops to draw up a list of its own. 																								Those having a licence to open merely a medicine shop are violating the Clinical Establishment Act by appointing doctors to attend to patients there. This has to stop, said health department officials.

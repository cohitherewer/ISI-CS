 Sunday, November 03, 2002 				 Citu leader suspended for assault 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Nov. 2: The management of Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP), late last night suspended Citu leader P.K.Sen, who had assaulted an assistant general manager (AGM) in the plant yesterday. Citu workers organised gate meetings and shouted slogans in the plant during the day to protest against the managements conspiracy against the Citu.																								The decision to suspend Sen was taken in a meeting presided over by managing director Subir Bhattacharya. Representatives of the DSP Officers Association and top executives were present. 																								Official sources said AGM Lakshi had been beaten up by Sen and his men after he transferred Intuc supporter Snehasis Ghosh from B shift to general shift. The Citu workers attacked him for showing favour to the Intuc worker. However, the official spokesman said the change was a routine one and no favouritism was shown. 																								Agitated over two successive assaults on two senior executives in the last one month, DSP Officers Association members staged a demonstration yesterday in front of the MDs office wearing black badges and demanding punishment to the Citu leader who had instigated the workers to assault Mujumdar.																								Another AGM, Amit Biswas, had been beaten up by Intuc supporters on October 2. Three persons were suspended for this.																								Zahangir Hossain, an association executive, feared that frequent attacks on executives will dampen the morale and hamper production in the plant. We are targeting to reach 120 per cent production to earn profit.																								General secretary of the association S.K.Hazra Chowdhury said,  It is the responsibility of both management and the state administration to ensure that work in the plant is not affected due to militant trade unianism. Assaults on the executives and threatening them on one plea or the other has become common here. This as to be stopped.																								President of the Citu union Santu Debroy alleged that the suspended Citu leader was a victim of managements conspiracy against the Citu. Debroy said that Sen had been framed. He had neither assaulted any one nor he had instigated anybody to assault any one. All that I have learnt is that Sen and Majumdar had an altercation over a worker shift, he said.																								ends

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, October 21, 2002 				 Gear-up time for Tagore mart, post copyright
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bolpur, Oct. 20: Faced with stiff competition after the copyright on Rabindranath Tagores work was lifted, Visva-Bharati University has drawn up plans to make its production of Rabindra literature more attractive.																								Visva-Bharati had the sole authority to publish Tagore before the copyright was lifted on December 31, 2001. Till then, it had enjoyed a virtual monopoly.																								But soon after the right was lifted, several reputed publishing houses took up projects to publish Rabindra literature. Some of them have already come out with select poems and novels.																								Many houses may publish Tagores works but, as far as authenticity is concerned, Visva-Bharati is beyond question. Despite that, we are chalking out plans to compete with the private publishers, said vice-chancellor Sujit Bose.																								A book with Tagores articles while on tours will be brought out soon, said Bose. Gitanjali, too, would be published afresh.																								The original manuscript is only with us, nobody will be able to publish such a book. It will definitely create a vast demand in the market. We have also lined up plans to publish Tagore in different languages to enter markets outside Bengal, Bose said.																								According to varsity officials, the really big houses are yet to publish Tagores works but once they enter the scene, Visva-Bharati will face a stiff time.																								To survive the competition, we have already refurbished our distribution network and are planning to go high-tech. All our books can be bought online and they will be delivered at home, an official said.																								But the private publishers sounded undeterred. Let our copies come to the market, then see which one the people are picking up, said Saradindu Mallik of Deys Publishing.

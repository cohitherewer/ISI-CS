 Saturday, October 26, 2002 				 Doctor thrashed at nursing home
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Oct. 25: The government may have absolved the authorities at the Burdwan Medical College Hospital for the baby deaths but the back-to-the-wall district administration had more to worry as angry relatives today ransacked a nursing home and beat up a doctor for a death due to negligence. 																								Officials said the police have taken the doctor into custody. 																								The doctor has submitted a note to the police stating that the anaesthesia he used while trying to set the broken elbow of Abhay Banerjee, 37, resulted in the death. He admitted that no anaesthetist was available during the operation. The death certificate put the cause as cardio-respiratory failure due to xylocaine shock.																								Abhays uncle, Adhir Banerjee, has filed a complaint with the police and the district consumer disputes forum. Abhay had fallen off his scooter on October 17 and broken his elbow joint. Doctors had advised surgery and he was admitted to Jeevan Deep nursing home around 2 pm yesterday. 																								The doctor commenced with the surgery minus an anaesthetist at 4.30 pm and administered xylocaine himself.

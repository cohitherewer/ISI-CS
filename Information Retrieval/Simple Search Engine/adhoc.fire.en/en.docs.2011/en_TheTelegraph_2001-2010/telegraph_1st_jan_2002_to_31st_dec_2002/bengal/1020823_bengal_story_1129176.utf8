 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Mamata slings KLO mud
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 22: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today alleged that the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) is a CPM creation to counter the Kamtapur Peoples Party (KPP).																								It is the CPM that has handed over long-distance rifles to the KLO activists to finish off the KPP politically, Mamata said even as she condemned the KLO strike on the CPMs Dhupguri office on Saturday. 																								She came down heavily on the ruling Left for turning a blind eye to the mushrooming of several terrorist outfits in the state over the past few years.																								CPM state secretary Anil Biswas had earlier criticised the Opposition parties in the state for not condemning the KLO attack that left five partymen dead.																								 Mamata said: I condemn the KLO attack on the CPM office. But some of our supporters were killed in a similar operation in Sonarpur, South 24-Parganas. If I am not wrong, no political party, including the CPM, had condemned the attack.																								The Trinamul chief claimed that the law and order has totally collapsed in Bengal and Tripura, the two states run by CPM-led governments.																								In south Bengal, Peoples War activists are very active and in the north, KLO activists are trying to establish a reign of terror, she said. North Bengal has become home to terrorists and the CPM is encouraging the KLO for its political interests, she added. 																								The party is also helping its cadre use guns meant for forest department officials, she alleged. This should be stopped immediately. If such a situation continues, people will lose faith in the police administration, Mamata said. 																								Criticising the CPM for what she called its failure to mount a strong campaign against the Centres decision to split Eastern Railway, Mamata said: They (the CPM) are doing nothing to stop the bifurcation. Their chief minister is acting like a big boss. If the Centre changes its decision on the bifurcation, mark my words, it will be doing so thanks to my pressure and the CPM has no role to play in this connection, she said at her south Calcutta residence this afternoon.																								The CPM state secretary, however, refuted Mamata. We are ready to give her credit if the Centre changes its decision. But we also want to know whether she will take the responsibility for her failure to force the Centre to change its decision, said Biswas. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.

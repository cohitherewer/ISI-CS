 Monday, October 07, 2002 				 Buddha sops in panchayat poll run-up
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Palasi (West Midnapore), Oct. 6: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has announced development schemes for people living below poverty line ahead of next years panchayat polls. 																								The government will introduce multipurpose cards for people whose monthly income is less than Rs 234. However, Bhattacharjee did not say how much money the government will have to spend to fulfil his promises.																								You will get free treatment in government hospitals, your children will get free education in government schools and your families will get essential commodities through the public distribution system at cheaper rates, Bhattacharjee said while laying the foundation stone of a Rs 10 crore milk supply project here. 																								The cards are ready with us and distribution will start soon. Initially, we will select five or six districts, Bhattacharjee said.																								Tight security arrangements were made here in view of the detection of mines from a bus bound for Nandigram. 																								The chief minister said Naxalites are trying to create disturbances in the state. Outfits like the Peoples War in Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia and the KLO in north Bengal are busy hatching conspiracies, but we have the experience of tackling the Naxalites in the 1970s and know exactly how to tackle them.

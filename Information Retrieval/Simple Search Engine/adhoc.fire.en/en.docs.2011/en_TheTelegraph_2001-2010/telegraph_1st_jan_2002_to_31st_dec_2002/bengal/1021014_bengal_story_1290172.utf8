 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, Oct. 13: The Regional Engineering College here has suspended its workshop superintendent for his long stay in Canada.																								The college authority, which had set up a two-member committee to probe the matter, is yet to have access to the workshop whose keys are still with the superintendent.																								According to a member of the inquiry committee, Shabir Ahmed had failed to justify his long absence. He refused to show his passport, visa and the address where he stayed in Canada. He was very impolite with us, the member said.																								According to the workshop officials, Ahmed has been asked to hand over charge to M.K. Mukherjee.																								REC principal S.P. Ghosh said: He did not clarify his whereabouts during his absence without permission. We have suspended him for an indefinite period and a new probe panel will be set up soon. 																								Ghosh, however, was non-committal on the issue of reporting the matter to police.																								Attempts to get in touch with Ahmed at his REC residence drew a blank with his wife saying her husband was away and she had no information on when he would return.																								According to the REC authorities, Ahmed had left for Canada on January 2000 and returned in July, last year. 																								Sources said he had casually handed over charge to a foreman and did not intimate any other officer.																								His family continued to live in the campus but no one drew the salary for Ahmed during the long absence, much to the surprise of his colleagues. 																								When the college refused to let him join, Ahmed appealed to the higher education department, which formed the inquiry committee that placed him under suspension.

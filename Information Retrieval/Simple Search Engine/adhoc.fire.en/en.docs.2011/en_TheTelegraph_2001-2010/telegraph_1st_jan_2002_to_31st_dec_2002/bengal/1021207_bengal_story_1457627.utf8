 Saturday, December 07, 2002 				 Steel plant theatre shut down
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Dec. 6: A theatre owned by the Durgapur Steel Plant was shut down by the provident fund commissioner today after the private firm that ran it failed to pay up dues to its employees.																								Chitralay, the only theatre inside the steel town, was handed over to the private operator on lease in 1989. 																								According to the regional provident fund commissioners office in Durgapur, Sivkumar Sau had failed to deposit Rs 52,000, his part of the provident fund contribution for 2000-2001.																								Sau, however, said he had deposited Rs 18,000 at the commissioners office a week ago. I had also asked for a month to pay up the pending amount. They sealed the hall without notice, he said. 																								A DSP spokesman said the plant had nothing to do with the running of the hall.

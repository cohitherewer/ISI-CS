The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, November 02, 2002 				 E-governance to cover entire state
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 1: The state governments nodal IT agency, Webel, is ready with the official portal for e-governance. 																								Webel will approach the government in a week to work out the launch details of the first step towards a citizen interface of the e-governance project in the state. 																								The project, to be executed by Webel and Tata Consultancy Services, aims at minimising human intervention in citizen-government interactions. 																								According to the blueprint, information kiosks would be set up across the state. 																								The project is the first of its kind in the country. Though the Andhra Pradesh government has its e-seva service, which is somewhat similar in nature, ours will be different. In Andhra, the services are available in Hyderabad alone, but we will be offering a broad-based service even at some of the remote corners of the state, said a senior Webel official. 																								In the first phase, around 80 kiosks will be set up. The West Bengal State-Wide Area Network (WBSWAN) will be used to link up the kiosks across the state.																								The services provided through the portal would initially include downloading forms, tenders and job advertisements, value added services from various departments and interacting directly with the government and its agencies. 																								Webel has also drawn up a revenue model to make the privately-run kiosks sustainable. All the services would be charged. 																								We have worked out a viable revenue model and are flooded with applications from parties interested in setting up the kiosks, said the official. 																								Already, Rs 2.5 crore has been spent on the project, with TCS bearing 70 per cent of the cost.

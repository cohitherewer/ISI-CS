 Sunday, October 27, 2002 				 Trinamul set to lose Hooghly municipality
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, Oct. 26: In yet another setback to Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamul Congress appears set to lose control of the Hooghly-Chinsurah municipality following the resignation of four party commissioners from the 30-member board.																								The board, where the Trinamul Congress enjoys a majority with 16 commissioners, including four Congress commissioners, has the CPM-led Left Front sitting in the Opposition with 14 members.																								The board faced the crisis yesterday when four commissioners  Shibu Das (Ward 1), Mita Chatterjee (Ward 20), Tapasi Dhara (Ward 27) and Sanjit Mondal (Ward 25)  resigned alleging that the present board had failed to meet the peoples aspirations in the locality. 																								They also charged board chairman Ashis Sen with deliberately sidelining them while taking important decisions.																								It is better to serve as Independents as we have no importance in the present board, Das said.																								Trinamul sources said a team of party leaders have rushed to Mamata to seek her advice to get over the crisis. However, an angry Trinamul chief was learnt to have pulled up the district leadership for the mess.																								, who is the brother of late Asim Das. Asim was one of those 13 killed in police firing on July 21, 1995 while Mamata was staging a law-violation programme at Esplanade.																								Sajib Basu Majumdar, a member of the municipality, later alleged that Shibu, with backing from the CPM, had roped in three other commissioners to resign from the board. Shibu has proved to be a betrayer by entering an understanding with the CPM to topple the board in favour of the CPM, he further complained.																								 Trnamul sources said a team of party leaders from the district rushed to Mamata tonight to seek her advice for getting over the crisis. However, an angry Trinamul chief was learnt to have pulled up the district leadership for the mess.																								Barun Ganguly, a key CPM functionary and leader of the Opposition in the municipality, said the party was keeping a close watch on the developments. Asked if the party would table a no-confidence motion against the board, he evaded a straight answer but said, We shall take the decision when the situation arises.																								This is the third municipality in the Hooghly district where the Trinamul is being dislodged due to intra-party squabbles. Earlier, the party had lost control of the Serampore and the Konnagore municipalities.

 Monday, November 04, 2002 				 Squabble-stung Mamata calls meet
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 3: Alarmed at infighting, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has convened a meeting on November 12 to discuss the state of affairs in her beleaguered organisation.																								Mamata had earlier said that she would convene a parliamentary party meeting to discuss the partys stand on the NDA in the next session of the Lok Sabha, beginning November 18. But desperate to stem the dissension, she rescheduled it and went for an emergency state committee meet, said a key Trinamul functionary.																								He added that Mamatas standoffs with the MP from Calcutta North-West, Sudip Bandopadhyay, and more recently with mayor Subrata Mukherjee were likely to be discussed at the meeting.																								About his strained relations with Mamata, Bandopadhyay evaded a straight answer but said all is not well in Trinamul. Sources said Mamata had stopped interacting with Bandopadhyay since he invited Union minister for communications and BJP leader Pramod Mahajan to his residence. Mamata is also upset at the way her one-time mentor Mukherjee behaved with the surgeon superintendent of SSKM Hospital, Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay.

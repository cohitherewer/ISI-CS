 Wednesday, October 09, 2002 				 Lecturer gets bail as state relents
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 8: Three months after being picked up from his Dum Dum residence for his alleged links with the Peoples War, Rajabazar Science College lecturer Kaushik Ganguly was finally granted bail by Calcutta High Court today. 																								But a division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice Narayan Chandra Seal said Kaushik would not be able to leave the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Dum Dum municipality limits without police permission. 																								Kaushik, who was lodged in the Midnapore jail, is in SSKM hospital, where he was admitted a few weeks ago. The bail order will have to be endorsed by the sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Midnapore before he can be released from custody. 																								Earlier, on two occasions, Kaushiks lawyer Dilip Dutta faced stiff opposition from the state government when he appealed for his clients bail on health grounds. 																								But today, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah did not oppose the bail plea strongly. He only made the point that there were three criminal cases against Kaushik. Admitting that Kaushik was seriously ill, he said the court might consider his plea on health grounds. 																								Kaushiks bail comes a day after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told senior officials to take steps to release from different jails in the state Naxalites against whom no specific charges had been filed. 																								However, Bhattacharjee declined to comment today on Kaushiks release and whether his government was turning lenient towards the Naxalites. Wait and see, Bhattacharjee said while leaving Writers Buildings for the day. 																								Kaushik was arrested from his Dum Dum residence on July 4 midnight when he was watching a cricket match on television. He was sent to Midnapore jail, and police started a criminal case against him at the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court there. 																								Kaushiks father had alleged that his son was tortured in jail, resulting in the lower portion of his body being paralysed. 																								While arguing for Kaushiks bail, Dutta told the court that Kaushik was a brilliant scientist  one whose talent was recognised by the Union government  and an expert on polymers. 																								Pleading that such a scholar should not be kept behind bars, Dutta said: His research is being hampered by the false charges brought by the police. Dutta added that his client was seriously ill and in need of urgent medical attention.

 Friday, November 01, 2002 				 CPM show in war zone 
 NARESH JANA																								Gidhni (West Midnapore), Oct. 31: The CPM made a show of strength here this afternoon when, after almost six years, district leaders addressed a massive rally in the area dominated by the Jharkhand Party (Naren) and the Congress.																								The rally amidst huge police arrangements came in the wake of the killings of four persons belonging to the three parties a week ago. Tension had been brewing in the area, and Jamboni in the Jhargram sub-division, ever since the CPM opened a party office here on October 9.																								Dibakar Malakar, a local CPM leader, was gunned down last Friday while he was on his way to Gidhni to organise todays comeback rally. Three persons, including a woman, were killed at Jamboni in retaliatory attacks.																								Today, district CPM secretary Dipak Sarkar exhorted the 12,000-strong gathering to resist the politics of violence unleashed by the Jharkhand Party in the past six years. CPM MP from Jhargram Rupchand Murmu and district secretariat member Dahreswar Sen were present as was Dipak Dasgupta, member of the partys state secretariat.																								More than 500 policemen, including Eastern Frontier Rifles personnel, were deployed to prevent any spurt in violence at the rally. Twenty-seven people have so far been arrested in connection with the Jamboni incidents.

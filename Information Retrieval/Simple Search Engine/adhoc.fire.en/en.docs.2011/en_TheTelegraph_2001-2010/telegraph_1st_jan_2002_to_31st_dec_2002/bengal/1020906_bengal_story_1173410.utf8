 Friday, September 06, 2002 				 Another tetanus case at Raiganj hospital 
 KOUSHIK SEN																								Raiganj, Sept. 5: Another child was admitted to the Raiganj Sadar Hospital today with tetanus, sending health officials in Uttar Dinajpur in a tizzy. 																								Nine-day-old Samar Roy died of tetanus yesterday and two children are battling the same disease in the hospital, sparking fears of a tetanus epidemic. 																								The alarming rise in cases among vaccinated children in the district follows an outbreak of kala-azar about two months ago. 																								Rajmani Sutradhar, a three-year-old suffering from tetanus, was admitted to Raiganj Sadar Hospital this morning. The condition of Shanta Kumari, who was undergoing treatment here for the past few days, worsened later in the day. Since the hospital does not have adequate infrastructure to handle such complicated cases, she was referred to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri, hospital sources said. 																								The health department must give serious thought to the abnormal rise in tetanus cases. Otherwise, it may lead to an epidemic, said Dhiman Pal, executive member of the Association of Health Service Doctors. 																								Rajamanis mother Dulali Sutradhar said the boy cut his leg after a fall last Saturday. Though the child was given eight stitches, puss started forming in the wound from the next day. Yesterday, his condition worsened. 																								Dulali insisted she could not fathom how her child was afflicted with the disease. I had regularly taken tetanus injections before childbirth, she said.

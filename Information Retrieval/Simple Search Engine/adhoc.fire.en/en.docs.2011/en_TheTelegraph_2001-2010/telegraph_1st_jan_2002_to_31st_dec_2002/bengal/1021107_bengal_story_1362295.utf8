 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 6: Salt Lake and its adjoining areas, including the house of former chief minister Jyoti Basu, were plunged into darkness this evening after the state electricity boards 132-KV high-tension line supplying power from Asoke Nagar developed a snag. 																								SEB authorities tried to route power from the Kasba sub-station, but the move fell through as the unit malfunctioned following leakage of cooling oil from the transformer. 																								As the power-cut stretched to two-and-a-half hours from nine, angry residents ransacked the local SEB sub-station. Police arrived before the situation could spin out of control. 																								Power supply was restored at 11.30 pm when the Kasba sub-station began functioning. Work is on to detect and repair the fault in the supply cables from Asoke Nagar, an SEB official said.

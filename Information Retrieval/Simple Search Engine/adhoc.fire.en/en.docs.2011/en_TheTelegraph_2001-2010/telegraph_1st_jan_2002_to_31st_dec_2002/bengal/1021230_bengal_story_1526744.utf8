 Monday, December 30, 2002 				 CPI calls for consensus
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 CPI leaders at the rally in Calcutta on Sunday. Picture by Amit Datta																								Calcutta, Dec. 29: The CPI today urged the CPM to give up its tendency to take unilateral decisions and work towards running the government and the Left Front on the basis of consensus among the partners. 																								Without naming the CPM, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan told a rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds that the largest constituent of the coalition took it for granted that no one in the Front will oppose it.																								We are also leftist. Our partners are also leftists. Naturally, it will be difficult for them to criticise us...This is the CPM mindset, Bardhan said.																								Bardhan was cautious not to irk the CPM in his critique. No one should misunderstand us, that we are telling all these things. We are not here to criticise any of the front partners, or the front as a whole, because we ourselves are part and parcel of the front and criticising the front means criticising ourselves, he told the modest turnout.

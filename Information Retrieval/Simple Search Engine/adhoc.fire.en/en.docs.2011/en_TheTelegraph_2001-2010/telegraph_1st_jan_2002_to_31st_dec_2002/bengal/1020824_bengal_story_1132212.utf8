 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Aug. 23: Poverty proved too much to bear for Jummatan Bibi, a young mother of two girls. Last evening, she poisoned herself and her children in a village near Kandi in Murshidabad.																								We have learnt from preliminary investigations that the mother fed poison to her daughters and took some herself, apparently to escape poverty, said sub-divisional police officer of Kandi Niladri Chakraborty.																								Police said Jummatans husband Alim Mollah was a farm labour who could not work regularly as he was weak. The couple had a quarrel last evening. Alim is absconding.																								They fought over the lack of money but we did not think that Jummatan would take such a step, said Alims sister Maria Bibi. After last evenings tiff with her husband, Jummatan had announced that she had poisoned her daughters and someone should tend to them. She herself fell ill after that.																								The two infants  one two years old and the other eight months  died soon after being taken to the district hospital in Behrampore. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.

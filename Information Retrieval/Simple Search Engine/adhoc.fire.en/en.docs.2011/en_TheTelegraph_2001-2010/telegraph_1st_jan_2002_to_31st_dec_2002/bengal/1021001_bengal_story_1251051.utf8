 Tuesday, October 01, 2002 				 Madarsa reforms report 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 30: The committee set up to recommend changes to modernise madarsas in the state handed over its report to school education minister Kanti Biswas today.																								The panel headed by former Governor A.R. Kidwai was constituted in March last year.																								The 141-page report in two parts, including 35 pages of recommendations, has suggested measures to improve the Madarsa system of education.																								The upgrading of the standard of the Madarsa board is necessary to ensure that students passing from there are eligible to appear in competitive examinations like the joint entrance, said Kidwai.																								The committee suggested the formation of a special task force to promote madarsa education in the state. Kidwai said it is necessary to frame strict guidelines before granting affiliations to new madarsas. The panel also suggested measures to develop Calcutta Madarsa, one of the oldest such institution in the country.																								Kidwai stressed the need for affiliation of unrecognised Madarsas. But he felt that recognition should be granted to such schools only if they meet the standards laid down by the government.																								In another important recommendation, Kidwai recommended the government to take effective steps to reduce the number of dropouts from Madarsas. He said this was possible by means of counselling of parents and students. He said at present the drop out rate after class four in Madarsa schools is nearly 70 per cent.																								ends

 Monday, December 23, 2002 				 Cong bandh call against murders
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Dec. 22: The Congress today called a dawn-to-dusk bandh in Murshidabad on December 30 to protest the murders of three supporters in four days by alleged CPM activists. 																								We are fed up with police inaction. Despite our pleas, they have failed to arrest any of the CPM-backed criminals, said district Congress president and MP Adhir Chowdhury. 																								On Wednesday, Ataur Rahman was strangled to death. Two days later, Sahid Khan, 65, was shot at Gangaprasad village. Yesterday, Congress leader, Motor Sheikh, 45, was killed at Kalla village. 																								Eleven of our men have been killed by the CPM in the past month, claimed Chowdhury.

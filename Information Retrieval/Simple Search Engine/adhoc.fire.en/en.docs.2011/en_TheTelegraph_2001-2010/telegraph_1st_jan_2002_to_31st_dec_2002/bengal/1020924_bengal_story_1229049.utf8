 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 23: Over 200 people were taken ill after drinking contaminated water in three wards of Barasat Municipality since Sunday night.

Sixty people from the area had to be rushed to Barasat Sadar Hospital for suspected gastro-enteritis. 																								Around midnight, the numbers soared and bewildered hospital authorities had to line up makeshift arrangements to accommodate more patients, many of them children. 																								The patients were coming from all around  Kanapukur, Balurmat and Akrampur, spread across wards 26, 27, and 29.																								Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee has ordered an inquiry. Preliminary investigations revealed that a leakage in the CMDA pipeline had caused the damage. Water supply has been stopped in the areas and samples are being tested.

 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 Sachin at Kalighat
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 28: Sachin Tendulkar and teammate Sanjay Bangar went to Kalighat Temple late tonight to offer prayers, less than 48 hours before the third Test between India and the West Indies at Eden Gardens.																								The players spent about 10 minutes at the Kali temple and returned to the hotel. It was a sudden visit and we had to make swift security arrangements around the premises, police said. 																								They, however, have no information on whether more cricketers are likely to visit the temple.

 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 Royal Bengal scare in village
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Canning, Sept. 3: Panic gripped Lahiripur village in the Sunderbans after a tiger strayed in and killed a cow and goat last night.																								Throughout the night, the animal played hide-and-seek with the villagers, holing up in paddy fields and clumps of bamboo as they kept chasing, beating drums and with flaming torches. 																								After much effort, the villagers managed to drive the animal away. It swam across a river to the Pirkhali forest.																								Trouble began when forest officials went to Lahiripur. The villagers gheraoed them and demanded a days wages. The officials had to cite law, according to which only the cattle-owner could be compensated. 																								A forest official said around this time, tigers stray into human habitation in search of food as their habitat gets flooded by the heavy rains.

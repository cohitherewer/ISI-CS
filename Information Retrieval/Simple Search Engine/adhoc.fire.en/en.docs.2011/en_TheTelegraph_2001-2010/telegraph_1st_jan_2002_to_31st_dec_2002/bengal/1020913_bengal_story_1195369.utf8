 Friday, September 13, 2002 				 Cops head for desert on ISI trail
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, Sept. 12: A four-member police team, headed by an inspector of the district intelligence bureau, will visit Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to interrogate Mohammed Nazrul, the arrested Pakistani Inter-services Intelligence (ISI) agent.																								Rajasthan police had arrested him at the Jaisalmer police station on September 8. 																								Our team will visit Jaisalmer to gather more inputs about ISI activities in the region. If need be, we can also bring Nazrul to north Bengal for further interrogation, said Jalpaiguri superintendent of police, Siddh Nath Gupta. 																								We plan to match the statements made by his local contact, Sattar Ali, with that of his mentor Nazrul. Once we are able to do that we can separate the chaff from the grain. Presently, numerous discrepancies abound. Moreover, contradictory statements are also causing immense confusion, admitted a senior district police official. 																								The police have also intensified search operations along with the army intelligence in Banarhat-Madarihat-Birpara for more such anti-national elements.																								During the course of interrogation, Nazrul, who assumed several aliases to spread an elaborate espionage network across the length and breadth of the country, revealed the name of Sattar Ali, a 40-year-old rickshaw-puller from Binnaguri in the Dooars in Jalpaiguri district. 																								Ali, according to Nazrul, was his local contact, who used to collect classified defence information from the armys 20th division headquarters at Binnaguri on his behalf.

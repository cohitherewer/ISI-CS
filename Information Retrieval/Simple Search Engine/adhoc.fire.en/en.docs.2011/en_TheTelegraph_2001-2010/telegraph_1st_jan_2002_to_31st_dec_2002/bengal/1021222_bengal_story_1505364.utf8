 Sunday, December 22, 2002 				 Subhas to fight subsidy recall
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Raiganj, Dec. 21: In direct opposition to finance minister Asim Dasguptas announcement that subsidies to the state transport corporation would be withdrawn, a defiant Subhas Chakraborty today assured the departments employees that he would oppose tooth and nail any move to withdraw subsidy in state transport corporations.																								The finance department had announced to reduce subsidy on the state transport corporations. Whoever might have taken such a decision, I assure you, I shall not allow this to happen. Not a single paisa will be curtailed on subsidy. You shall see it in the next budget, the transport minister said amid loud applause and thumping of tables.																								Dasgupta had stated that subsidies to state-run corporations would be withdrawn in phases at the recently concluded Assembly session.																								Addressing the 22nd central conference of the Citu-affiliated North Bengal State Transport Corporation at Bidhanmancha here this afternoon, Chakraborty announced that the government would not introduce the voluntary retirement scheme in the corporation.																								Calcutta and North Bengal State Transport Corporations are the two most important public transport services in the state that provide a crucial link between north and south Bengal, he said, adding that the transport department would buy 200 buses for the latter and more employees would be recruited to run them. Chakraborty, however, deplored the absence of sincerity and honesty among transport corporation employees.

 Friday, September 06, 2002 				 Murder plot charge on PW lecturer
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								West Midnapore, Sept. 5: Police today submitted a chargesheet against lecturer Kaushik Ganguly and 29 others arrested for suspected links with the Peoples War in the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court, accusing them of waging war against the country, conspiracy to murder and violating the Arms Act. 																								Apart from the Rajabazar Science College lecturer, who was arrested on June 23 from his Dum Dum residence, the charges were framed against Tinku Ghosh, Parasar Bhattacharya, Sudeep Chongdar, Partha Sarathi Banerjee, Mithu Roy and others. Abhijit Kundu, a lawyers assistant who was arrested from Baripada in Orissa recently, also figures on the list, district superintendent of police K.C. Meena said. 																								A Peoples War statement yesterday had hinted that Kundu was helping the outfits activists arrested in Orissa three years ago fight cases slapped on them. Kundu was picked up from a Baripada lodge on August 29. 																								Police filed the chargesheet within the stipulated period of 90 days from their arrest. But 18 of the 30 accused have eluded the police dragnet and are still at large. 																								The charges have been framed with details of how the arrested persons sat in Calcutta and drew up plans to kill CPM functionaries in Bankura and Midnapore, Meena said after the court proceedings. 																								The charged persons were responsible for the murders of Sibram Satpathi in Bankura and Tapan Ghosh and Anil Mahato in Midnapore, he said. They were also linked to the killing of Gour Mahato, a National Volunteer Force personnel, in Midnapore. 																								The charges were framed on the basis of a first information report filed in the Salboni police station the day Ganguly was arrested.																								Ganguly was remanded in judicial custody for another 14 days yesterday. The teacher, whose arrest had kicked up a row, has complained of police torture during his incarceration and has been presented before a medical board in Calcuttas SSKM hospital and the Bangur Institute of Neurology twice.

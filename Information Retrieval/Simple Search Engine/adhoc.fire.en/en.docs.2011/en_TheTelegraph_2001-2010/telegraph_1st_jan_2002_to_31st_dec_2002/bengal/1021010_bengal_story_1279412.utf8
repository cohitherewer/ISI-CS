 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 Duty hike anger at Asim
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Oct. 9: The government today approved an increase in stamp duty on purchase of property in municipalities after a 40-minute Cabinet meeting marked by sparring among ministers. 																								The stamp duty has been raised to 8 from 6 per cent. 																								Finance minister Asim Dasgupta met with fierce criticism as the duty increase came up for discussion. Sources said water investigation minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya of the CPI and minister for jails and social welfare Biswanath Chowdhury of the RSP led the attack, arguing that the move would hurt people in small municipalities. 																								But the two quietened down when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee rose to his finance ministers defence, assuring that the government would make necessary amendments if problems arose. 																								Officials said the hike will not affect Calcutta and Howrah, where there is already an 8 per cent stamp duty. Panchayat areas have been exempted, in a move that is being seen as an attempt to woo the electorate before next years panchayat elections. 																								The government also increased the OBC quota for admission to government schools to 7 per cent from the existing 5 per cent. Altogether 62 communities have been brought under the OBC category. The group constitutes 18.17 per cent of the population. 																								The sources said the quota is not applicable for higher education. The chief minister apparently said a high level committee would review the matter. 																								PWD minister Amar Chowdhury also came under attack, particularly from his RSP colleague Chowdhury, over the deplorable condition of roads in the districts.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Canning, Dec. 12: Four girls were molested by at least a dozen revolver-toting youths in full view of the public in a makeshift cinema at Patikhali village near here last night. 																								Police claimed to have arrested three of the youths. 																								A club had arranged cinema shows in three shifts over four days. A while into the 9 pm show, the miscreants stormed in and started firing. They snapped the electricity connection of the pandal and when everybody started running for life, started molesting the girls at gun-point. 																								When people responded to the screams for help, they were assaulted. The youths, with faces masked, ransacked the pandal and took away the projector. Residents, however, recognised some of them during scuffles.

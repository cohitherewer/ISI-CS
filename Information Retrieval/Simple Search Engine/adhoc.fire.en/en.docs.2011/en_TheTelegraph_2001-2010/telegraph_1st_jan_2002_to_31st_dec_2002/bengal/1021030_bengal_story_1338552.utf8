 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, Oct. 29: West Midnapore police have raised a motorcycle-borne commando force to patrol the violence-prone Jamboni area following the killing of five persons, including a woman, on Friday. 																								District police superintendent K.C. Meena said the commandos were equipped with assault rifles, carbines and walkie-talkie sets and have been asked to carry out raids and maintain vigil in the forest tracts too narrow for jeeps. 																								We will succeed with this step as now police can get to the den of those carrying out the violent activities, he said. 																								The district police have deployed 16 commandos, two on each motorcycle. These groups are on duty round-the-clock and are monitoring the movement of political elements in the jungle areas, Meena said.

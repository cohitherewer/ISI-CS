 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 				 Missing CPM duo dumped
 NARESH JANA																								Midnapore, Nov. 25: Chhoto Angaria continues to be a thorn in the CPMs path with the party being forced to drop its Garbeta leaders who went underground after the CBI secured warrants for their arrest in connection with the alleged massacre in January last year.																								Zonal committee secretary Sukur Ali Khan and Tapan Ghosh, the local committee secretary, were elected to their posts last winter, much after the incident in which 11 persons were allegedly killed at Chhoto Angaria village. 																								Their names featured in the FIR filed by Abdur Rehman Mondal, the owner of the house where the alleged carnage took place on January 4, 2001.																								We had repeatedly told the district party leadership not to nominate them as candidates at that time, and now we have become organisationally weak in the area, a CPM leader rued. The disappearance of Khan and Ghosh has also become an embarrassment for the local CPM leadership.																								Khan, who had even been inducted into the district committee, was reportedly too scared to go to the district party headquarters in Midnapore. for fear of being arrested. 																								The CPMs district leadership has been forced to select two party workers to fill up the posts. Kiriti Hazra has replaced Khan while Haradhan Sau is filling in for Ghosh.																								West Midnapore district secretary of the CPM, Dipak Sarkar, denied that Khan and Ghosh have been dropped from their posts. They are not being able to work for some difficulties, Sarkar said. 																								However, he reluctantly conceded that the CBI warrants were part of the difficulties.

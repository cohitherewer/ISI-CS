The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, October 30, 2002 				 Assembly session
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Oct. 29: The Assembly will be convened on December 9 for a short winter session that is expected to be stormy as the Opposition began preparations to demand a discussion on law and order in north Bengal in view of increased KLO activities and the financial crisis. 																								Among the clutch of Bills expected to be passed in the session are those that will formalise the recent imposition of a Re 1 cess on petrol and diesel and the hike in stamp duty on buying and selling property, parliamentary affairs minister Prabodh Sinha said. An amendment to the existing construction rules will also be tabled to impose certain restrictions on promoters. 																								The minister, who also holds the excise portfolio, said the government has decided to slap fees on liquor licences and their renewal to raise revenues from untapped areas. We take a fee for an application, but dont charge those who finally get a licence after a draw of lots. There is also no system of taking a fee during renewal of licence, the excise minister said. 																								The department is conducting a survey to find out whether more licences could be issued for liquor shops.

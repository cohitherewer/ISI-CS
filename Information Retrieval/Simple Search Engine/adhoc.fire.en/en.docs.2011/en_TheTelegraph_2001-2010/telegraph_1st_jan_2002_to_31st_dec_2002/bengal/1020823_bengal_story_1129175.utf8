 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Joynagar (South 24-Parganas) Aug. 22: The daughters of a local CPM leader were pushed on to railway tracks by miscreants last night. Both were admitted to a Calcutta hospital with serious injuries today. 																								Ramshankar Haldars daughters, Mamata and Sulata, were waiting at Baharu station for a train to Sealdah last evening when some local anti-socials pushed them from behind.																								The girls were lucky no train was approaching the station at the time. Others waiting on the platform helped the two up to a local hospital. The sisters had to be shifted to Calcutta after their condition worsened.																								Mamata is a post-graduate student in Bilaspur and Sulata studies in a Calcutta college.  copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

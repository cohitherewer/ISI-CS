The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, September 12, 2002 				 RSP raps govt on child deaths
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept. 11: The RSP, a key Front partner, today severely criticised the administration for its inept handling of the death of infants in the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children.																								It also censured the government for the mess in the publication of results of last years Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations and the abysmal performance of the power sector. 																								RSP leaders voiced their protest at a bipartite meeting with CPM functionaries at its Alimuddin Street headquarters this morning. 																								Bowing to pressure from Front partners, the CPM has decided to convene a meeting of the Left Front committee to discuss the issues raised by RSP. 																								The CPM has been assailed for some time now by criticism from its partners over a variety of issues, the latest being police non-performance at Dhupguri, where KLO activists had gunned down five CPM workers. 																								The RSP and two others  the Forward Bloc and the CPI  had rapped the police administration despite being asked not to do so in public as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee also holds the home portfolio. 																								They expressed resentment over the way in which the police remained inactive in the Basanti-Gosaba area of South 24-Parganas at a time when RSP activists were being killed by anti-socials.																								CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said today they had discussed various issues concerning the Left Front. He, however, refused to divulge the details.																								Later, senior RSP leader and former PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said the party had given some suggestions to the CPM on how to minimise intra-party squabbles among Front partners and improve the quality of work for better governance. 																								Besides Goswami, two other RSP leaders  Debabrata Bandopadhayay and Sunil Sengupta  were also present.

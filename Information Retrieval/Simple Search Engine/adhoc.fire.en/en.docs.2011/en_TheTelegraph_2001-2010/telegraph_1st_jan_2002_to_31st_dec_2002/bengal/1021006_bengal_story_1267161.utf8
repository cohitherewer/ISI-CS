 Sunday, October 06, 2002 				 Plane probe called off
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Raigunj, Oct. 5: Forty-eight hours after a mystery plane dropped a packet in a pond in Mokdamgach village in the Chopra police station area, which, according to some villagers, triggered an explosion, the police closed the case today saying there is nothing in it. 																								Police and villagers failed to find a fragment of any material that could suggest an explosion after flushing out the water from the pond and conducting an intensive search to trace the debris of the bomb-like object. There was also no packet.																								I am hundred per cent certain nothing fell into the pond or in the surrounding area. We are ending the search operations and have asked police to leave the area, said district superintendent of police Arun Sharma. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee also expressed doubts over the veracity of the villagers claims. The main problem is that the search is being conducted on the basis of what a 14-year-old girl saw. I have asked the police to investigate and submit a detailed report to me, Bhattacharjee said this afternoon.

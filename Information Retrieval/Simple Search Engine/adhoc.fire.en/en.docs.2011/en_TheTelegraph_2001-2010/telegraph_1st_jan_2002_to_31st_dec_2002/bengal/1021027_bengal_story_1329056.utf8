 Sunday, October 27, 2002 				 Buddha on orderly offensive
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 26: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today resented the delay in doing away with the orderly system despite a government directive.																								The orderly system, under which constables are made to do household odd-jobs of senior officials, is inhuman and condemnable, Bhattacharjee said while addressing an open session of the West Bengal Non-Gazetted Police Karmachari Samity in Howrah. 																								The chief minister denounced the manner in which some senior officials misbehave with junior policemen. I want senior officials to behave sympathetically with junior policemen keeping in mind that all of you are working for the benefit of the people, he said. 																								A proper investigation should be carried out before taking disciplinary action against subordinate staff, he added.																								Bhattacharjee was reacting to samity general secretary Muktipada Mondals allegation that some lower-ranked policemen were being punished for no fault of theirs by a section of IPS officers. Come to me if you have any problem with senior officials, he said amid cheers. 																								The chief minister also pledged to ensure that the Rs 600 a policeman gets every month in lieu of ration is excluded from income-tax. We have done away with the rationing system in the force, but the amount you are getting against the ration should be excluded from income-tax, he said. 																								He appreciated the role of the police during the Pujas and said everything passed off peacefully due to the good performance of the policemen.

 RANJAN LAHIRY 																								Burdwan, Nov. 26: Burdwan University today felicitated Asish and Mina Mandal, an NRI couple, for donating Rs 60 lakh to introduce a plant biotechnology course at the M.Sc. level. 																								Asish Mandal, a physician, has been practising in the US for the past five decades. His father, Mrigendranath, was once employed as an overseer with the university. Mandals endowment will help create two teaching posts in the memory of his parents.																								The new course will be introduced and posts of a professor and a senior research fellow will be created as desired by Asish Mandal and his wife. This is the first time weve received such an endowment, said vice-chancellor Amit Mallick at the felicitation. 																								I happen to be a son of the soil and I had a long-standing desire to do something for this seat of higher learning. I hope that our endowment will be utilised in a proper manner as Burdwan depends considerably on its agrarian economy, said Mandal.																								The varsity has been striving to achieve financial self-reliance for the last one year. Its website appeals to established students to extend financial assistance.

 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Puja power vigil
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept. 15: Armed with the new anti-power theft law, the state electricity board (SEB) has issued circulars to engineers in charge of its district stations asking them to be vigilant against power tapping by puja organisers.																								We are heading for the first pujas after the anti-power theft law came into force. We have asked our engineers to remain alert against any illegal supply of power to the pandals. Any negligence will be dealt with seriously, said board chairman G.D. Gautama.																								The engineers have also been asked to assess the load of the pandals correctly to avert any loss of revenue. The puja organisers will have to submit written undertakings for not drawing more than the declared demand endorsed by licensed contractors.																								After a meeting over the weekend with managers of the five power zones, Gautama said 64 special squads will inspect pandals from Panchami. Violations of the new law entail disconnection of electricity, non-bailable criminal proceedings against the puja organisers, a fine of Rs 50,000 and five years imprisonment, an official said.

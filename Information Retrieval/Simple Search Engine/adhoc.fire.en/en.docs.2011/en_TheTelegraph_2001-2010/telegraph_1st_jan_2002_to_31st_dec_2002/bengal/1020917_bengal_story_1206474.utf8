 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Hospital triple-death row
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Sept. 16: Police had to lathi-charge relatives of patients at the district hospital here to foil a demonstration against the deaths of three members of the same family who were admitted yesterday.																								Dulal Karmakar, who lost his wife, daughter and mother-in-law, has filed an FIR against the doctors and nursing staff of the hospital alleging death due to negligence. His sister-in-law is still in the hospital in a critical condition.																								The doctors and the nurses did not treat them even when they were suffering from food poisoning. The police, instead of sympathising with us, have injured five of my relatives, Dulal said.																								However, hospital superintendent Indranil Chatterjee said he had seen the patients admitted to the diarrhoea ward. I have received a complaint from the relatives of the three deceased women and I have formed a team to look into the incident, Chatterjee said.																								Last Saturday, the women fell ill after eating dal and chapatis. Suffering from acute food poisoning, they were hospitalised yesterday. This morning, Dulals mother-in-law Gangarani Karmakar, 70, was the first to die, followed by his wife Sandhya, 40, and sister-in-law Shampa, 21. Shampa had just completed her Part-I examination with Bengali (Honours) from Beldanga College.																								The nurses did not come even after we informed them that the saline drip had come off Shampas arms, alleged Rintu Karmakar, her cousin. Around 5 am, they had requested a physician to visit the patients, but the doctor came an hour later.																								Enteric fear																								Panic gripped Pandabeswar near Durgapur after more than 22 people fell ill from enteric diseases. A 70-year-old man died yesterday. Seven people were admitted to the Marwari Relief Society hospital in Ranigunj today. A team from the subdivisional hospital has collected water samples from the area.

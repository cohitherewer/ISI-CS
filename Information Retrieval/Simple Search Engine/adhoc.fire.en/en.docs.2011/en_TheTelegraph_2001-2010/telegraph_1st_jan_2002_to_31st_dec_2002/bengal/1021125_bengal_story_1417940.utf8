 Monday, November 25, 2002 				 Storm alert in south
 OUR BUREAU																								Nov. 24: The government has issued a red alert to the South 24-Parganas and East Midnapore administrations on a storm that is likely to hit coastal Digha, Diamond Harbour and Sagar Island tomorrow afternoon.																								According to the weather office in Calcutta, a depression developed in the Bay of Bengal near Chennai last night. This evening, it was 730 km south-east of Paradip in Orissa and moving north-west. The alarm said a storm with a minimum speed of 45 to 50 km per hour is likely to lash the coasts. Fishermen are told not to go in the deep sea.																								More than 100 fishermen had left Digha for the deep sea before the alarm reached us. We have sent wireless messages but it will take them 14-15 hours to return. We have asked them to head for Paradip, the East Midnapore district magistrate said.

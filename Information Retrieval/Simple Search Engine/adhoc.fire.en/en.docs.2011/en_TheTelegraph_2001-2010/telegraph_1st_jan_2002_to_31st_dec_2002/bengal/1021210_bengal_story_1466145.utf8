 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 9: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee was admitted to a city nursing home tonight following severe pain in her chest.																								Doctors attending on her said the ECG showed it was not a cardiac problem. The pain was due to an external injury.																								Mamata was hurt last night after a bus hit her car while on the way back from a wedding in Salt Lake. She, then, did not give much importance to the incident but had a headache and chest pain this evening. 																								Accompanied by party MLA Sonali Guha and Nayana Banerjee, she got herself admitted to the nursing home around 10.30 pm. A CT scan will be done on her tomorrow. A large police contingent has been posted outside the hospital.

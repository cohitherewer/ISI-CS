The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 Month-old body dug out to clear death doubts
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, Aug. 28: The body of 25-year-old Abul Hossain was exhumed at Indrani village a month after burial and sent to Calcutta for post-mortem after his father alleged that his daughter-in-law and her paramour had murdered him. 																								Saira Bibi was arrested, but Hasibul Sheikh is absconding. 																								The local police had initially refused to record it as a case of murder. It acted once sub-divisional police officer Niladri Chakraborty intervened, suspecting foul play behind the death of the young man. 																								Hossains father Majid Sheikh said his son had married Saira, daughter of a powerful local panchayat member, about two months ago. But soon after, Saira had an extra-marital fling with Hasibul Sheikh of the same village, Majid alleged. Hossain was found dead in bed on the morning of July 25 with strangulation marks on his throat and neck. 																								The Khargram police station refused to record a complaint when Majid went to lodge an FIR. Instead, panchayat leaders called Majid to a hurriedly convened meeting and asked him to return the money and gifts received from Sairas family at the time of the marriage. The panchayat leaders allowed Hossain to be buried only after that, Majid said. 																								A helpless Majid approached the Kandi SDPO 34 days after the burial. Chakraborty smelt a rat and ordered an inquiry. He also asked for an explanation from the Khargram police station why they had refused to record an FIR.																								In a similar incident in Kandi, the body of Jummatan Bibi, 20, was exhumed two days after burial to determine whether she was poisoned. On August 22, the womans husband poisoned his wife and two infant daughters and fled Durganpur village, said superintendent of police Virendra. 																								Hossains body has been sent to Calcutta Medical College Hospital morgue for post-mortem. We had to send the body for accurate forensic examination which is not possible here, Virendra added.

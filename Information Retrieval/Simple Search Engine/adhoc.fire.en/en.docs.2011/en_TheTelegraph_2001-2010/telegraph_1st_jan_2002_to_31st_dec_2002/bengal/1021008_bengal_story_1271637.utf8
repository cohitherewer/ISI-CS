 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kakdwip (South 24-Parganas), Oct. 7: Four persons were arrested from Gangarampur near here for selling machines to print currency notes to ignorant villagers.																								Police have recovered nearly Rs 1.5 lakh  the alleged sale proceeds  from the four.																								A large number of printing machines and spare parts were also recovered from the spot. Police suspect the involvement of a bigger gang which could be circulating fake currency notes in rural areas. 																								Kakdwip sub-divisional police officer Amitava Burma said Bablu De and his three associates were carrying on the illegal trade for quite some time.																								They sold the machines to villagers for Rs 15,000. Uttam and his associates persuaded the villagers to purchase a machine, saying it would help them print money of any denomination. However, they were told to begin printing the notes seven days after the machines were purchased, Burma said.																								One of the villagers, Badal Naskar, who had bought a machine, tried to print notes by using colours and bond paper. When nothing came of his efforts, he reported the matter to the local police station.																								Kakdwip police station officer-in-charge Raj Kumar Singh yesterday went to Uttam in the guise of a prospective buyer. A police team waited outside while Singh negotiated the price. As soon as Uttam brought out a machine, he and the others were caught, Burma said.																								On interrogation, they confessed that they had been carrying on with this racket for more than six months, the police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, October 05, 2002 				 Police clueless about CK killer
 OUR BUREAU																								Oct. 4: A day into the daring day-light murder of dissident Gorkha National Liberation Front leader C.K. Pradhan, police remained clueless about the assailant and Kalimpong stitched itself up in shutdown silence. 																								Shops, schools, colleges, banks and business establishments remained closed on the second day of the GNLF-sponsored three-day bandh to protest CKs killing in the heart of the teeming Kalimpong Bazaar. Stranded tourists had a harrowing time in the hotels and resorts throughout the subdivision.																								A youth in his twenties had shot the ousted GNLF Kalimpong unit chief from behind and melted into the milling afternoon crowd yesterday. 																								CK confidants sniffed conspiracy in the murder at a time when he was planing to float a new political outfit. CK was on the verge of launching the Gorkha National Liberation Revolutionary Front. He had finished giving final touches to the new party, a CK aide said.																								In Calcutta, inspector-general of police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said: The preliminary investigation has revealed Pradhan might have been the victim of a growing infighting within the GNLF. 																								We are confident of rounding up the prime suspect in a day or two from the Kalimpong area, he added.																								The police, however, are finding it hard to come across willing witnesses to the murder at the market place. We are still in the dark about the identity of the assailant. All that we have is his description from a couple of people who were willing to share information, said Darjeeling superintendent of police Sanjay Chander. 																								We are following some leads. Raids are being conducted at possible hideouts. 																								The dexterity with which the lone gunman managed to slip out of the area suggests he had thorough knowledge of the bazaars lanes and bylanes. But none of the witnesses recognised him. It seemed he was armed with a single-shot pistol that makes little sound, said Chander.																								More than 500 GNLF supporters were part of a protest procession that snaked through the tourist destination today shouting anti-government slogans and demanding a CBI probe into the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, September 21, 2002 				 Multi-crore multiplex
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, Sept. 20: This stagnating industrial township will soon vie for a place along side Calcutta. A sprawling 300,000 square feet, Rs 50-crore hypermart, replete with cinemas, gyms, eateries and shopping malls, is going to come up here by next March.																								A joint venture between the Asansol Durgapur Development Authority (Adda) and Shristi Infrastructure Development Corporation will promote the mart, Shristi chief Partho Ghosh said at a news conference today.																								Architects Stein Mani Chowfla, the firm that conceptualised India Habitat Centre in New Delhi, will design the mart.																								The first phase will be complete by October, Ghosh said.																								Industrial development is on the cards and with the new Internet earth station being set up by the Software Technology Parks of India, we are sure there will be growth in the sector. Such a facility will be a necessity then, said Burdwan district magistrate Manoj Agarwala. 																								Bengal-Shristi Infrastructure Development Ltd, the joint venture company, was formed in February 2001. 																								In January this year, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee laid the foundation stone of the City Centre where the hypermart will come up.																								Ghosh described the town as the focal point of a rich resource belt and with 40 per cent of its population in the high- and middle-income groups, Durgapur was an automatic choice for the multiplex. 																								There is no organised commercial complex in the vicinity and the large floating population from the towns in the hinterland  Burdwan, Asansol, Burnpur, Bolpur, Shantiniketan and Dhanbad  is waiting to lap up the new facility.

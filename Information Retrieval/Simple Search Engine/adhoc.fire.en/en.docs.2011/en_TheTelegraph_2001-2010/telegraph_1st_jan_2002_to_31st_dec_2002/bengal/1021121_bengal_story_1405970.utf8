 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Kanti rules out school fees 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Nov. 20: School education minister Kanti Biswas today ruled out introduction of tuition fees in about 60,000 primary and secondary schools in the state. The Left Front government made school education free when it came to power in the late 1970s. 																								Biswas said it was not possible for the government to discriminate among students. We cannot take fees from some and make it free for others as it will lead to serious psychological problems and inferiority complex in students not paying the fees, he said.

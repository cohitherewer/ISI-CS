 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 UK official meets Bleach in jail
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 3: British high commissioner to India Sir Rob Young visited Peter Bleach, convicted in the Purulia armsdrop case, at Presidency jail today.																								Spending about an hour with Bleach, Young (picture by Amit Dutta above) discussed various aspects of the case Bleach is fighting for release. 																								The British national recently contracted tuberculosis. I visited him because of the illness he is suffering. This is my first trip to Calcutta since he has developed TB, Young said.																								The British government has been seeking Bleachs release for over a year and continues to press the case with the illness adding urgency to the talks. I have made it clear to Bleach that we have drawn attention of the Indian government to his state of health, Young added.																								The case has come up, the high commissioner said, at every ministerial meeting with Indian officials, who have so far responded in the negative. 																								You will have to ask the Indian government why, Young said.

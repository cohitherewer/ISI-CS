 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 8: Undertrials will not have to fret and faint inside packed lock-ups in the court room if the judiciary departments proposal for an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code is effected.																								The department has suggested an amendment to Section 167 of the code so that those in custody do not have to be produced in court physically every time their case is heard. The department has proposed an audio-visual presentation of the undertrials before courts. The undertrials are now bound to be present in court during hearings.																								The proposal has already received a nod from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. It will be placed before the Cabinet for a formal sanction on Tuesday. If the Cabinet approves the move, a Bill will be tabled in the next session of Assembly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, August 26, 2002 				 Anger over killings in Gosaba 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Aug. 25: Agitated residents of Gosaba mobbed a police team this morning after the body of Provas Mandal, 45, was recovered from a paddy field. 																								Police said Mandal was beaten to death and his killing was a sequel to yesterdays incident in Gosaba, in which three RSP supporters were murdered. 																								Local RSP leader Subodh De alleged that Mandal was a notorious criminal and had harboured a gang of pirates that was carrying out dacoities in the area over the past month. He said the gang was behind the killing of his partymen yesterday. 																								The town was tense as the RSP had observed a 12-hour bandh in protest against the murder of its supporters. The recovery of the body added to the anger and villagers demonstrated with the policemen, who had been deployed in strength in view of the bandh. 																								RSP leader Kshiti Goswami, party minister Ganesh Mandal and MLA Subhas Naskar will visit Gosaba tomorrow to take stock of the situation and console the bereaved families. 																								The RSP criticised the South 24-Parganas police for its alleged indifference towards its party workers even though it claimed it had intimated the force about the possibility of an attack on RSP activists. 																								The CPM had criticised the Jalpaiguri police after five of its supporters were killed by KLO activists in Dhupguri.

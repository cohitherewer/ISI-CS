 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, Sept. 5: Eight constables of the State Armed Battalion and Eastern Frontier Rifles were injured after an hour-long exchange with Naxalites at Arabadi village on Tuesday night. 																								A 30-strong force had raided the village around midnight on a tip-off to arrest Naxalite leader Bidyut Sarkar, who is wanted for 28 murders. Sarkar and his group escaped as the other Naxalites engaged the force with a sudden burst of gunfire. 																								Police fired at least four rounds to disperse the attackers. The injured constables were admitted to hospital in Katwa, but one had to be shifted to Calcutta in a critical condition. 																								Two persons with bullet wounds were held from the village.

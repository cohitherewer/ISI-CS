The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, October 14, 2002 				 Undeclared pandal pariahs
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN 																								Gangadhari (Murshidabad), Oct. 13: Try telling Dipali Das casteism has no place in a state and a village that has consistently voted for progressive Left in the past 25 years and chances are that she will ask you to speak to her children, who look forward to Durga puja with abhorrence.																								Suitably decked for the occasion  in new clothes that their parents manage to buy them  they have come to understand that they have nowhere to go during the pujas. They have known that ever since they were kicked out of a pandal, where they had gone to offer anjali, last year.																								In a forced enactment of a macabre sequel to Satyajit Rays Sadgati, Left-voting Gangadhari  only 35 km from district headquarters Behrampore  has denied its muchi (cobbler) community the right to be seen anywhere near a pandal during the states most important festival.																								The 18 families comprising 80-odd heads are, instead, expected to look up at the neon-light-bright sky and listen to the dhak beats from a distance, making the premise  that Left-voting Bengal has no place for untouchability and caste-virus  stand on its head.																								They are expected not to violate the lakshmanrekha, drawn centuries ago, that is as much on the ground as in the minds of the victims and their oppressors.																								The present-day oppressors, however, do not see anything ghastly in the practice of keeping the cobblers at more than an arms length during the festival season. We do not allow cobblers to participate in our festivals, religious or otherwise, as they belong to a low caste, said secretary of the Mandalpara Sarbajanin Durga Puja Committee, Jiten Mandal, very matter-of-factly.																								He also gave an explanation for the admittedly irrational behaviour. They all skin cows, Mandal said. Besides, the muchis could organise their own pujas. The government has done a lot for them.																								With a touch of benevolence, Mandal added that they would let the cobblers organise their own puja. We wont come in the way, he said, overwhelmed by his own indulgence.																								The organisers of the other puja in the village, the Rudrapara Sarbajanin Durga Puja Committee, clung on to their right to not allow others into their own puja. And the fact that they did not collect subscription from the cobbler families was explained as an act of munificence. They are very poor and will not be able to afford the subscription, committee secretary Lakshman Das said.																								Both Hindus and Muslims live at Gangadhari. Hindus live at Rudrapara, Mandalpara and Muchipara. Though the festival is observed with the ritual gaiety in the first two neighbourhoods, a visit to the third showed how far Mandals they-can-organise-their-own-puja line was from reality. The cobblers live hand-to-mouth.																								The one or two families that can afford a donation say they are never called to do so. We can afford to donate up to Rs 100 but we are told that the goddess will lose her sanctity even if we go near her, said Satya Das of Muchipara.																								Dipali said she had bought her children a set of new clothes. But its no use. They (her children) are morose throughout the festival season as they are shooed away from the pandals, she explained.																								Three cobbler-families (those of Bhupen Das, Anil Das and Dilip Das) live in Calcutta and refuse to come home when the rest of the village is celebrating the homecoming season. Their neighbours here say they prefer the anonymity of Calcutta where they can partake in the festivities.																								RSP MLA Jayanta Biswas admitted to having heard of the practice and that the political parties, including his own, had done very little to educate the masses. These villages are still in darkness, he said, referring to the kusanskar (superstition).																								Sources close to CPM state secretary Anil Biswas admitted that the incident was disconcerting. We, as a party, are against the nation-wide movement against such practices and have asked our Murshidabad district committee secretary to submit a report on this, he said.																								There is, however, one silver lining. Cobblers are allowed to visit the riverside to watch the immersion. For the muchi community, the last day of the states most important festival comes alive  if not in festive gaiety  in a surrogate feeling of oneness with the goddess.

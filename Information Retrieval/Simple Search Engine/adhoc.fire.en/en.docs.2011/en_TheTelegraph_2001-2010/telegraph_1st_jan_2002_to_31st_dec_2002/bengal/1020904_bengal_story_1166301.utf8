The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 One-window access to industry
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Nirupam Sen																								Calcutta, Sept. 3: The government is considering setting up a single window facility for the industrial units in the Barasat-Barrackpore area of North 24-Parganas.																								The government is also setting up a committee under the chairmanship of the district magistrate in its bid to slash the number of industrial disputes and speed up the process of various regulatory clearances mandatory for new as well as existing units.																								By instituting such bodies at district levels, we want to create an environment where the local industry feels comfortable and comes up with fresh investments. This will not only help industrial expansion in the state, but will have a positive effect in luring investments from other states, said state industries and commerce minister Nirupam Sen.																								The minister was speaking at a seminar on industrial development organised by the North 24-Parganas zilla parishad. 																								Finance minister Asim Dasgupta and cottage and small scale industry minister Bansagopal Chowdhury were also present at the meet. Senior officials from nationalised banks, the State Electricity Board and various government agencies took part in the seminar.																								Associations such as the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and other local bodies represented the industry. 																								The chambers of commerce listed their problems in front of the ministers during the hour-long open house. 																								The business woes included non-availability of land, lack of co-operation from a section of government employees, paucity of funds, power problems and lack of work culture in the factories.																								I have been planning an expansion and overhaul of the production system in my factory for the past five years. But neither do I have the land for it and nor the consent from my union. I am in a fix, complained S.K. Anand of Harbanslal Malhotra and Sons, manufacturer of Topaz blades. Anand was joined by other industrialists, who expressed concern over the unrelenting trade unions.																								We know there are some problems, but the role of trade unions has changed in the state over the years. The government will do its best to sort out problems of industrial relations. But the entrepreneurs should also try to take their workforce into confidence, Sen said.																								Reacting to allegations of demand for cut money by a section of government employees, Sen requested the industrialists to not give in to their demands. Dont pay bribe. Please inform us about the corrupt officials and we will take exemplary action against those found guilty, promised Dasgupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Scent of politics in pujas craft theme
 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Calcutta, Sept. 1: Occasion: puja. Message: political.																								Next month, there will be one pandal out of a few thousand Durga pujas in Calcutta where Ma Durga will be coming from Baleshwar in Orissa to lend (not one) 10 helping hands to solve Bengals problem No. 1: acute dearth of jobs. 																								You can take this in a literal sense, for there will really be stalls which, besides, distributing Prime Ministers Rojgar Yojana and state government self-employment scheme forms, will motivate Bengals unemployed to stand on their feet with some help from the government.																								New Alipore Suruchi Sangha  the club that brought to life Baradi, a village now in Bangladesh where Jyoti Basus family came from  is using a religious platform to wade into a political theme again this year.																								There is, however, a twist in the script: the issue being raised this year is much more controversial than the depiction of what life used to be in sylvan Baradi and may not particularly endear the puja  or its organisers  to the ruling party. 																								And  you have guessed right  this is another Trinamul puja, the brain behind the show being the partys Calcutta corporation borough X chairman, Aroop Biswas.																								Biswas, however, pooh-poohed charges of political bias. Last year, we featured a CPM chief ministers native village, he said. We are just raising an issue (joblessness in Bengal) that is a fact of life, he added.																								The organisers are modelling the idol on Orissas pat art and the pandal proper on Beleshwars (also in Orissa) temple of the Sun-god. The Oriya bit is much more important to the puja than the states influence on the pratima or the mandap, the organisers say.																								However, the Oriya motif will run through the puja to send across a comparison that will ultimately be political. The puja will feature the traditional art-forms of both Bengal and Orissa and highlight how the formers are dying out and how the southern neighbours are progressing with government help.																								The northern flank of the approach to the pandal will have stalls featuring traditional Bengali handicraft and handlooms. None of them, however, will be working. One may have looms covered in cobweb, another may have a broken loom while the third stall may be a hut that shows years of disuse.																								The southern flank of the approach-road will feature Oriya art-forms like wood-engraving, mask-making, Pipli work and pat. They, predictably, will be working and the hands (around 35 in number)  the organisers say  will be brought from Orissa. Most of them will be students of famous Oriya artiste Jagannath Mahapatra.																								We want to show how successive governments in Orissa have paid utmost attention to the states traditional art-forms and helped sustain them by giving easy loans, Biswas told The Telegraph on Sunday. The contrast, obviously, would be with the Bengal governments apathy and neglect to its cottage industries which, according to him, could have sustained thousands of families.																								But the real help, he feels, will be the stalls distributing the Rojgar Yojanas and self-employment scheme forms. We want every visitor to go back with some idea of how to go about employing themselves gainfully, Biswas said.

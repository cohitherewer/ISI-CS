The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, September 07, 2002 				 BJP-Trinamul pact hopes alive 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept. 6: BJP president Venkaiah Naidu today did not rule out an electoral alliance with the Trinamul Congress in next years panchayat polls and promised steps to ensure the organisational and social expansion of his party to fight the Marxists.																								Addressing a Meet the Press programme at Calcutta Press Club this afternoon, Naidu said he was not sure about Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjees current stand on the NDA. We never asked (the) Trinamul Congress to go out of the NDA. We always had a soft corner for the party as it has been fighting the CPM, he said.																								Asked if the state BJP would be able to combat the Left Front politically without Trinamul support, Naidu said: We are not depending on (the) Trinamul Congress for our organisational and social expansion. Our only concern is not to allow a division in anti-CPM votes.																								On the state BJPs relationship with Trinamul, Naidu said: The BJP central leadership will provide necessary guidelines to the state unit, keeping in view the political reality in Bengal. We will think about poll alliances at the time of panchayat elections. We hope (the) Trinamul Congress, too, will be able to finalise its stand vis--vis our party by that time. We are not going to rush things.																								The BJP president also hinted at a subtle change in Mamatas attitude towards the partys apex leadership after her recent talks with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani. 																								Reacting to the Trinamul leaders earlier allegation about Advani hijacking the Prime Ministers office, Naidu said: Advanijis elevation to the post of deputy Prime Minister is not a sudden development, but the culmination of a long process. As far as Mamataji is concerned, I dont think she is holding the same view now.																								The BJP chief, however, ruled out re-consideration of the Cabinet decision on the bifurcation of Eastern Railway  the issue that led to Mamatas parting of ways with the Central coalition. The decision will ultimately benefit the people. We are ready to explain the situation, Naidu said.																								He came down heavily on the CPM-led government for its failure to solve the problems of unemployment, industrial slump, urban-rural disparity and lack of healthcare.																								Our party will play a progressively aggressive role to highlight these issues before the people, he said.

 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 Villagers make their own way
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Muraroi (Birbhum), Dec. 17: For years, the residents of Tirogram village were forced to take an arduous route through paddy fields to make it to the neighbouring village, about one-and-a-half kilometres away. They had cried themselves hoarse for a road connecting their hamlet with Bonha, where there is a bustling bazaar.																								Today, the villagers inaugurated a 1.5 km road that they built themselves. They engaged labourers for the job over the past few weeks and the funds came from their own pockets. 																								There was no alternative. For the past 10 years, we have been raising our demand for a road. From meeting the panchayat samity members, the panchayat pradhan and every senior official, we did everything in our hands, nothing happened, said Samir Ghosh, a resident.																								They had also blocked the panchayat sabhadhipatis way on one occasion, but to no avail. Finally, the villagers sat together and decided to build the road without help from the authorities. 																								The residents of Bonha extended their helping hand and offered land to let the road pass. 																								It took a 4-km detour through Bilaspur village to reach Bonha from Tirogram. The road was bad. Schoolchildren had to wade through paddyfields and then change into their uniform, said a villager. 																								However, from today, it will be a 1.5 km stretch.

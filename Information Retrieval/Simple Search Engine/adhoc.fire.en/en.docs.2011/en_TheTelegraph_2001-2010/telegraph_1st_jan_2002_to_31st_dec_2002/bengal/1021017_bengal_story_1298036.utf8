The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Split from family, man leaps to death 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Durgapur, Oct. 16: Confined to a hospital bed and unable to take his family out during the Pujas, Brij Kishore Shaw, 24, succumbed to depression and jumped to his death from the first floor balcony of the Bidhan Nagar sub-divisional hospital here yesterday. 																								The police said Brij Kishore  admitted to the hospital with jaundice  jumped from the verandah near his cabin on Tuesday afternoon after sending his brother, who had come to visit him, to get medicines. 																								Doctors rushed to Brij Kishores aid as soon as they learnt about the incident. They took him back to the first floor and tried to revive him, but in vain. Brij Kishores body was taken to his native Jagadishpur in Chhapra district in Bihar for cremation this morning. 																								Hospital sources said that before dying, Brij Kishore, a trader, had said he took his life because he could no longer endure the agony of being separated from his family during the Pujas. 																								He had been cribbing about his inability to take his wife and two children out to see the grand pandals in Calcutta like he always did. 																								We have spent wonderful times during the Durga Puja since our marriage. We never missed the thrill of going to Calcutta and seeing the famous Durga Pujas there. He (Brij Kishore) promised me a trip to Calcutta this year also, said Brij Kishores widow, Poonam Devi, huddling with their sons, Biswajit, 6, and Sujit, 4. 																								Brij Kishores elder brother, Joylal, who was the last person Brij Kishore spoke to, said his brother insisted that he buy some medicines for a headache. 																								He never gave the slightest hint that he was going to kill himself. I was told to stay at night with him as his condition was serious. When I came back with the medicines, he was dead, Joylal said with a sigh. 																								It is a very unfortunate incident. We do not suspect any foul play and the family, too, have recorded an entry in the general diary at the New Township police station, additional superintendent of police L.N. Meena said. 																								Brij Kishore had developed high fever from October 1 while on a business trip to Jamshedpur. On return, he was admitted to a nursing home and subsequently shifted to the hospital, where his condition deteriorated. 																								The trader had shifted to Durgapur from Jagadishpur two years ago and lived in a two-room flat in the Uttar Pally area.

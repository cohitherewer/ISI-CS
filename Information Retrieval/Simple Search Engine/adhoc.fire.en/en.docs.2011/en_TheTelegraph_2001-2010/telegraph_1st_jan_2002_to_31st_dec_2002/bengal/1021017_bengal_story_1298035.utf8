 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Single track stalls unsafe bridge repair
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Kharagpur, Oct. 16: The 400-metre, turn-of-the-century Kansai bridge connecting Kharagpur and Midnapore was declared unsafe a few years ago. Every day 64 trains, including Rajdhani Express, Nilachal Express, Ernakulam Express and Baidyanathdham Express, thunder over this bridge. 																								The engineering inspecting team of Kharagpur division has said in a report: The wooden sleepers of the track need urgent replacement. The pillars have also become too weak to hold the bridge. 																								But railway officials of the Kharagpur division are in a dilemma over how to go for a thorough repair of the bridge. The Adra division will practically remain cut off for at least 15 days once repair work is taken up on this single line. 																								Senior divisional engineer Manas Sarkar said they were racking their brains for an alternative. The railway ministry has sanctioned Rs 4.7 crore for the repair, he added.																								Midnapore MP Prabodh Panda said two other bridges had been constructed over Kansai river for road transport, but the authorities had done nothing to repair the railway bridge.

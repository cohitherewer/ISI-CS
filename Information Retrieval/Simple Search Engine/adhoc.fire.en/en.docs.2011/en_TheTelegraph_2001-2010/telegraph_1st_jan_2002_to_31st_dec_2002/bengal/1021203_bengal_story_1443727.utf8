The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, December 03, 2002 				 Hate magazine does the rounds
 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Calcutta, Dec. 2: Lanka was burnt because Ravan stole Sita; now millions of Sitas are being lost, why is Lanka not being burnt?																								Do or die. Can Hinduism survive  this sea of Islam?																								If theres any doubt in the readers mind about what burning Lanka actually implies, things will be sorted out pretty soon.																								A bilingual (Hindi and English) fortnightly published from Delhi by a former BJP Lok Sabha MP is now doing the rounds in far-off  and secular  Calcutta, reaching the citys more sensitive spots, and, surprisingly, even police stations.																								A copy of the late-October issue of Abhay Bharat (a photocopy of which is available with The Telegraph)  official organ of the Akhand Hindusthan Morcha  found its way to Kasba police station recently, state government officials said. The magazine was sent by registered post, going by the address and the crossed-out stamp, and we are worried about the intended fallout of this new occurrence, a senior official said.																								The West Bengal Minorities Commission said the matter has been brought to its notice We intend to inform the state government accordingly, commission chairman Justice K.M. Yusuf said. 																								It is unfortunate that Bengal and Calcutta, perceived to be communally much less volatile than some other parts of the country, are now being targeted by forces that want to destroy the countrys essentially secular fabric, he added.																								Senior officials said they were worried by the timing of Abhay Bharats circulation. Bengal, like the rest of the country, may celebrate Id-ul-Fitr on December 6 (depending on the sighting of the moon), the 10th anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid.																								The tenor of the issue doing the rounds has immense potential to lead to undesirable incidents, especially with some of the articles being deliberately targeted against a particular community.																								Much of it, for instance, deals with the explosion of the Muslim population in India. Taking to task Hindu intellectuals, Leftists and the secular nobility of India for deliberately ignoring the imbalance between the Hindu and Muslim rates of growth, the article warns that several states could have a Muslim majority in the near future.

 Friday, August 30, 2002 				 20 convicted for ex-MP son death
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, Aug. 29: Mafia don B. Rambabu and 19 of his groups members were convicted today for murdering former CPI MP Narayan Chowbeys son, Goutam Chowbey, in Kharagpur on September 11.																								Rambabus wife, B. Manju, brother, B. Shrinu, and brother-in-law, Ashok Tadi, are among those convicted by district additional sessions judge Intaj Ali Shah. The judge will pass the sentences on Saturday after hearing the convicts individually.																								In his 85-page judgement, Shah said all the 20 brought before the court for trial were involved in the murder of Goutam Chowbey directly or indirectly.																								Rambabu and his associates are also accused in eight other murder cases including the killing of Goutams younger brother Manas, who was hacked to death in Kharagpur on January 27, 1999.																								Goutams wife, Hema Chowbey, who was present in the court today with her four-year-old daughter Alisa broke down after the judge pronounced Rambabu and his associates guilty of murdering her husband.																								I have been waiting for this day to see the killers punished. I have lost everything except my courage to fight against these criminals and bring them to book, Hema said.																								There is no male member left in my family now. They killed my husband and my brother-in law, Manas, in broad daylight. I am happy to get justice from the court of law, she said.																								The police arrested Rambabu and others in Andhra Pradesh on November 1 and filed chargesheets against the accused within 81 days of their arrest. The police named 29 persons as Rambabus henchmen in the chargesheets. Of them, 19 were arrested and 10 are still absconding.																								District police superintendent K.C. Meena said a deputy superintendent of police was asked to supervise the case. Shah, in his judgement, complimented the investigation officer of the case, Dilip Dutta, for his hard work.																								The Chowbey brothers were murdered for actively protesting against Rambabus criminal activities in railway yards of Kharagpur.																								Rambabu had established a monopoly in bagging South- Eastern Railway contracts by unleashing a reign of terror among competitors.

 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Murshidabad assault on polio doctor 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, Nov. 20: Villagers beat up a doctor and three nurses in separate incidents in the Suti police station area of Murshidabad yesterday when children fell ill during the ongoing pulse polio drive. 																								Doctor Shyamal Chatterjee of the Aurangabad primary health centre has lodged an FIR with the police. Yesterday a child fell ill as it was infected with round worms. But the villagers dragged me out of the camp and began raining blows on me, Chatterjee said. The block development officer, the Unicef representative and the panchayat samity chairman, who were present, rescued him. 																								Two nurses, Parul Karmakar and Pika Bhattacharya, were assaulted in Aurangabad by angry villagers, who claimed that a child had taken ill after being administered the vaccine on Monday. Sandhya Sinha, another nurse, met with a similar fate at Mahendrapur village. 																								The pulse polio programme was on between November 17 and 19, and special attention was being given to Suti and Shamsergunje, where there are 10 and seven polio-infected children respectively.																								 Couple attacked																								A handicapped woman and her husband were attacked with knives last night at Katakhali village in Gosaba. A Trinamul Congress supporter allegedly led the attack as the man, a disgruntled RSP worker, was not shifting allegiance despite making such noises. The couple is in hospital in a critical state.

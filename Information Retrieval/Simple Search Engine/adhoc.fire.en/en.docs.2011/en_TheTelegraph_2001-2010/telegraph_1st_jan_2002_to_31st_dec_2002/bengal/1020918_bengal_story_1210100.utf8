 Wednesday, September 18, 2002 				 Police on private tuition prowl
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Sept. 17: The chief judicial magistrate here has ordered police to find out whether 43 teachers from state-run primary schools are coaching students privately even after pledging not to do so.																								Chief judicial magistrate S. Bramha was acting on a complaint by an unemployed youth, Rafiqul Hasan, and 20 others naming the 43 teachers who were still taking private classes. 																								The government had announced in December that teachers of state and state-aided schools would not be allowed to give private tuition. The teachers were also made to sign an undertaking.																								Whether or not these teachers are still taking private classes will also be probed by the district inspector of schools, said school education minister Kanti Biswas. The department will wait for the courts decision before acting on the teachers, the minister said. We will carry out whatever action the court decides to initiate against these teachers. We will ensure that the governments policy on private tuition is properly implemented. 																								District police chief B.N. Ramesh said his office was yet to receive the courts directive. 																								Bramha has asked the inspector in-charge of Burdwan police station to treat the complaint as an FIR and proceed with the investigation under Section 156(3) of the CrPC.																								District inspector of schools Subhas Samanta said the order banning private tuition was sent to all schools. Every school has sent us the undertakings signed by teachers. If we receive a complaint against a teacher, we forward it to the school concerned, he said.																								Samanta, however, conceded that there was no system in place to keep an eye on teachers to haul them up. 																								Rafiqul and the rest had said in the petition: We have gone house to house and taken photographs of these 43 teachers taking classes. A similar case was filed about a month ago by Girishchandra Jadab against 16 teachers. The case will be heard on September 19.

 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 CPM-RSP clash claims 2
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Canning, Sept. 15: Two persons were killed and three critically injured as CPM and RSP supporters clashed over the right to use a village pond at Budhakhali.																								Local RSP leaders claimed that the dead (Shahidul Gharami and Ramanik Gharami) were party members who were attacked by a group sheltered by CPM panchayat member Haripada Sardar. 																								The injured  Javed Ali Gharami, Abed Bux Mollah and Zakir Hussain  are all members of the Gharami family.																								RSP district secretary and Basanti MLA Subhas Naskar said the clash has the potential to rupture ties between the two Left Front partners at the grassroots level. We have raised the issue of CPM-sheltered goons targeting our workers at several Left Front meetings. Nothing has been done, said Naskar.																								Angry villagers refused to release the body of Shahidul for some time to protest police inaction. Tension ran high as several shops were damaged, bombs rained and firearms freely used, police said.

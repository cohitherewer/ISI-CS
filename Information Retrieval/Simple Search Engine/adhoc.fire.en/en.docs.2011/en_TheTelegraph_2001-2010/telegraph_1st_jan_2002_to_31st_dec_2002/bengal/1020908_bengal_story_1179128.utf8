 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 7: The state CPM leadership is likely to stress on winning back  during the panchayat elections scheduled for next year  seats that were lost by thin margins.																								At a two-day meeting that began today, party leaders emphasised the need to contest the panchayat polls without any differences among Left Front partners. They observed that there have been misunderstandings among Front constituents at the grassroots level and said the CPM will have to take the initiative to remove them before the polls.																								The leaders are also likely to discuss the overall political situation in the state.																								A section of senior CPM leaders, who are aggrieved over health minister Surjya Kanta Mishras preliminary reaction to the death of children at B.C. Roy Hospital, is expected to seek the leaderships view on the issue during the meeting.																								To mitigate the damage, the party has decided to highlight the facilities the government plans to introduce in hospitals.

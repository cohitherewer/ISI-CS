 Wednesday, October 09, 2002 				 Drive to deploy state doctors as teachers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 8: The health department today decided to revise recruitment rules for government doctors willing to become teachers in various medical colleges of Bengal.																								Director of Medical Education (DME) C.R.

We need about 350 more teachers for our medical colleges and we welcome those in the non-teaching cadre with adequate qualification to come and teach in our colleges. For this, we need to amend the recruitment rules, Maity said.																								He said doctors with degrees such as M.D., M.S. and D.M. posted in rural, sub-divisional, state general and district hospitals could now apply for the post of assistant professor at medical colleges in Bengal.																								Storms claim six 																								Six persons have died in the past 24 hours in a series of thunderstorms that swept through south Bengal.

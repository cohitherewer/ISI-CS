The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, October 28, 2002 				 Promise to streamline justice at school start
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 27: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today opened a law school in the city with a promise to smoothen the judicial system in the state.																								The government is working on a strategy to speed up the delivery of justice, Bhattacharjee said at the inauguration of the permanent campus of the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) at Salt Lake this morning.																								We are taking various steps, from the block-level upwards, to improve both the quality and the speed of justice across Bengal, Bhattacharjee told an audience that comprised Chief Justice of India B.N. Kirpal, chief justice designate G.B. Pattnaik, chief justice of Allahabad High Court Shyamal Kumar Sen, NUJS vice-chancellor N.R. Madhava Menon, Jyoti Basu, state law minister Nisith Adhikary and Assembly Speaker A. Halim.																								The NUJS, conceived as a centre of excellence in legal studies, is a major initiative of the state government in the sphere of higher education. It is indeed gratifying to note that meritorious students from all over India are now coming to Calcutta in search of better legal education, said Bhattacharjee.																								Former director of the National Law School, Bangalore, and vice-chancellor Madhava Menon said the varsity is a case in the point to show that government projects can be completed within deadlines in the state.																								About 250 students from 22 states have already migrated to the NUJS for a modern law degree, said Menon even as he praised Adhikary and his department. 																								Menon assured the chief minister that NUJS will lend its professional expertise to the state government on emerging issues like law reforms, legal policy inputs, cybercrime, environment protection, patent and intellectual property rights in an era of globalisation in agriculture, trade and industry. 																								There are discernible changes in nearly all aspects of governance and public life in the state, especially in higher education, said a visibly enthused Menon.

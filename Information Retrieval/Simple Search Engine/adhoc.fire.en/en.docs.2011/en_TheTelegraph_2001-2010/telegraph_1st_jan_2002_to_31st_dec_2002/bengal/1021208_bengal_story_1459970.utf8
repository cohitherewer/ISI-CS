 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 7: The Sealdah-bound Lal Quila Express today rammed into a row of unoccupied rickshaws stranded on the tracks at the level-crossing at Ichhapur railway station in Eastern Railways Sealdah division. The rickshaws were smashed beyond recognition but there were no casualties.																								According to railway police, Trinamul Congress supporters had put up a sudden blockade on the railway tracks by placing the rickshaws across the level-crossing in support of a seven-point charter of demands concerning station amenities. The train hit the rickshaws at full speed before the driver could apply the emergency brake.																								It could have been a major accident as it is risky to stop a train running at high speed. It is fortunate that the train did not go off the tracks after the emergency brake was applied, said a senior railway official of the Sealdah division.																								There were serious differences among local Trinamul Congress leaders over the mode of the agitation. Some of them had said that a sudden blockade on railway tracks is not only illegal, but also unethical.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, September 10, 2002 				 CPM-RSP meet to bury hatchet
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 9: Having clawed each other on issues concerning the Left Front government, the CPM  the Front overlord  and the RSP today decided to sort out disputes at a meeting on Wednesday. 																								The RSP had recently criticised the working of the police department that is overseen by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								It is learnt that the CPM has taken exception to the RSPs criticism. The issue will be in the focus at the Alimuddin Street meeting.																								Apparently, the CPMs hackles are up as the RSP criticised the police even after all the Front partners were asked not to criticise the government or its departments in public. Front chairman Biman Bose had also laid down norms for ministers and leaders asking them not to pass comments on the government.																								Another Front constituent, the CPI, had also come down heavily on the police after they reportedly picked up some of its activists in north Bengal during operations against the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation.																								The RSP leadership had criticised the South 24-Parganas police after three of its activists were killed in Gosaba. The party alleged that its supporters were active in resisting a group of anti-socials who had links with Bangladeshi pirates. 																								The party blamed the police for failing to protect its cadre.

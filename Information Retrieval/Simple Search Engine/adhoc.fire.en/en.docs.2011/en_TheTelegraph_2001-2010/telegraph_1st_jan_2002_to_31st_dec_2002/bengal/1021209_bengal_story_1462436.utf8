 VIVEK CHHETRI				 	 The Shah Rukh starrer being shot at St Pauls. Picture by Avijit Sarkar																								Darjeeling, Dec. 8: The fitness freak in Shah Rukh Khan is giving police sleepless nights. 																								Kept waiting for three days, the star-starved fans mobbed the actor when he made an unscheduled stop at a local health club on Friday night after completing the days shooting for Main Hoon Na at St Pauls School. 																								The police have now issued instructions that Shah Rukh cannot make impromptu visits and will have to send prior intimation in case he wishes to go somewhere.																								Around eight that evening, Shah Rukh, who finally arrived here on Thursday after missing his date with the hills on two consecutive days, said he would like to go to a gym. 																								As word spread that the superstar was working out at the BodyZone Health Club, the fans, mostly pretty young things, braved the chill and flocked to the centre. 																								On their toes ever since the arrival of King Khan, the police had a trying time controlling the crowd. The fans jostled us and ultimately Shah Rukh had to squeeze his way through the crowd to go out. He jumped into the escort jeep and had to be driven away to the hotel in it, said C. Bhutia, inspector-in-charge, Darjeeling sadar. 																								Shah Rukhs Toyota Qualis was completely surrounded by fans and there was no way he could get into it.																								Even last evening, hundreds had gathered at the health club in anticipation of the stars arrival. Instead, however, a member of the films crew came. The restless crowd started getting violent and the police had to intervene to control the situation.																								I was talking with his physical trainer in the morning and it seems that he works out everyday. If this is so, proper information has to come. We will have to make adequate police arrangement as the star has to walk a distance after getting down from the vehicle because of the clubs location, But so far, we have not received any intimation from them, Bhutia said.																								Right now, we are concentrating only on Windamere  the hotel where Shah Rukh is staying  and St Pauls where every police personnel have been given specific instructions. We will do the same at the health club also, if need be, he added. 																								Inchu Kwok, owner of BodyZone, said: There was no prior information of his arrival and we are not sure whether he will come again. We hope he does. 																								Sushmita Sen, who also stars in Farha Khans debut film as director, is expected to reach the hill town by December 15.

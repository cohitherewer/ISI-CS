The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Purulia goes mobile
 AMIT UKIL																								Purulia, Nov. 18: Mobile services in Purulia town commenced today but not without problems that left many subscribers agitated.																								The services, provided by BSNL, began simultaneously with two other towns, Kharagpur and Cooch Behar. Bankura, Behrampore, Suri and Gangtok (which comes under West Bengal telecom circle) are enjoying the services since November 11.																								The BSNL package comes with several advantages over the providers in the private sector in terms of activation costs and charges for add-on facilities like roaming and SMS, but the government enterprise was initially unable to activate the pre-paid connections. 																								Pre-paid SIM cards were provided to 40 subscribers on Day I by the BSNL office here, though about 120 individuals had paid the requisite Rs 200 for activation. 																								But even for the card holders, access to the network wasnt easy. A senior telecom official contacted Calcutta to find out the hitch and told the subscribers there were technical difficulties. Tomorrow being a holiday, the links can only be established by Wednesday, he said. All other mobile service providers give immediate connection, an angry subscriber complained, threatening to hold ground with his demand in front of the telephone office.

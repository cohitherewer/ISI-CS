 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 CM tuition warning
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 9: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today delivered another sermon against private tuition from a college platform. 																								Inaugurating the new building of the Charuchandra Evening College, the chief minister cautioned teachers against accepting money for tuition. 																								We continue to pay you decent salaries even during our financial crisis. Why should you sell education and lose your dignity? he asked. 																								Bhattacharjee denied that schoolteachers were asked to submit undertakings on private tuition, and held motivated media reports responsible for any misunderstanding between the government and teachers. We dont share a king-subject relationship. But you shouldnt also tarnish our image, the chief minister warned.																								We have always accorded priority to education. We have spread literacy and made education free at the primary level. We wont allow the funds crunch to reflect adversely on education .This is difficult, but we wont relent, promised Bhattacharjee.

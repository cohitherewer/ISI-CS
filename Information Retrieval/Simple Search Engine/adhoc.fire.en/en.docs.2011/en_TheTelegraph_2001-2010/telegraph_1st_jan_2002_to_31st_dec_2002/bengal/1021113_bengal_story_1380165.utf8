 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 Ex-MLA among loot victims
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Nov. 12: A gang of dacoits went on a looting spree with a series of daring raids on passing cars at Mangalkot where a controversial police station had a low-key opening today.																								Among the victims were former CPM MLA from Katwa, Haramohan Sinha. The gang fled after they mistakenly stopped the subdivisional police officers car. 																								On realising what was on, Parvez Nishad opened fire, seriously injuring one of the miscreants. He was on his way back from Mangalkot, where he had been to oversee preparations for the inauguration of the new police station building. 																								The injured dacoit has been hospitalised. Before accosting Nishad, the gang had looted four other cars.																								Sinhas car was forced to a halt by a bullock cart barricade the dacoits had put up near a culvert. About seven men armed with lathis and sharp weapons surrounded the car. They dragged us out and beat us, he said.																								Bus heist																								A Siliguri-bound bus from Durgapur was looted tonight at the Ilambazar area in Birbhum. The robbers were travelling in the backseat of the bus as passengers.

 Tuesday, October 22, 2002 				 Chased for picking flowers, boy drowns
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, Oct. 21: A class X student jumped into a canal and died after the guards of a garden, where he had gone to pluck flowers, chased him at Kamarpukur yesterday morning.																								Satyanarayan Roy and some of his friends went to Kamarpukur Ramakrishna Mission High School in the early-morning darkness to collect flowers for the Lakshmi puja organised by a local club. 																								On spotting them, the security personnel made a hot chase in which all others managed to flee, but Roy. 																								He (Roy) might have jumped into the roadside Bhutir Khal to avoid harassment in the hands of the security staff, said police.																								It was almost dark and the boys ran desperately, said an elderly resident of the area. 																								Roy was declared dead when brought to the Arambagh Sub-Divisional Hospital. 																								Sub-divisional police officer of Arambagh Subhankar Singha Sarkar said no one was aware of the mishap till 9 am yesterday. 																								Policemen were on the lookout for the boy since his father Sushil Roy lodged a missing diary with the Goghat police station. Around 11 am, the residents found a basket full of flowers lying near the canal and informed the police. 																								Convinced that somebody had kept the basket before diving into it, we began the search and flushed out the body late in the afternoon, said Sarkar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, November 25, 2002 				 Embassy linked to moles
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN AMP; AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR																								Nov. 24: Kashmiri militants have been using Calcutta and Murshidabad to pass on defence secrets to the Pakistani embassy in Dhaka, a joint probe by the state and Central intelligence agencies suggests.																								The militants cross over to Bangladesh with the help of ISI agents at Jalangi in Murshidabad and use their contacts in the Indian Army, navy and air force to procure vital information about their operations, officials said.																								Deputy inspector-general of police, Murshidabad range, D.P. Tarenia said the police have specific information that proved beyond doubt that Ziauddin Biswas, his wife Ismatara, brother-in-law Hasan Habib and Rinku Ahmed of Jalangi  all arrested last week  had links with the Pakistani embassys military attache in Dhaka. 																								Tarenia added that the investigators are in possession of documents and tapes containing recorded conversations between the arrested four and the Pakistani embassy.																								We have clinching evidence to suggest that Biswas, Rinku and Nazrul Islam (an ISI mole in the army) had been to the Pakistani embassy in Dhaka and met two officials, identified as Aamir and Bhaisaab, he said.																								A Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau tip-off had led to the arrest of nine suspected ISI agents from Domkal and Jalangi in Murshidabad, Hogolberia in Nadia and Pune in Maharashtra. 																								Quoting from the interrogation of the suspects and the coordinated investigation report, police officials of Nadia and Murshidabad today said two Valley militants arrested in Srinagar in the middle of November had blown the lid off the racket.																								Intelligence sources refused to divulge details on the two militants for the sake of the investigations.																								We have information that six officials at the Pakistani embassy in Dhaka were recruiting agents from the border areas in Murshidabad and Nadia and co-ordinating affairs on the Bangladeshi side, an official said.																								Biswas and the rest allegedly relayed messages on signals, mostly the frequency and wavelength of the wireless systems employed by the defence forces, strategic locations, BSF build-ups along the border and the profiles of military personnel involved in combat operations.																								Tarenia said the arrested army personnel  Aufan Ukil and Nazrul Islam  belonged to the signals divisions in their respective army and air force units. 																								Biswas had admitted to have recruited 25 agents for training at ISI camps in Bangladesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 Vajpai to go after rebels
 AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR 																								Calcutta, Dec. 18: Bengal police chief D.C. Vajpai said he would get down to business in real earnest now that the Supreme Court had quashed a petition challenging his appointment as director-general of police. 																								After the apex court upheld his appointment, Vajpai declared he will go all out against outfits like the Peoples War, KLO and the Ulfa, besides identifying and taking to task some rogue elements in the Bengal police force. 																								The Supreme Court upheld Vajpais appointment as director-general of police by the state government on Friday. The state had appealed to the Supreme Court after Calcutta High Court quashed his appointment in a verdict delivered on March 18.																								The commandant-general of the home guards, Manas Chakraborty, had moved the high court, challenging Vajpais appointment. The apex court had ordered on May 3 a status quo till the deposition of the case.																								Vajpai told The Telegraph there would not be any let up in the drive against militant outfits. My twin priorities are to take the fight against terrorists to a logical end and end the nexus of a section of police officers with corrupt people, he said. The DG said KLO militants were now taking shelter in neighbouring countries, while those from the PW were getting help from sources outside the state. 																								CPM leader shot dead 																								A CPM leader was gunned down in Sandeshkhali in North 24-Parganas this evening when he was returning home on a motorcycle. 																								Haripada Ghosh, 45, secretary of the local committee of Boyarmari, was rushed to a health centre, where he was declared brought dead. The CPM has called a 12-hour bandh in Sandeshkhali.

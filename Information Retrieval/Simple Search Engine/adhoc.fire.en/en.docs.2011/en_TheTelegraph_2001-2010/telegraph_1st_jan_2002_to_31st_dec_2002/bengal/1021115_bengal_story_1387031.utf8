 Friday, November 15, 2002 				 Hospital head sells mobile clinic
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 14: The health department today lodged an FIR against the superintendent of Baruipur Subdivisional Hospital in South 24-Parganas accusing him of selling off a mobile clinic van stationed in the campus.																								Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said he received the astounding news on Tuesday and immediately ordered an inquiry. Chatterjee added that departmental proceedings have been initiated against the superintendent. 																								Soon, we will chargesheet and suspend him. It is most unbecoming of the head of a hospital. We have charged him with fraud and defalcation in the FIR lodged at Baruipur police station because the huge Bedford van was sold for an incredibly low price, he said.																								The van was traced to a garage-cum-godown at South Sinthi in north Calcutta. When we found it, the roof of the van had been sliced off, Chatterjee said. 																								The Centre had given the van to the state in the eighties. It was equipped with X-Ray and oxygen facilities and a small OT, a health official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Attempt to clear border fire cloud
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, Nov. 18: Bangladeshi deputy high commissioner Tauhid Hossain today called the recent exchange of fire between the Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) simple misunderstanding and denied the countrys government having any information on terrorist training camps there.																								Hossain, who inaugurated a fair of Bangladeshi books at the Vidyasagar University, reminded that the border is fenceless and the demarcations natural. He added: Problems have arisen but this is nothing our two friendly countries cannot resolve.																								Two border guards from both countries had recently opened fire at Hingalgunge over the construction of a jetty on the Indian side of the Ichhamati river.																								Hossain said the Khaleda Zia government had no information on clandestine militant camps in Bangladesh. 																								If we get any definite report from India, we will look into it, he said while reacting to Union home minister L.K. Advanis charge that the ISI was carrying out anti-India activities from Bangladeshi territory.

 Sunday, November 10, 2002 				 Denmark not to hand over Davy
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 9: Denmark ambassador Michael Sternberg said his government would not hand over Kim Davy, a key accused in the Purulia arms-drop case, to the Indian government.																								As per our constitution, it is not permissible. But Indian authorities can visit our country to interrogate Davy, Sternberg told newspersons at Writers Buildings, where he had come to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee this afternoon. 																								Kim Davy, a Danish national, Peter Bleach of Britain and five Latvians had allegedly dropped a huge consignment of arms, including AK-47 rifles, in Purulia in 1995. Davy had fled India, but the others were arrested.																								A special trial court had convicted Bleach and the Latvians and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The President of India later pardoned the Latvians, who were then released. He, however, did not grant the mercy petition of Bleach, who is still behind bars.																								At Writers Buildings today, Sternberg discussed the possibility of setting up dairy farms in collaboration with the West Bengal government. The Danish government is also ready to offer soft loans for developing agriculture, the ambassador said.

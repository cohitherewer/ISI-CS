 A STAFF REPORTER																								Kultali (South 24-Parganas) Oct. 4: The spiral of violence continued to swirl in the area as a CPM activist was lynched and two others grievously injured in separate attacks by alleged SUCI supporters last night.																								With this death, the toll in the CPM-SUCI clashes that erupted last week rose to four. Two SUCI workers were killed on Monday and a CPM worker was murdered yesterday. 																								Last night, SUCI supporters caught hold of CPM activists Ayub Paik and Ismail Piada at Kankandighi when they were returning home and thrashed them. Paik, a resident of Raidighi, died on the spot. Piada from Mathurapur was admitted to a local hospital. Police said his condition was critical.																								Additional superintendent of police (rural) S.S. Panda said the two were named in the FIR filed after the Nalgara incident in which the two SUCI activists were killed. We were looking for them, Panda said. 																								Alleged SUCI sympathisers have pounded the hands of CPM activist Dibakar Mondal with a heavy stone. 																								The police today rescued the nine CPM activists who were kidnapped by SUCI men from Kankandighi last night.																								A police team went to Kuamari village looking for Sahajahan, the main suspect in the Nalgara killings. As it reached the village, residents shot at the policemen. Eight persons were later arrested and a cache of improvised arms recovered. But the police failed to trace Sahajahan.																								The police then got a tip off that Sahajahan was hiding at Purba Sibpur village. This time, he gave them the slip. 																								One person was arrested from Purba Sibpur. On its way back in a motorboat with the days catch, the police team was surrounded by a mob of villagers at the jetty and the man in custody was snatched away.

 Saturday, October 19, 2002 				 Boy stabbed to death for trying to rescue mother
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Oct. 18: A class-lX student was stabbed to death by drunk assailants when he tried to resist their attempts to assault his mother near the Nabagram hospital quarters last night. 																								The accused, Centre Shaikh, has been arrested. 																								According to Murshidabad superintendent of police Birendra, Shaikh and a couple of his inebriated friends were walking past the quarters when they bumped into Menaka Saha. 																								When she objected to their misbehaviour, Shaikh and his mates started abusing Menaka and tried to assault her. 																								Sixteen-year-old Motilal came to his mothers rescue and tried to thwart the drunks. But a dagger was pierced through his abdomen. 																								Menaka and her younger son Locus were injured when they tried to save Motilal. They had to be admitted to the Behrampore General Hospital. 																								Shaikhs companions managed to escape.																								Menaka, whose husband Makhan is an employee of the Nabagram hospital, said: We have been living in the hospital quarters for a long time. As there is no boundary wall around the hospital, residents of adjoining Fakirpara use the road in front of the quarters. I protested when the drunk men made indecent remarks about me. They even tried to assault me. When Motilal tried to resist, he was repeatedly stabbed. 																								He sacrificed his life to save my honour, she added, tears rolling down her cheeks.																								The murder sparked massive resentment among local residents and the hospital employees, who resorted to a spontaneous ceasework. 																								Nabagrams block medical officer Swapan Sarkar said: They demanded exemplary punishment for all those responsible for Motilals death, immediate construction of a boundary wall around the hospital and a permanent police picket at the murder site.																								Sarkar has sent a detailed report on the incident to the chief medical officer of the district. He admitted that outsiders had an easy access to the hospital campus in the absence of a boundary wall.

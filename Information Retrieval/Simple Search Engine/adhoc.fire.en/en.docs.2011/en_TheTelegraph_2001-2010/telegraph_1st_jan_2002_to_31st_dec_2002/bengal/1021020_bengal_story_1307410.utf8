The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, October 20, 2002 				 Project push for poll victory
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 19: The CPM has started garnering support for the ensuing panchayat polls in the state.																								Senior leaders of the party asked panchayat sabhadhipatis to complete all pending projects in their respective zones by December.																								The party leadership also asked the panchayat leaders to give priority to construction of roads and embankments along rivers and huge canals and supply of drinking water.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and CPM state secretary Anil Biswas told the sabhadhipatis at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street that the leadership will not accept any lame excuse if they fail to complete the pending projects within the stipulated time.																								Todays meeting between the party leaders and senior panchayat functionaries can be seen as a prelude to next years panchayat elections.																								The party is worried about its performance in the south Bengal regions of Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura because of the increasing activities of the Peoples War and the Maoist Communist Centre.																								It is learnt that the CPM leaders have asked the sabhadhipatis of these districts to initiate special drives to complete the pending projects so that the naxalites are not able to extract political mileage.																								The panchayat leaders have also been asked by the party leadership to consult the district leadership and take help from them in completing the pending projects in time.																								The sabhadhipatis of Malda and Murshidabad have been asked to pay special attention to the problem of land erosion as thousands of people living along the river in the two districts are on the verge of losing their homes to the rampaging river.																								Embankments along the river must be created immediately. The state PWD is working hard to protect the lives and properties of people living in these areas. But local self-government institutions will have to initiate serious measures to make people feel that they are with them (the people), party leaders reportedly told the sabhadhipatis of these districts.																								The CPM leadership also criticised the Centres indifferent attitude towards the problem of land erosion.																								The party leaders, however, reminded the sabhadhipatis that blaming the Centre for any unsolved problem will not help the CPM win the forthcoming elections.																								You have to make the people feel that you are sincerely working for them, the leaders reportedly told the sabhadhipatis.

 RANJAN LAHIRY																								Burdwan, Nov. 16: The district zilla parishad has finally decided to close down the sarpodyan (snake park) in Krishnasayar, an open-air environmental park in Burdwan town, due to infrastructural inadequacy.																								Venomous snakes, the main crowd-puller of the park, have died in large numbers in the recent past due to negligence. About 40 species of snakes, including the King Cobra and Russels Viper, used to be displayed. The snakes will now be sent to other enclosures by the forest department.																								There was no infrastructural facility since the parks inception to take care of the snakes, according to Krishnasayar sources. The park is among eight such state parks which will be closed in quick succession, after a recent decision by the Union environment ministry.																								Burdwan zilla parishad sabhadhipati, Ramkrishna Banerjee, said the closure of the park was inevitable due to lack of infrastructural resources. 																								Only a licensed person can be entrusted with the snakes. Originally wed engaged the snake expert, Deepak Mitra, to look after the reptiles. But he hasnt visited the park for a long while. We met a few months back to sort this out and he agreed to resume supervision. But he didnt eventually turn up, he added.

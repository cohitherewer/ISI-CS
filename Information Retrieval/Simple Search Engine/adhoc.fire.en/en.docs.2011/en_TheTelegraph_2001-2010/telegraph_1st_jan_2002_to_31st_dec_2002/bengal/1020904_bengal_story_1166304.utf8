 TAMAL SENGUPTA 																								Calcutta, Sept. 3: The commission in the state CPM that deals with errant cadre has expressed its displeasure at certain party units for violating norms while handling cases of corruption against partymen.																								In an internal note, chairman of the commission Haridas Malakar has said that some CPM units do not strive to reform party members against whom disciplinary measures have been recommended. 																								Besides, many units do not give any opportunity to such members to defend themselves before the party units. Action was taken in certain cases where the party units did not give the errant member a chance to defend himself, Malakar said.																								In some cases, fresh charges were framed against a party member even after the earlier charges against him were proved baseless. Such measures were usually vindictive in nature and mostly results of infighting, Malakars secret note says.																								There are instances where no chargesheet was given to a party member and the higher party units did not receive a written reply from the member facing charges before he was penalised. 																								In some cases, action was taken against a party member without setting up an inquiry committee and many party units do not bother to maintain the minutes of proceedings, Malakars note says.																								He has asked all party units to go by the directives of the commission strictly while probing charges against a member and not to violate any clause of the commission in initiating measures against an errant partyman. 																								Any violation of the commissions directives will be treated as a serious lapse on the part of the party unit, Malakar warned. 																								It is learnt that the commission held 134 meetings till January 3, to assess disciplinary measures against members initiated by smaller party units. 																								The vigilance cell of the CPM has also received complaints against several district committees. More than 900 complaints against party leaders is pending before the cell. It has referred 470 of the complaints to the district units for their opinion. 																								But most of the districts have not bothered to reply. 																								The cell has referred 148 complaints to the Calcutta district committee. But the committee has so far replied to only five. 																								After Calcutta, the cell has received maximum number of complaints against leaders of the North 24-Parganas district unit. Of the 117 complaints referred to the unit, responses have come to the cell on five.																								However, the cell has praised the Burdwan committee, which is regular in sending replies to queries on complaints against its leaders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, October 08, 2002 				 Anti-plague cell merger
																								Calcutta, Oct. 7: The government has decided to merge its anti-plague cell with the epidemiology department of the School of Tropical Medicine, reports our special correspondent.																								Sources said the matter will be placed before a meeting of the state Cabinet on Wednesday.																								We are not clubbing our existing anti-plague administrative epidemic control office at Mullickbazar to the STM because we fear an outbreak of the disease in the near future. We are doing it to improve research and there is much scope for it if we work hand-in-hand with the STMs epidemiology department, a health department official said.																								 The anti-plague cell will be under direct supervision of the STM.																								However, there will not be any new recruitment to the new-look anti-plague cell. We will require about 130 officials and workers to start the cell. All of them will be redeployed from the health department, an official added.																								The cabinet meeting on Wednesday is also expected to approve the state governments decision to increase the postal allowance of MLAs from Rs 1,000 per month to Rs 2,000.																								Wednesdays meeting is also expected to give its nod to a proposal to enhance the post of the chief ministers press secretary. The post is now equivalent to that of a joint director and it is under the information and cultural affairs department. The proposal seeks to bring the post of the chief ministers press secretary under the home department and enhance it to match the rankl of a director. 																								Ends.

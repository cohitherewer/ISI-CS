The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 Trinamul unity show
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mamata and Sudip at Howrah station on Tuesday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Calcutta, Sept. 10: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today succeeded in putting up a show of unity at the parliamentary party meeting that endorsed her decision to replace Sudip Bandopadhyay with Ranjit Panja as the partys chief whip in the Lok Sabha.																								The meeting at the south Calcutta residence of Jadavpur MP Krishna Bose was attended by all Trinamul MPs, including Bandopadhyay. Rebel MP Ajit Panja was the only absentee. 																								He did not want to continue as the chief whip as he was over-burdened with the work of several standing committees, Bandopadhyay said. He denied differences with Mamata on organisational matters. Todays meeting was held in an amicable atmosphere. We have decided to maintain solidarity and work together for the partys expansion, he said.																								Briefing newsmen later, the Trinamul chief said the meeting expressed shock at the Rajdhani derailment near Gaya and called for the formation of an expert group to suggest steps to enhance passenger security.																								The meeting did not demand railway minister Nitish Kumars resignation, but felt there was need for greater vigil along the railway tracks and to intensify steps to ensure safety and security of railway equipment and passengers. It condoled the deaths and demanded adequate compensation for the bereaved families.																								Mamata, accompanied by Bandopadhyay, went to Howrah station this evening.																								Informed sources said Bandopadhyay realised the need for a patch-up with the Trinamul chief as his tiff with her was sending wrong signals to the partys rank and file and ultimately doing no good to his image. 																								Mamata, too, did not want to lose the confidence of her long-time associate and utilised todays meeting to put up an everythings fine show.																								Sources said a move may be afoot to win over Ajit Panja, who was suspended for his anti-Mamata tirade and defying the party line on the partnership with the NDA. The new chief whip, Ajit Panjas younger brother, is likely to take a fresh initiative to bring Mamata and the rebel leader to the talks table.

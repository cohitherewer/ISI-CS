The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, November 24, 2002 				 Regrouped Bangasena threatens war against jihad
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jalpaiguri, Nov. 24: Last war to end Islamic jihad, reads the Bangasena leaflet.																								A defunct organisation formed on March 25, 1982, to form a homeland for Bengali Hindus hailing from erstwhile East Bengal, the Bangasena is making efforts to regroup and resume its agenda of waging a war against Islamic jihad.																								We are against the torture that Bengali Hindus are facing across the border. So, we have declared war against Islamic groups and against the government of Bangladesh. We are preparing ourselves to capture six districts of Bangladesh situated on the west bank of the Padma river and create a homeland for Hindus who have fled from there to India, said the self-styled, septuagenarian senapradhan of the Bangasena, Kalidas Baidya.																								Speaking to reporters from a secret hideout on the outskirts of Jalpaiguri, the chief clarified the outfits stance of announcing its stand on declaring a war against the suppression of the minority community in Bangladesh. Accordingly, the outfit plans to hold an open meeting at Vivekananda Palli here, near the Teesta bridge.																								The Jalpaiguri district administration, however, has no inkling of such a meeting. District additional superintendent of police Anand Kumar said: We do not have any such knowledge. Anyway, they need permission for organising any such meeting. We are looking into it.																								Baidya said as many as three lakh people had fled Bangladesh after the general elections last year. 																								We want that the six districts of the country, namely, Khulna, Faridpur, Jessore, Kusthia, Barisal and Potuakhali, be announced as an independent country and should be the homeland of the people who fled from their ancestral home owing to atrocities that they faced there, he added.																								Nilkamal Mondal, who hails from Calcutta, and outfitted in a Bangasena uniform, said: We are running camps for training our cadets in different parts of the country and even in Bangladesh, where our cadets are working in secret.																								Though both the members refused to specify their camps locations, they said they existed in different parts of Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttaranchal, Bihar, Jharkhand and other states.																								As far as the arms struggle was concerned, the activists were confident of getting hold of arms. 																								Partha Samanta, the Bangasena rashtrapati, was not present at the briefing. It is his security which matters. He always stays underground, Baidya said.																								We are not against Muslims but the way Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism is spreading in the world is a cause of concern for us. Thus, our cadets are even working in countries like US and England to watch and retaliate against the Islamic jihad as and when instructed by our high command, he said.																								They have even named their so called Homeland as Bangabhumi and the capital as Samanta Nagar at an undisclosed location.																								 Regarding their potential to strike a country and the Islamic fundamentalists, both of them remained tight-lipped. But Baidya claimed to have at least five lakh supporters in Bengal only, and its cadets were waiting for the order for action.

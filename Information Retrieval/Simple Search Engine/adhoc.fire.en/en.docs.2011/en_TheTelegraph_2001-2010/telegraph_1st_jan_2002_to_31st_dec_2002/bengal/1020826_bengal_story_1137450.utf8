 Monday, August 26, 2002 				 Quota clash in Visva Bharati
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Bolpur, Aug. 25: Violence broke out on the Visva Bharati campus today as students owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress drove out candidates who had come to take the admission test for the undergraduate course in social work, saying they were protesting against the universitys decision to reduce the internal quota from 12 to five. 																								University authorities cancelled the test after the slogan-shouting students disrupted the examination that was to have been taken by 130 candidates from the state and Bangladesh. 																								Officials said of the 20 seats, 12 are kept reserved for Visva Bharati students. From this academic year, the quota has been slashed to five.																								Visva Bharati registrar S.K. Sarkar said he had sought a report from the social work department. 																								We have urged the university authorities repeatedly not to reduce the internal quota for the course but they ignored our plea. We were left with no option but to ensure that the exam is not held, said the Trinamul-affiliated union leader Sujoy Mukherjee.

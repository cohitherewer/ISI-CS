The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, December 05, 2002 				 Santro seized for tax default
 REZA PRADHAN																								Siliguri, Dec. 4: Taking a cue from neighbouring Cooch Behar, the cashstrapped Siliguri Municipal Corporation cracked down on defaulters today and came back with a booty of home appliances and a Santro.																								With policemen standing guard, the taxmen from the corporation raided the premises of the defaulters who owe a whopping Rs 5 crore. Government organisations owe to the civic body Rs 2 crore more.																								The officials picked out three houses from a list of defaulters at Panjabi Para and Panitanki and took away furniture, fridge and cooking appliances. Iswar Chandra Agarwal of Panjabi Para, who owes Rs 2.2 lakh, had his Santro taken away.																								Mayor Bikash Ghosh said goods worth Rs 10 lakh were seized. We hope to realise Rs 4 lakh from the defaulters whose houses were raided today, he added. If they fail to pay up, the items would be auctioned.																								Of the 5,000 defaulters, the corporation has identified more than 1,000. Most of them have not paid taxes for years. There are some who have not paid anything over the past decade, said Ghosh.

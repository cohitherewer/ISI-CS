 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 CPM fumes at CPI initiative
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 1: The state CPM leadership today took strong exception to a CPI delegations visit to Dhupguri and its subsequent criticism of the police for non-performance in connection with the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation attack on the CPM office there. 																								Five CPM functionaries were gunned down and 13 others seriously injured by an armed gang of KLO militants on August 17.																								Left Front chairman Biman Bose said at the party office this afternoon that the issue would be discussed at the next Front meeting. 																								Asked if the CPI had tarnished the Fronts image by criticising the police, Bose refused to comment. I can tell you this much, that we shall discuss the matter threadbare at the next meeting, he said.																								The CPI delegation led by state party secretary Manju Kumar Majumder slammed the Jalpaiguri district police on its return to the city from Dhupguri.																								The team criticised the police for ignoring an intelligence agency warning about a possible KLO strike in the area. Majumder even alleged that a section of the policemen had links with the militants.																								Insiders said the CPM is unhappy with Majumders criticism of the police as it is aimed at embarrassing chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who looks after the home (police) department. 																								The Front chairman had urged all the partners of the ruling coalition not to criticise any government department in public.																								It is learnt that another reason for the CPMs unhappiness with the CPI delegations Dhupguri visit is that Majumder and his men made it to the site of the strike ahead of any CPM delegation from the city.																								The code of conduct for ministers and leaders of the Front constituents, drafted by its chairman, prohibits any criticism of the government in public. 																								But in clear violation of the code, the Front constituents often come down heavily on the police and its administration. Majumders case may be treated as the most recent instance. 																								Days ago, agriculture minister and Forward Bloc leader Kamal Guha had openly criticised the government for initiating a move to introduce the new agriculture policy. Guha had even threatened to place an alternative farm policy at the meeting of the state Cabinet.

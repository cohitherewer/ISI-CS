The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, December 21, 2002 				 Contempt plea against council
 FROM R.VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Dec. 20: A complaint seeking contempt action against the West Bengal Medical Council was moved in the Supreme Court today in the case alleging medical negligence in the death of US-based doctor Anuradha Saha.																								The petitioners counsel alleged that the medical council had filed a false affidavit in the apex court, which as per an earlier judgment of the Supreme Court, was contempt.																								The application charged Dilip Kumar Ghosh, registrar of the state medical council, with filing the false affidavit. The council had said in its affidavit that only 13 cases of medical negligence complaints were referred to it by the Medical Council of India. But the actual figure is 28.																								Anuradha died under medical custody during a trip to India four years ago. Her husband, Kunal, has been contesting criminal cases against the allegedly negligent doctors. His brother-in-law, Malay Ganguly, had filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court seeking action against errant doctors and accountability for those involved in medical negligence cases across the country.																								A court record obtained by this correspondent confirmed that 28 cases were referred to the state medical council, out of which it had not filed any reply in 22.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, November 16, 2002 				 Mass transfer for doctors
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov 15: The government today transferred a record 200 teacher-doctors from Calcutta to the medical colleges in Burdwan, Bankura and north Bengal. 																								The move is aimed to shake up the doctors who had got rooted in the city. Sections of the health department, however, said it was meant to lure the rural electorate before the panchayat polls.																								Director of medical education C.R. Maity said the mass transfer of senior doctors to the districts would help improve healthcare facilities there. While the five medical college hospitals in the city have nearly 600 teacher-doctors, three medical colleges in Burdwan, Bankura and north Bengal have 150.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, Sept. 21: A Trinamul Congress supporter was killed and two inmates of a house seriously injured when bombs kept in a bag suddenly exploded at Suranankar village at 1 pm today.																								Tamluk sub-divisional police officer Kalyan Banerjee said police have recovered 20 live bombs from the house near Tamluk town and arrested four persons, including two students of Pingla College  Ratikanta Santra and Tapas Sau. Trinamul flags and posters were also recovered from the house, Banerjee said.																								The blast at the house damaged its walls and a portion of roof was also blown away. The condition of the two injured  Biren Maity and Manas Roy  is said to be critical. Police sources said a group of Trinamul activists from Pingla, who could not enter their villages following a clash with the CPM, had rented a house in the village near Tamluk town a month ago from Ajit Sau.																								District CPM leader Dahar Sen alleged that Trinamul was gathering arms and weapons in their hideouts to terrorise the people before the panchayat elections scheduled to be held next year.																								Both the CPM and Trinamul held a meeting with the district magistrate M.V. Rao today and assured him of their co-operation in tackling anti-social elements in the district.

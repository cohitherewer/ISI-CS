 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 7: Trinamul Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjees growing disenchantment with the BJP-led NDA has found expression in her two books which were formally released today.																								The books, Ominous Signs and Feelings, were released by poet Nirendra Nath Chakraborty and writer Nimai Bhattacharya.																								The programme was attended by mayor Subrata Mukherjee, Trinamul legislators Saugata Roy and Tapas Pal and several party leaders. The number of books authored by the Trinamul leader has now gone up to 15.																								While Ominous Signs has openly criticised the NDAs disinvestment policy, Feelings contain Mamatas thoughts on the current political situation, including Gujarat. I have tried to highlight the need for some radical changes in the existing system, which will otherwise collapse, Mamata said.

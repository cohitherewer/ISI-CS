The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 Delay in Kidwai report
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 28: The Madarsa Education Committee looks set to receive another extension as its report has not yet reached Calcutta. 																								With just three days left of the committees term  the present extension is till August 31  officials say they have not received the report from committee chairman A.R. Kidwai, former Governor of West Bengal who is now in Delhi.																								The committee, set up by the state government 18 months ago to suggest ways of modernising the madarsa syllabus to bring it at par with the secular syllabi from Class X to the post-graduate level, is now into its second six-month extension after an original tenure of six months. 																								Despite protests mounting against the inordinate delay  the West Bengal Madarsa Students Union submitted a memorandum to the committee office on Wednesday  the government, feel officials, has no option but to extend the term.																								If the government does not extend the term, it will obviously not be able to submit its report, a senior official explained.																								Officials here say Kidwai found the first draft of the 174-page report too long. So, a second draft  of 114 pages was recently submitted to Kidwai. 																								The report is likely to recommend a balance between the secular and modern and the religious and ancient in every syllabus, starting from the class-X level to the post-graduate level, say officials.

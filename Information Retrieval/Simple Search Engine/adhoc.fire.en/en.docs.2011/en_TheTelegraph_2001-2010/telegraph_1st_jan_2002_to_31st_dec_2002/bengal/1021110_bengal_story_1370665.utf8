 Sunday, November 10, 2002 				 Couple held in chit-fund racket bust
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Siliguri, Nov. 9: A major chit-fund racket in north Bengal was busted with the arrest of a couple from Subash Pally, following night-long raids.																								The couple  Subhas and Susmita Burman  have cheated more than 100 people, most of whom are from the lower- income group, to the tune of Rs 5 lakh, say police officials.																								The Burmans posed as representatives of financial institutions, said additional superintendent of police K. Jayaraman.																								The couple had moved into a flat at Hathi More in Subash Pally in May. A month before Durga puja, the landlords suspicions were aroused as many poorly-clad people visited the couple.																								On raiding the flat, police found four suitcases with bundles with real notes at the top and bottom and plain paper sandwiched in between.

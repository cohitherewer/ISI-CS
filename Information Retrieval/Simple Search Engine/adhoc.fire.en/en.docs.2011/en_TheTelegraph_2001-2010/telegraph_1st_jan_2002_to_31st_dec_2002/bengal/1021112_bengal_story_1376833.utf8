 OUR BUREAU																								Nov. 11: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has asked chief secretary S.N. Roy to get in touch with the Centre and arrange for increased patrolling around Kendo and its adjoining islands near the Bangladesh border to check the intrusion of foreign trawlers.																								Bhattacharjee, who had a meeting with Sundarbans development minister Kanti Ganguly and fisheries minister Kironmoy Nanda at Writers Buildings, assured that he would take up with the Centre the issue of setting up a permanent Coast Guard station in the area. 																								The meeting was called in the wake of the intrusion of highly sophisticated Thai fishing trawlers near Kendo last weekend. 																								After the meeting, Nanda said putting up sophisticated wireless stations at Frasergunj and Shankarpur for a better communication network will help check intrusion. On Saturday, fishermen reported to police that about nine Thai trawlers raided theirs with sophisticated firearms. 																								The strengthening of the Coast Guard setup depends on the Centre and we have been making the demand for some time, said Ganguly.

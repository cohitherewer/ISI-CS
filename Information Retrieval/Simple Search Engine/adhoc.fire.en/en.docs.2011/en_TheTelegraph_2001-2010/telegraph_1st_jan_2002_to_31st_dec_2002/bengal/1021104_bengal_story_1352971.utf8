 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Nov. 3: District magistrate Manoj Agarwal today sought a report from the superintendent of police on the blast inside Burdwan police station. 																								A teastall owner was seriously injured when a bomb in a stack near the police station toilet exploded yesterday afternoon.																								The bombs were kept in the open without being defused. The rule is to defuse a bomb immediately after it is seized. The police have already started an investigation, said Agarwal. Stern action would be taken against the policemen responsible for not defusing the bombs, he added.																								Inspector-general of police, western range, Jitram Bhagat has ordered a separate inquiry into the incident. A suo motu case has been started at the police station by the inspector in-charge.																								Sources said the stock of bombs at the police station was seized months ago before a by-election to the local municipality.

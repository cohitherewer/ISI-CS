 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Veil off army ISI moles 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, Nov. 20: Police have circulated a list of names of persons in the armed forces suspected of having links with the ISI after interrogating the three men and a woman arrested from Jalangi last Sunday for their connections with the agency. 																								We have a list of names of quite a few army and air force men, who are suspected of passing on crucial information to the ISI, said Murshidabad police superintendent Virendra. The names are not only of those from this district, but from across the country. We have sent a list of names to the army, and police in Nadia, Calcutta and some other places so that they, too, can be questioned, he added. 																								Ziauddin Biswas had spilled the beans about an air force employee, Arfan Ukil, a day after his arrest. Arfan, posted at Nalia in Gujarats Bhuj district, is now in custody. 																								Police have detained about a dozen men, including several army personnel, for questioning from Kuchiamora village in the Domkal police station area, from where one of the ISI agents  Ziauddins brother-in-law Ghulam Murtaza  was arrested. 																								Besides police, officers from army and air force intelligence and a team of lady officers from the Centres subsidiary intelligence branch have arrived for interrogation. CID inspector- general Partha Bhattacharya is also coming from Calcutta. 																								Police are tight-lipped on why the jawans have been detained. One of the soldiers, Nazrul Islam, who was home on leave, was released today. 																								Ziauddins father-in-law, Afazuddin, and wife, Ismatara, were arrested in Sundays swoop on Domkal and Jalangi. Virendra said police were trying to find out whether Ismatara had links with army and BSF officers.																								The arrested quartet is in custody at the district intelligence branchs lock-up.

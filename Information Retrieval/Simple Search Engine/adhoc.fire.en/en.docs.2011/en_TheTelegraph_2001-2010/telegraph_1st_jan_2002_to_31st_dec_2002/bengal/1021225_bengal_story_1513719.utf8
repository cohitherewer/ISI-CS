 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, Dec. 24: The Trinamul Congress today lost power in yet another civic body when the Left Front defeated it in a vote of no-confidence and clinched control of the municipality here. 																								The Front wrested control of the municipal board after the two-vote win against Trinamul, riven by dissent and internal squabblings in the district. The party had lost the Bansberia municipality to the CPM earlier.																								Ashis Sen of Trinamul today made way for Barun Ganguly of the CPM as the new chairman of Chinsurah municipality. 																								The district front was apparently jubilant with the developments but Trinamul lay pondering over its many problems in the run-up to the pnchayat polls scheduled for next year.																								Late in November, four Trinamul councillors withdrew support for the chairman and declared themselves as Independents. With the Independents on its side, the front sniffed a majority support in the 30-member board. It tabled a motion to oust the chairman on December 4. Today, the front beat Trinamul 16-14.																								The result indicated cross-voting and the district Trinamul leadership pointed out that two of its councillors, Sibu Das and Sanjit Mondal, voted in favour of the front. Realising that infighting had reached a flashpoint in the district, Trinamul leaders Partha Chatterjee and Mukul Roy came on December 6 to effect a patch-up, but to no avail. Most district Trinamul leaders blamed the leadership for failing to stem the dissidence. 																								This is ridiculous. Sibu was charged with betraying the party. But his brother Asim was one of those killed in the police firing on Youth Congress supporters at a Mamata Banerjee rally on July 21, 1993. Didi herself helped Sibu get a berth in Trinamul. The leadership has lost control over its members, said a leader.

 RANJAN LAHIRY																								Burdwan, Nov. 17: A sentry on duty at the district armoury in the police lines here was killed by a shot from his own service revolver at dawn today. 																								Tapas Dewan, 28, resident of Gourhati in Hooghly districts Arambagh, joined the district armed police as a constable in 1999. 																								Primary investigation indicates Tapas committed suicide, police sources said. The body has been sent for post-mortem.																								I dont agree with the police version. There is no reason why Tapas would kill himself. Id look into the matter, said his father.																								Around 5.45 am, another policeman heard a gunshot and rushed to Tapas post to find him lying in a pool of blood. After the shot shattered the early-morning calm, panic spread among other policemen and residents of the police lines.

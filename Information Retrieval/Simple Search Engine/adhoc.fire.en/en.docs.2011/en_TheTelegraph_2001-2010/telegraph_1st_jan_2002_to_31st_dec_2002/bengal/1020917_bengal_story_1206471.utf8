 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE				 	 Madhab with Amit Kumar																								Barakar, Sept. 16: Even after 15 songs and six cassettes under top-notch banners, sub-inspector Madhab Mondal prefers to remain a policeman on job at the investigation centre here.																								Having had his lyrics sung by the likes of Anuradha Paudwal, Amit Kumar and Sadhna Sargam, Madhav is reluctant to hang up his vardi to become a lyricist worthy in the music firmament.																								If I took music as my profession, I would have had to write more lyrics for more money to sustain my family and the quality of the songs would then definitely plummet. No, the rat race is not for me, Madhab said.																								Madhabs dream became a reality in 2000 when one of his songs was sung by Anuradha Paudwal under the T-series banner. 																								Another cassette, Brithai Pujis Maatir Maake, sung by Anuradha is ready for release this year from the RPG-HMV studios. Sagarika Casettes is handling Swapna Niye, being recorded by Sadhna, said the sub-inspector.																								A graduate in botany, the boy from a poor farming family draws inspiration from the poet in chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. I once was watching an interview of the chief minister where he mentioned that he gains energy by relaxing and writing poems, Madhab said. He even began taking off on Bhattacharjees rhetoric.																								The chief minister was quoted in a vernacular daily as saying after his oath-taking ceremony: Ami swapna dekhte bhalobashi; tabey ta kakhono abastab swapna noy; swapna ke bastobe rup dite chai (I love to dream; but my dreams are never unrealistic; I want to give shape to these dreams in reality. The policeman responded penning the lines: Swapna dekhte bhalobashi; mon je swapne bhara;swapna noy to akash kusum, jay na jake dhara (I love dreaming; my mind is crowded with them; they are not empty ones that cannot be caught.																								Madhabs mentor is veteran singer and music director Mrinal Bandyopadhyay, who adds melody to his words. I have an understanding with Mrinalda. He is the one who took me to Mumbai and introduced me to the record companies, says Madhab.																								Madhab is a very good lyricist and I was impressed by his concept of writing, in his usage of words, a rare talent in a policeman. I immediately took a fancy for him and introduced him to the recording companies, said Bandyopadhyay.

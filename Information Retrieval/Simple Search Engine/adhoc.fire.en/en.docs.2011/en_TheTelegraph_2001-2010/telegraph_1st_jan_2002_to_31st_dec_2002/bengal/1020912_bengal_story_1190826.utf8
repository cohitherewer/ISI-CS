 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kharagpur, Sept. 11: Mamata Banerjee today extended her opposition to the division of railway zones from Eastern Railway to South-Eastern Railway.																								You are mostly railwaymen here and I know you are tense about the fate of your zone. Do not worry, we are beside you, the Trinamul Congress chief told a rally to mark one year of Gautam Chowbeys murder by mafia don Rambabu and his gang. 																								Addressing the crowd at the spot where Chowbey was killed, Mamata said she was anxious about the fate of those injured in the Rajdhani Express accident. 																								I was late for this meeting as we were in Howrah station for the past 48 hours. We are not satisfied with the rescue efforts, she said, adding that this was not the time to demand the resignation of railway minister Nitish Kumar but to concentrate on rescue efforts. 																								Sudip Bandyopadhyay, the dislodged Trinamul parliamentary chief whip, also attended, but left soon after Mamatas arrival.

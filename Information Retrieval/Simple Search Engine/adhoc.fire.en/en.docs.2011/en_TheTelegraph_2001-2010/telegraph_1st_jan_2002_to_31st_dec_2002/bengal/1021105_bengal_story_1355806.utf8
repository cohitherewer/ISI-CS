 A STAFF REPORTER																								Serampore, Nov. 4: A resident of Satghara Paschimpara under Serampore police station was severely beaten up by members of a local club last night when he refused to pay an exorbitant Kali puja subscription.																								Abhijit Halder, 25, was admitted to the Serampore Walsh Hospital in serious condition.																								Members of Smriti Sangha demanded a hefty amount from Abhijits father, Gobardhan Halder, 50. The Halders, a low middle-class family, could not afford to yield to the demand. The youth had to protest and the result was the merciless thrashing.																								Weve already arrested six out of the 12 club members involved in the incident. The club had not even obtained the mandatory police approval to organise the puja. The club president is absconding, said subdivisional police officer Shankhasubhra Chakraborty.																								We will react promptly if we receive any complaint of extortion against puja organisers, Chakraborty added.																								Nine members of the Seoraphuli Uporhata Sarbojonin Shyama Puja organising committee were arrested on November 1 on charges of extortion.

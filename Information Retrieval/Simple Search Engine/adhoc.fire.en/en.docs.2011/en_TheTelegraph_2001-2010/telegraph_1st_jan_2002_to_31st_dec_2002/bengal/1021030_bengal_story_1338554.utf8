 Wednesday, October 30, 2002 				 Hunt for killers of man carrying grenades 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 29: Police have launched a drive to identify a man found murdered today at Arjunpur in the Haroa police station area with two grenades and a pistol on him and to track his killers. 																								The force is also investigating the murder of two other persons  Javed Hussain, 38, and Anwar Hussain, 42  also in North 24-Parganas. 																								The unidentified man in his early 30s was killed when two miscreants shot him from point blank range at Arjunpur in Haroa police station area in Basirhat sub-division early this morning. The victim died instantly as the bullet pierced his skull and the killers escaped before people rushed to the spot. 																								Police recovered two hand-grenades, a six-chamber revolver and a cellphone from the victim. We are examining the cellphone to establish the victims identity, said Rahul Srivastav, district additional superintendent of police. 																								After preliminary investigation, police said the victim was riding a bike along with two persons towards Haroa on the Rajarhat-Gopalpur Road. When they reached Arjunpur, they stopped the bike. The two men pushed the victim off the bike and shot him with a country-made revolver, said an officer of Haroa police station. 																								On hearing the shot, people rushed to the spot and found the man lying on the road in a pool of blood. The residents of the area saw two men fleeing towards Haroa on a motorcycle. They gave us the number of the motorcycle that cannot be disclosed for the sake of investigation. We have contacted the motor vehicles office at Barasat to trace the two-wheelers owner, said the official. 																								Police said the incident was the fallout of a long-standing rivalry between local anti-socials.																								In the other incident, Anwar and Javed were found murdered near the Meghna jute mill in Jagaddal. Both were hacked to death. Apparently, gang rivalry was behind the incident, said an official of the Jagaddal police station. Police have detained four persons for interrogation. 																								The victims had a rivalry with another gang, reportedly led by notorious criminal Lalubabu. We are looking for three criminals  Arjun, Ichaiya and Raju. Apparently, these three played an active role in the killings, said the official.																								Buddhas power diktat																								With an eye on the forthcoming panchayat polls, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today asked the power minister and the authorities of the Rural Electrification Development Corporation to fulfil the target of providing power supply to 4,500 villages by March next year. 																								At a meeting, he asked the officials to expedite work to meet the long-term target of providing electricity to 7,000 villages by 2007. He is said to have told them that funds would not be a problem.

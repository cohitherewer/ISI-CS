 Saturday, November 02, 2002 				 Citu men beat up steel plant manager
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Nov. 1: Citu activists today assaulted an assistant general manager inside the Durgapur Steel Plant. 																								Tension ran high at the factory and members of the officers association wore black badges after the incident. They will go for an indefinite movement from tomorrow in protest against successive attacks on the officers by workers.																								Managing director Subir Bhattacharya convened an emergency meeting with the representatives of the association and other senior officials after a written complaint was lodged by assistant general manager Lakshmi Majumdar. 																								The Citu workers were apparently aggrieved as Majumdar had transferred Intuc supporter Snehasish Ghosh from the B shift to general shift. The Citu supporters, led by P.K. Sen, attacked Majumdar for showing favour to the Intuc supporter. 																								An official spokesman said the management was going to suspend Sen. On October 2, the assistant general manager of Merchant Mill, Amit Biswas, had been severely assaulted by Intuc supporters. Three persons had been suspended the day after the incident. 																								Jahangir Hossain, an executive of the steel plant officers association, said: Assaults on executives or threatening them on one pretext or the other have become common in the plant these days. This has been seriously affecting work in the plant and creating a sense of insecurity among the executives. 																								The general secretary of the association threatened to launch a stir for an indefinite period if the Citu worker was not brought to book in 24 hours. 																								When contacted over telephone, the president of the Citu union, Santu Debroy, said: I have heard about it. I have asked for a report from the workers who were present there. I cannot make a comment at this moment. 																								Suspended worker and joint secretary of the Intuc union Sameer Dasgupta said they are keeping a close watch on the steps the management takes against the Citu worker. Dasgupta had been suspended following the assault on Biswas.

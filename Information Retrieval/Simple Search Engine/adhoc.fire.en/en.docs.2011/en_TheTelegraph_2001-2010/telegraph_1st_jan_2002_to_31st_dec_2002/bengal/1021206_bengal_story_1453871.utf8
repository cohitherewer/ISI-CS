 Friday, December 06, 2002 				 Express on fire
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, Dec. 5: A fire broke out under a compartment of the Up-Gangasagar Express and soon spread inside leading panic-stricken passengers to first stop the train and then flee.																								The incident occurred around 7 pm when the train, which left Sealdah at 3.45, was passing through Baraj and Mankar stations. The fire was doused and the train was scheduled to resume journey around midnight. 																								The Panagarh station manager said no one was injured. Friction between the wheel and the brake-shoe apparently led to the fire.

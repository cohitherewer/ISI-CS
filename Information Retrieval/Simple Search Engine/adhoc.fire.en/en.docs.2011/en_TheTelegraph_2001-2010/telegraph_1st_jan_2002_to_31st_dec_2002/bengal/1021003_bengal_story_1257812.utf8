 Thursday, October 03, 2002 				 SUCI calls bandh to protest murders
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Oct. 2: The SUCI has called a 12-hour bandh from dawn tomorrow in the Raidighi, Kultali, Mandirbazar and Joynagar areas of South 24-Parganas to protest against last nights attack on party supporters, allegedly by the CPM, in which at least two persons were killed. 																								Angry party supporters did not let the police take away two bodies till this evening, demanding that the guilty be brought to book. 																								While the SUCI claimed that four persons were killed and two bodies were taken away by the police, the district police are standing by its count of two. Ten persons were admitted to hospital with serious injuries after the attack last night. Police have rounded up five persons following the killings. 																								A group of about 100 men led by notorious antisocial Shahjahan raided an SUCI meeting at Nalgara village under the Kultali police station at 10.30 pm yesterday and hurled bombs and fired from improvised guns. 																								The bodies of Moslem Mistry, 45, and Ashok Haldar, 40, were released by the SUCI supporters only after special inspector-general of police Gautam Mohan Chakraborty went to the spot and assured that the guilty would be punished. 																								Four of our supporters attending a political class were killed, I do not know why the police are trying to suppress the toll, said SUCI MLA Debaprasad Sarkar. He blamed the CPM and said Sunderbans development minister Kanti Ganguly was the mastermind behind the raid. 																								Denying the charge, Ganguly said: The area where the incident took place is not accessible to our partymen, such is the SUCIs hold there. It is ridiculous to suggest that I had anything to do with the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Fight to kill Kamtapur call
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Lakshmi Sahgal at the rally in Calcutta on Sunday. Picture by Amit Dutta																								Calcutta, Sept. 15: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today took on the pro-Kamtapur agitation in north Bengal and put his foot down on possibilities of even considering the demand for a separate state. 																								Let the KLO kill as many CPM workers as they like but there is no question of separate statehood. About 70 to 80 per cent of the Rajbanshis in north Bengal are with the Left Front government for the past 25 years and they will remain with us. None of them support the KPPs (Kamtapur Peoples Party) demand for a separate state, Bhattacharjee told a rain-soaked rally of youth and student organisations of the CPM and other Left parties here this afternoon.																								At the meet against communal threat posed by the BJP-led government at the Centre, the chief minister also came down heavily on ultra-Left forces like the Peoples War and warned that Naxalites are trying to spread their tentacles in pockets of Bengal. We had tackled them in the mid seventies. We will face them again politically, he said. 																								Bhattacharjee, however, remained silent on the Peoples War threat to kill him. The rebel outfit had recently threatened the chief minister and CPM state secretary Anil Biswas.																								Both the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation and the Peoples War are attacking our party leaders and killing them. We have become their common enemy. We will face both these forces politically, he said.																								Bhattacharjee expressed concern over RSS and Bajrang Dal activities in the state. They are very active in spreading their organisation and we have to remain alert, he said.

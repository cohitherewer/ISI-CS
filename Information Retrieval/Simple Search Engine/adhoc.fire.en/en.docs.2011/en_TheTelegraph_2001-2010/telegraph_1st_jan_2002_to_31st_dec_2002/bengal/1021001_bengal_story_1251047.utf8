His father Rabindra Nath Mondal, a businessman, came to know that the kidnappers had slipped into Bengal. 																								Rabindra Nath approached Ganesh Chandra yesterday and requested for help.																								Officer in-charge of Gosaba Ratan Pal said the information on the kidnap had come through the BSF.

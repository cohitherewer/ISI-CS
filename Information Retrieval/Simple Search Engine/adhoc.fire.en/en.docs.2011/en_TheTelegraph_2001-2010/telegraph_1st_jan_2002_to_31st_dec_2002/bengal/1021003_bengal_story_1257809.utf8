The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, October 03, 2002 				 CPM brainstorming at Buddha bastion 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 2: For the first time since Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee became the chief minister one-and-a-half years ago, the CPMs politburo and central committee, the two highest decision-making bodies, will sit in session for three days in the city against the backdrop of the crippling financial crisis.																								Jyoti Basu, the oldest politburo member, today said the politburo would meet on October 10 and the central committee on October 11 and 12 to discuss, among other things, the prospects for propping up the Third Front in the prevailing political situation.																								The country is going through a disturbing time, Basu told The Telegraph. It is time we concentrated on fleshing out the Third Front as an effective alternative to the BJP-led NDA coalition government in Delhi. 																								The party thinktank will also take up the current political issues in the country. In view of the terrorist attack on the Swaminarayan temple in Gujarat, it is likely that the party will send a high-power delegation to the state to assess the situation there. 																								The CPM has made it clear that it does not accept the bifurcation of Eastern Railway. It is not possible to prevent the split of the railways without removing the BJP-led coalition in Delhi. Naturally, we have to work towards our goal of removing the government in Delhi, Basu said. 																								The CPM will also take up the elections in Jammu and Kashmir, party sources said. Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis attack  with help from a section of the BJP  on chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh will also come up. The CPM, which backs Lyngdohs stand that holding Assembly polls in Gujrat is not possible in the existing political situation, plans to launch a campaign. It believes the Gujarat government is trying to force the election to recapture the government. 																								The financial crisis facing Bengal is another cause of concern for the CPM. The politburo and the central committee, which believe that the state government is facing the crisis due to the Centres wrong policies, are expected to address the issue.

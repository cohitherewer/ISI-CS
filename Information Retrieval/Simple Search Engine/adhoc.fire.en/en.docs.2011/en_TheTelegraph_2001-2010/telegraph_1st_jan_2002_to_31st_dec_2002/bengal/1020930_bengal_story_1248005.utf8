 VIVEK CHHETRI																								Darjeeling, Sept. 29: A student who did not figure in the top 10 list in Madhyamik results in Darjeeling subdivision has emerged the topper after her erroneous report card was corrected. 																								Nita Tamang of Municipal Girls High School of Darjeeling is just another example of what went wrong with grading the Madhyamik students this year. But this time, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education made the corrections after the dejected student approached it, without a nudge from the Calcutta High Court.																								Schoolteacher Surekha Rai said Nita, who had always topped the internal examinations, was depressed when she learnt of her results. The student had received 600 marks out of 800, with a measly 35 in the physical science paper. 																								Nita just could not believe it. She is a brilliant student. She had expected at least double the marks in physical science, the teacher said. 																								A shocked Nita had requested revision of the paper. The other day, the board sent a revised marksheet, giving her 70 in physical science, double of what she had got. 																								The 635 marks awarded to her has rocketed her to the top of the merit list in the entire subdivision, making her eligible for the scholarship given by the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council to Madhyamik toppers from the hills. 																								The revised marks have now come close to her expectations, said Rai. 																								As a Madhyamik topper, Nita will now get a cash prize of Rs 10,000 from the hill council.																								We were to have given the cash prizes to Madhyamik toppers students on August 15. We will now include her on the list of awardees, said T. Wangchuk, the education secretary of the hill council. We will wait for some more time in case the board corrects more marksheets and more toppers come up. 																								Excise raid 																								The state excise department carried out extensive raids in three villages of Howrah and seized 3,300 litres of country liquor. Satish Tiwari, the excise commissioner who led the raids, said the liquor was seized from three manufacturing units. But the persons involved in the racket managed to flee.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept. 15: The Congress finally woke up to the marks mess in this years Madhyamik examination and demanded the dismissal of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education president Haraprasad Samaddar.																								State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee today alleged hundreds of students and their parents were being harassed due to the boards blunders in the publication of the results. The board is wholly responsible for the ordeal the Madhyamik candidates are undergoing for no fault of theirs, Mukherjee said.																								However, Samaddar told a private television channel in Darjeeling that he had conveyed his decision to resign from the board to school education minister Kanti Biswas before leaving for the hills. The government might make a formal announcement tomorrow, he added.																								The Congress will organise a day-long sit-in on Rani Rashmoni Avenue on September 20 to protest against the prevailing state of affairs in the Madhyamik board, the states financial crisis, the condition of hospitals and the deteriorating law and order situation. We cannot sit idle when the people here are passing through a crisis, Mukherjee said.																								Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress today unveiled its programme to step up a statewide campaign to expose the CPMs bid to politicise education and the BJP, too, joined forces with the two main Opposition parties to protest the harassment of Madhyamik candidates.

 Friday, November 22, 2002 				 Cop clamour for ISI moles
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Nov. 21: Police here want the defence forces to hand over the army and air force personnel named by the alleged ISI agents arrested on Sunday for interrogation.																								The air force police arrested Aufan Ukil, a data operator at its base in Bhuj, yesterday following a message from the district police after the interrogation of Ziauddin Biswas, one of the four suspected ISI agents picked up from the Jalangi and Domkal areas. Aufan was an ISI recruit who provided sensitive information on the base to the Pakistani intelligence network.																								Since yesterday, the district police have sent several messages to the army, air force and navy bases where the personnel on ISI pay-rolls are posted.																								During interrogation, Biswas and his wife Ismatara, brother-in-law Hasan Habib and Ismataras cousin Ghulam Murtaza had named defence personnel who used to pass on military secrets. Biswas had admitted that he was working for the ISI since 1992. 																								District superintendent of police Birendra said they have got hold of Biswas bank account at Rajshahi in Bangladesh. 																								The bases where the messages have been sent should not release the named personnel after questioning, they should be sent here so that we can make them sit across the arrested persons who mentioned their involvement and get more information, he added.																								Yesterday, the police had brought in 12 men from the armed forces and the BSF for questioning. Biswas had named several army and air force personnel claiming that they were working for the spy network. He added that many of them were posted in the states bordering Pakistan.																								The police had yesterday sent their names and details on present postings to the bases with the request that they be detained immediately.																								The district police said today the arrested air force employee was from Barchandghar village in the Kaligunje police station area of Nadia district. 																								Ukils brother, Tazer, is a naik in the army and posted in Cooch Behar. We have information that whenever Ukil went to his village, he made long forays into the border areas on his motor cycle, Birendra said.																								However, one of Ukils brothers, Moyna, said over phone that the arrest was a conspiracy. How can my brother be arrested from Bhuj when he is currently posted in Pune? he asked. 																								Biswas has also told the police that every defence personnel working for the ISI has been to Dhaka at least once. He named two ISI operators based in the Bangladesh capital  Amir Bhai and Mohammad Bhai  from whom the armymen took instructions.

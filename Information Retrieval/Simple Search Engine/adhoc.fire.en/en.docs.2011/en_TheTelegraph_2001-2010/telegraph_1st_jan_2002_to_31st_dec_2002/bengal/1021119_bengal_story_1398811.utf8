 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Nov. 18: Little did nine-year-old Tanushree Dutta realise that the man who approached her in front of school this morning, with a promise to take her home, was intent on kidnapping her. Hours later, the child managed to give him the slip and returned home.																								Tanushree, a student of the CMS Schools morning section, told police that the man came up to her right after school and said he would take her home. Instead, he took me into a lane and asked me to take off my school dress and change into a frock. He was carrying the new dress. He took me towards Muchipara 																								By then, the kidnapper had a few accomplices. Tanushree added: I was afraid When they were talking about other things, I ran and got into a bus.																								When the bus got some distance, the girl walked up to the conductor and told him of her plight. The middle-distance bus was then at Memari, 30 km from here. It stopped, but with many passengers on board, could not return. The conductor took Tanushree to the bus-owners syndicate. She was then escorted to the Memari police station. The police there got in touch with their counterparts here. 																								Tanushree was brought back home by uncle Bidyut Nandi. 																								He had been to the school to pick up Tanushree but she was missing, Nandi said. Till we got a call from the Burdwan police, we were running around trying to locate her, a relieved Nandi added.																								Additional superintendent of police S.S. Dutta said the little girls presence of mind was what saved her. She could have been kidnapped and a hefty ransom demanded. We have spoken to the girl and are looking for the culprit going by her description, Dutta said. 																								Tanushrees father is a dealer for a reputed cigarette company.																								The principal of the CMS School, S. Kundu, admitted the institution had to share some of the responsibility for the incident. We will ensure that from now on, no one gets to take away the children without the identity card we issue, Kundu said.

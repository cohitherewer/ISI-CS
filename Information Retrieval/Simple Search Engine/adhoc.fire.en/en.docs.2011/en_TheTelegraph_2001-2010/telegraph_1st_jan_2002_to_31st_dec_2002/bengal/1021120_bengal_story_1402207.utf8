 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Nov. 19: The widow of the armyman allegedly recruited by one of the ISI agents arrested yesterday claimed today that her husband was killed by the army.																								Ahsan Ali Biswas, a lance naik in the Signals Regiment, was recruited by suspected ISI agent Ziauddin Biswas to pass on military secrets.																								Biswas was one of the three suspected spies picked up by the Intelligence Branch and Murshidabad police yesterday after an years efforts. The police claimed yesterday that Biswas has admitted to having used Ali for sensitive information. 																								The widow, Afroza, who lives in Durlabherpara village here with Alis family, said on July 26, this year, she received a call from the army saying her husband had suffered a heart attack and was no more. 																								The army sent the body back to our house three days later, accompanied by three soldiers who took part in the last rites on its behalf, said Afroza. She added that a month before his death, Ali had called up home.																								He blamed us (his family) for pushing him to earn more. He told me that he would be killed and we would have to bear the responsibility. After that, there was no phone call for a month, Afroza said.																								Despite the official statement, Alis death was shrouded in mystery. His body came from Jodhpur but he was supposed to be posted in Pune, said sources.																								The other version of the circumstances leading to Alis death is available with the police. He apparently committed suicide when caught red-handed while passing on military information. 																								Badluddin Shiekh, a resident of Alis village, said he was caught stealing important documents but the authorities had killed him later.																								After yesterdays arrests, the Intelligence Branch suspects that some police officers in the region are quite familiar with ISI agents. 																								Ismatara Biswas, the woman arrested yesterday, allegedly had close links with the Behrampore police station, sources said.

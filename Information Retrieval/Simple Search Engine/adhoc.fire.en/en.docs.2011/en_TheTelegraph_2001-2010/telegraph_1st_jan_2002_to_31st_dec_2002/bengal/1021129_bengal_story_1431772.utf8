																								Behrampore, Nov. 28: The Howrah-bound Janshatabdi Express had to be detained at Mahipal Road station for over two hours after a fracture was detected on the tracks by villagers of Nowpara in the Sagardihi police station area this morning, reports our correspondent.																								A railway gang repaired the fracture and the train was allowed leave around 10 am. Railway sources in Calcutta, however, claimed the crack was detected by the gangmen. Unless over five inches wide, fractures do not cause derailment, they claimed.

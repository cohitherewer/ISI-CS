 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Students body in safety tank
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mathurapur (South 24-Parganas) Sept. 1: The stinking body of a 16-year old boy, who went missing eight days ago, was found from the safety tank of a house in Shatghara village here today.																								After a frantic search for Nabin Haldar failed to produce result, his parents had lodged an FIR with the local police station.																								Residents of Shatghara were shocked and enraged at discovering the Class XII student in their backyard today.																								Four persons, including a classmate of Nabin, his father and grandfather, have been arrested.																								In the FIR, Nabins uncle Sukumar had said that on August 24, he left home around 8 pm for his classmate Arun Debnaths house, less than half-a-kilometre away. 																								But when he did not return late into the night, his worried parents knocked at several neighbourhood doors, including those of Aruns house. However, nobody gave a clue about his whereabouts.																								Early this morning, a stench wafted from the safety tank of an under-construction building in the area. With the day, residents got curious and a crowd gathered after the source of the stink could be identified. The police were called in.																								Personnel from the Mathurapur police station opened the lid of the tank to find the heavily bruised and decomposed body. Nabins relatives confirmed it was his.																								Since the discovery of the body, opinions and rumours about what led to the gruesome murder gained ground.																								According to some, Nabin and Arun shared a relation that was not approved of by Aruns family. Others said they formed the arms of a love triangle. Nabin was murdered to clear his friends path. 																								However, Sukumar alleged that Aruns family members are trying to fan rumours to hush up the real incident. Nabin was killed as he had come to know certain secrets of the Debnath family, he said.																								Officer in-charge of Mathurapur police station Debashish Chakraborty said Nabin was hacked. The injury marks on the body show he was attacked suddenly by several people, the officer said.																								Nabin had tried to save himself, but failed. The murderers were ruthless and must have dumped him in the tank under the cover of darkness, Chakraborty added. 																								He did not rule out the role of contract killers in the incident. 																								After getting specific complaints from Nabins parents and his uncle, we picked up Arun, his father, grandfather and uncle from their house today. We hope their interrogation would lead us to the real truth. The viscera will be sent to forensic experts in Calcutta to ascertain the exact cause of the death, Chakraborty said.

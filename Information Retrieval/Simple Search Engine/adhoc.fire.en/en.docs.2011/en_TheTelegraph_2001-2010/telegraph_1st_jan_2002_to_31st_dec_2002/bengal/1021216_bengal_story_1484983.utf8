The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, December 16, 2002 				 Nurses on district route
 BARUN GHOSH																								Calcutta, Dec. 15: The government is working on a unified transfer policy for nurses after the successful shift of more than 250 doctors from the city to the medical colleges and hospitals in the districts.																								Like for doctors, we should have a proper transfer policy for the nearly 27,000 nurses working in hospitals and medical colleges, director of medical education C.R. Maity said today.																								When contacted at his Burdwan residence, Maity said he has discussed the matter with health secretary Asim Barman. 																								The nurses are being transferred in a haphazard manner in the absence of a proper policy. We are seriously working on the subject to improve the quality of work among nurses, who play a vital role in the states healthcare management, he said.																								Maity would convene a meeting of the nursing superintendents to discuss the issue.																								Nurses should work three years in Burdwan and two years in Bankura and North Bengal Medical College before seeking a transfer to the medical colleges in Calcutta, Maity said. Working in district hospitals should be mandatory.																								Health department sources said the proposed move follows Fridays indecent behaviour of some staff nurses towards health minister Suryja Kanta Mishra at the N.R.S. Medical College and Hospital. 																								According to reports, a group of nurses rushed to the dais where Mishra was seated with other dignitaries during a programme to unveil a C.T. Scan machine and protested against the transfer of one of their colleagues to Purulia. Before leaving in a huff, Mishra had asked hospital superintendent Shyamal Rudra to punish those behaving irresponsibly inside the hospital premises.																								We shall issue a showcause notice to Shovana Nath for leading the demonstration, Rudra said today. She has been asked to submit a reply by December 18.

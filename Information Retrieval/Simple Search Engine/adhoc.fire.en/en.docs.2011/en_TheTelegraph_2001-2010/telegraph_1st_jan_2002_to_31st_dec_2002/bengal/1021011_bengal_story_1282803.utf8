 Friday, October 11, 2002 				 Madhyamik suggestion: devolve board duties
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 10: The Madhyamik result fiasco, which ended in the board presidents resignation last month, has prompted Left Front-affiliated teachers organisations to demand decentralisation of the examination system. 																								The responsibility of preparing question papers should continue to lie with the headquarters of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in Calcutta, but all other aspects of the system needed immediate decentralisation, the organisations said. 																								At a meeting with other board members, teachers representing the Left organisations put forth several suggestions advocating decentralisation as a remedy for the goof-ups that have led Calcutta High Court to direct the board to produce as many as 97 answerscripts this year. 																								n Give more powers to the boards four regional offices regarding publication of results. The regional offices should be made responsible for collecting data from examiners, tabulating them and preparing the marksheets. The last two duties are now done by the board headquarters. 																								n Scripts of students from a particular region should be checked by teachers of the same region to iron out regional bias.																								n Appoint separate controllers of examinations for each of the four regions. 																								The 30-odd teachers representatives felt that the rise in the number of Madhyamik examinees had made the system more complicated and increased chances of human error.

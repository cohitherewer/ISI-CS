 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 19: Tension prevailed in North 24-Parganas district today after two persons were killed in Titagarh and Halisahar on the citys northern fringes during last 24 hours.																								Officials said Billa, 20, was killed by his associates at a roadside eatery in Titagarh last night over sharing of booty from a railway wagon robbery between Titagarh and Barrackpore.																								Billa was a local criminal who had unleashed terror in Titagarh area.																								Trouble started around 11 pm, when Billa and six of his associates assembled at a local eatery and started sharing the loot.

While two of the gang members supported Billa, four differed and stabbed him to death on the spot.																								Billa was attacked by his own associates, who slit his throat with a knife, confirmed an official of the Barrackpore police station. He said raids were being conducted to arrest those involved in the murder.

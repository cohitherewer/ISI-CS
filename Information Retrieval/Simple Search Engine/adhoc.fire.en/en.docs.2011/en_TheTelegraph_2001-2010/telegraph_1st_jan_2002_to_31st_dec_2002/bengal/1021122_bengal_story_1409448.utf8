 Friday, November 22, 2002 				 City dacoity bid foiled
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 21: Four criminals, including an associate of arrested don Sheikh Vinod, were intercepted by Jadavpur police late tonight when they were plotting a raid on a jewellery shop on Prince Anwar Shah Road.																								A patrol vehicle, which was acting on a tip-off, caught hold of Sheikh Sagar, Sanjay Mandal, Gaur Maiti and the driver of taxi in which they had come, Khondokar Ahmed.																								Residents helped the police corner four dacoits. Three others fled. Surprised by the police swoop, the criminals  who had two revolvers and bombs with them  failed to offer any resistance.																								Vinod masterminded the operations of one of the most dreaded gangs that worked in south Calcutta and the southern suburbs of the city.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 BJP chief replaced
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 17: The state unit of the BJP today went in for the first phase of an organisational restructuring with the removal of president Ashim Ghosh.																								Tathagata Roy replaced Ghosh amid murmurs that he was removed for failing to rev up the party into a fighting unit and denials that it was part of a restructuring taking place in other states as well.																								Five or six other states are going in for these changes, party office secretary Sailen Majumdar said. The change at the top will be followed by others down the line. 																								But several BJP insiders rubbished the theory. Ghoshs resignation was anything but voluntary, they said. The central leadership went in for the change because it wanted the party to be transformed into a combative force before the panchayat polls scheduled for next year, they added.

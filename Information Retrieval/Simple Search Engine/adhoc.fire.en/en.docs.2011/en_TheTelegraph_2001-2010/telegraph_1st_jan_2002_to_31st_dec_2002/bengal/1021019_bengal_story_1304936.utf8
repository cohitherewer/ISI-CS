 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 18: A health department survey shows heart diseases affect people in the rest of the state as much as it does a Calcuttan.																								Quoting from the findings, director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said today that an alarming 33.12 per cent of patients admitted to city medical college hospitals with cardio-vascular diseases died, while the figure was 34.99 per cent in district hospitals. Deaths from other diseases were much less in both Calcutta and the districts.																								The survey was part of the ongoing medical audit of the department to pinpoint areas where treatment facilities needed to be augmented. This survey will help us find out the main diseases causing deaths in the tertiary and secondary hospitals and the number of patients being admitted in critical stages. Then, it will be easier for us to find out what percentage of them could be saved if we had better facilities, Chatterjee said.																								The survey was conducted in three medical colleges in the city  Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, NRS Hospital, RG Kar Hospital and Burdwan Medical College  and the district hospitals in Birbhum, Cooch Behar, Howrah, Hooghly, Jalpaiguri, East and West Midnapore, Malda, Murshidabad, Nadia, South 24-Parganas and North Dinajpur. The data was compiled between January and June this year.																								Apart from heart and cerebro-vascular diseases, the survey showed 11 other leading causes of mortality  poisoning, respiratory infections, burns, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diarrhoea, road accidents, tuberculosis, meningitis, anaemia and diabetes.																								Deaths from poisoning were reported more in the district hospitals (8.5 per cent) than in the medical colleges (5.6 per cent). The survey revealed that 6.4 per cent of patients with respiratory infections died in district hospitals against 3.37 in the medical colleges. More people died of tuberculosis in the medical colleges in the city (5.38 per cent) than the hospitals in the districts (4.28 per cent), the survey showed.

 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 GNLF pattern in Kamtapur: Basu
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Basu																								Siliguri, Sept. 21: Underscoring the the need for an ideological crusade against outfits like the Kamtapur Peoples Party, former chief minister Jyoti Basu today said the state government would not tolerate separatist tendencies.																								Speaking at a rally organised by nine Leftist student and youth organisations, the veteran leader said: We have managed to effectively put an end to the 28-month-long Gorkhaland agitation in the Darjeeling hills by offering autonomy to the people there. I had then told GNLF leaders that separatist demands are not quite a remedy for your problems. The formation of the DGHC (Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council) was a natural corollary after that.																								Basu said a similar problem has surfaced in large parts of north Bengal districts, with militant groups like the KLO indulging in violence and targeting CPM cadre. The government, he added, should try to bring back the disenchanted section of tribal youths who might have turned to militant tactics under duress.																								The need of the hour is to set up alternative social organisations, distinct from political parties. The public forums have to shoulder new responsibilities in a changed social milieu, Basu said.																								Blasting the BJP government, Basu said US interference in Indias politics was an ominous sign. The BJP is squarely responsible for offering America a toehold within our political space. We should resolve to fight out the communal and fascist tendencies of the Centre. The BJP governments support to Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi shows the extent it can go to foist its communal designs on the public, Basu said.																								The state municipal affairs minister, Ashok Bhattacharya, said the menace posed by the KPP and the KLO needed to be countered politically.

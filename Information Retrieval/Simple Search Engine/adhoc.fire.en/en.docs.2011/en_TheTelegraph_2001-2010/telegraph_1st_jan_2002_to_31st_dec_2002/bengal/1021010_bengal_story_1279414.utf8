 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 DM-led puja in dock for subscription violence
 KOUSIK SEN																								Raiganj, Oct. 9: Members of a puja committee, headed by the district magistrate, assaulted a businessman and his brother for refusing to pay a hefty chanda (subscription) in the North Dinajpur district headquarters last night. 																								Badal Sutradhar, owner of a furniture shop, and his brother, Sushil, badly beaten with wooden planks, have been admitted to Raiganj Hospital in a serious condition. 																								District superintendent of police Arun Kumar Sharma said Sanjib Majumdar, one of the members, was arrested and a case started against the Karnajhora Government Housing puja committee. He said police were trying to hunt down the others involved in the assault.																								The West Dinajpur Chamber of Commerce threatened to launch a district-wide agitation after the Pujas if the culprits were not arrested. The Karnajhora Byabsayee Samiti has filed a police complaint against five members of the puja committee involved in the attack. We are not going to tolerate such high-handedness of a puja committee comprising the district magistrate and other senior officers, said Jaynarayan Somani, general secretary of the body. 																								The quarters of senior government officers, including the bungalow of district magistrate Arif Aftab, is located in the housing colony. The puja committee is made up of several officers, with Aftab as president, according to the flyers distributed by the committee. 																								While the district magistrate was unavailable for comment, treasury officer Nikhilbaran Biswas, who is vice-president of the puja committee, said the organisers had put him on the committee without his consent. I will inform the police about this, he added.																								District information and cultural officer Krishnendu Kayal said he, too, was put on the puja committee without my permission. 																								Around nine last night, four youths of the puja committee went to collect chanda from the furniture shop. They wrote out a receipt for Rs 2,000, handed it over to Sutradhar and told him to pay up. The trader refused. This enraged the youths, who picked up some wooden planks and hit Sutradhar and his brother with them.																								All the four youths are residents of the Karnajhora Housing Estate. Since I refused to pay such a huge sum, they began assaulting me. I lost consciousness soon after, Sutradhar said, cringing in pain as he lay on his hospital bed.																								Bar on Sanchayani Savings																								The Reserve Bank of India has reaffirmed that the Supreme Court, in a ruling passed on August 19 this year, upheld an RBI directive (passed on May 10, 1997) forbidding the city-based Sanchayani Savings and Investment Limited from mobilising or accepting public deposits.

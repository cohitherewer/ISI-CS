 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 Bangla-bound jawan held
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Dec. 10: An armyman was picked up by the Border Security Force near Lalgola last Sunday when he was found trying to cross over into Bangladesh with a civilian. 																								Ziaul Haque has been handed over to an army team that came from Fort William in Calcutta. 																								According to the Murshidabad additional superintendent of police, Shankar Singh, the jawan and Mansoor Ali were arrested by the BSF from the zero-point on the India-Bangladesh border near Ashariadaha village in Lalgola.																								Police suspect that like the defence personnel arrested last month  Nazrul Islam and Aufan Ukil  Haque has links with the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence. 																								The police are trying to determine whether he had been passing on sensitive information to the other side.																								Both Haque and Ali are from Jannagar village in Maldas Ratua police station area. The BSF handed the civilian over to the police. We have interrogated Ali but not much headway could be made, Singh said. Ali is still in custody.																								BSF sources said initially, the two tried to flee towards Bangladesh but they were stopped by people working in the fields. A border patrol from the Ramnagar outpost detained the two. The commandant of the 62 Battalion confirmed the arrest today.																								We found the armymans i-card and a piece of paper with addresses of places in Bangladesh. We are certain after questioning him that he was up to some mischief, said a BSF officer. 																								Haque, who could not provide a reason for being where he was, has no known acquaintance in the area, sources said.

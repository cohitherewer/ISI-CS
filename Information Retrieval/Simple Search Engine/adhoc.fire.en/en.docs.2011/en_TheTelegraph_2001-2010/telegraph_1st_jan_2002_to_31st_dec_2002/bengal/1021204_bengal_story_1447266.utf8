 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Dec. 3: West Bengals first medical university will start functioning from the next academic session beginning 2003, minister for health and family welfare Surjya Kanta Mishra said today. 																								The University of Health Services, West Bengal, will be initially housed at the office of the health and family welfare department at Salt Lake and later shifted to the building adjoining the Salt Lake sub-division hospital. 																								Madan Mohan Chaudhuri, retired professor of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research, has been appointed vice-chancellor of the university for three years.																								Mishra said the university was formally set up yesterday, with the West Bengal University of Health Sciences Act 2002 coming into effect. 																								The minister said all seven medical colleges in the state will be brought under the new university. Besides the four medical colleges in the city, the others are: Bankura Medical College, Burdwan Medical College and North Bengal Medical College. Three proposed medical colleges in Midnapore, Malda and in the SSKM hospital will also be under its control. 																								All homoeopathy, ayurvedic, unani and other alternative medicine hospitals and nursing homes, pharmacy and dental education institutes will function under it. Courses on laboratory technology and paramedical subjects will be affiliated to it.																								It is aimed at establishing uniformity in standards of education in all faculties of health sciences, including formulation and implementation of syllabi and curricula for various academic courses, with a view to augmenting the quality of such education and achieving the highest standards of academic excellence at all levels, Mishra said.																								He added that a three-member search committee has been constituted, comprising the state health secretary, director-general of health services, Union ministry of health and family welfare, and the director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, for the purpose of selection of the vice-chancellor.																								Officials said the new university will henceforth be the only competent institution in the state to give affiliation to all new courses in medical, para-medical and para-dental disciplines and conduct the courses there.

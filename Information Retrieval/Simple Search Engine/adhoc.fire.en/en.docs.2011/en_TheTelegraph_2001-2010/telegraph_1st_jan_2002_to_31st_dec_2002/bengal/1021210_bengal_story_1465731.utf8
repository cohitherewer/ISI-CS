 Tuesday, December 10, 2002 				 Strike rift among lawyers
 OUR BUREAU																								Dec. 9: Several lawyers owing allegiance to the CPM-backed Democratic Lawyers Association were asked to explain why they defied the ceasework call by their bars even as more reports of unruly lawyer conduct poured in from courts where there were attempts to break the 27-day strike.																								The lawyers staged demonstrations and blocked roads in Howrah, paralysing traffic. At the end of the day, 56 black coats were behind the bars.																								The DLAs attempts to break the strike intensified after Saturdays appeal to lawyers across the state by CPM state secretary, Anil Biswas.																								The CPM leader had pleaded to the lawyers to resume work on Monday but the Burdwan Bar association today suspended eight lawyers for appearing in court over the weekend. The association has asked the offenders to explain why they had violated the unanimous resolution passed by its members in support of the agitation against the proposed court fee hike.																								An association executive said the lawyers have also been given interim suspensions. 																								We expect to take a final decision on December 12, when they have been asked to submit their replies, he added.																								Clashes between lawyers willing to work and those against it were also reported from Durgapur and Barasat.																								Four persons were injured in the scuffle between two sets of lawyers at Barasat. 																								Following the clash, the local bar association decided to take action against eight DLA members and placed them under temporary suspension. 																								In Durgapur, 400 pro-strike lawyers clashed with DLA members outside the court premises.

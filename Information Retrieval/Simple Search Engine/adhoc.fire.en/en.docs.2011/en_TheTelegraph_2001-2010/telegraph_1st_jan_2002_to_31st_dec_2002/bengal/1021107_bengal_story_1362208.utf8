 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 Naxalite released on bail
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Midnapore, Nov. 6: Mithu Roy, a former Peoples War member, was released on bail from the West Midnapore Central Jail today, making her the third Naxalite arrested from Calcutta to walk free again. Earlier, Calcutta Science College lecturer Kaushik Ganguly and Shampa Dasgupta, student of the citys Gurudas College, had secured bail. 																								Mithu was arrested on June 23 from her residence in Rani Park in Belghoria for alleged anti-state activities. She had secured a bail order from the high court order along with Shampa, but her release was delayed as she could not furnish the Rs 50,000 bond. 																								Soon after her release, Mithu told reporters that her stay in jail had made her even more resolute in her political belief. I have become mentally stronger as I was released following strong public opinion against our arrests, she said.

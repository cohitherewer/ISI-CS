 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Suti (Murshidabad), Nov. 7: Police had to fire in the air to stop a violent clash between CPM and Congress supporters here last evening. Twenty-one men from both parties have been put behind bars.																								The area was tense since last afternoon when alleged CPM supporters attacked Baliaghat village in the Suti police station area and went on a looting spree. Soon, the predominantly Congress-supporting villagers retaliated, a clash followed and bombs were hurled freely. 																								The area has seen frequent clashes between supporters of the two parties in the past month. Two weeks ago, a CPM supporter died of injuries from a bomb attack. 																								Following the death, the police set up a picket of nine personnel and a sub-inspector and seized over 900 crude bombs from the village. The policemen from this post fired 12 rounds in the air to disperse the mobs yesterday. 																								District superintendent of police Virendra said no one was injured in the firing. A large band of policemen, including the subdivisional police officer of Suti, have been despatched.																								Congress MLA from the area Humayun Reza alleged that if the police had not acted in a partisan manner, things would not have turned violent. The police and the CPM cadre jointly attacked the houses of our supporters, Reza alleged.

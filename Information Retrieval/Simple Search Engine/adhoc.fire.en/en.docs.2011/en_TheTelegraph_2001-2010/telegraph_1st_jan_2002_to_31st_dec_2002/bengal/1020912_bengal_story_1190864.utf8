 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept. 11: Tapping into the corporate culture, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today said the performance of its employees would now be assessed on the basis of marks they score at work. 																								In the revised assessment procedure, the employees  belonging to Groups B, C and D  would be graded on a scale of 100 and promotions recommended not merely on the basis of seniority but also on marks scored. 																								Earlier, the chief minister had said in the Assembly that he would introduce annual confidential reports (ACR) for all categories of employees. But he had to give into pressure from the CPM-dominated employees body  the Coordination Committee  and assess only 15 marks confidentially. Scores on the remaining 85 marks will be revealed in the employees annual performance report. 																								This new system  with retrospective effect from April 1 this year  will monitor factors like attendance, performance, efficiency, accountability and integrity.																								Except for accountability and integrity, the report on the other items will be an open report, an official release said.																								An employee will have to score 60 per cent marks on the whole to earn eligibility for promotion. Minimum qualifying marks for attendance will be 70 per cent, it says. For consideration of promotion, it is essentially required that integrity will be above board and minimum requirement for accountability will be above average grading, the release added. 																								While for Group A employees (section officers and above) the existing ACR system will continue, they will have to score an additional 70 per cent on attendance to be eligible for promotion. 																								Employees of Groups B and C  upper and lower division  have been allotted 25 marks for attendance, 60 for performance and efficiency, and 15 for accountability and integrity. For Group D employees (peons, orderlies, etc.), there will be 35 marks for attendance, 50 for performance and efficiency, and 15 for accountability and integrity.																								The employees will be graded on the basis of office records like attendance register, case book, case diary and field diary.																								Co-ordination Committee leaders at Writers Buildings welcomed the revised assessment procedure and said it had been made more objective and specific.																								Earlier, we were guided by the open performance report in which there were general comments from superiors on the employees performance. Aspects like efficiency, accountability and integrity were included in the single report. Under the new system, the performance assessment will be done on specifics in a more objective manner like grading, said Jyotiprasad Basu, joint secretary of Co-ordination Committee.																								Sources in the state secretariat said that the decision to grade employees was taken last year.

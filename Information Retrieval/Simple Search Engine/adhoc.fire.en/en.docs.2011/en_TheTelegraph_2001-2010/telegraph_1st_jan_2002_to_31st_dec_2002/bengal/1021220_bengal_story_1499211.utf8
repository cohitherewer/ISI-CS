 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Rehab homes for victim women
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Dec. 19: The social welfare department has picked out South 24 Parganas, Murshidabad, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar to set up rehabilitation homes for victims of sexual crime and girls rescued from brothels. 																								The government will take help from voluntary organisations in the mission to provide shelters to sexually exploited women deserted by families due to social stigma.																								Social welfare secretary Jaya Dasgupta said a rehabilitation programme for deserted women has been floated under the Centre-sponsored schemes, Swadhar and Swayamsidha. The Central funds would be spent to set up the homes and to pay salary to their employees. 																								The homes, which would be run by NGOs, will train women to be self-reliant. We have selected four voluntary agencies who are working on the rehabilitation of women victims, Dasgupta said.																								The social welfare department has floated a project under Swadhar to combat trafficking of women from the districts. Most women who end up in brothels are lured out of rural families in the border districts by pimps, said Dasgupta. 																								MiG from Kalaikunda crashes																								A MiG-27 fighter crashed on an open field in Benajeria near Kharagpur tonight. The pilot, who baled out of the blazing aircraft, has been admitted to a sub-divisional hospital. The plane took off from the Kalaikunda air base on a routine training flight.

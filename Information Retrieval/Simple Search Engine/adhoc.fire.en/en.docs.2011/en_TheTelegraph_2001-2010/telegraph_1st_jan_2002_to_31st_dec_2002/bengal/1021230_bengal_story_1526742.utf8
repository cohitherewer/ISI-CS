 Monday, December 30, 2002 				 Basu sermon for cadre
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kamarkundu (Hooghly), Dec. 29: A day after the Forward Bloc charged the CPM with taking sides with landlords, Jyoti Basu admitted here that the party had not been able to live up to the expectations of the people. 																								An introspective Basu asked party workers to increase contact with the masses at the grass-roots level. We have been unsuccessful in fulfiling the demands of the people. We have to admit our lapses, he said. 																								We have to give a patient hearing to the people. We must mix with them and try to understand their problems to arrive at a solution. This is the greatest lesson I learnt in my political career, the former chief minister said.

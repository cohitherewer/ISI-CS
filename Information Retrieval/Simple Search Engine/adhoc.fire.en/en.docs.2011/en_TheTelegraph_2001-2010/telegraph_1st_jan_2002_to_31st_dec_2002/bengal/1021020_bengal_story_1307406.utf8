 Sunday, October 20, 2002 				 Goddess imposters arrested in Midnapore
 KUMARESH GHOSH																								Egra (East Midnapore), Oct. 19: Imagine two goddesses on the prowl, asking for money and threatening to pick up children if their demands for exorbitant demands were not met.																								The two living deities are now cooling their heels in a dingy cell after the Midnapore police arrested them for terrorising residents of the area into emptying their pockets. 																								Meet Manju, as Ma Kali, and Pampa, as Ma Manasa. The two posing as goddesses with powers to interact with the gods, have been asking villagers of North Daudpur under Egra police station in East Midnapore to give them money in exchange for blessings or face the wrath of the gods.																								The few who did comply got their blessings. However, those who refused incurred the duos wrath, until some villagers decided to complain to police after the two threatened to sacrifice the sceptics children to appease the gods.																								Initially we did not bother about their demands. But when these two young women, dressed as gods, decided to take our children for sacrifice, we decided to inform the police, said a villager.																								Police said the duo were arrested and sent to Contai court with a plea for remand.																								We have learnt that, for more than one year now, Manju has been claiming that the Goddess Kali possesses her at night, while her sister Pampa decided to hog the limelight by posing as Ma Manasa, said the officer in-charge of Egra police station Sekhar Roy.

 Sunday, September 29, 2002 				 Big fish spills ISI beans
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jalpaiguri, Sept. 28: Nazrul Nazrul, a Bangladeshi national arrested for links with the ISI in Rajasthan earlier this month, has told police here that he was engaged by the Pakistani outfit to recruit agents from here and the Northeast.																								A police team brought Nazrul back from Jaisalmer today. Sleuths of a Central intelligence agency had picked him up from the desert town. 																								According to intelligence officials, Nazrul is a big fish. They said he collected inputs on the Indian Army and channelled them to the Pakistanis. He had apparently put in place the largest network of ISI linkmen across the country.																								Since his arrest, 22 people have been arrested from various corners of the country. 																								Yesterday, three persons were arrested from the Salugara area near Siliguri for alleged links with Nazrul. The Jalpaiguri police have arrested Sattar Ali, one of Nazruls accomplices, from Binnaguri. Ali was recruited to feed Nazrul with information on activities at the Binnaguri army cantonment.																								A Nazrul agent was arrested from Tezpur in Assam. Nazrul told the police that he worked according to instructions from the ISI setup in Dhaka. 																								Nazrul will be produced in the Jalpaiguri court tomorrow. Then we will start a proper interrogation. We hope that he can give us details about ISIs activities in the region, said superintendent of police S.N. Gupta. 																								Nazrul has been to Pakistan on several occasions but Gupta had no confirmation on whether he had been trained there. 																								He is aware of Dilshad, the ISI agent arrested in Siliguri earlier this year, and is well acquainted with the layout of the town, an officer, who was part of the team that went to Jaisalmer, said.

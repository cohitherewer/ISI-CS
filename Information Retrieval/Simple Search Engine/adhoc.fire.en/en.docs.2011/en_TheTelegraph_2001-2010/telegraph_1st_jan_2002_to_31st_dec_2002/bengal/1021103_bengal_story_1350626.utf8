 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE																								Barakar, Nov. 2: A businessman was abducted by an unknown car-borne gang early this morning, causing panic in the trading and business community in this town near Asansol.																								According to eyewitness reports, 40-year-old Shivkumar Agarwala, a foodgrain wholesaler and the partner of a flourmill, was taking his morning walk when he was forced into a Maruti Zen at gunpoint on Kalyaneswari Road.

Ramesh said police and the CID were now jointly probing the Agarwala abduction case. 																								Bengals border with Jharkhand is very close to this area and it is easy for the gang to have fled there. We have informed the police there and alerted the neighbouring district, Ramesh said, adding that the mode of operation pointed to the fact that the gang was highly professional. 																								Ramesh declined to reveal whether Agarwalas family had received any ransom call. 																								According to family sources, Agarwala walked every morning from his Hospital Road residence along the Kalyaneswari Road accompanied by three or four of his associates. This morning, he went off on his own as his friends had not showed up.																								A resident of Manberia village, who saw the incident, said three cars  one of which he identified as the Zen  was following Agarwala. Three men got off and tried to push him into the Zen. A scuffle ensued and the eyewitness said that one man pulled out a gun and shoved him into the car.

 Tuesday, December 10, 2002 				 Trinamul plays govt
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 9: Trinamul Congress MLAs took over the House moments after Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim adjourned it after obituary references on Day I of the winter sitting and held a mock session on the power tariffs issue.																								Arunabha Ghosh sat in front of the Speakers chair and played Halim while the rest divided themselves between Opposition and treasury benches. Sadhan Pande was the power minister and submitted that his government had nothing to do with the tariffs issue. Not unlike the communists in China, I have joined hands with the capitalists, Pande said.																								Around this time, Sonali Guha and some others from the Opposition began shouting slogans demanding the resignation of the chief minister. Paras Dutta, the chief minister, said whatever the Opposition felt, the government will do what is good for the people. Pande also had to stave off a mock attack by the Opposition members who rushed towards him with posters and lanterns. 																								The session came to a close with the chief minister dissolving his Cabinet and resigning.																								Those who have nothing to do indulge in such gimmicks, I ignore such acts, Halim said later.																								Leader of Opposition Pankaj Banerjee said Trinamul would move a no-confidence motion against the bankrupt government after consultations with the Congress. They also demanded white papers on the state of finance and law and order.																								Congress leader Atish Sinha said his party is also contemplating an adjournment motion against the Left Front and will get in touch with the Trinamul leadership on the issue.

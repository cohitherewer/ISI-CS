 Tuesday, September 03, 2002 				 Women assault charge on cops
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Sept. 2: The son of a 75-year-old woman has complained to the district civil and police administration that his mother and wife were severely beaten up by the police on Saturday night. Both the women are in hospital.																								I have received the complaint and asked deputy superintendent of police T.K. Mondal to give me a report. If the police are found guilty, the offenders will be duly punished, Murshidabad superintendent of police Virendra said today.																								The son, Bakkar Sheikh, has also sought the help of the Association for the Protection of Democratic Rights.																								The family which struggled with stifling poverty lived in a shanty at Bhakuri village in the Behrampore police station area. The widow, Mohsena, and Bakkars mentally-challenged sister Rabea Khatun made their living by begging on the streets of the town.																								About three weeks ago, my younger brother Akkar, who was a cycle-rickshaw puller, left home without telling his wife about his destination. His wife complained to the police that we knew about Akkars whereabouts, Bakkar said.																								The police picked up Bakkar, his mother and wife Mahima Bibi following the complaint. 																								The policewomen began beating my mother and my wife for no reason. My mother collapsed unconscious on the floor. When I tried to protest, I was thrashed with lathis, Bakkar said.																								There is a creeping suspicion in Bakkar that some influential members had the family harassed to get it moved from the shanty to make room for a stall.																								The trio was detained in the police station without food till that evening. Yesterday, the two injured women were admitted to hospital.																								A spokesman of the Association for the Protection of Democratic Rights said for the past three days, the family had not been able to earn a single paisa. The organisation would conduct an independent probe into the incident and then approach the state human rights commission, he added.																								The spokesman pointed out that Bakkar had three children who had to go without food ever since their father had to run around trying to fetch medical aid for his mother and wife.

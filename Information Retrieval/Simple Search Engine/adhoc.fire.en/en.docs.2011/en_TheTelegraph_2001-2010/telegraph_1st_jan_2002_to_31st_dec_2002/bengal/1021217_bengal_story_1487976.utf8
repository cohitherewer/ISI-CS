Trinamuls Arunabha Ghosh said 11 students of Hindi (honours) had failed in the examination but neither the university nor the government were concerned. Soon after the results were published, Calcutta University ordered re-examination of answerscripts of all the students of Presidencys political science department. We are surprised that the university is least concerned about the grievances of the students of the institutions Hindi department who, like their counterparts in political science, were dissatisfied with the poor marks, said Ghosh.																								The demand for an overall review of the Presidency students political science answerscripts was first raised by principal Amitava Chatterjee at a meeting of the syndicate, the universitys highest policy making body, a day after the results were published. At the same meeting, another member of the syndicate, a Hindi teacher in Presidency, had pointed out that the university should also consider a total review of the Hindi answerscripts.																								Higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty today said he had no report that the students of the Hindi department in Presidency had not performed well in the examinations.																								He dismissed allegations that the government had favoured the political science students. We provide the highest amount of funds to Presidency. All the departments of the college are of equal importance to us, he said.

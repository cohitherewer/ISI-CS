The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, October 08, 2002 				 Sachins culinary gifts
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai: Though Tendulkars promises to emerge as the hottest eatery in town, maestro Sachin Tendulkar is quiet clear that cricket will remain the No. 1 priority.																								Interacting with the Media after a conducted tour of the swanky yet-to-be-opened restaurant  a product of a joint-venture with top gun Sanjay Narang  Sachin said he would leave the business aspect exclusively to his partner.																								The Colaba restaurant was to have been opened Monday itself, but Sachin decided against doing so as he did not want the event to be a distraction ahead of the first Test against the West Indies. And, as he told The Telegraph, he wants everything to be perfect before Tendulkars is thrown open to the public.																								As part of the learning process, Sachin invited teammates for dinner and, added, he hoped to suggest improvements on the basis of the observations from the Sourav Gangulys and the Rahul Dravids. Im on my toes, even off the field, he quipped, as the time neared for teammates to troop in.																								Significantly, Sachin didnt forget to make a mention of the late Mark Mascarenhas, his business manager, whose idea it originally was to launch an upmarket eatery with the Tendulkar branding. 																								While there are no plans (right now) to start a chain, Tendulkars will have a memorabilia section and a corner from where merchandise can be bought.																								Clearly, yet another Sachin hit is around the corner.

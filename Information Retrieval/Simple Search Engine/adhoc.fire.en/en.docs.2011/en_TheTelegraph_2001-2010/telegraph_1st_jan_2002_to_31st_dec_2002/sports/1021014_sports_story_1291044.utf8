The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Monday, October 14, 2002  BRIEFS
				 																																	n The Philippines Arvin Ting, who won the bronze, during the mens wushu at the Asian Games in Busan Sunday. Chinas Yuan Xindong won the gold, with Hong Kongs To Yu Hang winning the silver 				 																																	Perth: Former world number one Greg Norman has delayed the launch of his new luxury yacht after the fatal bomb blasts in Indonesia, a spokeswoman for the Australian golfer said on Sunday.				 																																	Bombs ripped through a packed nightspot on Indonesias traditionally tranquil tourist island of Bali overnight, killing at least 150 people, most of them foreigners, in a suspected terror attack. We just felt it was inappropriate because of the number of people who had been hurt and killed and especially because of the number of West Australians, a spokeswoman for Norman said.				 																																	Belfast: In Northern Ireland, where wearing the wrong soccer shirt can get you killed, its hard to separate sport from politics. So in a few weeks time, when the provinces police force play their counterparts from the Irish Republic in their first Gaelic football match since a ban on members of the crown forces playing traditional Irish games was lifted, the significance will go far beyond sporting rivalry. This is a great day for many of us, I had one guy here last week in tears because he thought he would never see the day when we would have a Gaelic football team, said Chief Superintendent Brian McCargo.				 																																	Bratislava: Two England football fans were shot and hurt when security guards at a Bratislava pub opened fire early on Saturday, hours before England beat Slovakia in their Euro 2004 qualifier match.				 																																	Officials said one of the fans was shot in the thigh. The second, shot in the neck, underwent surgery in Bratislava and was in stable condition in hospital.				 																																	The men were shot outside a pub during a rainstorm on a picturesque square in the Slovak capital only about 100 metres from the England team hotel, witnesses said.				 																																	London: Early revelations from an autobiography by television presenter Ulrika Jonsson, England coach Sven Goran Erikssons former lover, proved a damp squib on Saturday, providing none of the scurrilous revelations predicted in the British press.				 																																	Newspapers had predicted the extracts published in the Mail on Sunday would include new material likely to strain relations between the Swedish coach and the English FA. But Jonsson, who is also a Swede, in the first instalment, merely detailed the course of the affair, which was made public last April. 				 																																	Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic): A French woman attempting to break the world record in freediving was declared dead shortly after plunging into the sea, a diving official said.				 																																	Attached to a pulley and weighted sled, Audrey Mestre sunk below the surface without oxygen, only for her seemingly lifeless body to be hauled up by divers nine minutes later. Medics tried to resuscitate her at a beach hotel but she was declared dead shortly after the effort.				 																																	An accident happened down there, said Carlos Serra, president of the Miami-based International Association of Free Divers. We believe something hit the sled. When she came out of the water she was foaming from the mouth and bleeding.				 																																	Mestre reached her target depth of 561 feet, Serra said, at the beach near La Romana, about 130 km east of Santo Domingo, the capital. But in order for it to be considered a record, she needed to return to the surface safely, he said.				 																																	Something went terribly wrong, said Jeff Blumenfeld of Mares, an Italian diving company that sponsored the 28-year-old Mestre. 				 																																	Zero-tolerance for racism: Blatter				 																																	Zurich: Fifa president Sepp Blatter on Saturday called for the fight against racism in football to be stepped up in the light of a spate of incidents in recent European competitions.				 																																	In one of the most serious cases, leading Dutch club PSV Eindhoven were fined 20,488 euros by Uefa on Saturday after their supporters chanted racist chants and threw objects at Arsenal striker Thierry Henry in the English clubs 4-0 Champions League win in The Netherlands last month.				 																																	Blatter said: We have talked about it. We have put those words into action. But now I think it is time for us to take our efforts to a higher level and lead the fight against discrimination in football with renewed vigour.				 																																	With this in mind, I wholeheartedly support Uefas recent declarations on this issue.

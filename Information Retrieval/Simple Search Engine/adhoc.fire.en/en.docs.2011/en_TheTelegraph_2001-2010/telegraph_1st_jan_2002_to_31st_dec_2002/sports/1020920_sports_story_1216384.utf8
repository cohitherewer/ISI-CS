The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 EB end with victory
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 East Bengal striker Mike Okoro (right), who scored twice in the 3-0 win over Port Trust, in action Thursday																								Calcutta: East Bengal shook off their three-match win-drought with a cakewalk over Calcutta Port Trust at home on Thursday afternoon. The Super Five lightweights were, in fact, lucky to come away with a 0-3 scoreline rather than something much, much more embarrassing.																								East Bengal thus completed their engagements with 30 points from 13 games. Neither Mohun Bagan (22 points) nor Mohammedan Sporting (27) can top their tally. But its still not certain whether East Bengal will have to feature in a play-off to identify the champions.																								Mohun Bagan can force a play-off if they win both their remaining fixtures  against Tollygunge Agragami on September 25 and Mohammedan Sporting on September 28. Mohammedan Sporting are also in contention only have to hold Mohun Bagan to qualify for a play-off with East Bengal.																								Bolstered by the return of Mike Okoro and Douglas DSouza, East Bengal piled on the pressure from the outset. Okoro fired the opener after 24 minutes. After many East Bengal misses, the lively Nigerian doubled the lead 33 minutes into the second session. Second-half substitute Alvito DCunha made it 3-0 seven minutes from full time.																								Okoro now has a dozen goals in his kitty and it will take some doing for the likes of Rahim Nabi and Dipendu Biswas to displace him from the top.																								Having lost to Mohun Bagan the other day following stalemates with Mohammedan Sporting and Tollygunge Agragami, Subhas Bhowmicks men were desperate to get back to winning ways. Okoro and Malswamtluanga set the pace early on before Tushar Rakshit got into his game-making groove to split the Port defence time and again.																								A fine Okoro header off a Malswamtluanga cross saw Port custodian Sandip Guha bring off a spectacular save. Another penetrative Malswamtluanga centre was intercepted by Pinaki Datta in the nick of time.																								The breakthrough came with Tushar coming into his own. His measured through, bisecting the central defenders, found Okoro inside the penalty box. The Nigerians angular right-footer went in off the outstretched hands of the keeper.																								Tushar masterminded countless such incisive forays but just one got converted. Tushar set up Surya Bikash Chakraborty with a neat square pass and the overlapping wing-back did his bit by crossing the ball for Okoro to tap in unchallenged.																								The third goal was Dipankar Roys creation. Having replaced Tushar after 79 minutes, the little medio laid the ball in DCunhas path from the centre line. DCunha sprinted a good 30 yards, drew the keeper out and pushed the ball into the net.																								Port didnt stretch the East Bengal defence even once. Sanjit Saha caught the eye but Port need at least three-four workhorses like him to make a mark.

Suresh, Raju Singh, Tushar Rakshit (Dipankar Roy, 79), Douglas DSouza, Anit Ghosh, Malswamtluanga, Subhash Chakraborty (Alvito DCunha, 66), Mike Okoro (Trijit Das, 89).

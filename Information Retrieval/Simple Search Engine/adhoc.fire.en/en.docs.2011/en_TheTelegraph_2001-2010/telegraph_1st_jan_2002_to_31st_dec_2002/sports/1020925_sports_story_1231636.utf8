				 																																	Tunis: Tunisia have named Roger Lemerre, sacked as France coach in July, as coach of their national soccer team, officials said on Tuesday.				 																																	The new coach is Roger Lemerre. He will come to Tunis this week and he will be with the team for its friendly match with Portugal on October 12, a Tunisian Football Federation official said.

Lemerre won the European title with France in 2000. 				 																																	Busan: Asian Games organisers were scrambling Tuesday to kick-start ticket sales with ninety per cent unsold just days before the opening ceremony.

Koreans, who have already been to the feast of the World Cup, do not care much for the Asian Games, said Um Doo-wan, director of the ticket sales department of the organising committee. Geographic distances between Seoul and Busan and between downtown Busan and Asian Games venues also thwart many people to come to the Games, he said.

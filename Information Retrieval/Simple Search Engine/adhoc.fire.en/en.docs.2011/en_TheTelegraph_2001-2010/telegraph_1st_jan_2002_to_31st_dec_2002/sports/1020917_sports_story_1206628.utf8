		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Waqar retained captain
				 	 Waqar Younis																								Karachi: Waqar Younis will retain the Pakistan captaincy for the upcoming series against Australia, but is under orders to improve his teams dismal recent record, the countrys cricket chief said Monday.																								We are retaining Waqar for the Australian series and will continue to monitor his performance as well as that of his team and maintain our policy of naming a captain series by series, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Lt Gen Tauqir Zia said. We want him to motivate the boys and try to put the team back on winning ways.																								Waqar was last month appointed captain only for the current Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka.																								Experienced paceman Wasim Akram and opener Saeed Anwar have opted out of the upcoming series while ace batsman Inzamam-ul Haq has a heel injury. Zia disclosed that wicketkeeper Rashid Latif has also asked for a break. 																								We have recalled Moin Khan primarily because we have been informed by the team management that Latif also wanted a break from international cricket, he said.																								Moin, sacked as captain last year, was Saturday named among the 22 probables for the series against Australia.																								The withdrawals have sparked talk of a crisis in Pakistan cricket and the local media had speculated about a possible revolt against Waqar. The PCB chief declined to comment.																								Pakistan meet Australia in the first Test in Colombo from October 3-7. The remaining two Tests will be played in Sharjah.																								Lloyd Match Referee																								Former West Indian captain Clive Lloyd will oversee the Pakistan-Australia series as the Match Referee, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced Monday. ICC panel umpires Steve Bucknor of the West Indies and Indias Srinivas Venkatraghavan will officiate in all three Tests.  (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, December 21, 2002 				 Houllier unperturbed
																								London: Gerard Houllier has reiterated his unflinching commitment to Liverpool as the Anfield club aim to rescue their English Premier League season with victory over Merseyside rivals Everton on Sunday.																								Having taken just one point from the last 18 in the league, the French coach has endured the first backlash of his Liverpool tenure.																								A minority of fans have even called for his departure in the midst of four straight league defeats, and fourth-placed Everton, one place above their city rivals, will relish the chance to intensify Liverpools misery at Anfield.																								But Houllier, whose life was in danger when he underwent emergency heart surgery in October 2001, remains positive.																								I think I am fortunate to be here and preparing for games like this after what has happened over the last year or so, he told the Liverpool website. (REUTERS)

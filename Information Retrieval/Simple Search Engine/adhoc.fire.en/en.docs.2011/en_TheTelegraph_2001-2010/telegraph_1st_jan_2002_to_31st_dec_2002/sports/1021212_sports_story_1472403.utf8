		 Thursday, December 12, 2002 				 Akram to appeal ban on captaincy 
				 	 WASIM akrAM 																								Karachi: Pakistan all-rounder Wasim Akram will file an appeal against a ban on captaining his country imposed after he was implicated in match-fixing, relatives said on Wednesday.																								Wasim has met several experts on law, and to my knowledge he has already filed an appeal against the recommendations of a judicial inquiry, Akrams wife Huma said.																								Pakistans first match-fixing inquiry, conducted by Lahore High Court Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum in 1998 and 1999, banned Salim Malik and Ata-ur-Rehman for life and fined six others including Akram, who was fined Rs 300,000.																								The Qayyum Commission also censured Akram and recommended he should not lead his country again. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) implemented the recommendations in May 2000.																								Pakistani media has been widely speculating that current captain Waqar Younis, although appointed captain until next years World Cup, will make way for Akram after the on-going series against South Africa.																								Pakistan has a history of sacking captains and coaches midway through their tenures. 																								Sources close to Akram said he would file an appeal in the Lahore High Court on December 22, explaining his reluctance to play Test matches in South Africa from December 26. He is currently playing in the one-day series there.																								PCB spokesman Sami-ul-Hasan confirmed that Akram conveyed his desire to file an appeal. Wasim, as an independent citizen, has his right to challenge, but the PCB is not providing him any legal or technical support, he said.																								He refused to comment on whether Akram would be appointed captain if he wins the appeal. We will cross that bridge once it comes, he said. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, December 15, 2002 				 Bond warns of more 
																								Wellington, Dec. 14 (PTI): New Zealands tearaway fast bowler Shane Bond, the destroyer of the Indian batting in the first Test, promised to employ more of short-pitched stuff against the tourists in the second Test at Hamilton beginning Thursday.																								We really employed the short ball well against the Indians on a bouncy pitch. I am sure we would look to do the same in the second Test, said Bond in an ominous warning to the Indians who were skittled out for 161 and 121 in two innings on their way to a 10-wicket loss.																								Bond, who finished with seven for 99 in the match, also suggested he could bowl faster than what he dished out at the Basin Reserve. I think I can bowl quicker. Sometimes when there is a wind up your tail, you almost pull yourself back. I know I am quick enough to hurry people.

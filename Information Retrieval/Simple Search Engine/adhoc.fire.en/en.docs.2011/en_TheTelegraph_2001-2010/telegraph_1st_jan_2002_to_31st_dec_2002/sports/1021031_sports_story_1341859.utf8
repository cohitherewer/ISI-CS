 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sanjay Bangar sets off for a single Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Calcutta: A visit to the Kalighat temple Monday night may have spelt luck for Sanjay Bangar but he does not regret missing out on a well-deserved century at the Eden Gardens on the opening day.																								Yeah it is disappointing to be dismissed on 77. But, at the same time, I should also consider myself lucky to have survived on five, Bangar said after the days play.																								He felt that the pitch was more to be blamed for his dismissal. The ball stopped and came and took me by surprise. The wicket is slightly on the slower side but the outfield is fast. So																								This was the Railways batsmans first international at the Eden though he played in a Ranji Trophy tie in 1996-97. This apart, he has also played at Kanchrapara and Eastern Railway Sports Association ground at Behala during the inter-railway meets.																								Bangar had a sedate start Wednesday. However, he did change gear to move into an attacking mould after crossing his half century. At times I just did not play shots and left balls outside the off stump. It was a bit frustrating. The West Indians were disciplined in their attack and I could not risk playing too many shots.																								Initially, as always, when we walked out there were butterflies in the stomach. But once we took strike, it was a matter of concentrating and playing each ball on merit, Bangar said.																								He feels India should aim for a total around 400. That will serve as a big psychological boost for us. We would have been in a much stronger position had we not lost a few wickets.																								The grey areas																								Though he has been successful, Bangar feels there are still a lot of areas which he needs to work on. I need to improve my footwork and also be able to put the bad balls away more consistently.																								The more you play at this level, the more experience you gain. It helps you gain maturity, he explained.																								What has been the secret of his flourishing partnership with Virender Sehwag? He helps me a bit and vice versa. He keeps me going as we keep encouraging each other. It does not matter who gets the runs as long as the partnership is kept going.

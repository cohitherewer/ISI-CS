		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Kenya hoping for a miracle
				 	 HOOPER: Need to be focussed 																								Colombo: Kenya captain Steve Tikolo says West Indies will be under pressure when they go up against his side in their Champions Trophy pool 3 encounter on Tuesday.																								After losing their first match to South Africa, West Indies know their only chance of progressing to the semi-finals is to beat Kenya convincingly and then hope the Kenyans can spring a major surprise by beating Shaun Pollocks team.																								This is a situation Tikolo feels his players can exploit.																								We know the West Indies position but it doesnt affect our game plan, he said on Monday. They are the ones under pressure.																								West Indies captain Carl Hooper is equally aware of the situation but promised his side will not be taking Kenya lightly.																								I dont think were in a position where we can afford to be complacent, he said. 																								Hooper stressed the need for a professional performance from his players.																								I havent got the World Cup of 1996 in my mind, he said. But I can remember a number of games where shocks have taken place.																								Meanwhile, the major weakness of Kenya might be the lack of a cutting edge with the ball but Tikolo feels the absence of a genuinely quick bowler could work to Kenyas advantage.																								Ive watched the few games so far and the wickets have played pretty well in the first session but then get slower and turn as the match goes on, he said. With our bowling line-up that could work in our favour.																								Both sides have no reported injury problems and are at full strength. West Indies have yet to confirm their final XI but Hooper said it was likely to be the same one that played South Africa.																								Teams																								Kenya: Steve Tikolo (captain), Joseph Angara, Hitesh Modi, David Obuya, Thomas Odoyo, Maurice Odumbe, Collins Otieno, Kennedy Otieno, Ravindu Shah, Martin Suji, Tony Suji.																								West Indies (likely): Carl Hooper (captain), Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Pedro Collins, Mervyn Dillon, Vasbert Drakes, Chris Gayle, Wavell Hinds, Ridley Jacobs, Brian Lara, Mahendra Nagamootoo, Ramnaresh Sarwan.																								Umpires: Daryl Harper and Srinivas Venkataraghavan.																								Third umpire Asoka de Silva.																								ACU to study all tapes 																								The Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) of the ICC will review tapes of all matches in the ICC Champions Trophy.																								The ACU has requested the host broadcaster to supply it with tapes of all matches played by all 12 teams competing in Colombo. The role of the ACU will include detailed monitoring of all matches and reviewing any incident that may look unusual, said an ICC statement. 																								The ACU has studied incidents in the opening game between Sri Lanka and Pakistan as part of the security protocols put in place for the event, the release said. (REUTERS)

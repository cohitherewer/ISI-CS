(AFP)																								Dhaka: Ramnaresh Sarwan hit his maiden Test century as West Indies took full command on the second day in the first Test against Bangladesh on Monday.																								The visitors took a sound lead of 261 with five wickets in hand at close of the second day after bundling Bangladesh out for a paltry 139 in the first innings, just 24 minutes after tea on the first day.																								Sarwan scored a career-best 119 with 19 fours before being caught by Naimur Rahman off Talha Jubair.																								Sarwan and Marlon Samuels added 176 in the fourth-wicket stand. Samuels was deprived of his second century of the tour when he was trapped leg before to Talha Jubair for 91 that contained 15 fours.																								Daren Ganga and Ridley Jacobs were at the crease with 34 and 14, respectively.																								Earlier, Chris Gayle and Wavell Hinds put on 131 for the first wicket before Gayle was caught behind off Tapas Baishya for 51, including eight fours. It was his ninth Test half-century.																								Hinds followed his partner just three balls later as he lifted a catch to Naimur at mid-off from Baishya. He scored 75 with 12 fours.																								The visitors, who were 118 for no wicket at the close of the first day, were reduced to 150 for three as Baishya struck in the same over to remove Gayle and Hinds while Shivnarine Chanderpaul also fell cheaply.																								Chanderpaul scored only four when he mistimed a slower delivery from left-arm orthodox spinner Enamul Hoque and was caught behind by Khaled Mashud. (REUTERS)

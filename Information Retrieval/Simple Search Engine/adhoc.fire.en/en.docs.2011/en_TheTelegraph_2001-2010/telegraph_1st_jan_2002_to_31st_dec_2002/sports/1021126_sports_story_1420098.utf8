The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 				 Mix-n-match outfit shot down by Sourav
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Deep: Time not right for recall																								Hyderabad: Even if Sourav Ganguly didnt get everybody of his choice, for the first half of the New Zealand tour, he convinced the selectors (and coach John Wright) that the 16-strong squad simply had to be Test-specific and the strictly one-day players ought not to be somehow accommodated.																								Indeed, according to The Telegraphs sources, there was a move to pick a few one-day specialists, thereby allowing them more time to acclimatise before the seven ODIs  Indias last set of engagements before the World Cup. In that eventuality, Shiv Sundar Das (third opener) and Ajay Ratra (second wicketkeeper) wouldnt have made it.																								[Ratra, it may be recalled, was overlooked after the tour of England.]																								However, it is learnt Sourav strongly argued that everyones immediate attention should be on the two Tests (Wellington and Hamilton, from December 12-23) before looking to the one-day series (December 26-January 14). The selectors, who met in Mumbai Monday, eventually went along with the captains point of view.																								In fact, just the other day, Sourav had told a confidant: Everything should be done step-by-step... Therefore, its pointless to even think of sending a mixed squad. At this moment, our focus has to be on the Test series.																								The one-day squad will be chosen around the middle of December.																								To talk of the selection, Brijesh Patel and Co. didnt consider Anil Kumble, as he made himself unavailable on personal grounds. As was tipped in these columns Monday itself, Murali Kartik became the beneficiary.																								As for the other senior pro, Jawagal Srinath, he has been rested. Actually, he himself wanted a break to get stronger and fitter and personally conveyed that to Patel and Wright. By default, then, Tinu Yohannan has been recalled. He must consider himself very lucky  after all, had Irfan Pathan been a right-hander, he would have been heading for New Zealand.																								Incidentally, while the new-ball operators were being discussed, Easts Pranab Roy made a mention of Ranadeb Bose, who returned match figures of ten for 168 versus Himachal. He didnt come into reckoning but, then, fine performances on a regular basis will keep him in the selectors eyes.																								Kartiks case is different. Earlier this season, he wasnt even good enough to make the Test XIV (rookie Amit Mishra was preferred) against the West Indies. Yet, when opportunities came during the one-dayers, Kartik grabbed with both hands.																								The same can hardly be said of Deep Dasgupta. A fortnight back, he was the frontrunner to keep Parthiv Patel company. As it turned out, he missed catches and byes in the Ranji game versus Himachal and, worse, didnt get runs.																								So, as the selection neared, it became evident the going was exceedingly tough. As someone involved with the process put it, recalling Deep at this point in time (when his keeping is suspect) would probably have hastened the end of his career.																								When Deep does return, he should be safe behind the stumps, the gentleman added. Besides, he must be consistent with the bat. If he isnt, the bit about his batting being an asset, simply wont hold. More than ever, Deep must now know exactly whats required of him.																								One understands M.S.K. Prasad was also a contender for the second wicketkeepers berth. Prasad, of course, made his India debut (1999) well before both Deep and Ratra.																								Meanwhile, Railways Nathu Ram Choudhary has been appointed manager for the tour.																								q Openers: Virender Sehwag, Sanjay Bangar and Shiv Sundar Das.																								q Middle-order batsmen: Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S.Laxman and Mohammed Kaif.																								q Allrounder: Ajit Agarkar.																								q Wicketkeepers: Parthiv Patel, Ajay Ratra.																								q Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Murali Kartik.																								q New-ball bowlers: Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and Tinu Yohannan.

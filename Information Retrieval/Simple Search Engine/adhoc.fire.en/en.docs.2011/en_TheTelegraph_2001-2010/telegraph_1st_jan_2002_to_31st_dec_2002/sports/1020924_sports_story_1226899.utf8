		 Tuesday, September 24, 2002 				 Chandhok finishes on podium
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The experience gets better with time. First it was Narain Karthikeyan who was close enough to flirt with F1, now Karun Chandhok, son of veteran rallyist and racer Vicky, has made it, so to say in the world of racing.																								The 18-year-old prodigy, sponsored by JK Tyre, finished his first season in British Formula III on a high with a second place at the Donington Park Grand Prix circuit in England, according to information reaching here. 																								Considering this is his debut year in British Formula III (Scholarship Class), Chandhoks performance has been extraordinary. With this, the reigning Asian Formula 2000 champion accumulated a total of six podium finishes in the British Formula 3.																								It was a strong start for Chandhok over the weekend, finishing up fourth in the test session held on Wednesday. During qualifying Karun struggled with a handling imbalance and ended the day with a pair of sixth positions for the final two races of the championship.																								In the first racehe got caught up when Adam Carroll spun in front of the field and was down to sixth. Later he retired.																								In the second race, Chandhok started well to retain his sixth spot. Five laps later he passed Gavin Smiths teammate Stephen Colbert, going into the final hairpin. Robert Dahlgren then went wide on the penultimate lap, allowing Chandhok into third place. 																								The Chennai-born driver then dived down the inside of teammate Clivio Piccione as they went into the first corner starting the last lap. It played to Chandhoks advantage and he came home to collect his trophy for second place from non other than the three-time Formula 1 World Champion, Nelson Piquet.

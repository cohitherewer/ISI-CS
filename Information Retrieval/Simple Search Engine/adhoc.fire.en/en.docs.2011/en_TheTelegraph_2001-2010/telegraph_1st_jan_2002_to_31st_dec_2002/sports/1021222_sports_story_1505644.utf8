		 Sunday, December 22, 2002 				 BTA hits back at BOA
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 21: The Bengal Tennis Association (BTA) lashed out at the Bengal Olympic Association (BOA) for providing deplorable residential facilities at the National Games village. The tennis team left the village for a hotel of their choice, for which Bengal Chef-de-Mission, Dilip Pal criticised the tennis contingent Friday. 																								Water from the toilet was coming into the rooms and the maintenance was quite awful at the village. So, our boys had no option but to move into a hotel of their choice, BTA treasurer Hiranmoy Chatterjee told The Telegraph Saturday.																								He also informed that the tennis contingent shifted after taking his permission and the BOA has no business taking offence. If this goes on, we will stop sending tennis teams for the National Games in future, the treasurer added.																								He also said that they are waiting for an official letter from the BOA on this regard and that they will duly send their reply.																								ITF meet to be upgraded																								The ITF junior meet, scheduled to take place at the city from January 18 to 25, will be upgraded to Grade III from Grade V this year, according to Chatterjee, who is one of the organisers of the meet. He also added that there are only two more Grade III events in the country.

		 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 Boje, Dawson ruled out of semi-final
																								Colombo, Sept. 21 (Reuters): Allrounder Nicky Boje and fast bowler Alan Dawson have been ruled out of South Africas Champions Trophy semi-final Wednesday due to injuries.																								Boje has a hairline fracture in his right finger and Dawson has a right calf injury, South African media manager Gerald de Kock said.																								He added 37-year-old fast bowler Steve Elworthy and uncapped allrounder Robin Peterson were being flown in as cover.																								Dawson played in South Africas 176-run victory over Kenya on Friday which sealed their semi-final place. They will meet the winners of Sundays deciding pool II clash between India and England.																								Opener Herschelle Gibbs was adjudged Man of the Match for his 116.																								Boje, a left-arm spinner and lower order batsman, missed Fridays game because of the injury he suffered on September 13, attempting a return catch against Carl Hooper during the win over the West Indies.																								Peterson and Elworthy played for South Africa A in the home series against Australia A which ended earlier this week.																								Peterson, 23, who bowls left-arm spin and bats right-handed, travelled to Sri Lanka two years ago as cover for left-arm spinner Paul Adams but did not play.																								Elworthy, who has 38 one-day international caps, last played at the top level in January in a five-match series in Australia which South Africa lost 5-0.

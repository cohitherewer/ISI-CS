																								Perth: Sri Lankan cricket officials have claimed their team were snubbed on arrival at Perth airport for two key weekend tri-series clashes with England and Australia, it was reported Friday.																								Lanka manager Ajith Jayasekera claimed no local official was present at the airport for assistance Wednesday, the West Australian newspaper said. The team was left waiting for a baggage van and no one told the players when they would be able to train at the WACA ground, the paper reported.																								This is no way to treat a visiting team, Jayasekera said.																								This has not happened to us anywhere else in the world, and I am sure it wouldnt happen to any other team but Sri Lanka.																								Jayasekera said he had to ring the ACB in Melbourne to arrange for a baggage van after the team had waited for sometime. It had also taken until Thursday to confirm training arrangements, he complained.																								Western Australian Cricket Association chief executive Kath White, who welcomed the England cricket team when they arrived in October, said there had been a mix-up over Sri Lankas arrival time. (AFP)

 							 - Super division l Brazilian Douglas modest debut for league leaders BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 East Bengals Mike Okoro jumps onto Chandan Das, who scored the second goal against Ever-Ready Saturday. Subhas Chakraborty (right) chipped in with a brace																								EAST BENGAL 5 EVER-READY 0																								Calcutta, Aug. 24: It was another soggy day on the Maidan. Soccer was damp, the ground was slushy, the mood tired. In between, five goals were scored, and Calcutta Football League Super Division leaders East Bengal walked all over debutants Ever-Ready Association.																								There isnt much to talk about, soccer-wise, this day. Subhas Chakraborty scored twice, the others being shared among Chandan Das, Malsawmtluanga, and Soumitra Chakraborty. The basis of this win was a weirdly lackadaisical Ever-Ready defence and a weak half line that could pose little challenge for the dominant home team.																								The day was interesting for the East Bengal fans, vis--vis the debut of a Brazilian, Douglas DSilva in the defence line. Well, not much can be said from a lone (that, too, the debut) match, played on soggy turf and against a crumbling and a pretty meek defence. Yet, on a tentative scale of zero to ten, Douglas may have made between a modest 4 and 5. There were a couple of dead-ball handlings that looked good, but his gait failed to impress.																								Ever-Ready presented their own Nigerian forward, Celeste, and this was a decent buy, it seemed, for a modest outfit like theirs. He is bouncy and full of energy. He moves, he lopes, more importantly, he tries.																								Despite the domination, the home team had to wait till the 43rd minute for the lead, Subhas shooting home a Kulothungan pass.																								The insurance came three minutes after changeover. Up the right, in attack, Malsawmtluanga trapped in the box and passed to the goalmouth where Chandan Das had no problem shooting in.																								In the 13th minute, Douglas put in his five-pence bit that yielded a nice few dollars as dividend. From the top of the box on the right he took a free-kick that went straight to the goalkeeper. The custodian, Debashis Ghatak, managed a poor collection and the ball spilled back on the turf. Subhas was at hand to punt home the rebound.																								By then the Ever-Ready defenders were reduced to spectators. The ground was porridge, and as the attacks increased, the visitors ran out of ideas. They gave away the goals on a platter.																								In the 65th minute Mike Okoro was up the middle before passing to the right to Malsawmtluanga. Malsawmtluangas low volley beat the goalkeeper hands down.																								It was a free-for-all by then. Douglas also tried his hand and scoring, but was quickly cut short, and as Soumitra Chakraborty came on in place of Kulothungan an attack was developing. Malsawmtluanga lifted one to the goalmouth and Soumitra homed in an angular shot to complete the tally.

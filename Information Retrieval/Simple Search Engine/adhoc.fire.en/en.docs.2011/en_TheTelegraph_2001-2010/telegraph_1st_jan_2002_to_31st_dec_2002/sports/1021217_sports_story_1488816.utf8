(AFP)																								London: Two goals from midfielder Stefano Fiore gave Lazio a 2-1 win at champions Juventus in Serie A on Sunday to maintain their 100 per cent away record and stretch Juves winless run to four games.																								Victory keeps Lazio in second place, just a point behind leaders AC Milan who enjoyed a 2-1 win at bottom club Como with goals from Massimo Ambrosini and Andriy Shevchenko. Juventus are in fifth place, six points behind Milan.																								Third-placed Inter Milan remain two points behind their city rivals after they beat Atalanta 1-0 at home thanks to a fine strike from Sierra Leone striker Mohamed Kallon.																								AS Roma put some disappointing results behind them to emerge convincing 3-0 winners over Reggina with goals by defender Walter Samuel and strikers Francesco Totti and Vincenzo Montella. 																								Roberto Baggio scored the 200th Serie A goal of his career from the penalty spot to complete Brescias 3-1 win over Perugia. 																								Real Sociedad edged out Real Mallorca 2-1 on Sunday to re-establish their four-point lead at the top of the Spanish first division and ensure they will go into the New Year as league leaders.																								Mallorca took the lead with a Samuel Etoo header early in the second half but goals from Javi de Pedro and Miquel Aranburu took the unbeaten Basques to a ninth victory of the season.																								Champions Valencia also claimed a valuable win, 2-0 away to local rivals Villarreal on Saturday, while Real Madrid came from two goals down to beat Recreativo Huelva 4-2 on Sunday and claim their first home victory in two months.																								Real Sociedad remain untouchable at the top, though, with 32 points from 14 matches with just one more league game to play before the Christmas break.																								Valencia stay second on 28 points, with Real Madrid moving up to third, eight points behind the leaders but with a game in hand.																								Celta Vigo and Real Betis both lost further ground with surprise defeats, Celta going down 3-0 at Racing Santander and Betis losing 1-0 at home to Rayo Vallecano.																								Celta slip to fourth on 24 points, behind Real Madrid on goal difference, with Betis in fifth a point further back.																								Deportivo Coruna moved up to sixth, behind Betis on goal difference, thanks to a 1-0 win at home to Malaga. 																								VfB Stuttgart stayed on course for a place in Europe next season with a 2-1 Bundesliga win at VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday.																								Thomas Schneider opened the scoring for the visitors in the 35th minute before fellow defender Fernando Meira doubled the advantage 10 minutes into the second half.																								Wolfsburg, playing in a brand new stadium for the first time before a club record 24,147 fans, pulled one back with a penalty from Croatian striker Tomislav Maric in the 76th minute. They drop one spot to 10th.																								Crisis-hit Kaiserslautern recorded their third league victory of the season with a much-needed 2-1 win over Hertha Berlin in the other match played on Sunday.																								A penalty from defender Harry Koch with three minutes remaining gave the four-times German champions the points.																								Czech striker Vratislav Lokvenc had put them ahead in the 28th minute but visiting Hertha levelled the match in the 64th minute courtesy of Hungarian midfielder Pal Dardai.																								 Resurgent Olympique Marseille completed the first half of the season at the top spot of the French league table after reigning champions Olympique Lyon were held to a 1-1 draw by Montpellier on Sunday.																								Nices impressive run at the top of the first division standings, built on the divisions best defence, ended with their 4-0 demolition by Girondins Bordeaux.																								Marseille, who beat Sedan 2-1 away on Saturday, lead with 34 points from 19 games, one point more than Nice and two above Monaco, Lyon and AJ Auxerre.																								They went two goals up through defender Manuel Dos Santos and Ivory Coast striker Ibrahima Bakayoko either side of halftime. The hosts reduced the deficit through Henri Camara.																								A moment of madness from Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Kasey Keller helped an unsettled Arsenal salvage a 1-1 draw in a frenetic north London derby at White Hart Lane on Sunday.																								Keller, the US international, brought down Thierry Henry inside the area on the stroke of halftime and Robert Pires converted the resulting penalty to cancel out Christian Zieges stunning opener Tottenham.																								The point shared restored the English champions outright lead of the Premier League with 36 points from 18 games, one more than second-placed Manchester United, who beat West Ham United 3-0 on Saturday.																								In the later match on Sunday, shell-shocked Liverpool suffered their fifth defeat in six league games, going down 2-1 at struggling Sunderland. (REUTERS)

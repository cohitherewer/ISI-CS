 FROM A CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi: Kali Prasanna Banga Vidyala, Kodalia, entered the quarter finals of the 2002 Subroto Cup football tournament after a narrow 1-0 win over Bihars Navbharat High School of Bhabua on Thursday. The Bengal school qualified for the knock-out stage with an all-win record in two matches. 																								Kali Prasanna dominated proceedings but managed to score just once in the 26th minute. Left back Suprakash Haldars angled free-kick was trapped and slotted in by central midfielder Sheikh Siddique. Playing in the 4-4-2 formation, the Kodalia school, though, squandered four sitters in the second half. 																								Five players of the Bihar school failed the medical test and so they were left with just their playing eleven. The secretary of the tournament, Sqn. Ldr. Subodh Bhatnagar still felt that the malaise of over-aged players was less this year. 																								Of the six schools tested so far, only eight players have been disqualified, five from Bihar, two from Bagapa Ashram High School, Tripura and one from the holders Government Higher Secondary School, Mizoram. n																								In the other match on Thursday, Government HSS trounced Sri Ramakrishan HS, Salem, 11-0 in a group A match. Striker Lalramhlunga scored six goals.

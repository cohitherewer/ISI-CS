The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, October 06, 2002 				 Amit Mishra confident of handling the pressure 
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Bangalore, Oct.5: Young Amit Mishra may not have been thinking about this afternoons selection committee meeting, while trying to fox the West Indies batsmen, but he sure was overwhelmed with his selection for the first two Tests.																								Hum log chaar bhai aur do bahen hain... Nahin, chaar bhai aur teen bahen, Mishra, 19, mumbled while speaking to The Telegraph at the KSCA Stadium. Realising he had made a mess of answering a perfectly simple question, the leggie laughed and added: Main lekin sabse chota hoon.																								Mishras maiden India call-up, however, is no laughing matter. For good measure, he insisted there wont be any pressure when he does get a place in the XI. Im confident I will be able to keep the nerves in check, Mishra, who is Rohtak-based, remarked.																								A Shane Warne admirer, Mishra is known to possess a lethal googly. But, he quickly pointed out that he unleashes it judiciously. Wicket dekh ke phekna chahiye... Of course, bowling the right line and length is what must always be kept in mind... Today, for instance, I stuck to this basic (for Board Presidents XI).																								Talking generally, Mishra said he chooses when to flight and entice batsmen. If the wicket is absolutely flat, theres no point in flighting. Turn rehne se maaza aata hai... Asked about his USP, Mishra promptly answered: Sharp spin.																								Incidentally, Mishra maintained much of the credit for his selection should go to Sanjay Bharadwaj, who runs a coaching centre in New Delhi. The coach, too, is from Rohtak. Mishra, by the way, made it a point to thank his family, especially parents Ram Sumer (a former Railway employee) and Chandra Kali, for so much encouragement.																								n Srinath, Das in XIV: Pg 14

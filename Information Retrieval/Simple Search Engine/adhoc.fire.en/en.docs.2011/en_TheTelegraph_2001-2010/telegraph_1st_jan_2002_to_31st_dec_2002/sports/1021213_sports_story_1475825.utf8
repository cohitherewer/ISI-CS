The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 Mundy on top with 6-under
 															- NOIDA GOLF BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Uttam Singh Mundy fired a six-under 66 to leap into the lead midway the Noida Open 2002 at the par-72 Noida Golf Course Thursday. According to information received here, Mundys tournament tally is six-under 138.																								Delhi youngsters Ashok Kumar and Shamim Khan were placed second and third at five-under 139 and three-under 141, respectively. 																								Stalwarts Vijay Kumar and Mukesh Kumar were tied fourth with Vinod Kumar, Sanjay Kumar and defending champion Vivek Bhandari at two-under 142.																								The cut was applied at 11-over 155 with 50 pros and four amateurs making the grade.																								Mundy, who ended a two-year dry spell with victory at the Surya Nepal Masters three weeks ago, thinks he is a more confident player now. 																								My win in Nepal really set the ball rolling. I have been playing consistent golf all these years but there was something lacking that prevented the win from happening.																								On Thursday, it was his driving that saw the 37-year old return a card of six-under 66. Mundy played an error-free round with birdies on the second, eighth, ninth, 13th, 14th and 15th. 																								I drove superbly and my putting has also improved, he said. From here, I will take it hole by hole.																								Ashok shot a two-under 70. He was two-over on the seventh tee following bogeys on the third and sixth but birdies on the seventh and ninth evened things out. 																								On his return journey, Ashok birdied the very first hole, dropped a shot on the 13th, birdied the 14th and dropped another shot on the 16th.																								I decided to go for it as that was the only way to make up for the earlier errors, said Ashok who finished off his opening round with a hattrick of birdies on the seventh, eighth and ninth holes Wednesday.

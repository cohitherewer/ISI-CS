		 Monday, December 16, 2002 				 Aussies whip England again
																								Melbourne: Australia easily won the second one-day tri-series match against England on Sunday but lost leg-spinner Shane Warne for the remainder of the Ashes series. 																								Warne dislocated his shoulder diving to stop a ball off his own bowling and will be out of action for four to six weeks at least. 																								The fifth and final Ashes Tests begins in Sydney on January 2 with the World Cup starting in South Africa the following month.																								The freak injury followed a record Australia total against England in an ODIwhen they smashed 318 for six from their 50 overs.																								Captain Ricky Ponting (119) and Adam Gilchrist (124) shared a record Australia partnership of 225 for the second wicket against any team.																								England opener Nick Knight, fresh from an unbeaten 111 in Fridays loss to Australia in Sydney, made 70 on Sunday in Englands reply of 229 all out in 48 overs. Australias total was their highest against England, beating the previous mark of 283 for five in Brisbane in 1990-91.																								It was also Australias ninth consecutive win in ODIs against England and Nasser Hussains side have yet to record a win after 13 matches and eight weeks in Australia.																								Man-of-the-Match Gilchrist smashed 124 from 104 balls and Ponting hit 119 from 123 balls, adding 225 for the second wicket from 206 balls after Australia opener Matthew Hayden was out to the bowling of James Kirtley for four in the third over.																								Australias previous best for any partnership in ODIs was the 224 by Dean Jones and Allan Border for the third wicket against Sri Lanka in Adelaide in 1984-85.																								Englands innings started badly with Marcus Trescothick out for six and Ronnie Irani run out for his second successive duck.																								Hussain put on 60 for the third wicket with Knight, scoring 19 before he became one of Warnes two victims. Craig White (57 not out) and Ian Blackwell (43) put on 72 for seventh wicket in 84 balls to take England beyond 200.																								Australia picked up a bonus point by restricting England below 254. They have 11 points after two wins, to Englands one. (REUTERS)

		 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 HC clarifies Jadeja order 
																								New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday said Ajay Jadeja and the Board of Control for Cricket in India would have the right to approach the court on any other issue even after the dispute arising out of a five-year ban on the cricketer was decided by arbitration.																								The clarification was given by a bench comprising Justice Usha Mehra and Justice R.C. Jain on an application by the BCCI stating that the court in its October 30 order had stated that only Jadeja would have such a right.																								BCCI counsel Gopal Subramaniam submitted that this would prejudice the board.																								After hearing the parties, the court said a correction is made in the order that the right of the petitioner (Jadeja) and respondent (BCCI) if any survives, they can agitate against the same in the court.																								The court had referred Jadejas case to an arbitrator to decide it within two months after a mutual agreement between him and the BCCI.  (PTI)

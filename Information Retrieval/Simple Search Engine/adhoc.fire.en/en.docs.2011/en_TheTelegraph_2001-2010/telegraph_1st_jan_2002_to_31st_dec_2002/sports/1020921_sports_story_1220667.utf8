				 																																	Sydney: Australias hardline quarantine inspectors have barred entry to two boxes of turf from the world famous Lords cricket ground, fearing that they might be a haven for bugs and pests.				 																																	Two souvenir sods of Lords grass, ordered by Australian cricket lovers, arrived through the mail in boxes bearing the customs declaration sporting (cricket) goods. But quarantine officials dug their heels in and refused to admit them.				 																																	It is hallowed turf and we have quite a number of cricket enthusiasts who were quite impressed to see this, but obviously from a quarantine perspective we cannot allow this into Australia, said Craig Hall, manager of the Agriculture Fisheries amp; Forestry mail programme on Friday.				 																																	Lords, owned by the Marylebone Cricket Club, is seen as the home of cricket and its spiritual headquarters. With the historic arena now being relaid, the MCC decided to raise funds by selling chunks of the old turf to cricket lovers around the world.				 																																	Strasbourg: Strasbourgs sacked Paraguayan goalie Jose Luis Chilavert is taking legal action against club president Patrick Proisy for alleged racism, his lawyer said Friday. The action relates to comments by Proisy reported in the press last month which poked fun at Chilaverts weight and origins.				 																																	The player, who has ballooned to 106kg, 18kg over his ideal weight, was formally sacked by the French first division side Thursday, after a stormy two seasons with the outfit.				 																																	He (Proisy) called him Michelin man and spoke of banana republic practices referring to his (Chilavert) South American origins. All that to unbalance him, claimed the players lawyer Rene Pernot. An employee who is not paid his salary, whom you insult and show the door, its not normal.				 																																	Milan: Italian World Cup winner Franco Baresi has returned to AC Milan as coach of the Serie A clubs youth team. The 42-year-old former Milan captain, voted the clubs Player of the Century, resigned as director of football at Premier League club Fulham last month. Prior to his three-month spell in London, Baresi, who helped Italy win the 1982 World Cup, had been a vice-president of Milan with responsibility for youth development.				 																																	Oslo: Norwegian soccer club Vindbjart have agreed to sell striker Kenneth Kristensen in return for his weight in shrimps, the club said on Friday. The goal-getter will be weighed when Vindbjart play his new team, Floey, at the island of Flekkeroey in southern Norway on Saturday.				 																																	Vindbjart will receive an estimated 75 kg (165.3 lb) of fresh shrimps for the transfer, agreed last winter after Vindbjart made the novel demand for crustaceans rather than cash. The shrimps will be eaten at a party next week.				 																																	Kristensen said he had wanted to swap clubs because of a remarkably beautiful girl living on the island. 				 																																	London: Former Leicester City midfielder Dennis Wise is set to sign for Millwall after agreeing to terms with the English first division club. Millwall moved in for the former England international after Leicester won the right to sack him on Wednesday following an incident on a pre-season tour that left a teammate with a fractured cheekbone.				 																																	Millwall manager Mark McGhee told Sky Sports TV that he was not concerned about Wises off-field problems.				 																																	Rio de Janeiro: Brazilian club Palmerias troubles have intensified with the request by World Cup winning goalkeeper Marcos to be dropped from the team. He made the request after his side lost 0-2 to Ponte Preta on Wednesday. Coach Levir Culpi however, rejected his goalkeepers request and insisted he would play against fellow strugglers Figueirense on Saturday. 				 																																	n Cricket, Champions Trophy  Pakistan vs Holland live from 9.30 am on SET Max n Golf: Tigers Bridge from 6 pm on ESPN n Soccer: Football Asia from 12 noon on STAR Sports n Soccer: Premier League, live from 7.25 pm on STAR Sports

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Rain saves day for Bangladesh
																								Chittagong: Bad weather forced the first one-day International between Bangladesh and the West Indies to be abandoned as a draw here on Friday. 																								Bangladesh, chasing a target of 276, were struggling at 90 for four in 17 overs when rain hit the M.A. Aziz Stadium and forced play to be stopped. 																								The umpires abandoned the match after the interruption left no time to complete a minimum of 25 overs in Bangladeshs innings. The rain allowed Bangladesh to wriggle out of a tight situation after West Indian fast bowler Vasbert Drakes sliced through the top order with all four wickets. 																								Bangladesh were reduced to 52 for four before Sanwar Hossain (16 n.o.) and Alok Kapali (20 n.o.) aded 38 for the unbroken fifth wicket.  (AFP)

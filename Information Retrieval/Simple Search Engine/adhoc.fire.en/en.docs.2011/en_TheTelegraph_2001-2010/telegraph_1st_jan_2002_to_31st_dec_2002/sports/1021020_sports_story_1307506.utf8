		 Sunday, October 20, 2002 				 Ntini stifles Bangla after SA declare
				 	 Kallis: Completes 4000 runs and 100 wickets																								East London, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Makhaya Ntini produced a fiery spell of pace bowling to cripple Bangladeshs first innings on the second day of the first Test against South Africa on Saturday.																								Ntini took three for 13 in 10 overs, five of which were maidens, as Bangladesh slumped to 153 for seven at stumps in reply to South Africas first innings of 529 for four declared.																								South Africa had resumed on 369 for two and captain Mark Boucher declared 40 minutes after lunch.																								Gary Kirsten scored 150, his 15th Test century, while Jacques Kallis made an unbeaten 75 and became the fifth player to complete the double of 4000 runs and 100 wickets in Test matches.																								West Indians Garfield Sobers  who reached the milestone in the fewest Tests, 43  and Carl Hooper, Kapil Dev and Ian Botham are the other players in the group.																								The 27-year-old Kallis batted for three hours, faced 138 balls and hit nine fours while debutant Martin van Jaarsveld was 39 not out in an unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 81.																								South Africa lost their third wicket after an hour when the left-handed Kirsten steered a square drive off the bowling of medium pacer Talha Jubair to Alok Kapali at backward point.																								Kirsten, who became the first player to score centuries against all nine Test-playing countries, was at the crease for more than five hours in which he faced 223 balls and hit 14 fours.																								The same Bangladeshi combination struck in similar fashion in Jubairs next over to dismiss Ashwell Prince for two.																								Both wickets fell because of batting errors rather than penetrative bowling as the visitors modest attack failed to make an impression on the steadily flattening pitch.																								South Africas new ball pair of Mornantau Hayward and David Terbrugge also struggled to settle on a line and length but, in the eighth over, Javed Omar played back to an angling delivery from Terbrugge and was trapped in front for seven.																								Ten balls later, Al-Shahriar was bowled around his legs for 18 by Hayward, the ball ricocheting from his thigh pad into his armpit and on to the stumps.																								Boucher brought Ntini into the attack after tea and he struck in his sixth over when Sanwar Hossain, on 31, fended a sharply lifting delivery behind to end a third-wicket stand of 66 with Habibul Bashar.																								In Ntinis next over, Tushar Imran ducked into a short-pitched ball and was bowled via a deflection for no score. Top scorer Bashar, who made 38, was next to go, dismissed by Ntini as he sparred at a wide delivery and was caught behind.

				 																																	Madrid: A distracted Tim Henman found the tireless Thai Paradorn Srichaphan too much of a handful in the second round of the Madrid Masters on Wednesday, the British number four seed going down to an untidy 6-3, 3-6, 3-6 defeat. Srichaphan went on to beat Croatian Ivan Ljubicic 6-4, 6-2 in the third round Thursday. Top seed Tommy Haas lost his place in the tournament, the defending champion having to retire while trailing 7-6 4-1 to Frenchman Fabrice Santoro because of a blister on his hand. Albert Costa, the sixth seed, didnt even make it on to court, as a back injury forced him to withdraw from his match against Nicolas Lapentti.				 																																	Durban: Ali Bacher, the chief of the 2003 cricket World Cup organising committee, has denied suggestions that the World Cup music committee was divided along racial and ideological lines.				 																																	Bacher was responding to a front-page leading article in a Johannesburg newspaper on Wednesday that said the theme song composed by an African musician was rejected because it was too African.				 																																	Bacher said the music committee on the whole rejected the song as they felt it might only receive the support of one section of the community.				 																																	The revised World Cup song has now been completed and would be representative of all South Africans, he said.				 																																	Rome: Winger Vincent Candela has denied Italian media speculation that he will leave AS Roma for Juventus when the transfer market opens in January. It had been suggested that the Frenchman, who was jeered by fans during his sides recent defeats, would be exchanged for Juventus midfielder Edgar Davids, for whom Roma made a series of unsuccessful offers before the season started.				 																																	Ive never heard anything from anybody at Juventus, he was quoted as saying in Corriere dello Sport on Thursday. 				 																																	Wentworth: European Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance has been named the European Tours Golfer of the Month for September following his teams victory over the United States 19 days ago.				 																																	Europe went into the last-day singles at The Belfry as underdogs but, galvanised by Torrances bold strategy of sending out his best players early, they surged to a memorable victory.

		 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 Shah: Not disappointed
 							 - Keen tussle gives way to bonhomie at BCCI annual general meeting BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 BCCIs new secretary S.K. Nair shares a light moment with president Jagmohan Dalmiya at a city hotel Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Calcutta: At the end of it all, there was no ill will, no show of strength. The lack of fireworks was almost anti-climactic. 																								The newly elected BCCI secretary S.K. Nair and Niranjan Shah, who he replaced, sat hand-in-hand beside board president Jagmohan Dalmiya at the press conference following the AGM on Thursday.																								Dalmiya even went to the extent of calling Shah a perfect teamman.																								Its been a roller coaster ride for me under Dalmiyas leadership. I enjoyed every bit of it and am not disappointed. Its a result of groupism, politics and democracy.																								My group couldnt muster enough votes for me and well try for better luck next time, said Shah.																								On the ICC sponsorship controversy that erupted during his tenure, Shah said: The ICC never understood the market of cricket in India. The show cannot go on without India.																								Nair, while thanking the Almighty for his ascendancy, adopted a cautious approach. This is an opportunity as well as a challenge for me to work hard.																								The 65-year-old Nair, a former BCCI treasurer and outgoing finance committee chairman, refused to answer questions on the players contract and the logo controversy. I have just been elected. Give me some time to get settled and understand the issue, was all he would say.

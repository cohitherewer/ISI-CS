		 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 Media goes ga-ga over Clijsters
																								Brussels: Belgium lauded Kim Clijsters on Wednesday after the teenager upset world No. 1 Serena Williams to clinch the prestigious WTA Tour Championship.																								Clijsters: the best in the world, said Het Laaste Nieuws.																								The victory of 2002, cheered La Dernieure Heure.																								Kim Clijsters wows, splashed Gazet van Antwerpen across its front page, next to a picture showing the Belgian punching the air after her Los Angeles triumph.																								Clijsters, dogged by a shoulder injury for much of the season, needed only 85 minutes to defeat Williams 7-5, 6-3 on Monday, in a victory that propelled her to number four in the world.																								Clijsters, 19, is now mature enough to go for her first Grand Slam victory and a well-considered attack on the top spot in world ranking, the Gazet Van Antwerpen said.																								The Los Angeles victory gave her the edge over Belgiums other rising young star, Justine Henin, who she demolished 6-2, 6-1 in the quarter finals of the Los Angeles tournament.																								Physically, but especially mentally, Kim Clijsters is a notch higher than Justine Henin, tennis commentator Philippe Lacourt wrote in La Derniere Heure.																								Great things will now be expected of Clijsters.																								The icing on the cake is still out there, added De Morgen. It would be a shame if Clijsters, given her talents, did not win a Grand Slam tournament. Without a doubt that goal in particular should push her sporting heart next season. (REUTERS)

		 Saturday, December 14, 2002 				 Indians and a shocker De Silva
				 	 Sourav: Past victim																								Wellington: Wherever they play these days, Indian cricketers have to contend not only with the opposition but with a Sri Lankan umpire who has handed down some truly shocking decisions against them so much so that he is now being referred to as a shocker De Silva.																								The despair to which the genial 46-year-old Asoka De Silva has driven the Indians in recent months is such that the team management reportedly called up Board officials after the first day of the Test match against New Zealand here. 																								De Silva, a former Test player, has so far officiated in 21 Tests and 15 of them have been against India. India have won six of these games, lost five and drawn four. 																								De Silva ruled two questionable decisions on the first morning of the match, giving Sanjay Bangar and Sachin Tendulkar out which reduced Indians to 29 for 3 and straightaway put them at a disadvantage. 																								Against the West Indies in India, De Silva stood in three Tests and handed out, among many, two rough decisions each against Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid.. 																								Sourav, before the start of the present series, had hoped there would be better luck for him in this time as far as umpiring decisions go but the fate he avoided has befallen on his two other teammates.

				 	 Willstrop 																								Chennai: James Willstrop of England became the new world junior mens squash champion when he beat compatriot Peter Barker 9-0, 9-3, 9-1 at the India Cements Academy Monday.																								In the final, the tall and well built player from Pontefract in Yorkshire put all his reserves into the title clash for an emphatic win over Barker in just 24 minutes. Barker, who was tamed for the fourth time this year having lost in straight games in the British Open, British Junior Open and the European Championship, was subdued perhaps due to the excellent court coverage and consistent winners by Willstrop.

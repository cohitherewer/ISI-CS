		 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 CAB-CMC showdown stalled till after Test 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The trouble between the CAB and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has been stalled till after the Eden Test starting October 30. The deal was struck Tuesday between CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya and mayor Subrata Mukherjee, after days of impasse in which neither side agreed to move from their respective positions.																								Hectic parleys over the last few days culminated Tuesday in a part peace treaty in which the CMC wants the CAB to make a token payment and carry the rest of the argument over to after the Test. 																								That would be time when the rates and nitty-gritties would be worked out. Not that the CAB has agreed to any such token payment (agreeing to one would open the gates to other demands), but it is learnt that the softening of the CMC stand has come about after a level of interference from the state government. The government doesnt want this issue to be a hurdle in smooth conduct of the Test.																								The CAB working committee, which met earlier Tuesday, had given Dalmiya all powers to deal with the CMC on this issue.																								Meanwhile, three officials of the water department of the CMC were sent back from Eden Tuesday. The officials had purportedly gone to the CAB to collect drinking water samples for testing, a formality before cricket matches here.																								A senior CAB official told the CMC officials that no water sample would be available to them if they failed to furnish proper papers. The flummoxed officials returned and the issue was about to blow up in the associations face when Dalmiya had a telephonic discussion with the mayor and invited the officials to call in Wednesday to collect the water samples.

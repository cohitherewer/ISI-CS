		 Tuesday, September 10, 2002 				 Laurie Williams killed in car crash
																								Kingston: Former Jamaica and West Indies cricketer Laurie Williams died in a car crash which also claimed the life of his brother, authorities said on Monday.																								Allrounder Williams, 33, and his 23-year-old brother Kevin Jennison died when a car being driven by Williams went out of control and ran into a public transit bus in the suburb of Portmore near Kingston.																								Police said Williams was on the way to his home on Sunday evening when he swerved to avoid a damaged section of road. His car ended up under the bus.																								I am shocked by his death, sports minister Portia Simpson Miller said in a written statement. I just cannot believe this. Laurie represented Jamaica and the West Indies well and at all times was committed to the game.																								Williams, a medium pace bowler and lower-order batsman, made his first class debut for Jamaica against Eng land on February 19, 1990 and took 170 first class wickets, including a best of six for 25 from his 51 matches.																								He also scored 2,002 first class runs, with a highest score of 135 and a batting average of 24.71.																								He also represented the West Indies 15 times in ODIs, making his debut against New Zealand in 1996. (Reuters)

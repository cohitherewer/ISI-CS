		 Monday, December 30, 2002 				 Aussies need 107 
				 	 VAUGHAN: Sixth century of the year																								Melbourne: Michael Vaughans sixth century of the year Sunday helped England set Australia the relatively small target of 107 to win the fourth Ashes Test.																								Australia, who lead the five-match series 3-0, faced two overs before the close of the fourth days play, reaching eight without loss. Yorkshire opener Vaughan hit 145 before Australia dismissed England, who had been asked to follow on, for 387 in their second innings 18 minutes before the scheduled close of play.																								Leg spinner Stuart MacGill, recalled for his first Test in 11 months following a shoulder injury to Shane Warne, took two for 108 from 36 overs in the first innings and five for 152 from a marathon 48 overs in the second.																								Pacer Jason Gillespie, with four for 25 and three for 71, was also a key weapon for Australia captain Steve Waugh after he enforced the follow-on.																								Vaughan became the highest run-scorer for the 2002 calendar year, passing the 1,392 from Indias Sachin Tendulkar. His 1,481 runs from 14 Tests puts him behind only former Windies captain Viv Richards who made 1,710 runs in 11 Tests in 1976.																								Vaughans 277-minute innings included 19 boundaries and three sixes from 218 balls. The Yorkshire openers innings closed in dramatic fashion in the fifth over after lunch. He smashed MacGill for a six over mid-off and a boundary to square-leg before cutting a ball to slip where debutant Martin Love took his third catch. (REUTERS)

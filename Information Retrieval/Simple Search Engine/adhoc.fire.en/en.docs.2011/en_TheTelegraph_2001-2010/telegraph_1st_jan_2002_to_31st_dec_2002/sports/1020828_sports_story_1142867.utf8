		 Wednesday, August 28, 2002  Daniel holds key to Colts Stakes 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: With all the three runners in the fray sporting his chief patron MAM Ramaswamys colours, trainer Daniel David holds the key to the Calcutta Colts Trial Stakes on Wednesday. However, it is the topweight Smart Ruler, vastly improved since castrated, who has the edge over the field.

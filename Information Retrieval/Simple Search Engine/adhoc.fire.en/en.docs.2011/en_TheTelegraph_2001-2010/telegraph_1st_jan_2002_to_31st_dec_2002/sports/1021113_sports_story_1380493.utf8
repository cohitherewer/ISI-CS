																								Rio de Janeiro: Brazils interim coach Mario Zagallo named four domestic players to complete his squad for a friendly against South Korea in Seoul next week.																								Goalkeeper Julio Cesar and left-back Athirson were called up from struggling Flamengo, while Gremio sweeper Anderson Polga and Atletico Paranaense midfielder Kleberson will complete the world champions squad for the November 20 game.																								Athirson was not originally in Zagallos plans but was brought in as a late replacement for AC Milan left back Serginho, who is no longer available.																								The selection of Anderson Polga was unexpected, because his Gremio team is still battling to qualify for the quarter finals of the Brazilian championship.																								Bayer Leverkusen centre-half Juan and Paris Saint Germain midfielder Ronaldinho are doubtful because of injury, while Hertha Berlin striker Luizao was ruled out on Tuesday.																								Zagallo has promised to revert to his preferred 4-4-2 system rather than the 3-5-3 used by Luiz Felipe Scolari in Brazils triumphant World Cup campaign.																								THE SQUAD																								Goalkeepers: Dida (AC Milan), Julio Cesar (Flamengo). Defenders: Cafu (AS Roma), Bellitti (Villareal), Roberto Carlos (Real Madrid), Juan (Bayer Leverkusen), Anderson Polga (Gremio). Midfielders: Gilberto Silva (Arsenal), Emerson (AS Roma), Flavio Conceicao (Real Madrid), Kleberson (Atletico Paranaense), Ronaldinho Gaucho (Paris St Germain), Juninho Pernambucano (Olympique Lyon), Ze Roberto (Bayern Munich). Forwards: Amoroso (Borussia Dortmund), Franca (Bayer Leverkusen), Denilson (Real Betis), Ronaldo (Real Madrid).

				 	 SURYA: Held through perpetual checks																								Panaji: Indias newest Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly was held to a draw by compatriot Akash Thakur in the first round of the world junior chess championships which began here Monday.																								The first round was, however, a smooth affair for most of the top seeds. 																								The girls section too did not produce any sensational results in the opening round. Top seed GM Koneru Humpy played a lively game to score an easy win against compatriot Anori Mehul Shah.																								Against the 11th seed Surya, Thakur forced a draw through a perpetual checks in a game which lasted 41 moves.																								Top seed Bu Xianghi of China proved his mettle when he made a daring knight sacrifice in the middle game in a game involving Sicilian dragon. The Chinese GM, who picked up the black colour in the draw of lots during the inaugural ceremony, went for a violent attack after sacrificing the piece.																								His opponent Indias Vikramaditya Kamble was a mute spectator of Xianghis onslaught and at one stage, to save his king from the mating net, Kamble had to return the piece. In the ensuing end game Kamble was fighting a losing battle with two pawns down and resigned in 36 moves.																								Armenian GM Aronian Levonon was also impressive in his opening round win over Indias Preetham Sharma in a closed Sicilian defence game. 																								Levonon, on the white side, co-ordinated his pair of bishops with his major pieces to take total control of the board and this positional advantage was sufficient for him to win in 35 moves.																								GM Pendalya Harikrishna too got off to a winning start, beating Jones Eriksson.Fourth seed Miton Kamil of Poland employed Fianchetto variation to beat the Kings Indian Defence of Annaberdiev Meylis of Turkmenistan.

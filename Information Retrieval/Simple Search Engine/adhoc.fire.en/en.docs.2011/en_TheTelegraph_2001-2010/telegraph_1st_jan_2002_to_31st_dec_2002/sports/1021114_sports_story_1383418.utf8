		 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 Stromsik to coach Mahindra
																								Mumbai: Mahindra United have roped in 1982 World Cup goalkeeper Karel Stromsik of the Czech Republic as their chief football coach.																								Stromsik, who played international soccer between 1980 and 1983, has been recruited to improve the Mumbai-based outfits chances in the National Football League championship.																								Stromsiks induction is primarily to improve the physical fitness and skills of our players during the last 20 minutes of the game, when players are generally exhausted and short on stamina, Alan Durante, president of Mahindra United, said.																								Mahindra have also signed up three foreign players, Strnadel Petr (Czech Republic), Odartey Lawson (Ghana) and Monga Aby Samson (Ivory Coast). (PTI)

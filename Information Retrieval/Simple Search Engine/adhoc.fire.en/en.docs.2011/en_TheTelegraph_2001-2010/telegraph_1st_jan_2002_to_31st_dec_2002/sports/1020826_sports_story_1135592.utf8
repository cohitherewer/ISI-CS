(Reuters)																								London: Premier League champions Arsenal saved their 23-match unbeaten record by snatching a 2-2 draw against West Ham with late goals from Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord Saturday.																								Seeking a record 15th consecutive victory, Arsenal were outplayed by their fellow Londoners who scored through Joe Cole a minute before half-time and Frenchman Frederic Kanoute in the 51st.																								Arsenal pulled one back when Henry rifled the ball home after 65 minutes but Kanoute then had a penalty saved by David Seaman. Wiltord found the target in the 88th to grab an improbable draw.																								Liverpool went briefly to the top with a 3-0 win over Southampton before Leeds took over by defeating Premiership new boys West Bromwich Albion 3-1 in a game that featured a superb goal from Lee Bowyer.																								Harry Kewell scored his first of the season after 39 minutes before Bowyer finished off a slick passing move with a 20-metre drive. Mark Viduka scored the third before West Brom managed a consolation for the home fans.																								Liverpool cruised to victory at Anfield, with newly-signed Senegalese striker El-Hadji Diouf scoring his first two goals for the club.																								Diouf fired home after just three minutes from Emile Heskeys pass. He headed in the second six minutes after the break following a nod-on from the same player. Danny Murphy converted a last-minute penalty to complete the show.																								Earlier, newly promoted Manchester City brought Newcastle United down to earth, claiming a 1-0 win to kick-start their campaign. Former Newcastle man Darren Huckerby gave City the win with a close-range header after 36 minutes, although he appeared to be off-side.																								An Arsenal victory would have given them an outright English record of 15 straight league wins  overtaking Manchester Uniteds 1904-05 second division mark of 14  but they will be happy to have escaped with a point after being outplayed for much of the game.																								Arsenal came back strongly following a super effort from Henry, who flicked the ball up with his back to the goal before turning to blast in.																								Kanoute should have made sure of the points, but Seama saved his feeble penalty, and West Ham paid the price when Wiltord equalised after some good work by substitute Nwankwo Kanu.																								In Germany, Bayern Munich thrashed Hamburg to keep up their solid start. But the promoted Bochum were hogging the headlines after stunning Bayer Leverkusen 4-2 away to stay atop.																								Jan Simak put Leverkusen ahead in the tenth minute and Bochum roared back with Thordur Gudjonsson levelling three minutes later.																								Dariusz Wosz and Frank Fahrenhorst scored before the break and Christiansen netted on the hour before Franca pulled one back for the shell-shocked Leverkusen.																								Hansa Rostock joined Bochum on nine points after keeping their 100 per cent record intact in style with a 4-0 waltz away to Energie Cottbus.																								Bayerns Brazilian star Giovane Elber stepped out of the limelight following his four goals last week against Arminia Bielefeld as the Bavarians hammered a poor Hamburg side.																								Peruvian forward Claudio Pizarro scored midway through the first half and again five minutes from time before Alexander Zickler put the icing on the cake in the dying seconds.																								Champions Borussia Dortmund bagged their first win after two draws by beating Stuttgart 3-1 with Jan Koller and Brazilian duo Dede and Ewerthon doing the damage.

																								ASIAN OPEN GOLF																								Tao Yuan (Taiwan), Nov. 23 (Agencies): Jyoti Randhawa recovered somewhat to card a two-under par 70 and place tied 11th after the third round of the $ 1.5 million BMW Asian Open golf championship here Saturday.																								That kept the Indian in contention for his second straight top ten finish in as many weeks. Randhawa finished tenth in the TCL Classic in China last week. Randhawa totals a six-under 210 after three rounds over the Ta Shee Golf Club course.																								Another Indian to have made the cut, Arjun Singh had a topsy-turvy round with three birdies and four bogeys for a one-over 73, which saw him slip from overnight joint sixth to tied 16th place after 54 holes. 																								Vijay Kumar and Arjun Atwal played their best rounds so far with two-under 70 and three-under 69, respectively. Atwal, with a total of two-under 214 is now tied for 30th place, while Vijay with one-under 215 is tied for 40th place.																								Meanwhile, Maarten Lafeber carded a lacklustre one-under-par 71, but still finished the third round of the Asian Open one stroke clear of the field. The Dutchman ended the round at 13 under par ahead of Irelands Padraig Harrington and South African Trevor Immelman.

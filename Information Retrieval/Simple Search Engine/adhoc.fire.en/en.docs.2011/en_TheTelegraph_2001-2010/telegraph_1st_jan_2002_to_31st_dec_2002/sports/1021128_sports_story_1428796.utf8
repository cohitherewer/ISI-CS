The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, November 28, 2002  Immaculate has it easy in Burdwan Cup 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Topweights found the going easy on Wednesday as four of the six winners on the cards  including Immaculate, in the days main event, the Maharajadhiraja Uday Chand Mahtab of Burdwan Memorial Cup  cruised home with their respective events.But Immaculates task was made easier by his main challenger Allaying, an odds-on favourite, who lost about a distance at the start to do anything worthwhile in the race. Amyn Merchant, who partnered the Errol Bhungard-trainee to victory, was, however, less enterprising on his fancied filly Moon Mission in the Manasseh Memorial Cup, thus prompting the RCTC stewards to open an enquiry in to the running and riding of the Bhungard-trainee. A big gamble was pulled off in the race on the stables other runner, River Melody, who was backed from 8s down to threes. River Melody dictated terms from the start to score comfortably while Moon Mission toiled in the rear for a major part of the trip with Amyn making a very reluctant effort in the final stretch. Stewards will conduct the enquiry on December 4.

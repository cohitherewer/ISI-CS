		 Tuesday, December 10, 2002 				 Mumtaz, and the magic of the gloves
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Womens boxing is not a very popular game in India. But it is set to have a star participant in its ranks.																								Mumtaz Sorcar, the youngest daughter of the world-famous magician P.C. Sorcar Junior, has decided to put the boxing gloves on. She is currently practising at the South Calcutta Physical Culture Association under the coaching of Jamiul Alam and Sujoy Guha.																								She had a keen interest for the game from a very young age, and when she wanted to take it up seriously, we didnt think twice, said P. C. Sorcar.																								But isnt it disappointing that she has not gone into magic as a profession? You can be a magician with boxing gloves as well, Sorcar said. Moreover, we are stage performers, and my instincts say that she will prove it on the bigger arena.																								But the magician went on to add that she also has a knack for the family-profession. Thats in her blood, he said.																								Mumtaz, herself said that Laila Alis success in the game was a major reason behind her taking it up seriously. When I saw Laila doing so well, I really felt charged up. It was my dream and when someone else can do it, why cant I? the 16-year old added.																								I used to be a keen sportsperson from a very young age. I even hold a record in the shot-put in the school level, the Class X student of Modern High School added.																								Meanwhile, Asit Banerjee, vice-president of the Indian Amateur Boxing Federation, feels that Mumtaz has a great future ahead of her. P.C. Sorcar sent Mumtaz to me and I spotted the talent immediately, Banerjee said. She has a height (5 feet 6 inches) perfectly suited for the sport.

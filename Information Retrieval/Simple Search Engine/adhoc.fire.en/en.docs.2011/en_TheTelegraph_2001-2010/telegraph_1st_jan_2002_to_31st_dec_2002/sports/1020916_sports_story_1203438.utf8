		 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 McGrath sets right NZ record
																								Colombo: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming admitted his defending champions had been outclassed  as they faced an early exit from the Champions Trophy  in the 164-run defeat against Australia Sunday.																								You have to get the ball in the right areas bowling-wise and be thorough in your batting and we did neither, Fleming said. 																								Glenn McGrath admitted it had given him special satisfaction on two fronts. Not only did the five-wicket haul take him to 250 ODI wickets, it also helped the bowler set the record straight against a side with a good record against him.																								They played well against me last summer and my stats against them are not as good as against others. Its always a big game for me and it was in the back of my mind they had done well against me in the past. (REUTERS)

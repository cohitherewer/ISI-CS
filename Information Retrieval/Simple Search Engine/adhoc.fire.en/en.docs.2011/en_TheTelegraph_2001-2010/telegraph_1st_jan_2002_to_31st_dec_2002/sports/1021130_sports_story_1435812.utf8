The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Spain crush hapless US 
																								Perth: Spain trounced the US 4-1 in pool B thanks to a six-minute goal blitz at the womens hockey World Cup here Friday.																								In pool A matches, Germany thrashed Scotland 3-0 while South Korea beat New Zealand by the same margin. In another pool A match, England went down 1-3 to Australia.																								After a scoreless first half, Spain took the lead in the 40th minute through a penalty corner by Erdoitza Goikoetxea.																								The Spaniards then put the Americans to the sword with a devastating rush of scoring, Nuria Camon, Silvia Munoz and Luci Lopez netting in the 47th, 50th and 53rd minutes.																								Kate Barber had scored a consolation goal in the 52nd minute, but there was no way back for the Americans in pool B.																								US coach Tracey Belbin bemoaned her sides second-half collapse against the speedy Spaniards. I was pleased with the first half but we were undisciplined in the second half. Spain is a talented and quick team and after the first goal against us we sagged back and played off the back foot, Belbin said.																								Now we have to salvage all we can from the next three matches, she added.																								Spain coach Jack Holtman said his side had been confident of eventually breaking down their opponents. We applied a lot of pressure on US in the first half and the team was patient, waiting for the goals to come, Holtman said. 																								In the earlier match, South Africa and Japan played a 1-1 draw. South Africas goal scoring machine, Pietie Coetzee, drag-flicked a penalty corner conversion high into the right pocket of the net, nine minutes into the match for South Africas first goal.																								Japan hit back five minutes later when Japans star ball-carrier, Sakae Morimoto carried from Japans attacking quarter line into the circle, leaving South Africas defenders in her wake. (AFP)

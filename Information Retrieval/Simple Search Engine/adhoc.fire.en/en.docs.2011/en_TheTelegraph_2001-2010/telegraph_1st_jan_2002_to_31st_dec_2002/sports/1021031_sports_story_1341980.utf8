		 Thursday, October 31, 2002 				 Railways on track after poor start
																								New Delhi: A resolute innings by opener J.P. Yadav saw Ranji champions Railways recover from early setbacks and reach 135 for three in their first innings on a low-scoring Day II of the Irani Trophy match against Rest of India on Tuesday.																								Railways found the going tough after they skittled out the Rest  who lost three wickets for 39 runs  for 266 in their first innings 10 minutes after lunch.																								With the cheap dismissals of Amit Pagnis (6), Yere Goud (1) and skipper Abhay Sharma (20), it was left to Yadav and Jacob Martin, to do resurrection job.																								The duo did not disappoint, especially Yadav, who was included in the Indian squad for the Champions Trophy but did not get a look-in, showed immense character during his unbeaten 71-run knock.

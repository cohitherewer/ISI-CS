Verma said on Friday that the second test was yet to be conducted and the medals have also not been withdrawn yet. Before Sunita Rani left for Busan, two tests had been conducted and in both of these she had tested negative. It was only because of this that Sunita Rani had been allowed to proceed to Busan, he said.																								Asked what action would be taken against Sunita if proved guilty, he said: There is no need for any such action. As it is if she really tests positive she cannot take part in any event for the next two years.

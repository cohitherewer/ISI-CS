The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, November 05, 2002 				 Bagan release Debjit 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Debjit																								Calcutta: The Debjit Ghosh imbroglio finally got over on Monday with Mohun Bagan agreeing to release him to play for Mahindra United in the National Football League (NFL). 																								Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra said the decision was taken to ensure that the defenders career isnt hampered.																								It all started in June when Debjit signed the inter-state in favour of Mahindra United but later backed out citing technical problems.																								Talking to The Telegraph, Debjit said, I requested Mohun Bagan to give me the clearance and Im really grateful that the officials have complied.																								When asked whether itll be difficult for him to adjust with the somewhat alien conditions, Debjit replied: Not at all. Im a professional player and I have to play to the best of my potential. He, however, didnt specify whether he plans to come back to his favourite Mohun Bagan next season. He will be off for Mumbai on Saturday.																								 Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya sounded quite dejected about Debjits departure. Itll be a huge blow, he said. The coach added that he has asked the club officials for a replacement before the NFL starts.

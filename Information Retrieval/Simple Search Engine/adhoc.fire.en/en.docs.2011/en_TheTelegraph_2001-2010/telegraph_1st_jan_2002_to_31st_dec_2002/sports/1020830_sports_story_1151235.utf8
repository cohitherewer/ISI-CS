		 Friday, August 30, 2002 				 Pakistan crawl to four-wicket win 
 (AGENCIES)				 	 Man-of-the-Match Abdul Razzaq in action during Pakistans tri-series tie against Kenya in Nairobi Thursday. (Reuters)																								Nairobi: Pakistan made heavy weather of a small total before crawling to a four-wicket win over Kenya in the opening match of the triangular tournament Thursday.																								After dismissing the hosts for a paltry 133 in 30.3 overs, Pakistan slumped to 97 for six before Inzamam-ul-Huq and Rashid Latif took the team to victory with 16.3 overs to spare. Inzamam remained unbeaten on 14 and Latif made 28.																								The Pakistan innings got off to a bad start when Martin Suji dismissed Saeed Anwar with the fifth ball of the first over without a run on the board. Kenyan vice-captain Thomas Odoyo bowled Imran Nazir in the fourth over.																								Shahid Afridi came in at No. 3 and blasted 27 off 22 balls, including two huge sixes and three fours, before being caught by Odoyo off Martin Suji in the ninth over. Younis Khan and Azhar Mahmood pushed the score past 50, but the latter was run out with the score on 61. Four overs later, Abdul Razzaq was bowled by Joseph Angara. Younis fell soon after.																								Earlier, Pakistan won the toss and elected to field in cloudy conditions. Opener Kennedy Obuya top-scored for Kenya with a battling 36.																								Razzaq and Wasim Akram were the pick of the Pakistan bowlers. Razzaq took four for 35 and won the Man of the Match award. Akram claimed three for 29 off seven overs and broke the back of the Kenyan line-up with the key wickets of Steve Tikolo and Maurice Odumbe.																								However, it was skipper Waqar Younis who got the first breakthrough when he trapped Ravindu Shah leg-before in the fourth over. Akram then claimed three quick wickets, trapping captain Tikolo and Thomas Odoyo leg-before before bowling Odumbe for a duck. It left Kenya gasping at 30 for four in the ninth over.																								Just 36 runs  mostly extras  came in the first ten overs. But Obuya and Hitesh Modi steadied the innings and increased the run rate, taking Kenya past 100 in the 19th over. But Modi was soon forced off the field after being struck on the finger by Shoaib Akhtar.																								Modi made 34 off 32 balls and shared a partnership of 71 with Obuya, who was then joined by brother David. The youngster lasted just five balls before being caught by Waqar off Razzaq for a duck. The third Obuya brother in the team, Collins, was the next man out for one, leaving Kenya struggling at 104 for six.																								Razzaq bowled Kennedy Obuya in the 24th over, which brought back Modi. The batsman, however, didnt last long and was caught by Latif off the same bowler one over later without adding to his score.																								Pakistan meet Australia in the second match of the tournament Friday.

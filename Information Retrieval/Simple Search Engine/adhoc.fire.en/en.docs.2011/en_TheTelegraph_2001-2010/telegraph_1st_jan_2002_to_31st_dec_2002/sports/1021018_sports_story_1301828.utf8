				 	 Gough: Ready for Aussies																								London: Darren Gough insisted on Wednesday that he was on course to face Australia, even though he has not played in Tests for over a year.																								But his prolonged absence from top-class cricket has not dented Goughs self-confidence. 																								He said: I am 32, I am not 21, and you dont forget how to bowl, even though I keep reading that I have not bowled for a year. Its like riding a bike. 																								I am not scared, I have no fear. I have been around for 20 years and once I start again, it might take a week, but I know I have nothing to worry about. 																								Gough maintained that his earlier comments about a delayed return had been misunderstood. The plan was that my fitness would be adjudged around the time of the first Test but I am ahead of schedule. I was not supposed to bowl until I was out there but I have been for the last week off short run-ups.																								We have three weeks until the opening Test when I hope I will be either available or playing. I love cricket. I am just pleased to have this opportunity to give it my best shot and I am confident it will go well. 																								Asked if he minded being Englands third quickest bowler behind the likes of Simon Jones and Stephen Harmison, Gough said: No, because Im the best. 																								And on a more serious note, Gough insisted: Ive never been one to be jealous of my teammates. I want them to do well.  (AFP)

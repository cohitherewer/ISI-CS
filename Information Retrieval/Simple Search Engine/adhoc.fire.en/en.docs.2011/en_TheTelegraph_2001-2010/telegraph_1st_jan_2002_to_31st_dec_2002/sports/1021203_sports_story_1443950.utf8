		 Tuesday, December 03, 2002 				 Fleming to continue as opener 
 							 - ONE-DAYERS vs INDIA 				 	 FLEMING: No experiment 																								Christchurch: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming has made it clear that his side would not experiment during the one-day series against India and that he would continue to open the innings.																								The time to experiment is over. Now we have to work hard on the options we have developed, he said, adding that consolidation and not experimentation, will be the order of the day against India.																								The Black Caps, who had a disastrous season ever since their appearance in the final of the triangular series in Australia, have lost 14 of their 21 matches, including a humiliating defeat against Australia in the ICC Champions Trophy and a series drubbing by Pakistan.																								New Zealand, struggling with the form and fitness of their top players, had tried eight different opening combinations in the past one year with Fleming joining the only common denominator Nathan Astle for the last seven outings.																								Even if the combination makes a sorry reading in terms of partnerships, the highest being 23, Fleming said its an option I will favour.																								The New Zealand captain has scored 235 runs at an average of 33.57 in these seven matches.  (PTI)

 							 - Geet Sethi settles for bronze				 	 Indias Soumyadeep Roy in action against Mongolias Sukhee Galbadrakh during the table tennis singles first round match in Busan Tuesday. Soumyadeep lost in the second round. (AFP)																								Busan: India were robbed off a possible gold medal in sailing at on Tuesday after overnight leader Nitin Mongia was disqualified from one of the races in the OK Dinghy Class in a controversial decision which relegated him to the second spot.																								Mongia, a points ahead of his nearest rival, was disqualified in Mondays eighth race on a complaint by H.C. Jin of South Korea who claimed that the Indian had made contact with his boat.																								Mongia admitted that there was a contact but stressed that it was the South Koreans fault. I had contact with Jins boat but he was in the wrong. A jury member gave witness in my favour. Yet I was disqualified.																								Mongia seemed to have lost focus thereafter and came second and third in the ninth and tenth races on Tuesday, both incidentally won by Jin.																								Just as Jin is now assured of the gold medal, the silver is Mongias even if the two do not compete in the 11th and last race on Wednesday.																								Geet Sethi ended Indias campaign in cue sports with a bronze medal in billiards singles. He beat Aung San Oo of Myanmar 2-0 in the best of three-frames match at the Dongju Stadium.																								Grapplers falter																								Shokinder Tomars 1-4 loss to Ulu Ulan Nadyrbek of Kazakhstan in 60kg freestyle wrestling narrowly took away a bronze from India.																								Another grappler, Sujeet Mann kept his medal hopes alive by defeating Pakistans Muhammad Ali 7-0 margin in the 74 kg freestyle category.																								However, Gursharan Preet Kaur lost both her bouts on Tuesday to return empty-handed in the womens 72 kg freestyle. 																								Fifth in team dressage																								After having won a bronze in team eventing, India finished fifth in team dressage in equestrian. Sunil Shiv Das, Mritunjay Rathore, Vishal Bishnoi and Sandeep Dewan garnered 2849 points.																								Indian shooters continued to disappoint as Jaspal Rana failed to win a medal on the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Rana hardly did anything to make up for his dismal show on Monday finishing 12th in the 25m standard pistol individual event.																								In the team event, India finished seventh at the Changwon International Range with a total of 1680 points.																								The Indian challenge in individual table tennis event ended with Soumyadeep Roy crashing out 4-11, 8-11, 6-11, 11-8, 4-11 to South Koreas Tak Soo-kim in the second round. (PTI)

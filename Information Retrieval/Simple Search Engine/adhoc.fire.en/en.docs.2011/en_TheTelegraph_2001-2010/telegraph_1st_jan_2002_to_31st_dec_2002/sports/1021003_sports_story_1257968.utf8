		 Thursday, October 03, 2002 				 Women shooters settle for silver
				 	 Anjali Bhagwat, a member of the Indian womens 10m air rifle team which won the silver, in action in Busan Wednesday																								Busan: Women shooters and mens rowing teambrought some cheer to the Indian camp with a silver and bronze medal, respectively, but there were disappointments galore in other disciplines on the fourth day of the Asian Games here Wednesday.																								The women shooting team comprising Suma Shirur, Anjali Bhagwat and Deepali Deshpande bettered the previous Asian record and scored a total of 1187 points but still had to settle for silver in the 10m air rifle team event which was won by China with a world record effort of 1194 points.																								Far from the shooting ranges, the rowing team in the coxless fours brought the only other medal for India in the day. The team comprising Inder Pal Singh, Roshan Lal, Jenil Krishnan and P. T. Paulose clocked seven minutes 2.91 seconds to finish third and claim the bronze.																								The gold was won by China in six minutes 46.25 seconds while Uzbekistan took the silver in six minutes 58.79 seconds.																								In the only other notable performance, the mens hockey team blanked Japan 3-0 in their second league encounter to keep themselves on course for their title defence and move into the semi-finals from group A.																								India also advanced to the next rounds in mens and womens tennis team events with 3-0 whitewash against East Timor and Mongolia, respectively. 																								But elsewhere, there was only disappointment in store for the Indians. Bhagwat missed the bronze in the individual event of 10m air rifle by just 0.1 point while Abhinav Bindra finished a poor seventh in mens section of the same event.																								The medal hopes in squash came a cropper with all three Indians bowing out at the quarter final stage. Joshna Chinappa and Vaidehi Reddy were tamed in straight games by their formidable rivals in the womens singles, while Ritwik Bhattacharya gave a good fight to third seed Mohd Azlan Iskander of Malaysia in the mens singles before going down in five games.																								It was a similar story in judo, swimming and wrestling where the Indian participants failed to get past the initial rounds.																								The volleyball team also lost its first league match to South Korea going down in straight sets. (PTI)

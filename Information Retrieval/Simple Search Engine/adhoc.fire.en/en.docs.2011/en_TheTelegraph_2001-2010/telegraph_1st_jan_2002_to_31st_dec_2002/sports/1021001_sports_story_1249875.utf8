The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, October 01, 2002 				 Coach confined to the gallery
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Busan: Its no secret Stephen Constantine is a hard taskmaster and strict disciplinarian. So what did he tell his boys at half time after Bhaichung Bhutia and boys trooped to the dressing room having played some third-grade soccer?																								Would you like me to repeat it, the Englishman asked, speaking to a small group of newsmen who had just watched India come from behind to thrash Turkmenistan 3-1. The coach was in great spirits, despite being subjected to some gross humiliation by the tournament committee. 																								A letter from the Match Commissioner said Constantine couldnt sit with his team on the ground for Mondays match for misbehaving with the referee after Fridays game against Bangladesh.																								The letter was issued to the Indian contingent just 45 minutes before kick-off of the Turkmenistan match.																								They got more than a kick on their backside, the coach revealed about his half-time pep talk to the boys. I didnt tell them to change anything, just reminded them they needed to play football like its played.																								Asked about the new experience of watching his team play from the galleries, Constantine said it didnt matter in the end because the mission had been accomplished. In any case, there was the TD (Sukhwinder Singh) and assistant coach (Aloke Mukherjee) to help me communicate with the players.																								He made it a point to blast the ridiculous decision to ban him from the pitch. I cant believe they put me up there I didnt abuse the referee after the last match, I was just excited (for the stoppage-time red card flashed at Dipak Mondal).																								Coach and manager Santo Mitra said the Indians will be putting in a formal protest to the tournament committee.																								Bhutia was elated after the final whistle. All goals are important for me, I dont want to rank them. But yes, todays goals were very crucial for our team, so I am delighted, he said with more than a touch of modesty.

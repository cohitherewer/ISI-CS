																								Munich: Boris Becker must pay 3.2 million euros in tax arrears immediately or face a jail term, German weekly Focus reported on Sunday. 																								Becker, 34, would be required to pay the sum before his trial on tax evasion charges begins in Munich on October 23. Only then will the prosecutor and judge accept the plea agreement of a two-year suspended jail sentence.																								He is suspected of having failed to pay some 5.3 million euros in taxes from 1991-1993. He had said he lived in Monaco during that time but investigators claim his actual permanent residence was in Munich.																								Focus reported that Beckers lawyers were negotiating with tax authorities whether he would be required to pay an additional two million euros.																								Beckers brush with authorities is the latest in a series of setbacks since he retired in 1999 with more than $25 million in career earnings. (AFP)

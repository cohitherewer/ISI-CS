		 Monday, September 09, 2002 				 Buoyant Bagan leave for Lanka
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya with his wards at the club ground Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Calcutta: Buoyed by the arrival of Bhaichung Bhutia from the national camp, Mohun Bagan left for Colombo Sunday evening for the September 11 Asian Champions League tie against Sri Lankas Sanders.																								Coach Subrata Bhattacharya put the players through the paces at a brief training session in the morning before boarding the flight for Chennai, from where the team will proceed to Colombo.																								The coach said he didnt know anything about the rivals and a draw would not be a bad result, considering the second-leg match will be played at Salt Lake Stadium, where the players will enjoy the support of the home crowd.																								Even in case of a draw, I prefer a 1-1 scoreline rather than 0-0, since the away goal will become important if the teams are even after the two games, said Subrata. He added his team will start with focus on defence, keeping in mind the unknown factor.

		 Friday, August 30, 2002 				 Youhana back for Champions Trophy 
 (PTI)																								Islamabad: Yousuf Youhana was reinstated in the Pakistani squad Thursday, but not for the current tri-series in Kenya, following an apology tendered by the cricketer to skipper Waqar Younis.																								Youhana, who was expelled from the Pakistani squad in Nairobi following a fracas with Waqar, will play in the Champions Trophy next month.																								A compromise was reached during Youhanas meeting with Pakistan Cricket Board chief Tauqir Zia at Lahore Wednesday following which the batsman tendered an apology to his captain.																								Youhana, who had earlier denied any row with the skipper, admitted he indeed had an altercation with Waqar during Pakistans net session in Nairobi. Yes, I was involved in a verbal row with Waqar and after that things went from bad to worse, he said.																								Youhana said he refused to go for training when Waqar asked him to do so. I was doing individual training at the ground, but did not go for the nets because my shoulder was under treatment then, he said.																								Youhana said the verbal spat took place when the captain insisted that he follow the instructions and take part in the nets. In keeping with the PCB directive not to tolerate any indiscipline, the team management decided to send him back to Pakistan.

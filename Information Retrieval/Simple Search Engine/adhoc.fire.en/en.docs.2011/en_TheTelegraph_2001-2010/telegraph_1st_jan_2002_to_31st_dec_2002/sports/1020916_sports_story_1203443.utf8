		 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Barrichello leads Ferrari 1-2
																								Monza: Brazilian Rubens Barrichello led Michael Schumacher to a one-two win before a red sea of Ferrari fans in their home Italian Grand Prix on Sunday.																								An afternoon that had promised to belong to Williams and Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya turned into another day of Ferrari domination as Barrichello crossed the line 0.2 of a second ahead of Schumacher for his third win of the season.																								A tide of flag waving, flare-brandishing fans flooded the pit straight to acclaim their heroes and pay tribute in a season that has seen 13 Ferrari wins in 15 races.																								It was such a feeling, said Barrichello of his reception on the podium. It was unbelievable. As far as my eyes could see there were people. Amazing.																								Briton Eddie Irvine, a former Ferrari favourite and honorary Milanese, put the icing on the cake for the local Tifosi with an unexpected third place for Jaguar. (REUTERS)

		 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Johansson pulls out of US Open
 (AGENCIES)				 	 JOHANSSON: Sore right shoulder																								Stockholm: Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson withdrew from the US Open on Wednesday because of a sore right shoulder.																								I tried to serve the ball harder today, but it hurts so much. I cant play at 100 per cent, Johansson said after a 90-minute workout on a hardcourt outside Stockholm.																								The 27-year-old Johansson was injured during the Masters Series tournament in Toronto late last month. After losing his second-round match at the next Masters Series event in Cincinnati, he pulled out of another tournament in Indianapolis and returned to Sweden for rehabilitation and a medical examination conducted by the Swedish Davis Cup physician.																								I dont know yet if surgery will be necessary, Johansson said. Ive rested for two weeks. Well see.																								Missing the last major of the year is a big blow for Johansson. Hardcourt, which is the US Open surface, is the Swedes favourite.																								 He beat Marat Safin on a similar surface to win the Australian Open in January. Johansson reached the quarter finals twice at the US Open.																								Larsson may quit 																								Magnus Larsson could be playing his last US Open this year, the Swede said after clawing his way through to the second round of qualifying at the final Grand Slam of the year.																								Ive been on the tour since 1988-89. This might be my last year, he said after beating Peter Wessels of the Netherlands, 7-5, 6-4. But I still enjoy it. I still enjoy playing and enjoy travelling.																								Im slipping a little bit every year, the 32-year-old right-hander added. It bothers me now, playing in the qualifying, but Im not better than my ranking. You appreciate it much more being in the main draw.																								Once ranked as high as 10th in the world, Larsson has only qualified for six tournaments this year. He is currently listed at 158th. His 2002 record includes first round losses in his last three tournaments, including Wimbledon.																								I used to play on weekends in the semi-finals and finals, he said. Now Im playing the weekend before the finals in qualifying. Im a week ahead of schedule. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

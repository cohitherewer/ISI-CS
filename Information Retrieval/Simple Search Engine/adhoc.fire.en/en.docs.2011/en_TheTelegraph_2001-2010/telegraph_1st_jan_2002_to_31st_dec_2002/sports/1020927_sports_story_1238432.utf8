		 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Aussies worried over playing in Sharjah
																								Colombo: A week ahead of their first Test against Pakistan here, Australian players are talking about the dangers of playing the second and third Tests in Sharjah in the backdrop of US plans to attack Iraq.																								There was a bit of casual talk among the players about the dangers of travelling to the Middle East, Aussie coach John Buchanan was quoted as saying by the Melbourne Age website.																								The Test series, originally scheduled to be played in Pakistan, was agreed to be played in Colombo and Sharjah after Australia refused to tour Pakistan citing security reasons. 																								But Buchanan said the players would play in Sharjah if the Australian Cricket Board so advised.																								We will rely on the advice of the ACB and if they say it is fine to go, then we will go... I dont think we will be sent to places where they believe we are in danger, Buchanan said. 																								Australia will take on Pakistan in the first of the three Tests here starting on October 3. (PTI)

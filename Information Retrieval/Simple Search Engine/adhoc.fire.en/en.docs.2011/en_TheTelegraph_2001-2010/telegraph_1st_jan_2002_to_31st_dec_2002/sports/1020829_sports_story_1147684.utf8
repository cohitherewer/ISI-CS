		 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 Indians clinch a thriller
 (PTI) 																								London: Showing grit and determination, India snatched a three-wicket victory from the jaws of defeat in the first under-19 one-dayer against England at Bristol on Tuesday.																								Winning the toss and opting to bat, England made 265 for eight in 50 overs. In reply, India were tottering at 200 for seven before tailenders Kuldeep Rawat and Irfan Pathan saw them home with an unbroken 71-run partnership for the eighth wicket with five balls to spare.																								England seemed to have been rattled by Indias run in the last stretch as they missed two catches and also conceded 41 extras including five penalty runs. 																								Earlier, Kadeer Ali and P. Mustard put on 99 runs for the second wicket as England made a thumping start. J. G. E. Benning and K. W. Hogg kept the momentum going but after their dismissals Englands score was reduced from 208 for three to their eventual total.																								Brief scores: England 265 /8 in 50 ovs. (P. Mustard 45, Kadeer Ali 62, J. G. E. Benning 60; Pathan 2/56, Atram 2/40). India 268/7 in 49.1 ovs. (M. Bisla 35, A. Rayudu 34, K. Rawat 53 n.o., I. Pathan 42 n.o.; Plunkett 3/46, Wagg 2/67). India won by 3 wkts.

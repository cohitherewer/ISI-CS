Picture by Aranya Sen																								Calcutta: Manchester Commonwealth Games gold-medallist Mohammed Ali Qamar will train Bengals boxers for the national sub-junior meet to be held in the city from January 23. 																								According to the Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) vice-president Asit Banerjee: We plan to have Qamar for the boys in the last two weeks. We hope itll be a big boost for the boys.																								The young boxers are currently practising at the Netaji Indoor Stadium under Sujoy Guha.																								Incidentally, Qamar had an operation on his nose recently and is under rehabilitation. Banerjee said the session with the sub-junior pugilists would help Qamar to ease back into the game. 																								Meanwhile, talking about the meet, Banerjee said: Thirty-nine teams and Services, an affiliated unit, will take part. 																								He added that the first round would be held in Howrah while the semi-finals and finals would take place at the South Calcutta Physical Culture Association.																								In Howrah, new boxing rings have been made at the Anandamela ground, Shibpur Janakalyan Sangha and the Municipality grounds. Also, the South Calcutta Physical Culture ring has been renovated recently for the meet, Banerjee said.																								However, Banerjee lamented the fact that the IABFs attempt to have a meet for the sub-junior girls along with the boys didnt materialise. We tried to get the permission from the world body, but it couldnt be obtained, he said.																								Meanwhile, the official stamp for the meet was unveiled by renowned magician P.C. Sorcar Jr., his daughter Mumtaz and Bengal Olympic Association president Ashok Ghosh at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Tuesday.																								Five-nation meet																								Calcutta is likely to get a flavour of international boxing in the near future. The IABF has planned to host a five-nation boxing meet starting May 13 at the city. However, the teams for the meet havent been finalised.

																								Sydney: The world champion Australian team has become more of a Dads Army than England ever were, former Test batsman Doug Walters said Tuesday.																								Walters, who played his last Test in 1981 against India at the age of 36, believes the selection of 30-something players is threatening Australias dominance of cricket. Im not happy with the way that cricket is heading in Australia because were more Dads Army than England ever were and I see it getting a lot worse.																								The problem that we have is the structure of state cricket. Theyre all under contract and theyre getting 60 to 70 grand a year to play Sheffield Shield cricket, said Walters. Not many have a chance to go any further than Shield cricket and theyre clogging up the system.																								Theyre not going to retire and look for a real job and they keep the younger guys out. So as a result we now drop a 37-year-old bloke (Mark Waugh) and pick a 32-year-old bloke (Darren Lehmann).																								I dont think theres a lot of future in that sort of thing. The next in line are all approaching 30 apart from (Michael) Clarke but I dont think theres a lot of alternatives. Clarke is among a group of batsmen pressing for a call-up to the national side.

				 																																	Munich: Bayern Munichs goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was fined 10,000 euros by his club on Thursday for turning up at a disco last weekend when he was supposed to be recovering from injury.				 																																	The talismanic 33-year-old German was let off Bundesliga duty against Hannover with a strained thigh muscle, picked up in Bayerns 1-2 defeat away to AC Milan earlier in the week.				 																																	He played a round of golf on Friday afternoon at Baden-Baden near his home town of Karlsruhe before the costly visit to a nightclub later that evening. He told Kicker magazine: Ive had to pay 10,000 euros, and not the 50,000 reported in some quarters.				 																																	Melbourne: Victoria fast bowler Shane Harwood became only the third Australian to claim a hattrick on his first-class debut as the home side took control of a four-day match against Tasmania on Thursday. The 28-year-old from Ballarat in rural Victoria blasted through Tasmanias middle order, taking four for 49 from 14 overs, as the visitors reached 146 for seven at the close on day two at the MCG.				 																																	Resuming on their overnight 258 for five, Victoria made 353 for nine declared. In reply, Tasmania reached 108 for three before losing four quick wickets.				 																																	Harwood bowled Shane Watson for four and finished his 11th over by trapping Graeme Cunningham leg-before for a duck. Wicketkeeper Sean Clingeleffer was then bowled for nought with the first ball of Harwoods next over.				 																																	London: The first suspected case of nandrolone abuse by a professional English soccer player is being investigated by the Football Association.				 																																	The English FA said it was probing the case that appeared in a report to be published by UK Sports anti-doping programme on Thursday covering drug tests carried out between April and September this year.				 																																	FA spokesman Paul Newman refused to identify the player involved or give any more information about the case that has yet to be confirmed as a drug offence.				 																																	But soccer sources said it did not involve a player from the Premier League.				 																																	Santiago: Chilean soccers dire financial crisis took another twist on Wednesday when a judge ordered the 50,000-capacity stadium of bankrupt Colo Colo, the countrys most popular club, to be sold off.				 																																	The Monumental Stadium is the main asset of the club, which was declared bankrupt at the start of the year with debts of around $30,000 and which is under the administration of an auditor.				 																																	At the same time, players of Colo Colos arch-rivals Universidad de Chile threatened to go on strike over unpaid wages, little more than one month after the end of a nation-wide players strike which halted the Chilean championship for three weeks.				 																																	A judge involved in the Colo Colo case said the decision was made because a property company owned by Colo Colo owed $250,000 to a local businessman.				 																																	Manchester: Alex Ferguson has confirmed that Manchester United have opened negotiations with South African midfielder Quinton Fortune about a new four-year contract.				 																																	At the moment, we are re-negotiating with him for a new contract, hopefully for a four-year period, and that confirms our thoughts about the lad, the United manager told MUTV. Apart from the football thing, hes a fantastic ambassador for his country and himself.				 																																	Fortune has made just 26 starts for Manchester United in the four years since he signed from Atletico Madrid for 1.5 million. 				 																																	n Cricket, India vs West Indies: Final Test, Day III, live from 9.10 am on DD Sports n Football, Uefa Champions League: Liverpool vs Valencia from 9.30 am on ESPN n Football, English Premier League: Bolton Wanderers vs Sunderland, from 12.30 pm on STAR Sports

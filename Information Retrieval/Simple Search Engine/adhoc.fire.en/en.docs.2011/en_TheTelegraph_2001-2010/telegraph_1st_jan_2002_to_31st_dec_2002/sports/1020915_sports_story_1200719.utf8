																								Colombo, Sept. 14 (Reuters): South African captain Shaun Pollock said he will keep faith with his top-order batsmen despite a patchy performance in their opening Champions Trophy match against the West Indies.																								Pollock acknowledged his side got off to a less than ideal start to the pool III match on Friday as they slumped to 61 for three before rallying to claim a thrilling last-ball victory by two wickets. 																								Up front we need to get off to a good start, Pollock told reporters. Weve discussed it with the guys and we had some good discussions but sometimes things dont go for you.																								Thats not all of a sudden a reason to change your game-plan, to try and change again and panic.																								However, with the pitches in Sri Lanka looking similar, one way around the problem would be to use a pinch-hitter like Lance Klusener or Nicky Boje. I know the guys will come right, he said.

		 Tuesday, October 22, 2002 				 Sociedad take over from Celta Vigo
				 	 Tottenham Hotspurs Robbie Keane celebrates scoring against Bolton Wanderers in their Premier League match at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Tottenham won 3-1. (Reuters)																								London: Robbie Keane struck twice as Tottenham jumped to third in the Premier League in a 3-1 win over Bolton on Sunday. Charlton climbed away from last with a 1-0 triumph over Middlesbrough to leave Bolton at bottom.																								Keane gave Spurs a 58th minute lead and, although veteran French forward Youri Djorkaeff levelled five minutes later, the Irishman struck again in the 74th. Simon Davies, one of the heroes of Wales 2-1 Euro 2004 qualifying victory over Italy on Wednesday, added the third in the final minute. That result and Middlesbroughs loss pushed Spurs up from sixth to third, five points behind Liverpool and four behind north London neighbour Arsenal. 																								Real Sociedad will enjoy at least a week atop the Spanish top flight after a 2-2 draw at fellow Basques Alaves on Sunday proved enough for them to nudge a hapless Celta Vigo down into second place. Before the weekend, Celta had been ahead of Real Sociedad on goal difference, but the Galicians lost their unbeaten record when they went down 0-1 to visitors Rayo Vallecano.																								Alaves Martin Astudillo put the home side ahead after just five minutes. Sociedad drew level via Turkish midfielder Nihat Kahveci after 34 minutes. Sociedad then took the lead midway through the second half when Valery Karpin scored from a Darko Kovacevic pass. Alaves got their first point at home this season when Ruben Navarro scored four minutes before the whistle.																								Real Sociedad now lead the table with 14 points from six games, with Celta Vigo a point adrift.																								Against Celta, Rayos Bolo Perez scored after six minutes, heading home a Sergio Mora cross, and Madrids third club hung on despite the onslaught, which continued even after Celta were reduced to ten men.																								Real Betis went the Celta way and lost their unbeaten record after going down 0-1 to Real Mallorca after Alvaro Novos 32nd minute strike. 																								Barcelona continue to languish in the middle of the table after losing 1-2 at Valladolid. Rivaldo and Jon Dahl Tomasson scored their first Serie A goals and Andrea Pirlo added two second-half scores in a 4-1 win at Atalanta on Sunday, giving AC Milan a share of first place in Serie A with crosstown rival Inter Milan.																								The two Milan clubs sit atop the Italian league at 13 points following Saturday nights dramatic Italian Derby between Inter and defending champion Juventus that ended in a 1-1 draw after two last-minute goals. Elsewhere on Sunday, Bologna beat Roberto Baggios visiting Brescia 3-0 behind two scores from Argentine Julio Ricardo Cruz to move into second place. While in Rome, Lazio got two goals from veteran striker Enrico Chiesa to beat Perugia 3-0 to jump up to third.																								 Modena beat Parma 2-1 on 21 year-old French striker Diomansy Kamaras first Serie A score.																								In Bergamo, Milan went up 1-0 on Brazilian Rivaldos long blast that landed just inside the post 15 minutes in.																								After Atalanta defender Luigi Sala drew the hosts even at the half-hour mark, Tomasson made it 2-1 in the 41st minute. Pirlo added a penalty in the 66th after Portuguese international Manuel Rui Costa was taken down and then scored his third goal of the season on a free kick that bounced in off the crossbar in the 82nd.

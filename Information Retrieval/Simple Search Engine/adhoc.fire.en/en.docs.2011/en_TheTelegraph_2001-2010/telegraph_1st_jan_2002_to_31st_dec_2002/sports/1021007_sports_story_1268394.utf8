The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, October 07, 2002 				 Dravid role insult to our fraternity: Kiri
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 KIRMANI: Straight from the shoulder																								Bangalore: Ajay Ratra probably knew it was coming, yet looked devastated Saturday evening when word got around that Parthiv Patel had been preferred over him for the first two Tests against the West Indies.																								Ratra, however, can take heart from what Syed Kirmani said Sunday morning.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Indias finest wicketkeeper-ever minced absolutely nothing: Frankly, Parthiv should consider himself lucky... He has beaten somebody who is not only a fine keeper, but is more experienced... I feel very sorry for Ratra.																								Kirmani, who finished with 198 dismissals in 88 Tests between 1975-76 and 1985-86, added: Actually, I just cant understand the selectors approach towards the most specialised of all positions. This neglect hurts... Ratra is made to feel a veteran at 21 and, worse, our best batsman (Rahul Dravid) is made into a wicketkeeper in one-day cricket.																								God forbid, but if Dravid gets injured behind the stumps  and a non-regular keeper does run that risk  we will lose the mainstay of our batting. Moreover, if the first six batsmen cant get runs, its foolish to expect No. 7 to rescue the team. Whats happening is an insult to the fraternity of wicketkeepers.																								[While the Dravid-strategy had the previous selection committees endorsement, the present one has dumped Ratra.]																								Kirmani emphasised the best results come with the most pucca grooming. I could hold my own for a decade  in fact, I should have been given a longer run, but thats a different story  because I was groomed (as Farokh Engineers deputy) for four-five years. I wasnt suddenly thrown at the deep end of the sea.																								Look at Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher... With experience, they have been getting better each season... Having given Ratra a break in the West Indies (second Test, Port-of-Spain), our selectors should have been enhancing his confidence and allowing the younger Parthiv (17) to mature without too much pressure. An injury did give him two opportunities in England, but the teenager should now have been made to wait and learn.																								Kirmani continued: While I definitely dont wish to be harsh, its not that Parthiv is the most outstanding keeper around... When the difference is sirf unees-bees, go for the man with experience...																								As Kirmani is Bangalore-based, it would have been in order to involve him with the National Cricket Academy as full-time coach for wicketkeepers. Inexplicably, that hasnt been done and, in his view, quite a few of the youngsters look confused.																								As Kirmani explained: Thats because enough attention is not being paid  neither at the grassroots level nor at the very top.																								Asked what made a good keeper, Kirmani answered: Without a demo, the qualities cant be properly illustrated... Basically, a number of things must synchronise... And, yes, you should judge a wicketkeeper on how he performs standing up.																								Can keepers be made or must they be born naturals?																								Kirmani laughed for what seemed an eternity before replying: Look, in this age and time, everything can be made... Im sure there are some naturals around. Only, somebody must do a proper job of scouting... The work, of course, wont end there  the youngster(s) will have to be thoroughly groomed.																								While the Establishment continues to keep Kirmani at an arms length, for whatever reason, the one-time champion is keeping himself busy with quite a few things. Among others, Kirmani is involved with Saheli, an organisation which has taken the lead in organising a tournament  Voice of the Voiceless  for the boys of local slum-dwellers.																								Ive donated the trophy... In time, I could get involved in a bigger way. Ill be happy if I can be of some benefit to somebody somewhere, Kirmani signed off.

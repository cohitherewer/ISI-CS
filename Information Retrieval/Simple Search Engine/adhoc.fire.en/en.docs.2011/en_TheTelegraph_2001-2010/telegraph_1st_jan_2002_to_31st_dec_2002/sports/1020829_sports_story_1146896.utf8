		 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 A costly spat with skipper
 (AGENCIES)				 	 Youhana: No replacement named																								Karachi: Pakistan middle-order batsman Yousuf Youhana said Wednesday that his premature return from Kenya was due to shoulder and back injury, not because of differences with the captain and management.																								Officials had said the right-hand batsman was sent home from Kenya, where the Pakistan team is due to feature in a triangular one-day series from Thursday, for a disciplinary violation. 																								Youhana, who had earlier refused to comment on the matter, said that his return was due to a misunderstanding between himself and captain Waqar Younis.																								It was all a misunderstanding because I was getting treatment for my shoulder and back injury from the team doctor when the captain called me to the nets and he (Waqar) thought I did not comply with his orders, he said after a meeting with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief, Lieutenant General Tauqir Zia.																								Youhana, who turned 28 Tuesday, said it was a huge disappointment to be missing an important series.																								But he rejected concerns his career would be halted because of the incident, and said it would be up to the PCB to select him in future. 																								If I have done anything wrong, I apologise for that and I respect all my seniors and am always ready to play for my country. The PCB chairman was not angry and listened to my side of the story, Youhana said.																								Pakistan take on world champions Australia and hosts Kenya in a double-league, tri-series one-day tournament, an event shifted from Karachi because of security fears. 																								Meanwhile, PCB chief Zia played down the issue saying it should have been sorted out then and there.																								I am told that Youhana disobeyed the doctor and the captain, but my personal view is that it was not a big issue and should have been sorted out in Kenya, Zia said.																								PCB sympathetic																								I have given full authority to the team management to send back home any offender, but this has been blown out of proportion and I will talk to manager Yawar Saeed.																								Youhana would not go back to Nairobi now, but would be considered for future events, he said. The PCB said they would not send any replacement.

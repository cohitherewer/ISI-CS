The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, September 01, 2002 				 India to field full team today
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Aug. 31: India will field their full team in the second and final international friendly against Jamaica XI on their tour of England Sunday. India lost the opening game 0-3 Thursday, against the same opposition.																								All the top players are available for tomorrows match and we are hoping for a better show, technical director of the Indian team, Sukhwinder Singh, told The Telegraph over telephone from Wolverhampton Saturday. 																								Debjit Ghosh is thus set to feature in the starting line-up. Jo Paul Ancheri will also be back in action. Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, who injured his knee just hours before the first match, is fit now and will replace Sangram Mukherjee under the bar. Rajat was adjudged best goalkeeper of the six-nation meet in Vietnam earlier this month. Abhishek Yadav will start with captain Bhaichung Bhutia upfront.																								Though India conceded three goals to Jamaica Thursday, Sukhwinder emphasised the scoreline was not a proper reflection of the Indian performance.																								The margin of our loss was misleading. We played quite well one of the goals we conceded was through a dubious penalty, Sukhwinder maintained. He was happy with the way the young team fought against the experienced Jamaicans. 																								It was learnt that chief coach Stephen Constantine was not happy with the defence and a reshuffle is on the cards. He rested some of the leading players Thursday. Coach and his wards, meanwhile, went to watch the local league match between Coventry and Nottingham Forest this afternoon.

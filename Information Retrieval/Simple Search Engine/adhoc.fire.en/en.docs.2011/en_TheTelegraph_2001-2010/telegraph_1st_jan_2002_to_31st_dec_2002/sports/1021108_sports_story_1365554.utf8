The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 08, 2002 				 SA pitch for revenge
																								Johannesburg: South Africa and Sri Lanka have starkly differing objectives as they go into the first Test starting at the Wanderers on Friday.																								While the South Africans have made it clear that all cricket this season is geared towards winning next years World Cup, Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya has more immediate goals in mind.																								Its really great to be able to play five ODIs in South Africa with the World Cup coming up, Jayasuriya said. But our emphasis is the Test matches because we have never done well here.																								Although Sri Lankas batsmen have prospered in their two warm-up matches, both were on the flat batting tracks in Kimberley and Lenasia. South Africa are thirsting for revenge after the itinerary handed to them on their last tour of Sri Lanka just over two years ago.																								Having warmed up on seaming wickets, Shaun Pollocks team played the first Test at spin friendly Galle and were thrashed, with Muttiah Muralidharan taking 13 for 171. South Africa aim to employ exactly the same plan on home territory  but in reverse.																								The track at the Wanderers will retain all the characteristics of the green mamba which saw England reduced to two for four during their last tour. The toss could therefore be crucial, and if Sri Lanka find themselves asked to bat first, they are likely to undergo a stern test.																								South Africa have the option of going into the game with five seamers, with Steve Elworthy likely to be recalled for his first Test after three years. His lower order ability with the bat would also strengthen the South African batting.																								Elworthys inclusion in the squad of 13 would appear to be a short term move in a South African season entirely focused upon winning the World Cup for the first time. Every Test match and every Test series is obviously important, but this is World Cup year and were not pretending that everything isnt focused around that, said Herschelle Gibbs.																								This is the Sri Lankans third tour since South Africas readmission to the game and they have yet to win a Test.

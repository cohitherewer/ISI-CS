The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, September 14, 2002 				 No logo on Indian shirts 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The Indian cricketers will take the field for their opening ICC Champions Trophy match against Zimbabwe in Colombo Saturday without any logo on their shirts.																								The ICC on Thursday had communicated to the BCCI that its clearance of the new logo Subrata  named after Sahara chairman Subrata Roy  was subject to deletion of the winged graphic impressions. 																								Sahara rejected the ICC proposal, saying the portion of the logo with orange and greeen strokes represented Indian flag colours and are a matter of national pride.																								As of now, this is applicable to only the opening game of the tournament. But if the sponsor row with the ICC is not resolved, it could extend to the whole tournament, said a senior BCCI official.

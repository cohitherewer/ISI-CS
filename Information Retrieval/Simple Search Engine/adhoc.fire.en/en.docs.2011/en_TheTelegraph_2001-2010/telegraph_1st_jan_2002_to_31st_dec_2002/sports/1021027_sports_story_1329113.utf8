The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, October 27, 2002 				 SA top order in run-scoring spree 
				 	 Gary Kirsten en route to his unbeaten 154 on Day II of the final Test against Bangladesh in Potchefstroom on Saturday. (AFP) 																								Potchefstroom, Oct. 26 (Reuters): Gary Kirsten extended his own South African record with a 16th century as the home team dominated day two of the second Test against Bangladesh Saturday.																								Kirsten was 154 not out as South Africa reached stumps on 414 for two  a first-innings lead of 199.																								It was a profitable day for the rest of the top order, with hundreds for both Herschelle Gibbs (114) and Jacques Kallis, who was unbeaten on 107.																								The Bangladeshis bowled with discipline but lacked the penetration required at Test level.																								There are few players better equipped to accumulate steadily against a weak attack than Kirsten and the left-hander was content to find the gaps and wait to hit the bad ball to the boundary.																								His innings was chanceless and by the close he had been at the crease just under six hours, facing 219 balls and striking 17 fours and a six.																								Kallis owed his century to a slice of good fortune. He was on 36 when the Bangladeshis went up for a concerted appeal for caught behind off Sanwar Hossain which was turned down by umpire Russell Tiffin. Television replays indicated the bowler had been unlucky.																								Kallis took full advantage, bludgeoning his way to his tenth Test century. By the close he had struck 13 fours and a six in a three-and-a-half-hour stay during which he faced 190 deliveries.																								Earlier, Gibbs and Kirsten totally dominated the morning session, adding 117.																								The bowler to really suffer was off-spinner Hossain, who was twice lofted over the mid-wicket boundary by Gibbs, and then struck for six more over mid-on by Kirsten. It was just the seventh six in 85 Test matches struck by the left-hander.

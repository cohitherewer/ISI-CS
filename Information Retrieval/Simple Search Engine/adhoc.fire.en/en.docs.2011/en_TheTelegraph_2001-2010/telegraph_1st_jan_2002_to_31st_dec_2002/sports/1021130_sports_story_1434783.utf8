The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Dalmiya may interact with seniors in city
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta: With the Indian cricketers departure for New Zealand rescheduled from here, early Sunday, Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya may interact with a couple of seniors on the Player Terms for the 2003 World Cup.																								This opportunity, of course, wouldnt have arisen had the departure been from New Delhi, as earlier scheduled, late Saturday.																								Now, the Sourav Ganguly-led team will be boarding a Royal Brunei flight to Singapore en route to coach John Wrights homeland.																								Apparently, a move to advance the teams (original) departure by a day was shot down both by the players and the Board. Just as well, one could add. 																								While Dalmiya himself wasnt available for comment, a well-placed source told The Telegraph it wouldnt surprise if he actually had a closed-door meeting with Sourav, vice-captain Rahul Dravid and senior pro Sachin Tendulkar.																								But if thats not confirmed, what is certain is that Dalmiya will personally see off the team. Its a gesture which should go down well.																								Incidentally, the ICCs high-powered committee (of which Dalmiya is a member) exclusively dealing with the contentious Terms had another tele-conference Friday afternoon.																								Nothing concrete has emerged.

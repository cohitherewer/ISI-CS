The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, October 30, 2002 				 Best way to counter pressure is to focus on what you are expected to do: Sourav
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Sourav Ganguly at the Eden Tuesday. (Reuters)																								The demands on Indias most happening captain are far too many to be counted. From inaugurations to felicitations to honouring commitments of personal sponsors  not to speak of plotting Team Indias strategy  Sourav Ganguly has little time to spare. The captain, however, did make himself available to The Telegraph for some 45 minutes on the eve of the third and final Test.																								The following are excerpts																								On his earliest cricket-related memory																								Going to the Eden, as a four-year-old during the 1976 Test against England, and crying when asked to pose with Tony Greig! I was petrified.																								On whether he actually nursed an ambition																								Not that I can remember Of course, being blessed with everything, by Gods grace, I was a happy child.																								On whether, coming from a family deeply into business, his love for sport (cricket and soccer) was frowned upon																								No My father (Chandi), for one, was associated with the CAB and, then, my brother (Snehashish) was already into cricket. Father, especially, was keen I be involved with sport  initially, I was obsessed with soccer. (Adds laughing) Except tending to the goal, I probably played in all positions 																								On what prompted him to focus full-time on cricket																								Being selected and doing well for the India colts against Pakistan (1989-90) 																								On his probable vocation had he not made it big in cricket																								Difficult to say The family business, perhaps I was quite good at studies and, so, could even have taken up a job somewhere.																								On being the unconventional sort																								But, then, what exactly is being conventional? Also, who defines what is unconventional?																								On quietly marrying Dona, despite opposition from both families																								(Laughs again) Doesnt make me a rebel																								On whether he would be conscious about having had a most comfortable upbringing																								Wouldnt ever compare Never thought of myself as being privileged or whatever.																								On what money means to him																								Security Its important and I wont pretend it isnt. At the same time, I dont have an extravagant lifestyle.																								On whether he finds time for charitable causes																								Though Im associated with a few organisations, our hectic schedule comes in the way of devoting much time Specifically, my wife and I are closely involved with an NGO project for homeless mothers and children Weve been doing our bit for a couple of years.																								On whether our cricketers should be doing more for the underprivileged																								Look, quite a few of us are involved with charities Sachin, Rahul, Anil In their own way, somebody or the other is doing something.																								On how he would describe himself																								Its tough, dont think I can Im not the outgoing type I learn from experiences As Ive said, its a difficult one to answer. 																								On his inspiration outside cricket																								Pete Sampras His attitude, the quality of his play His ability to fight back the heaviest of odds Even if Sampras doesnt add to 14 Grand Slam titles, he will remain a great sportsman.																								On the most inspirational cricketer																								Steve Waugh I have the highest regard and was very happy when he got that hundred (28th) in Sharjah last week Under pressure, it was another brilliant knock I can only endorse Steves observation that statistics dont always tell the full story.																								On what he has learnt from Sampras and Steve																								Never to give up.																								On what cricket has taught him																								That sport is such a leveller Ive seen the highs and lows The on-field experiences have helped make me a better person Its been an extraordinary education.																								On being a calmer captain now																								(Smiles) Its easier when the teams doing well, thats when a captain is more in control Thats when he comes through as being calm. Also, I suppose (daughter) Sanas birth has made a difference In some ways, Ive changed.																								On being conscious about averages																								I was, at one time, but realised that put pressure Today, Im not unduly taken up by averages.																								On what helped him get over that slump in 2001																								The conviction that it would only be a phase, that I would emerge stronger Of course, as you must have seen yourself, I worked very hard too. If you ask me, self-belief makes a huge difference. 																								On destiny																								Plays a role, yes, but it would be foolish to leave everything to destiny. You cant, for instance, merely talk of something being destined to happen  youve also got to work towards it.																								On being religious																								Thats the way Ive been brought up Every puja, for example, is a big affair at home An extension is that on Tuesdays and Saturdays Im a vegetarian.																								On handling criticism																								Criticism is perfectly okay if its fair and not personal. If it isnt, then Really, one cant tolerate crap and vindictive criticism.																								On one-time critics embracing him																								I cant answer why people change (After a pause) As for me, Im not the sort to wake up thinking I ought to have done something differently the previous evening. 																								On whether chartbusters alone help him unwind																								Theres Sana and (niece) Sneha When Im with them, I switch off cricket When I switch back on, Im fresh. Off the field, they remain my focus.																								On whether the lack of much privacy is a high price for stardom																								At times, it does get difficult One does miss doing certain things though. Just the other day, I could stop at an ill-lit corner in New Alipore and help myself to puchkas. 																								On his advice on handling pressure																								Once you are exposed to pressure day in and day out, you actually get used to it Becomes part of your system Indeed, the best way of countering pressure is to focus on what you are expected to do.																								On the chemistry between him and the states chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee																								(Smiles again) Well, Buddhababu has an enormous interest in cricket While I obviously dont know much about politics, its pretty apparent that Buddhababu is determined to make Bengal a better place Our state needs somebody like him.																								Finally, on chances of doing an Imran Khan																								Absolutely none I dont have the mental make-up of a politician.

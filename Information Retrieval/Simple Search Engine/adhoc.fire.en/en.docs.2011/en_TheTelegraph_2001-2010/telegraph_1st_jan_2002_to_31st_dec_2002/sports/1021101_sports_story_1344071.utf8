The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 01, 2002 				 India No. 5 on one-day list
																								London: In stark contrast to the recent performances of the two teams, India have been placed one rung below Pakistan, in fifth place, in the first official one-day International rankings unveiled by the International Cricket Council Thursday.																								Test champions Australia top the list with 128 points followed by South Africa (120), Sri Lanka (117) and Pakistan (115).																								India, who have won 13 of their last 18 one-day matches, secured 106 points.																								Announcing the rankings at a news conference, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said Indias form this year was much better than last year and they could improve their rankings.																								In addition to recognising the relative status of each ODI team, the new ICC Championship table will place every future one-day International match in a wider context.																								Now the result of every one of the 120 or so matches that will be played between the 11 ODI countries over the next 12 months will count towards a countrys rating. This will add a new dimension to the playing side of the game and contribute towards greater spectator interest, Speed said.

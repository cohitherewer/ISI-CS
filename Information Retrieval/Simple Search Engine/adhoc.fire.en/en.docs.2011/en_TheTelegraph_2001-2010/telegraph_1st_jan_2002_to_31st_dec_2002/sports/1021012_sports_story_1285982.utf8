		 Saturday, October 12, 2002 				 IOA officials did nothing: Santo Mitra
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 11: The Indian participants are having a good time at the Asian Games after some time, but the performance of the officials accompanying the contingent in Busan has been far from ideal.																								Football manager Santo Mitra, who returned here Thursday, is still bitter about the experience. There were more than 50 Indian Olympic Association (IOA) officials in Busan, to look after the squads, and they did nothing, said Mitra Friday.																								Be it a vehicle to go to watch a match, or a doctor to treat an injured player, nothing was in place. Plenty of doctors and many more officials were flown to Busan, none were available when we needed them.																								Mitra said there would rarely be anybody at the temporary IOA office and even when someone was found, it hardly mattered because the work was not done. Too many unnecessary people and nobody is accountable, thats the problem, said Mitra.

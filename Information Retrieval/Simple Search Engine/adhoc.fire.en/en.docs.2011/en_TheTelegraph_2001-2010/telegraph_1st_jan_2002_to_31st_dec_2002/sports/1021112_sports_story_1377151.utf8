The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, November 12, 2002 				 2 points only for outright win
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The BCCI has changed the points rule for Ranji Trophy. According to new regulations, taking effect this season, teams will get lesser points for an outright win, incomplete match or first innings lead, but would be get bonus points for an innings victory.																								An outright win, from now, will fetch only two points against eight earlier, CAB secretary Bablu Koley quoted from a BCCI circular here Monday. 																								The following are the new points system highlights:																								n Two points only for outright win (against 8 earlier).																								n No point if first innings of both sides remain incomplete (against three points for each team earlier). 																								n First innings lead: Only one point (down from five). The side conceding the lead will not get any point (against three till last season).																								n For innings victory: Winner to get one bonus point.																								Ignorance of the new system created a problem at the Eden Monday. At the Bengal-Rajasthan Ranji match neither the umpires nor the teams had any idea of the new points system.																								At stumps Monday, with the rain coming down and the weather forecast for the next day not good, the Bengal camp wanted to know what the fate of the match would be if no play was possible on the final day. The umpires didnt have any answer. 																								One good thing about the rule is that no team can just play out the match, not go for a result and walk away with points, Bengal coach Sambaran Banerjee said.

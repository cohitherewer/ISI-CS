The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, December 04, 2002 				 Bopanna knocks out top seed
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Rohan Bopanna created a quite a flutter at the $25,000 Bangkok Challenger on Tuesday.																								According to information received here, the big-serving 23-year-old tossed out top seed Hyung Taik-lee 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in the first round. Lee, runner-up to Paradorn Srichaphan at the Busan Asian Games, is ranked No. 86 in the world.																								This is easily Bopannas biggest career win, all the more creditable because he was a wild-card entrant. Ironically, he hasnt yet been granted a wild card for the December 30-January 5 Tata Open in Chennai.																								It will strengthen Bopannas claim for a Davis Cup singles berth in the tie versus Japan in Delhi from February 7-9.																								Its the first time since Leander Paes singles heydays that an Indian has scalped a top-100 player at the Tour level. 																								Paes, it may be recalled, ousted Marc Rosset and Pete Sampras the same week in 1998, as also Wayne Ferreira and Roger Federer the next season.

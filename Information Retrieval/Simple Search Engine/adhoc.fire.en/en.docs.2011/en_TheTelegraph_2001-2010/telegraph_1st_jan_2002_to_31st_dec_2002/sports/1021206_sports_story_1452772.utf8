				 																																	Brussels: Kim Clijsters is considering becoming an Australian citizen to spare her from the clutches of the Belgian taxman, according to Belgian media reports.				 																																	Kim has never said she wanted to become an Australian (citizen). On the contrary she has always said she was and will remain Belgian, her father Leo Clijsters was quoted as saying by local media on Wednesday.				 																																	But as her manager I have to look at all options. We cant dismiss this without studying it carefully.				 																																	Asked about reports that Clijsters was considering Australian citizenship, Australias Federal Department of Immigration said: We cant confirm or deny that. For privacy reasons we cant comment on any case like that.				 																																	Tokyo: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis is set to play at the $1.3 million Pan Pacific Open early next year, tournament organisers said on Thursday.				 																																	The 22-year-old Swiss, who said in October that she would take an indefinite break from tennis after a poor run of results following ankle surgery, is scheduled to make her comeback at the Australian Open in January.				 																																	Hingis, listed among the official entries for the January 13-26 Grand Slam event in Melbourne, is the defending champion at the Pan Pacific Open, which gets under way on January 28 at Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.				 																																	Colarado Springs: American anti-doping agency USADA said Thursday that it had suspended Greco-Roman wrestler Tipton Peterson for two years after he tested positive for banned anabolic substances earlier this year. 				 																																	The suspension would be counted from August 8, the date laboratory tests reported the results, the USADA, said in a statement. 				 																																	Peterson, 28, first tested positive for testosterone at the world team championships in June in St Paul, Minnesota where he placed fourth in the 96 kilogram (210 pound) weight division but has since been disqualified. 				 																																	Los Angeles: Australias Ian Thorpe and Natalie Coughlin of the US have been named the male and female World Swimmers of the Year by Swimming World magazine.				 																																	This is the second time in a row and fourth time in the last five years that Thorpe has earned the prestigious award, making him the first swimmer to win the award four times.				 																																	It is the first time that Coughlin has received the award. The two were selected by a panel of 12 international swimming writers. 				 																																	Rio de Janeiro: Santos, regarded as one of the best teams since their Pele-inspired heydays of the 1960s, survived a vicious second leg to overcome Gremio on aggregate on Wednesday and reach the Brazilian championship final.				 																																	Gremio won the semi-final second leg 1-0 in Porto Alegre but Santos went through 3-1 on aggregate and now face Corinthians.				 																																	Antwerp: Jonathon Power, the only North American to win a major squash championship, has warned that he intends to win back the World Open which starts in Antwerp on Friday.				 																																	The 28-year-old has already managed one important coup this year by taking away Peter Nicols Commonwealth title in Manchester.				 																																	n Soccer: English Premier League West Ham United vs Southampton from 2.30pm on ESPN n Spanish League highlights 2002/03 from 10.30pm on STAR Sports n Cricket: 5th ODI South Africa vs Sri Lanka from 1755 on ESPN n Sachin Tendulkar programming from 9.30pm on STAR Sportsn Real Madrid captain Fernando Hierro arrives in Madrid Wednesday after defeating South American champions Olimpia of Paraguay in the World Club Cup in Yokohama.

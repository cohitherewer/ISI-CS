		 Friday, October 04, 2002 				 Ponting slams 141
				 	 Ricky Ponting after his century in Colombo Thursday. (AFP)																								Colombo: Ricky Ponting hammered 141 and put on 183 for the second wicket with Justin Langer as Australia closed the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan on 330 for five Thursday.																								But there was disappointment for skipper Steve Waugh. Attempting to re-establish his authority after being replaced by Ponting as captain of the one-day team, he fell for 31 to off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq.																								His twin brother Mark made 55, becoming only the third Australian to go past 8,000 runs before he also fell to Mushtaq.																								Australia began with a wobble as opener Matthew Hayden was caught by Imran Nazir for four off fast bowler Waqar Younis in the first over of the day after Langer had been dropped in the gully off the very first ball.																								But Ponting and Langer quickly settled into a rapid rhythm, scoring at five an over against Pakistans pace bowlers.																								Langer hit 10 boundaries in his 76 before he was caught behind off all rounder Abdul Razzaq.																								For Ponting, it was his 11th Test century, completed with a boundary clipped through mid-wicket off Razzaq. His runs came off just 163 deliveries, including 92 in fours. In all, Australia hit 190 runs in boundaries, Steve Waugh contributing the one six of the day.																								Pakistans bowlers conceded 138 runs for just one wicket before lunch. Only 77.2 overs were possible before bad light ended play. (REUTERS)

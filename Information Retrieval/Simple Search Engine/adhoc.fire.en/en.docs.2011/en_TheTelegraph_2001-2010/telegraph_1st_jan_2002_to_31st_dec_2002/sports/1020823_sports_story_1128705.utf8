Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Calcutta: This years The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship has proved to be one of the most closely fought editions ever. Even after the eighth round there are four players on 7 points each, still jostling at the top for the coveted title. Two more follow with 6.5 points each. 																								Unlike in the past, most of the top players in the meet  organised by Alekhine Chess Club and presented by Horlicks  prefer to fight it out rather than settle for short, insipid draws.																								Top seed Joydeep Dutta of Kumar Ashutosh Institution got the better of Mary Ann Gomes of Frank Correa Academy after a protracted struggle. Mary Ann, playing White, opted for the Catalan set up against Joydeep and obtained a positional superiority from the opening.But she erred in severe time pressure and allowed Joydeep to effectively utilise his two rooks and lost.																								Debaditta Sinha Biswas of Salt Lake Point School decided to adopt the advanced variation against the French defence of Saurav Chakraborti of St James. Debaditta sacrificed a pawn in the opening in return for a promising position but went astray and allowed Saurav a passed pawn in the centre which led to his downfall.																								Second seed Debayan Majumdar of St James fell to Baishaki Das of Jamshedpur.

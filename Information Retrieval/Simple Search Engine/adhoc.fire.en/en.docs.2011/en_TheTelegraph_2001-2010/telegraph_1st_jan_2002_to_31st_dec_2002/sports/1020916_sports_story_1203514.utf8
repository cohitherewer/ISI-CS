The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Athletes ready for chill-out zone
				 	 EL GUERROUJ: Over to jet skis																								Paris: Marion Jones says shes going to hang up her spikes and not watch athletics on TV. The worlds best 1,500m runner dreams of zooming around on his jet-ski. Felix Sanchez, king of the 400m hurdles, just wants to chill.																								As the 2002 season drew toward a close with Sundays Grand Prix final here, the worlds best athletes looked forward to resting their finely honed bodies during a winter lay-off ahead of next years crucial world championship season.																								I will not come near any track at all, said Jones, undefeated over 100 m this season. I will not watch any track and field on TV and surely not wear my running shoes.																								French sprinter Muriel Hurtis agreed. I want to have a complete break, she said. I dont want to step onto the track, not even put on a pair of sneakers.																								Sanchez, the Dominican dominant this season in 400 m hurdles, plans to just take it easy for a couple of months before preparing for next years Pan-American Games, to be held on his home turf, and the World Championships in Paris. I wont travel and will not get up early in the morning, he said.																								One person who, it appears, badly needs a breather is Maurice Greene. The 100m Olympic and world champion pulled out of the Paris meet, citing fatigue. By his high standards, Greene had a disappointing season, defeated repeatedly by rivals he usually leaves in his tracks.																								Hes been on top for more than five years... His body needed a rest, said fellow -American Tim Montgomery, among those who beat Greene this season. He might still be recovering from his past efforts. But I have the feeling that he will be ready next season.																								For Hicham el Guerrouj, the 1,500m world record holder, home and the sea beckoned. I want to go back to Morocco, see my family, do some jet-skiing and play golf. I must escape the routine of running every morning and evening, so I can find the energy to begin again next year. (AP)

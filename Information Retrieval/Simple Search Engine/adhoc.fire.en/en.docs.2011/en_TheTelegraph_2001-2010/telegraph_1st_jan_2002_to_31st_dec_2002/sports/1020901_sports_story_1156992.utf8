		 Sunday, September 01, 2002 				 Roddick to the rescue
																								New York, Aug. 31 (AFP): Andy Roddick rescued a young boy from possible serious injury by autograph seekers on Friday after winning his second round match at the US Open.																								On his 20th birthday, the 11th seeded American began signing autographs for fans who gathered near the fence along the court level at the Louis Armstrong Stadium, where he defeated Dutchman Raemon Sluiter 6-2, 6-4, 6-4.																								Roddick and a security guard saw a young boy being jostled and pushed by older patrons in the surge to get within range of Roddick, so together they pulled the boy out of the pile to safety. 																								Roddick gave the upset boy a souvenir to calm him.																								I literally saw the kid take about three elbows to the face, Roddick said. That didnt shake him. It was rough. 																								He was getting beaten up pretty good. I didnt sign too long. I dont think it was safe for the kids in front.																								Roddick was stunned at the crush to get his signature.																								I dont really understand it but its normal, he said. They want to get an autograph and push to the front. It makes for a little bit of a dangerous situation sometimes.

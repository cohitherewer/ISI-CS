		 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Klinsmann backs Sheringham 
																								London: Former German international Juergen Klinsmann believes 36-year-old Teddy Sheringham should still be playing for England and could even help them win the next World Cup.																								Klinsmann is back in town to play for Tottenham on Thursday in a benefit game against American team DC United to raise money for former Spurs heroes.																								Klinsmann, who won the World Cup with Germany in 1990, said on Wednesday: I spent 90 minutes on the training ground with Teddy and he looks like he is 21 again.																								I would expect to see him in Portugal 2004 and would love to see him in the World Cup in Germany in 2006.																								Sheringham said a month ago he still had hopes of adding to his 51 England caps. He made four appearances as a substitute at the World Cup this year but has not featured since.																								Klinsmann said: Teddy is a special player, unlike any other of his generation. He could fit into any team on the continent or play at the top in Italy because of his style and certainly I can see him playing at the highest level for a few more years.																								Hes a very smart player with great vision and awareness of his team mates and can play great passes. No one else is like that in England. 																								Klinsmann retired after his second stint at Spurs in 1998 and moved to America following that years World Cup.																								He insists he has no regrets about retiring when he did, adding: It was the right time to stop because I wanted to spend more time with my young family.																								But this match is for a great cause and it will give me great pleasure to play again at White Hart Lane where I have had so many great memories.																								Klinsmann will play in a team of former Spurs greats including Glenn Hoddle, Chris Waddle, David Ginola and Paul Gascoigne. Gascoigne had trials with DC United earlier this year.  (REUTERS)

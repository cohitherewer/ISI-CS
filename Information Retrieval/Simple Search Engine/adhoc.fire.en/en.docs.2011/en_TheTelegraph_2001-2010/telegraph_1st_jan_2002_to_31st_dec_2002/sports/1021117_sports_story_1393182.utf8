The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, November 17, 2002 				 There should only be one players body:Kapil 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 KAPIL: Should cater to grassroots also																								Calcutta, Nov. 16: Kapil Dev feels that the cricketers association should cater to players even at the grassroots level.																								Kapil was head of the players body formed in 1989  the Association of Indian Cricketers (AIC)  and there have been efforts to revive it after the newly-formed Indian Cricket Players Association (ICPA) came into being. He, however, feels, that there should only be one body looking after the players interests.																								It will be silly to have two associations. One can always merge with the other since the objective is to look after the cricketers and not just Test players, said Kapil, who was in the city to take part in Gully Cricket, Sony Maxs promotional series for the World Cup. 																								The association should go to the grassroots level and even cricketers on the streets should be got involved, he said.The former India skipper said it was sad that the AIC could not continue.																								On Ashok Malhotras questions regarding the AIC, Kapil said: Of late, Ive been reading a lot about this in the newspapers, but Im not aware of anything. Though I was the president, I dont know exactly what happened and I have to ask the concerned people. 																								Kapil hailed Indias victory over the West Indies in Ahmedabad on Friday as fantastic.																								This team has played extremely well. Now we can dream a little more about winning the World Cup. But they must improve their fielding and running between the wickets, he said.																								On the one-dayers increasingly becoming a nightmare for the bowlers, he said: The problem with bowlers in one dayers is that they do not get the chance to experiment with the ball much, only try to contain the batsmen. 																								But this is quite natural, because bowlers are afraid that if, for example, they go for swinging the ball, the umpires may end up calling it a wide. So, the captains always ask them to bowl straight and up to the batsmen.																								He praised the Indians ability to chase big targets successfully, adding: They have been doing it frequently and if this trend continues, then some day some side may reach 400.																								He felt the current set of players were much stronger. They hit sixes like anything. Even (Sanjay) Bangar hit an overboundary over point. One reason could be the heavy bats they use these days.

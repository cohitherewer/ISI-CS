																								Mumbai: Nishit Shetty slammed 123 off 207 balls and put on 164 runs for the sixth wicket with Vinayak Samant (54 off 146 balls) to help former champions Mumbai take a 132-run first innings lead over Bengal on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy group A match here Monday.																								In their second innings Bengal had made 138 for seven by stumps with Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Ranadeb Bose batting on 20 and 8, respectively.																								The hosts, resuming at 231 for five, found both the overnight not out batsmen  Shetty and Samant  in very good nick. The two added 164 runs off 46.5 overs with Shetty hitting as many as 18 fours. Samant was caught and bowled by Bengal skipper Rohan Gavaskar.																								The Mumbai innings came to an end 16 minutes before lunch for 322 off 12.1 overs with Robin Morris also chipping in with a quick 21. Spinner Utpal Chatterjee took four for 43 while Shukla got three for 67 for Bengal.																								Bengal fared pretty poorly in the second innings as well and were staring at an innings defeat losing six wickets for 95 runs off 47.1 overs before some bold hitting by Shukla (20 batting) and Chatterjee (17 off 19 balls with two fours) helped them finish the day at 138 for seven off 61 overs.

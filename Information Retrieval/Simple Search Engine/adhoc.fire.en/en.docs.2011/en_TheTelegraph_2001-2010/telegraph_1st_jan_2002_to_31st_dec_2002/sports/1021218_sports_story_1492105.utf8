		 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 England end drought with win over Lanka
				 	 STEWART: 64 from 61 balls																								Brisbane: Half-centuries by Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart and an improved allround bowling performance helped England break a 14-match run without victory and beat Sri Lanka by 43 runs on Tuesday.																								It is the first time since they began their Australian tour two months ago that Hussains side have won. Their last victory was over Zimbabwe in the Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka on September 18.																								Hussain made 79 off 106 and Man of the Match Stewart 64 from 61 deliveries to take English to a daunting total of 292 from their 50 overs.																								Englands bowlers then responded with their best performance of an otherwise disastrous tour to restrict the Sri Lankans to 249 for six with only Mahela Jayawardene (71) and Russel Arnold unbeaten on 60 offering any real resistance.																								After being thumped by the Australians over the past two months, the English found the going a little easier against a Sri Lankan team making its first appearance in the triangular one-day series and without strike bowler Muttiah Muralitharan.																								Despite losing their last five wickets for 14 runs to be all out on the last ball of the innings, Englands total was the fourth highest score ever made in a one-day International at the Gabba.																								Marcus Trescothick (27) and Nick Knight (29) gave the English a flying start, scoring at almost a run a ball in the first few overs, before throwing their wickets away.																								Ronnie Irani also went cheaply as England slumped to 73-3 before Hussain and Paul Collingwood steadied the innings with a fourth-wicket partnership of 82.																								Collingwood went for 37 with the total on 155 then Hussain and Stewart added a further 72 before Hussain, who batted for 136 minutes and hit five fours, was dismissed for 79.																								Using Collingwood as a runner after suffering cramps, Hussain was sent on his way when Collingwood was caught short of his ground by a direct throw from Sanath Jayasuriya. (REUTERS)

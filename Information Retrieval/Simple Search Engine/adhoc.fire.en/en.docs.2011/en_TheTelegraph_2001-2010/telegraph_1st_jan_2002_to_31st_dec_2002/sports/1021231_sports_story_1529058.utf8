The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, December 31, 2002 				 I am a natural striker: Astle
				 	 Astle: Not technically correct																								Christchurch: For Nathan Astle striking form comes easy  he just has to relive the record-shattering knock that he played against England to motivate himself.																								And thats exactly what he did prior to the 76-run knock against India on Sunday as New Zealand helped themselves to a three-wicket victory.																								Troubled by his poor run of form Astle put his feet up and switched on the video screen to relive his most glorious moment yet  his 168-ball 222 which is the fastest ever Test double century ever.																								Astle has more one-day centuries than anyone against India. He says the secret to his success is to spot the ball early and improvise on the shot beforehand. But he insists he is not a very technically sound batsman. 																								Ive never been technically correct. Ive got to learn and I make no bones about it but I havent changed too many things in my career, said Astle.																								I dont know if I am unorthodox. I think I am a natural striker of the ball. My eye and hand co-ordination is what I rely upon a lot. Sometimes it leads to my downfall, sometimes it comes off, Astle said.																								Astle is still cautious of what Indians can do in the remaining one-dayers and says, Rahul is the key. He is in great form and he has shown he can adapt to different countries. If I have to make my pick it would be Rahul. (PTI)

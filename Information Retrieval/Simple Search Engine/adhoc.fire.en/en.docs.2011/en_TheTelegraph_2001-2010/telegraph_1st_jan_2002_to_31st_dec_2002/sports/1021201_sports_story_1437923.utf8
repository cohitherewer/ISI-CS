		 Sunday, December 01, 2002 				 Cairns out of first Test
				 	 Cairns																								Auckland, Nov. 30 (Reuters): New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns has ruled himself out of the opening Test against India starting in Wellington on December 12, it was announced on Saturday. 																								Cairns, who underwent his second knee operation in March, was back playing a first class championship tie for Canterbury against Otago on Friday. The medium-fast bowler and attacking batsman had earlier informed the chairman of selectors, Sir Richard Hadlee, that he was doubtful for the full two-match Test series against India, and was targeting the one-day series which begins in Auckland on December 26.																								He has subsequently informed me that he will reassess his condition in time for consideration for the second Test in Hamilton (December 19). 																								Chris doesnt want to rush his comeback like he did this time last year from another knee operation, Hadlee told Wellingtons Dominion-Post newspaper. The first priority has to be the World Cup in February and March, because Chris is so vital to our chances of winning there.																								Also out of the running for first Test is Auckland allrounder Andre Adams, who is returning from a back injury.

		 Monday, December 09, 2002 				 Willstrop, Barker enter final
																								Chennai: The top two seeds James Willstrop and Peter Barker lived up to their billing when they set up a title clash in the 12th world junior squash championships here on Sunday. 																								In the semi-finals, Willstrop beat unseeded Khayal Mohammad of Pakistan 9-1, 9-0, 9-4 in 29 minutes while fellow Englishman Barker beat another Pakistani, Majid Khan 9-3, 9-0, 10-8. Fourth seed Majid gave Barker a fright when he took the third game to extra points.																								He came from 0-3 and 3-5 down to level the score at six all and then went on to lead 8-7. He then played a delectable drop from close to the wall and Barkers return seemed to have hit the tip of the tin. 																								However, the referee asked the point to be replayed as she could not see it properly. It was replayed and Barker won the point to make it 8-8, and then went into the lead.																								The Pakistani contested the referees verdicts on a number of occasions, right from the first game and got a warning. However, Majid did delight the crowd with few delectable drops and forehand drives for winners.																								In Mondays final Willstrop will start with an edge having beaten Barker this year in three tournaments. (PTI)

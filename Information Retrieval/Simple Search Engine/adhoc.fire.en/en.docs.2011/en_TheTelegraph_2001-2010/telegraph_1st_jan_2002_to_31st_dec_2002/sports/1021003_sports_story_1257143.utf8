				 	 Maradona: Would pay to see Aimar play																								London: Argentine football legend Diego Maradona fired the latest shot in his perpetual battle with British footballers when he accused them of being square- footed Wednesday.																								The 41-year-old hero of Argentinas 1986 World Cup triumph predicted in The Sun that Premiership giants Liverpool would be hammered by Spanish champions Valencia when they play at Anfield in the Champions League at the end of this month.																								While Maradona had little time for Premiership footballers, he heaped praise on Valencias young Argentine star Pablo Aimar, who he regarded as the genuine successor to him in the national side who scored one of the goals in the 2-0 win at home to Liverpool last month. 																								Pablo is having fun on the pitch, just like I used to, added the former Argentine captain, who also appeared in the 1990 World Cup final defeat to the then West Germany and was thrown out of the 1994 finals after failing a drugs test.																								Maradona said it was because 23-year-old Aimar, who was inspirational in leading Valencia to their first title in 31 years but rarely featured in Argentinas disappointing first round exit at the World Cup finals, was having so much fun that Liverpool and the Spanish sides other rivals would suffer.																								This is why he will bring Valencia much more joy and will make sure life wont be a bed of roses for their opponents.																								Unlike the Brits, who have square feet, Aimer has skill in his that goes all the way to the tips of his toes.																								I would pay any entrance fee to see him play, said Maradona, whose virtuoso 1986 performances were offset by his hand of god goal against England in the quarter final.  (AFP)

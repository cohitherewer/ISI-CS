		 Sunday, December 01, 2002 				 England face another humiliation
				 	 Alex Tudor runs out Shane Warne on the second day of the third Ashes Test in Perth Saturday. (AFP)																								Perth, Nov. 30 (Reuters): England were facing the humiliating prospect of defeat inside three days after Australia left them facing a hopeless battle after the second day of the third Ashes Test at the WACA on Saturday.																								Trailing by 271 on the first innings after Australia amassed 456 at more than four-and-a-half runs an over, the depleted tourists staggered to 33 for one at stumps, needing a further 238 to make Australia bat again.																								Opener Michael Vaughan was batting on eight with nightwatchman Richard Dawson also on eight after surviving an appeal for a catch at bat-pad on the final ball of the day.																								England, looking increasingly demoralised and directionless during the day, lost Marcus Trescothick for four when the out-of-form Somerset opener gloved a sharply rising ball from express bowler Brett Lee and wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist took the catch leaping to his right.																								Their already slim hopes were made even more difficult with the loss of Chris Silverwood, ruled out of the rest of the match after tearing his ankle ligaments fielding on the first day.																								Damien Martyn (71), Ricky Ponting (68) and Steve Waugh (53) all completed half-centuries. Waugh joined Don Bradman, Allan Border and Gary Sobers as the only batsmen to make 3,000 Test runs against England.

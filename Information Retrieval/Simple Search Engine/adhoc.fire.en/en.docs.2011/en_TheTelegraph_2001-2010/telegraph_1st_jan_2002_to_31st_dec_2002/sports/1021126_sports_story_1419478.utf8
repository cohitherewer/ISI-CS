		 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 				 Randhawa leads Order of Merit
																								New Delhi: It has been an incredible comeback for Jyoti Randhawa who was involved in a motorcycle accident earlier this year.																								Returning to professional golf just three months ago, Randhawa has again risen to the top of the Davidoff Asian PGA Tour Order of Merit, courtesy a scintillating performance that saw him finish second on Sunday at the $1.5 million Asian Open at Taiwan. 																								Randhawa, who was leading the strong field at the end of the first round with a brilliant performance, did slip a bit in the mid two rounds, making the cut in not too happy a mood.																								However, he came rushing back in the final round, finishing at eight-under 64 and a tournament tally of 14-under 274 at the richest event on the Davidoff Asian PGA Tour. 																								This saw the Indian golfer pocket a hefty sum of $1,66,660, which propelled his seasons tally to a whopping $2,46,667.																								Another Indian, Calcuttas Arjun Atwal also kept the tricolour flying high after a strong finish. He returned a final round card of a bogey-free 65 that saw him finish in a tie for 11th place at nine-under. 																								It was his best finish since his victory at the Singapore Masters in February and put him third on the Order of Merit with $2,04,374.																								Among the other Indians on the Order of Merit, Harmeet Kahlon was placed 25th with a tally of $73,494, Vijay Kumar 28th at $66,650 and Arjun Singh 33rd at $59,003. (PTI)

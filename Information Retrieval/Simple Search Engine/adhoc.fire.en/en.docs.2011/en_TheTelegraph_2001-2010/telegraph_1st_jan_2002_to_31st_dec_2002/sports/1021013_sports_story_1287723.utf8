		 Sunday, October 13, 2002 				 Schumi hits half-century
																								Suzuka, Oct. 12 (Reuters): Michael Schumacher seized the 50th pole position of his Formula One career on Saturday as Ferrari swept the front row for Sundays season-ending Japanese Grand Prix.																								The final session of a championship dominated by the Italian team was halted for more than an hour after Briton Allan McNishs Toyota veered out of control and crashed heavily backwards through the metal barriers.																								The rear end was destroyed but the Scot was helped out of the smouldering wreckage unhurt in a testament to the strength of modern Grand Prix cars.																								When the pit lane reopened, normal service was resumed with Schumacher sealing Ferraris 10th pole position, and his seventh, of the year and beating his Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello by 0.432 of a second.

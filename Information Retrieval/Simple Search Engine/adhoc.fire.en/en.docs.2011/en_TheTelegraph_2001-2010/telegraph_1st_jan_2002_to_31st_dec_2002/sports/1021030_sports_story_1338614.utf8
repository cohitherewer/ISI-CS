The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, October 30, 2002 				 Chaos at press meet irks Hooper
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: With no room earmarked at the CAB for press conferences, utter pandemonium prevailed on Tuesday, during the customary match-eve media sessions with the two captains.																								Journalists and cameramen had to jostle for better position at the makeshift site as the CAB had not made sufficient arrangements.																								Disgusted with the primitive arrangements, the West Indies captain Carl Hooper and manager Ricky Skerritt refused to speak to the media and walked out.																								They returned only after being requested by a senior CAB official who pleaded that it was BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiyas home turf.																								While the policemen were determined to thoroughly check identity documents of the newsmen, there was no such bar on autograph hunters.																								The mediamen had been facing problems since morning.																								Merely entering the Eden complex seemed like breaching a fortress. The lucky few who made it were asked to watch the teams practise from galleries and not the lower tier of the Club House, as promised by the lawmakers Monday.																								Queries to policemen on duty were met with the stock answer that they were only following orders from the DC Head Quarters to check some last-minute security arrangements.																								Interestingly, while the journalists were prevented from entering the Club House, a handful of spectators merrily took position inside with help from the police. They were asked to vacate the place only after protests from the mediamen.																								Drinking water																								In another development, director of health services has asked CAB to ensure mineral and purchased drinking water only under the Bureau of Standard certification be sold inside the stadium. 																								Chittaranjan Maity, director of medical education, will also lead a team at the Eden during the match.

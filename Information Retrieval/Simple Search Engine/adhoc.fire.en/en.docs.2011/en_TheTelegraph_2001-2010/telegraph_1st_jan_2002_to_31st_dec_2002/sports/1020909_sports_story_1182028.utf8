																								Colombo: New Zealand cricket captain Stephen Fleming Sunday said his team was under no pressure to defend their title in the upcoming Champions Trophy tournament here. We are under no pressure and are looking forward to the tournament with a high degree of confidence, Fleming told reporters.																								New Zealand beat India in the final in Nairobi two years ago. They open their campaign vs Australia next Sunday.																								He said New Zealand will miss all-rounder Chris Cairns, out with a knee injury. It is now up to a younger player to come forward and grab that chance, he said. Cairns 102 not out off 113 balls ensured a famous victory after Sourav Gangulys century had given India a head start in the final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, December 21, 2002 				 Inter ousted by Bari
																								Rome: Inter Milan made an ignominious exit from the Italian Cup on Thursday, losing their third round, second leg tie 1-2 against Serie B side Bari.																								Inter lost the first leg 0-1 after fielding a team of youth players, but included several first team regulars, including striker Alvaro Recoba, defender Javier Zanetti and Fransesco Toldo for the return.																								The Serie A side levelled the tie on aggregate after Portuguese midfielder Sergio Conceicao headed home Recobas free-kick in the 56th minute.																								But three minutes later the visitors levelled, Inter defender Carlos Gamarra diverting a low cross from Bari midfielder Antonio Bellcross into his own net.																								That left Inter needing two goals to overturn Baris away-goal advantage.																								Instead it was Bari who increased their lead three minutes into injury time. Inter goalkeeper Toldo tried to punch a cross clear, missed, and the ball fell to striker Gionatha Spinesi, whose close-range header completed victory.																								Bari will face Lazio in the quarter finals. Lazio cruised to a 2-1 win in the second leg of their tie against Empoli (as reported in Fridays Late City edition) thanks to goals by Enrico Chiesa and Giuseppe Pancaro.																								With Lazio leading 2-0 after the first leg, Chiesa gave Empoli a mountain to climb when he scored in the last minute of the first half. (Reuters)

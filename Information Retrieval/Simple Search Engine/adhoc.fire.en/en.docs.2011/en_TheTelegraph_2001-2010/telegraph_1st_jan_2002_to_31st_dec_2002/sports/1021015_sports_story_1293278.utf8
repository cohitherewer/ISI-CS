		 Tuesday, October 15, 2002 				 No free food, lodging for athletes 
																								Busan, Oct. 14 (PTI): Qatar, hosts of the 2006 Asian Games, have denied that the organisers will provide free lodging, food and air tickets to athletes and officials taking part. 																								Qatar Olympic Committee president Tamin Hamad al Thani said the country could not afford to offer such perks to athletes and officials from 44 participating countries.																								Weve to minimise it because we cannot offer these to all the countries taking part, Tamin was quoted as saying by a Malaysian news agency. 																								But well discuss this with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and well take it as a serious matter, he said reacting to reports quoting Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) secretary Sieh Kok Chi as saying that Doha had agreed to such a proposition.																								At a recent OCA meeting, Doha had agreed to provide the offer to 30 officials and athletes from each country.																								In fact, the offer was stated in their Games bidding document.																								Tamin, who is also Doha Games Organising Committee chairman, said the Doha Games, to be held from December 1 to 15, 2006, would have 333 events but did not confirm whether cricket will be introduced. 																								Maybe, therell be some new events introduced but well decide after discussions with OCA, he said.

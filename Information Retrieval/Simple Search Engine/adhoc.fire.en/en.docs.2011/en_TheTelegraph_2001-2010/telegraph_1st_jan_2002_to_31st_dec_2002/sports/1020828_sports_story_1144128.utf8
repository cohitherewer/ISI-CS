		 Wednesday, August 28, 2002 				 ECB to discuss Fletcher future
 (AGENCIES)																								Leeds: England coach Duncan Fletcher is due to discuss his long-term future with the ECB next week.																								I have been asked to a meeting on Monday. I think that its important that its sorted out before an important cricket tour, Fletcher, contracted until the end of the 2003 English season, said Tuesday.																								England are due to tour Australia at the end of the year.																								Fletcher, 53, added the Ashes squad would probably also be discussed next week, with the final list of names due to be announced after the fourth Test against India early next month.																								Fletcher, a former Zimbabwean international captain known for his close attention to detail, has helped transform Englands fortunes since he was first appointed in 1999.																								He and skipper Nasser Hussain teamed up to take England to four consecutive series wins in 2000-1 against Zimbabwe, West Indies, Pakistan and Sri Lanka before that run was halted by a 4-1 home defeat by Australia. 																								Meanwhile, England opener Marcus Trescothick looks set to miss Englands final Test against India having failed to return from injury, adds another report.																								The left-hander had hoped to prove his recovery from a broken thumb in Somersets County Championship match against Lancashire at Blackpool, starting Tuesday. 																								But he still suffered jarring in the thumb when he batted in the nets and is also doubtful for Saturdays C amp;G Trophy one- day final against Yorkshire at Lords.																								England have tried out Robert Key of Kent in place of Trescothick in the second and third Tests without much success. Michael Butcher had done the job in the first Test.

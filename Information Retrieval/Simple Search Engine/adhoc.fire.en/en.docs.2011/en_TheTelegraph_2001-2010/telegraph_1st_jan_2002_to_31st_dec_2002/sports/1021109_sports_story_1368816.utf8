		 Saturday, November 09, 2002 				 Zimbabwe wary of Pak
																								Harare: Tight security and bad weather greeted Zimbabwe, preparing for the first Test vs Pakistan on Saturday at the Harare Sports Club (HSC). At least 30 guards waited in intermittent showers that were forecast to continue.																								Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell expected Pakistan, who are smarting from a run of poor results including a 0-3 drubbing in a Test series against Australia, to play aggressive cricket in the two match series.																								Theyre a strange side, Campbell said of the visitors. When theyre down theyre really down, but when theyre in a corner they come out all guns blazing.																								They are going to want to put in a big performance against us. (Reuters)

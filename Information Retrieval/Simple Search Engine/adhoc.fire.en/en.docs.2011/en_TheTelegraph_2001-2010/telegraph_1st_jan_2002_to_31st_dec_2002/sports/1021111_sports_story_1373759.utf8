The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, November 11, 2002 				 Nassers worst day
																								London: Nasser Hussain said the first day of the Ashes series was his worst as England captain and admits he was wrong to send Australia into bat on Thursday after winning the toss.																								Australia destroyed Englands bowling to close at 364 for two after 90 overs on Thursday.																								Its obvious, blatantly obvious, that the decision I made to send Australia in to bat in the first Test was wrong, Hussain wrote in his Sunday Telegraph column. Obviously we were not helped by the cruciate ligament injury to Simon Jones. It added up to the worst day I have had as an England player, certainly since I became captain.																								Everything went wrong from the toss to the close, he said. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, November 03, 2002 				 An allrounder must have a big heart: Mike Procter
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Eleven years ago, the Calcuttans affection left Mike Procter, then South Africas coach, overwhelmed. This time, of course, Procter is around in a different capacity: As Match Referee.																								Also a former selector, Procter is one of five Referees on the ICCs Elite Panel.																								Respected as being among the most outstanding of allrounders, Procter spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on his tribe.																								The following are excerpts																								On what goes into the making of a quality allrounder																								More than anything else, a big heart. I say this because an allrounder wishes to leave a mark in more than one department, is keen to contribute both as batsman and bowler Also, the love for the game must be immense.																								On allrounders in general																								Its nice to have two strings to your bow  theres less pressure. Psychologically, an allrounder is always better off as he knows he can contribute in two departments If he fails in one, he can make amends in the other.																								On the finest allrounder in his book																								(Smiles) Nobody will ever get better than Garfield Sobers. Its unfair if somebody only rates him as one of the best batsmen of all time, for the simple reason he was also such an outstanding bowler Could be effective with the new ball, be a wrist spinner and, equally, be a fine orthodox one Besides, he was superb in the field. You will never have a better package. The opposition, be it at the international or the County level, would be left hoping he had an off day! On his day  and there were many  no opponent could do a thing.																								On the Big Four (alphabetically) after the Sobers era																								Ian Botham: A complete allrounder, who could do just about everything Indeed, a great allrounder is one who can win a game either off bat or with the ball. Botham could do both.																								Kapil Dev: Brilliant. A bowler with a big heart and somebody who could win the game with his batting.																								Richard Hadlee: Probably the lesser allrounder in this group, because he was more a bowling-allrounder as opposed to being a fifty-fifty performer.																								Imran Khan: From being a raw youngster, in the early Seventies, he got better and better In fact, I would give him higher marks because he was such an inspirational leader You only have to look at the impact he left on cricket in Pakistan.																								On the current lot																								Frankly, nobody stands out The only one who comes close is Chris Cairns, but hes out half the time through injuries.																								On Jacques Kallis, seen as having the potential to be counted in the Botham bracket																								Jacques is a tremendous cricketer, yet I dont consider him a match-winning bowler and, thereby, dont see him today as a true allrounder.																								On why, despite the mushrooming of one-day cricket, the number of quality allrounders is thin																								I agree with you Logically, there should be many around Why it isnt so, I cant say Still, teams are improvising. For instance, look at Rahul Dravid When he keeps, Sourav Ganguly has the option of fielding either an extra bowler or batsman.																								On whether the Adam Gilchrists and Jonty Rhodes should be treated as allrounders																								(Smiles again) Theres certainly a case because both contribute in more than one department. If a couple of stumpings or catches  or even a run out  make the difference, those authoring that deserve to be treated at par with the more accepted allrounders. If you ask me, I consider Jonty an allrounder. Even Gilchrist or a Mark Boucher.																								Finally, on having worn so many caps with distinction																								Its been interesting A lot of South African cricketers keep regretting that they matured in the wrong era, that they missed out on international cricket Owing to the circumstances, even I could only play seven Tests but, today, I consider myself fortunate that I had a role in our period of transition That I was around when Nelson Mandela took centrestage Personally, then, I dont have regrets. How do I view the present scenario (in South Africa)? Well, only the best should get to wear the South Africa cap

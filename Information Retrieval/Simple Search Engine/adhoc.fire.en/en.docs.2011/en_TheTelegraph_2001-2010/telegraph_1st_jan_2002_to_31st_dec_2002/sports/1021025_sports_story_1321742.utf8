		 Friday, October 25, 2002 				 Parthiv has bright future: Taylor 
				 	 PARTHIV 																								Mumbai: Bob Taylor feels Parthiv Patel has a bright future as his concentration level is very high at the young age of 17.																								The former England stumper was speaking to newsmen at the end of a three-day wicketkeeping clinic organised by the Cricket Club of India (CCI). 																								While giving tips to Parthiv, I mainly focussed on his concentration. He also has the ability to move with the ball and is certainly a great prospect, Taylor said.																								The Englishman also had some words of advice for Bengal keeper Deep Dasgupta who lost his place after playing eight Test matches.																								Deep has talent but his concentration level certainly needs improvement. I hope he uses the tips I offered him during these three days, Taylor said.																								Commenting on other wicketkeepers he saw in the clinic, Taylor said they are young, enthusiastic and talented but their real test will come only when they go out to the middle.																								I can only help them improve their skills and strengthen their basics I cant go and play for them, Taylor said, adding that the future of Indian wicketkeeping is bright as all 24 boys who attended the clinic are talented and have a strong desire to make it to the top.																								Taylor feels concentration is the principal attribute of a good wicketkeeper.																								People watch a wicketkeeper right from Day One of a Test match till the end of the game. The only thing they see in a keeper is his level of concentration. To me, concentration comes before anything else, he said. (PTI)

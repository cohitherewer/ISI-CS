		 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 WIs Morton banned, two others fined
																								St Johns: West Indies all rounder Runako Morton has been banned for a year after being found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute by the disciplinary committee of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), the Board said on Tuesday.																								Morton, Barbados left-arm spin bowler Sulieman Benn and fast bowler Tino Best were also fined 10 per cent of their tour fees for breaches of rules concerning their conduct and behaviour during the West Indies A Teams visit to Ireland, Britain and Canada during the summer, a WICB statement said.																								Mortons ban was imposed after he was found guilty of engineering an early departure from the ICC Champions Trophy series in Sri Lanka last September.																								The WICB said the player had thereby brought himself into disrepute.																								The WICB did not say what the players had done, but Morton left Sri Lanka early citing a family bereavement.																								The board also said the breaches of the Code of Conduct during the tour concerned dignity, standards of behaviour, confrontation with players or officials and the use of bad language and sledging.																								The WICB was not immediately available for comment, but said in the statement that it had told Morton to seek professional counselling. (Reuters)

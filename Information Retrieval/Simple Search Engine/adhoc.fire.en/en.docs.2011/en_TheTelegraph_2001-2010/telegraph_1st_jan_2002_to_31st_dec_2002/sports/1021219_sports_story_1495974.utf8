		 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 WI lift series with 7-wkt win
																								Chittagong: Alok Kapalis pugnacious 85 went in vain as the West Indies wrapped up the second and final Test against Bangladesh inside three days here on Wednesday.																								The seven-wicket verdict at the M.A. Aziz Stadium followed a massive innings and 310-run West Indies victory in the first Test in Dhaka.																								Bangladesh, after conceding a 102-run first innings lead, were bowled out for 212, setting the visiting team an easy target of 111. It was Bangladeshs 16th loss in 17 matches since gaining Test status two years ago.																								The only consolation for Bangladesh was Man of the Match Kapalis effort, his best in five Tests.																								Kapali struck 12 boundaries and two sixes in his 111-ball knock and was part of a useful 73-run partnership with Enamul Hoque for the seventh wicket. 																								But Kapalis dismissal at the stroke of tea ensured an early end to their innings. (AFP)

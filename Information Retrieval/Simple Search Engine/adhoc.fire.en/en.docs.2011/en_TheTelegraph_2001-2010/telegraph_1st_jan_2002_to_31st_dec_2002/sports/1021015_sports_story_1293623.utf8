The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, October 15, 2002 				 Two up, one to go
 							 - Imran catches up with Ranatunga as lawmaker BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Oct.14: Imran Khan beat Arjuna Ranatunga to the World Cup, but its the Sri Lankan hero who made it to Parliament before the icon from Pakistan.																								Now, Imran too is right up there. 																								Indeed, with Imran getting elected to the National Assembly, two of the three World Cup-winning captains from Asia have a seat in their countrys supreme law-making body.																								Of course, its to be seen whether Kapil Dev will, at some point, enter either the Lok Sabha or the House of Elders. Its no secret that pro politicians keep wooing him.																								Imran, unsuccessful in all nine seats he contested during the 1997 elections, defeated the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) candidate, Obaidullah Shadikhel, by around 6,000 votes in Mianwali.																								While the PML (Q) is pro Pervez Musharraf, Imran heads the independent Tehreek-e-Insaf party, which he founded in early 1996. 																								Mianwali, it may be recalled, is the home turf of the Niazi family and Imran polled about 66,400 votes, a big improvement on the 18,000 or so he got in 1997. Mianwali is a shade over three hours drive from Lahore.																								Imran, however, lost in three constituencies  Swat and Karak in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), as also Lahore (seat NA-122). Ironically, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) candidate who beat him in Lahore, Sardar Ayaz Mehmood, had been a Tehreek nominee in the last elections.																								Till Imran moved to Islamabad a few years ago, he was Lahores best known face. Yet, in last weeks election, a low turnout saw only about 18,000 vote in his favour. The winner got around 32,000. 																								[In the provincial assembly elections too, only one Tehreek candidate won  Mian Nisar Gul in the NWFP.]																								Imran himself wasnt available for comment  he was in Mianwali (where, for instance, cellphones dont function) to personally thank constituents  but a Tehreek spokesman did speak to The Telegraph from Islamabad this afternoon.																								The only silver lining, frankly, is that the National Assembly will at least have one independent voice We were banking on the silent majority turning out in big numbers but, when the turnout is low, its the professional politicians who gain, the spokesman said.																								Clearly, it didnt help that Imran largely gave tickets to the educated middle-class. Neither did his candidates have the resources, nor could they really have outsmarted the pros.																								Also, its not insignificant that Imran declined to be part of an alliance which had Musharrafs blessings. Moreover, some of Imrans comments appear to have more than angered the Establishment.																								Imran couldnt have joined that alliance as it comprised the most corrupt politicians, explained the spokesman, adding that manipulation was very much there.																								In Mianwali, though, Imran  who has consistently been tearing into corruption  was unputdownable. As it turned out, the start of his new innings coincided with Pakistans worst moment in cricket (in Sharjah).																								Imrans feelings must have been very mixed.

				 	 HAYDEN: Only just started walking 																								Perth: Australia opener Matthew Hayden must prove his fitness before he is cleared to play in the third Test against England starting on Friday after undergoing surgery twice in the past week for haemorrhoids.																								Hayden has had two minor operations to alleviate the problem and could need mild pain killers to take the field on Friday.																								Sitting down on the flight was hard work but Ive come across here earlier than anticipated so thats a good start, Hayden said after arriving in Perth on Wednesday.																								If Im not 100 per cent then I wont play and Ive got some fitness tests to do. Ive only just started walking but I think Ill be all right.																								I could have a local anaesthetic but Im hoping it wont come to that.																								The whole of Australia seems to have had some fun at my expense but the way I look at it everyones suffered something at some time and theres people a lot worse off than me.																								The left-handed opener, currently ranked the worlds best batsman, was Man of the Match in the first Test after making 197 and 103, becoming just the fourth Australian to score twin centuries in an Ashes match.

 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 2: N.S. Virk, the security inspector of ICCs Anti Corruption Unit (ACU), will have a discussion with Bengal players soon after the current series ends.																								This is a part of the educational programme of the ACU. We want to ensure that budding cricketers do not commit the mistakes that some of their seniors have.																								Ill be off to New Zealand soon after this series. But Ill sit with the Bengal players before that, he said. He also informed that he will interact with the under-17 and 19 players of the state.																								Asked whether the ACU plans to have regional inspectors in India, Virk said: Not yet. But it may be discussed in future.																								Bengal coach Sambaran Banerjee said he is looking forward to Virks session with players. Itll be good for the boys, he said.																								The security-inspector was very happy with the functioning of the CAB during the current Test match. Eden Gardens has been the best of all the three centres in this series (Mumbai and Chennai being the others), he said.																								He added the performance of the police has been quite exceptional and there has hardly been any report on any untoward incident.

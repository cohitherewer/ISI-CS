The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, October 09, 2002 				 Bagan face the unknown 
 BY NILESH BHATTACHARYA				 	 Mohun Bagans Jose Ramirez Barreto (centre) warms up with teammates at the club ground Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh 																								Calcutta: They say the exotic charm of the Maldivian atolls coexists with an uncanny system of fanditha. 																								Derived from a rather sanctified term  pundit  fanditha has drawn on Indian Ocean traditions over the years to come to associate itself with the practice of black magic and superstition. And soccer, being the biggest passion in the islanders life, predictably, does not exist outside the rituals orbit. Staunch supporters of football clubs in the Maldives often indulge in fanditha against their rivals as a means to success. 																								On Wednesday, during the AFC Champions League second round qualifier against Mohun Bagan, it isnt certain if fans back in the Maldives will need such methods to overcome their Indian opponents. In fact, Abdula Shibau, the clubs football manager, said Tuesday that they would deal with Mohun Bagan in an orthodox way, through the game of football. 																								For Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya, all this is a surprise package from their guests. I heard Senegal fans had indulged in such practices during the World Cup. But if this is a really effective tool to beat your opponents Senegal would have been World Cup champions. However, this is against the laws of the game and well definitely keep a tab on such activities at the stadium tomorrow, Subrata told The Telegraph. 																								He, though, has his own answer  more sagacious and telling  to this intimidation. Having the dream pair of Jose Ramirez Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia  arguably the most lethal attack in Indian club football of late  at his disposal, means he has little to fear now. 																								And there you have it  a battle of fanditha and fantasy, of surprise and sensation, to be fought in two different ways to stay in contention for the richest prize in the Asian club football. 																								Valencia are unknown to me and an unknown enemy is always dangerous. Therefore, well start off cautiously and want to see how Valencia respond. If they are proved to be in the mould of Saunders, well attack at the outset. If they are proved to be a hard nut to crack, our strategy will accordingly be changed. But winning by a big margin will be the top priority, the Mohun Bagan coach said. 																								Plain talking, that, devoid of his customary braggadocio. Wednesdays match, in more than one way, is bound to shape Subratas future, following the clubs decision to showcause him for criticising an official. But there is also this fear of a graver peril within  his strategic willingness for a devils bargain. 																								Bhaichung and his national teammates  Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, Satish Bharti and Rennedy Singh  are set to figure in the playing XI, just hours after their touch-down in the city from Busan via Hong Kong and New Delhi. 																								Their (the stars) very presence will be a big confidence-booster for the entire team, he said, his words also finding an ally in Basudeb Mondal and Barreto. For Valencias Slovak coach, Rastislav Vancur, the goal is simple. Well fight hard and try to avoid defeat, he said. 																								There is one foreigner in the team  midfielder Yusuf Monsuru Ademola of Nigeria. Captain Mohamed Nizam and current top-scorer in Maldivian league, Ali Shiham are the other players to watch.

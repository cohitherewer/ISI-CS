																								Athens: Greek national soccer captain Theo Zagorakis tested positive for high levels of testosterone but denied any wrong doing, his club said on Friday.																								The AEK Athens midfielder failed a urine test on November 3 following a league game against OFI Crete.																								Thr 31-year-old former Leicester City player had failed a similar test last year but was later cleared after a sports judge accepted claims that his body overproduced the hormone.																								I havent taken any banned substance, AEK quoted Zagorakis as saying. I was worried this might happen again ... I am sure Ill be cleared.																								Zagorakis is expected to undergo a second test by the state-controlled anti-doping center before a decision is made on his participation in the first division league and national team. He faces a two-year suspension if found guilty. (PTI)

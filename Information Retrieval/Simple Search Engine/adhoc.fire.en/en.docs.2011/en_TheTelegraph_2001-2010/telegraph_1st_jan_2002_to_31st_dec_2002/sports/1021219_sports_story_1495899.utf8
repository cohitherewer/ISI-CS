The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 19, 2002  [+uc('by star racer ')+]				 										Calcutta: The RCTC stewards and the finish camera remained busy on a rather eventful Wednesday afternoon. If photo prints had to be consulted to identify winners in four of the six events, the stewards task was also cut out from the start of the day. Incidentally, it was horse-owner Deepak Khaitans lot that pushed all close verdicts to the limit. 				 										Stewards, on the other hand, were presented with a difficult job of sorting out contrasting ordeals concerning apprentice Malcom Maseyk.				 										In the first case it was Maseyks careless riding on trainer Bharath Singhs winner Gryffindor that cost Arian a certain berth in the winners enclosure. The apprentice was, therefore, handed a two race-day suspension  spanning the New years Day and the Derby day meets. 				 										The apprentice had something to cheer about as the second case went grossly in his favour. Stewards enquiring into the running and riding of Afflutter (S. Shanker atop), the original winner of the Wiseman Cup, awarded the verdict to Maseyks even-money favourite The Flying Star  earlier placed second. Afflutter had interfered and bumped the favourite, up in the straight. Shanker was also fined Rs 2,000 for failing to keep a straight course. Nevertheless, trainer Bharath Singh had a profitable day winning the first three events and at lucrative odds, while brother Vijays Arcaro romped home with the afternoons feature event, the Elusive Pimpernel Cup.

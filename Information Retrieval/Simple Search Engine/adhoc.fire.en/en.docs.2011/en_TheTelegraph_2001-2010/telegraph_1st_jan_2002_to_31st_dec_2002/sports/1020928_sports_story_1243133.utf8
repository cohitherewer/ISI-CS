				 																																																	 Bhratri Sangha let in three own goals as they went down 0-5 to SAIL at the Howrah Stadium on Friday. While Biman Mondal scored two of these, Shankar Das was the other culprit after SAIL had taken a 2-0 lead in the first half. Dulal Patra and Sarojit Sarkar scored for SAIL. The loss ensured Bhratri Sangha tenth position in the league, thereby allowing them to play SAIL (who came eighth) in the knockout phase. Had the result been different, they would have played FCI. The IFA authorities said Bhratri Sangha could not be penalised for playing a fixed match until referees report mentions it. The SAIL authorities later said they were surprised at the way Bhratri let the goals in.

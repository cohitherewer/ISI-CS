				 																																	Belfast: Neil Lennon, forced to pull out of a soccer international following a sectarian death threat, says it is too traumatic for him to play for Northern Ireland.				 																																	Lennon, a Catholic, withdrew from the friendly against Cyprus in Belfast just hours before he was due to lead his team out as captain on Wednesday. The caller said the threat was from a Protestant paramilitary group.				 																																	Lennon said enough was enough and he would never play for his country again.				 																																	Its a real pity that it all has to end like this, he told the BBC on Thursday. My parents were pretty distraught. Obviously I cant put them through this every time, he said.

London: Manchester United captain Roy Keane will discover early in September whether or not he will face disciplinary action and a possible suspension following his controversial autobiography.

If he is found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute, he may face a suspension of up to four matches. The FA have come under pressure to bring the matter to a head given that it has dominated the football world since the book was serialised earlier this month.

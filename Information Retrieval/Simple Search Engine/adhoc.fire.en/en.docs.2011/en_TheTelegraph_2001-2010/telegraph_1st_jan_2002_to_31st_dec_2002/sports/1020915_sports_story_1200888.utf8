																										Colombo, Sept. 14 (PTI): Mohammed Kaif rates his unbeaten 87 at Lords in the NatWest Trophy final against England two months ago higher than his match-winning century at the Premadasa Stadium this evening against Zimbabwe.																										I would say Lords was my best. It will remain so. It was under different conditions. England were playing at home and beating them there is a difficult task, Kaif said after Indias 14-run win against Zimbabwe. 																										It was a good wicket to bat on, Kaif said about his unbeaten 111. In the process, he shared a 117-run sixth wicket stand with Rahul Dravid (picture left).

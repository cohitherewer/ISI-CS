		 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Lanka hit back at media slur 
				 	 MURALI: A victim																								Perth: Sri Lankas cricket board has lodged a complaint with its Australian counterpart over what it claims is unfair treatment by the local media over their top bowler Muttiah Muralidharan.																								The Sri Lankan team manager Ajit Jayasekara said on Thursday that he was upset at constant criticism of Muralidharans bowling action.																								We are concerned because we feel it is a bit unfair, Jayasekara said. We have spoken about it, and the chairman of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) has made representations about it to the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and I believe we were supported by the ACB.																								Recent reports in the Australian media quoted two former Australian Test umpires criticising Wisden for selecting the off-spinner as the best Test bowler in history.																								The two umpires said they thought Muralidharan, whose unique action mixes finger spin with wrist rotation, was a chucker and his action had been getting worse since he was officially cleared of throwing.																								The Sri Lankans said they were upset about the report because the International Cricket Council (ICC) had cleared Muralidharan after he was filmed with high-speed cameras.																								They decided that he had a permanently bent arm, which gave the illusion of throwing.																								Sri Lanka are in Australia for a triangular one-day series, also involving England.																								Muralidharan is recovering from a hernia operation but hopes to be fit to play in the match against Australia in Sydney on January 9. (REUTERS)

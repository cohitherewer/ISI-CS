The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 Bagan routed 0-6 in Taejon
 							 - AFC CHAMPIONS LEAGUE l Extreme cold, superior Koreans wipe out city team BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Mohun Bagan were brought to ground by Taejon Citizen of South Korea when they went down 0-6 in the third round of the AFC Champions League away match Wednesday. Bagan conceded four in the first half and two in the second.																								The goals were scored by Kim Young-kwen, Lee Kwang-woo, Gong Oh-kyun (two), Kim Kwang-sun and Kim Eun-jong. 																								Speaking to The Telegraph over telephone, Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya said that theres no disgrace whatsoever going down to such a strong team. They are a much organised side and were at least 10 years behind them in every department, the coach said. 																								Its impossible to put up even a decent fight against this kind of an opposition with our set-up, he added.																								Bhattacharya informed that the extreme cold in the stadium was also a factor behind the defeat. It was impossible for our boys to adjust to such extreme conditions in such a short time, he said.																								The injury problems also bothered the National League champions to a great extent. Even Barreto got injured during the match which didnt help our cause in any way. But I had to persist with him because there was not much alternative left, he added.																								Moreover, the absence of Bhaichung Bhutia also hurt the team a great deal. You cant fight with a team of the quality of Taejon without the best team, he said.																								Though not impressed with the performance of the team, the coach felt that Dulal Biswas did a good job. He has been a consistent performer for us this season and tried his level best.																								The coach further informed that Mohun Bagan suffered by some missed chances. We did create a couple of openings in both halves, but George Ekeh and Sunil Chettri missed those, the coach added.																								He also said that the team was hurt by refereeing decisions. A penalty given against us that resulted in the second goal had a major effect on the game, he lamented.																								However, Bhattacharya felt that this defeat wouldnt be a factor in the ensuing National Football League. Itll be a different ball game altogether. We had been doing quite well and our team is good enough for any national level meet, he said. 																								Mohun Bagan take on Taejon in their home match on November 26.																								MOHUN BAGAN LINE-UP																								Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, Dulal Biswas, Yakubu, Satish Bharti, Lolendra Singh, Jayanta Sen, Basudeb Mondal, Barreto, Rennedy Singh, Sunil Chettri, George Ekeh.

																								Brisbane: Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, called for throwing on his past two tours of Australia, said Thursday he did not expect any more trouble from local umpires.																								It doesnt matter as long as everything is done right for me, Muralidharan said. They cant question me anymore, in my mind, because its gone. Its all past.																								I never thought about not coming to Australia. I always wanted to play here.																								The 30-year-old Sri Lankan, who is recovering from a hernia operation, arrived with the team in Brisbane on Wednesday. Muralidharan has not played in Australia since he was called for throwing in 1995-96 and 1998-99.																								 He is the third highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 437 victims, behind only Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne and retired West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh.																								Sri Lanka will play a warm-up match against Australia A in Brisbane on Saturday ahead of their first game of the series against England in Brisbane on Tuesday.																								Murali said he was looking forward to adding to his array of deliveries which have also produced 297 wickets in 200 ODIs.																								Youve got to keep on trying, he said. Im trying hard to bowl new balls and it might work or it might not work.																								If I can play another 40 Tests and average five a match  thats 200 wickets, he said.																								Coach Dav Whatmoresaid Muralitharan had become an amazing force in international cricket.Years ago you wouldnt say that anyone would fear an off-spinner. A lot of teams do now, he said. (REUTERS)

				 	 Kazakhstans Sergey Drozdov after winning the waterpolo gold-medal match over Japan Sunday. (Reuters)																								Busan: Chinas Liu Chunhong broke three womens weightlifting world records on a rain-sodden seventh day of competition at the Asian Games on Sunday that saw Japan awarded the softball gold on a walkover after a wash-out.																								China stretched their lead in the medal table as they added seven more golds to move onto 92, while second-placed South Korea took three more golds for a total of 32 and Japan secured two to move up to 28. Kazakhstan stay fourth with nine golds.																								Chinas Liu broke the 69-kg records in the snatch, clean and jerk and total in what her coach called a perfect performance.																								Liu topped the previous snatch mark of 115 kg with a lift of 115.5 kg, then bettered the clean and jerk record of 147.5 kg by 0.5 kg. Her total of 262.5 kg was five kgs above the old mark.																								The silver went to Thailands Pawina Thongsuk, who tied the world snatch record and, with a total of 260 kg, eclipsed the previous 257.5 kg world mark before those records fell to Liu.																								Japan were awarded their first ever softball gold after heavy rain washed out the bronze-medal semi-final between China and Chinese Taipei and the championship game.																								The loser of the Chinese Taipei-China game would have been assigned the bronze medal with the winner facing Japan, but because of the wash-out they were both given silvers.																								Thailand captured the mens team gold in sepak takraw regu to avenge an upset loss to South Korea earlier in the tournament.																								Kazakhstan consolidated their position in fourth place in the standings with a gold in water polo after beating Japan 15-14, while Hong Kong won their third gold in the table tennis mixed doubles with a 4-3 victory over South Korea.																								The Koreans redressed the balance when they overwhelmed Hong Kong 101-58 to secure their place in the semi-finals of the mens basketball competition.																								The host nation then made it two out of two as the womens team beat Japan 93-72 in a preliminary game before a partisan crowd.  (REUTERS)

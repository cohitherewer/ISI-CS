				 	 Ramnaresh Sarwan plays one on the leg side on way to his maiden century in Dhaka Monday. (AFP)																								Dhaka: A magnificent third-wicket stand of 146 by Marlon Samuels (82) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (102 not out) and devastating bowling by Vasbert Drakes helped the West Indies beat Bangladesh by 84 runs in the second one-dayer on Monday.																								Irresponsible batting saw Bangladesh dismissed for 182 in 48 overs after the visitors scored 266 for four in 50 overs.																								Bangladesh started disastrously and lost six wickets before reaching 100 with only Mohammed Ashraful providing any resistance with 44.																								Drakes grabbed a career-best four for 18 after he ripped the Bangladeshi top order by grabbing the first three wickets to fall.																								Bangladesh captain Khaled Mashud and Naimur Rahman proved some late-order resistance, adding 71 runs off 95 balls in their seventh-wicket stand to help Bangladesh reach their face-saving score. Mashud made 41 before he was bowled by Cameron Cuffy, who finished with two for 33, while Rahman made 37 before he was run out.																								Earlier, a magnificent third-wicket stand of 146 by Samuels and Sarwan helped West Indies to their total. Sarwans maiden century also took him past 1,000 one-day runs.

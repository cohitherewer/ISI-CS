		 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 Miffed Sunita goes missing
																								Sangrur: Disgraced distance runner Sunita Rani has gone underground after reportedly threatening to expose other athletes using banned drugs to enhance performance.																								Sunita, stripped of her two Asian Games medals following positive tests for nandrolone, is understood to have told family members that dope-testing facilities in South Korea were not fool-proof. 																								Sunita won the 1,500m gold in Busan, shattering the Asian Games record. Two days later, she bagged the 5,000m bronze.																								Sunita was said to have left for New Delhi with brother Sinder Pal to present her case to the AAFI that has set up a one-man committee to probe the scandal. But all efforts to trace her in the capital proved futile. Even AAFI secretary Lalit Bhanot said he had no knowledge of her being in Delhi.																								Meanwhile, the AAFI Tuesday said it wont take any disciplinary action against Sunita till the Sushil Salwan committee submitted its report.																								Salwan, AAFI vice-president and also convenor of the Asian Athletic Associations legal committee, was appointed by Suresh Kalmadi, who wanted the report to be submitted within a week.																								The AAFI received a letter from the Olympic Council of Asia Monday confirming that Sunita had been stripped of her medals after her B samples also tested positive.																								n Saraswati skips felicitation, on Page 25 (PTI)

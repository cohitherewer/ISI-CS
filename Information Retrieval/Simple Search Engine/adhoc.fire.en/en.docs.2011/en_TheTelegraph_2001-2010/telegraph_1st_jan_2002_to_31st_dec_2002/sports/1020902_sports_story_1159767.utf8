																								New Delhi: Lamenting the lack of financial support to former players, legendary batsman Mushtaq Ali has urged the BCCI to provide monetary assistance to them.																								Ali said players like M.G. Gopalan and C.S. Nayudu who represented India against England in 1934, were struggling financially.																								The board must provide financial assistance to improve the condition of players who devoted everything to cricket, Ali said in his hometown Indore.																								He said it was the older generation of players who laid the foundation for the development of the game in the country. If we hadnt played as well as we did, then Indian cricket would not have reached this position. But there is no one to take care of us today, he said.																								Ali felt cricket has been reduced to a source of generating money and said the Board was more responsible than the players for this. (PTI)

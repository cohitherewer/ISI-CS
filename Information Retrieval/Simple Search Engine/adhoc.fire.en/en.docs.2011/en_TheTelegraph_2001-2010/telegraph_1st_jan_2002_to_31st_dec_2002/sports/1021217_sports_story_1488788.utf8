				 	 Kirsten: Grand return																								Paarl: Gary Kirsten struck his 13th one-day hundred on his return to the side as South Africa clinched their series against Pakistan with a comprehensive nine-wicket win on Monday.																								After dismissing Pakistan for just 213, South Africa reached their target with eight overs to spare to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series.																								Kirsten scored an unbeaten 102 off 118 balls with nine fours to see South Africa home with Boeta Dippenaar, who made 47 not out. The only South African wicket to fall was that of Herschelle Gibbs, bowled by a good delivery from Abdur Razzaq for a crisp 52 off 58 balls including six fours and a six.																								Earlier, Yousuf Youhana held together a shaky Pakistani batting effort, top-scoring with 61 from 71 balls as the tourists lost wickets at regular intervals after winning the toss and making a brisk start. That was provided by young wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal and Salim Elahi, but the slide began when Akmal was bowled for 31 by Makhaya Ntini with the score on 54.																								Allan Donald and Jacques Kallis then struck in successive overs, Razzaq (5) and Elahi (26) both caught plumb in front.  (REUTERS)

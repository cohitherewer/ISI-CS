																								Paris: Top seed Lleyton Hewitt piled the pressure on Andre Agassi with a comprehensive 6-2, 7-6 victory over Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the third round of the Paris Masters on Thursday.																								While Agassi says he does not pay attention to Hewitts progress, he would have been secretly hoping for a Kafelnikov victory which would have enabled him to close the gap on the Australian at the top of the Champions Race.																								Hewitt was pushed hard in the second set by Kafelnikov but always appeared to have an extra shot in his locker, and so it proved as he romped through the tiebreak.

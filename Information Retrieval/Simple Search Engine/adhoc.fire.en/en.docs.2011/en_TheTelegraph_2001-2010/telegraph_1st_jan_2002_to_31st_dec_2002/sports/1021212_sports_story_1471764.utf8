																								Ludhiana: JCT registered their first win of the National Football League beating Indian Bank, Chennai 2-1 at the Guru Nanak stadium Wednesday.																								K. Yeboah and Harvinder Singh (jr) scored for JCT while Mohammed Qizar struck for Indian Bank.																								At half time, the score read 1-1. Stung by the equaliser, JCT accelerated the pace and clinched the issue in the injury-time. Receiving a pass from Musa Aliu, Harvinder unleashed a powerful shot which found the back of the net.																								JCT have four points from six games while Indian Bank have seven from five.																								Mahindra hold Vasco																								Substitute Abhishek Yadavs late strike helped Mahindra United hold Vasco 2-2 in another NFL match at the Nehru Stadium in Margao.																								Dictating terms early in the first half, Mahindra took the lead in the 31st minute through R. C. Prakash. 																								Enjoying an edge, they kept on the pressure and had another scoring chance but Petr Strnadels shot went over.																								Vascos Brazilian striker Marcos Pereira, in spite of his tight marking, troubled the rival defence along with Rui Wanderleis. He restored parity for the Goa side just before half-time.																								Vasco took control in the second session and went into the lead in the 70th minute via a Pereira strike. 																								But Mahindra fought back in the closing stages with substitute Yadav heading home a R.C. Prakash cross that rebounded off keeper Ramos knee.																								Disappointed with the result, Vasco coach Derick Pereira said: Our midfield failed to function in the first half. The defence also made mistakes and in spite of giving clear instruction to the defenders not to hold the ball, they committed the mistake.																								With this draw, Vasco now have 11 points from six matches while Mahindra have six. (PTI)

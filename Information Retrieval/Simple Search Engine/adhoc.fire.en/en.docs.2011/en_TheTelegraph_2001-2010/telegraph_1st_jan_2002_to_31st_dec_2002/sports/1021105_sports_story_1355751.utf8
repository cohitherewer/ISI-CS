				 																																	Rome: Inter Milan striker Christian Vieri could become the latest player to face trial by television after the Italian international was caught on camera, stamping an opponent.				 																																	Vieri was seen treading on Ezio Brevis outstretched leg as the Como defender lay on the ground during Inters 2-0 win at the Giuseppe Sinigaglia Stadium Monday.				 																																	The Italian Football Federations (FIGC) rules state that television evidence can only be used if the referee did not witness the incident.				 																																	Pierluigi Collina, who refereed this years World Cup, was close to the incident, but it was not clear whether he actually saw what Vieri did to Brevi. Therefore Collinas report, which will be submitted to the FIGC this week, will decide whether Vieri faces punishment.				 																																	Rome: Under-pressure Italy coach Giovanni Trapattoni has been given the backing of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), the ruling bodys vice-president said on Monday.				 																																	Amid speculation that he could lose his job, Trapattoni met with Federation president Franco Carraro on Monday to discuss Italys recent poor results including last months defeat by Wales. Trapattoni is staying as coach of the team and his position is not based on any time restriction, FIGC vice-president Giancarlo Abete said.				 																																	The FIGC had earlier dismissed reports suggesting that England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson had been targeted to replace Trapattoni. Italys next game is a friendly against Turkey on November 20.				 																																	Sydney: Former tennis world number one Pat Rafter said on Monday he would soon decide whether to take up the racket again after a year off the courts.				 																																	Obviously its a decision Ive still got to make and Ive got to make it very quickly, Rafter said. The stress fracture in my arm has settled down. I had that tested and the body seems to be in pretty good shape at the moment, Rafter said.				 																																	Paris: Frances Cedric Pioline announced his retirement from professional tennis on Sunday after losing in the doubles final at the Paris Masters with Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten.				 																																	Pioline, 33, who turned professional in 1989, won five career titles and reached the US Open final in 1993 and the Wimbledon final four years later  losing to American Pete Sampras on both occasions.

 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Action from the final of the All-India and South Asia rugby meet between Bombay Gymkhana and Future Hope at the CC amp;FC Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Calcutta, Aug. 24: Bombay Gymkhana blanked out Future Hope 24-0 in the final to emerge champions in the All-India and South Asia rugby meet at CC amp;FC today. 																								The presence of Bollywood star Rahul Bose in the Bombay Gymkhana ranks drew a large number of spectators to the ground but they missed the gripping action in a one-sided affair. The slushy turf also made things difficult for the players.																								Things were so bad that the match was confined to 35 minutes in each half, instead of the scheduled 45. Geof Carolan put the visitors ahead with a try in the eighth minute. Chaitanya Sinh increased the margin through a penalty in the 27th minute.																								Naser Hossain scored through a well-crafted try in the second session followed by another from Jaspreet Singh. Chaitanya struck home two more penalties to complete the demolition job. 																								Tim Grandage of Future Hope was named Man-of-the-Tournament while Manipur RFU received the Fair Play trophy.																								The Losers Plate final between Magic Bus and Sergeants Institute was postponed because of the poor ground conditions and will be held tomorrow.

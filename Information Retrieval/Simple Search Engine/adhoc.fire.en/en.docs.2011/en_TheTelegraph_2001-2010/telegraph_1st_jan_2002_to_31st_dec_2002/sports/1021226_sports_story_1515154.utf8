The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 26, 2002  River Melody, Shining Jewel may rule Boxing Day 
 [+uc('BY STAR RACER ')+]				 										Calcutta: Fields in the Boxing Day, on Thursday, race-card are poor but quite competitive thus chances of outsiders popping up in the frame of seven can not be ruled out. However, the two horses who are unlikely to disappoint, albeit over contrasting trips, are Shining Jewel, in the 2,000m General A. S. Vaidya Memorial Cup, and River Melody in the afternoons feature event the 1,200m Army Cup.				 										River Melody had landed a comfortable gamble when trusted under a weak jockey like Sheikh Salam. An in-form Mark Gallagher partners the Daniel David-trainee now and the Sizzling Melody-River Chase daughter may, once again, account for almost the same set of rivals she had beaten in her last start.				 										Promoted to Class III after his runaway victory, in a 1,400m race, over The Flying Star and Rigged For Revenge, victory may again come easy for Shining Jewel. Bred to stay, the Vijay Singh-trained three-year-old by Razeen out of Rhein Jewel will be ridden by C. Alford.

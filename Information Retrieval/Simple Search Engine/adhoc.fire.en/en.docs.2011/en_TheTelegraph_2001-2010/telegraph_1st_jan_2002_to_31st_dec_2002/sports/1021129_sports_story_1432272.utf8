		 Friday, November 29, 2002 				 Sehwag ready to bat anywhere
				 	 SEHWAG																								Ludhiana: Notwithstanding his success as an opener, dashing batsman Virender Sehwag said on Thursday that he was prepared to bat in the middle order to help the teams cause during next years World Cup which India will certainly win. 																								India will certainly win. The World Cup will be ours, Sehwag said, exuding confidence in the teams ability to win the coveted trophy. The explosive batsman said he was more concerned about playing his shots rather than bothering about his position in the batting order in the build up to the Cup. 																								Sehwag was also not averse to the idea of going down the order saying batting in the middle order is also thrilling and challenging. A good contribution by the top order batsmen make it easier for the middle order to play their shots more comfortably and aggressively but a low score in the beginning poses a challenge for the middle order batsmen to rise to the occasion, he said. 																								Sehwag, who was here on a personal visit, said the Indian team would take stock of the situation after the New Zealand tour and then chalk out a strategy for the World Cup. He said that he was keen to settle an old score with Pakistan pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who had bowled him in his debut match. (PTI)

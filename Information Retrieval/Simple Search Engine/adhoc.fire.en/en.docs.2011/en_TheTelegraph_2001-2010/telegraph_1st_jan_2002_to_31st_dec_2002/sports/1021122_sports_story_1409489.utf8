																								Adelaide: Michael Vaughan defended his decision not to walk after Australias Justin Langer claimed he had caught him during the first day of the second Ashes Test on Thursday.																								Vaughan was on 19 at the time and went on to make 177 to help England reach 295 for four at close. Langer claimed he took the low catch cleanly but Vaughan stood his ground and was allowed to keep batting after the matter was referred to the video umpire who ruled that the footage was inconclusive.																								Vaughan told a news conference later that he was within his rights to stand his ground because he was not sure whether the ball had touched the ground or not.																								At first I thought I was gone but there was a suspicion in my mind that the ball had touched the ground and thats why I stood my ground, he said. The replays suggested the ball had touched the ground and I think if you ask any batsman in our team or their team they would have done exactly the same.																								The introduction of television replays to adjudicate on catches has been greeted by a mixed reaction with some critics preferring to let the umpire make the decision on the field.																								Since batsmen are entitled to the benefit of the doubt, most replay decisions have tended to work in their favour and Vaughan said it was almost inevitable more and more batsmen would stand their ground in the future.																								Im in my right to do that. I didnt make the rules that you can call for the replay but now that theyve done that, I think a lot of batsmen will do exactly what I did today, he said.																								It probably is a bit sad but battings a tough game and there are going to be days when you get given out when youre not, so youve got to take the rough with the smooth. If I got away with it I got away with it, but the cameras suggested the ball did touch the ground.																								Australian coach John Buchanan said Langer had told him he had caught the ball fairly and he was happy to take him on his word.																								But Buchanan said there was a growing concern among players and coaches about the technology and many people would like the umpires to take greater responsibility for making decisions on the field.

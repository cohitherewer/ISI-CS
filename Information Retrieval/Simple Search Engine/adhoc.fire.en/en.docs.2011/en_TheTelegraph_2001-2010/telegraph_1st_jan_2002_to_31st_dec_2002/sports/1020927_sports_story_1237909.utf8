		 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Englands pride, Australias envy
																								London: The new England academy at Loughborough University in Leicestershire will be the envy of world champions Australia, academy director Rod Marsh said on Thursday.																								People in the cricket world have been used to keeping up with Australia, Marsh told The Guardian newspaper. But I can see Australia looking at this (the academy) and saying that they want something similar.																								The centre here will be far and away better than where we have been based in Adelaide in the past couple of (English) winters.																								From now on keeping up with the Joneses will mean keeping up with Loughborough, said the former Australia wicketkeeper, who is one year into his three-year stint as director of the England and Wales Cricket Boards (ECB) national academy.																								Work will begin on the new four million pounds academy next month and is scheduled to be completed in a years time, said the newspaper. ECB performance director Hugh Morris was also full of praise for the new academy. The facilities will be world class, Morris said.  (REUTERS)

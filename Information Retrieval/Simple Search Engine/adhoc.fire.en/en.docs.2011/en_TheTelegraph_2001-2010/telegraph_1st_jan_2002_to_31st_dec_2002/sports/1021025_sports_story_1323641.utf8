				 																																																	 Having seen Mohun Bagan through to the third and final qualifying round of the AFC Champions League, coach Subrata Bhattacharya has very little time to cherish the success before responding to another immediate assignment  guiding Bengal to another Santosh Trophy glory. 				 																																																	Landing in the city late last night, Subrata, however, received a blow to his plans for the Imphal meet. He learnt on Thursday that Rahim Nabi and Ashim Biswas, currently with Indian squad in the AFC under-20 meet in Qatar, would not be available for the national meet. As this would definitely make his forwardline poorer, he pitched in for immediate reinforcements. The Bengal coach, however, told IFA officials on Thursday to immediately approach AIFF and hosts Manipur Football Association to complete the formality of including Sunit Chhetri and Jayanta Sen in the squad within a day. 				 																																																	 Burdwan University got a walkover from Rabindra Bharati in the inter-university football meet.

Antarpit Roy was leading in the under-11 section with Bitan Banerjee and Indranil Chattopadhyay heading the under-9 and under-7 sections. 				 																																																	 The fourth all-India railway golf championship got underway at Tollygunge Club on Thursday. A total of 105 players from 15 railway teams are taking part in the three-day meet.				 																																																	 City boy Sanjay Kumar Mondal emerged champion in mens high board diving but Archana Bhusan and Rahul Batra scooped up a double each in the all-India inter-university aquatic championships at Subhas Sarobar on Thursday. 				 																																																	Archana of Bangalore won the womens 200m medley and 200m butterfly while VTU Belgawns Rahul emerged best in mens 1500m and 100m freestyle.

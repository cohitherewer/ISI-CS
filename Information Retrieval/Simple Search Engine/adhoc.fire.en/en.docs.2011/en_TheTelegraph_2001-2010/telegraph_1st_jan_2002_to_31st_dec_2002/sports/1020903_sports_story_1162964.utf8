		 Tuesday, September 03, 2002 				 Be ready for a backlash: Schumi
 (AFP)																								Spa-Francorchamps: World champion Michael Schumacher has warned Ferrari fans to brace themselves for a backlash when the final European Grand Prix of the season takes place at Monza in two weeks time.																								After clinching a record 10th win this season at the Belgian Grand Prix Sunday  the 63rd of his career  the five-time world champion German believes his rivals will want to sign off their poor campaign on the continent with a victory.																								I dont think we can ask for so much, said Schumacher. We have achieved so much this year that it would probably be a little bit arrogant to ask for more. We just take what comes and we do our best and honestly we would like to do our best and take another victory because Monza is our home Grand Prix.

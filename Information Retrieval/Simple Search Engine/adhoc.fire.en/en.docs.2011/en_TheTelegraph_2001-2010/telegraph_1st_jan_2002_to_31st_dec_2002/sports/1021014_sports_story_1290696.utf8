		 Monday, October 14, 2002 				 Schumi driven by success drug
				 	 schumacher: Hungry for more																								Suzuka: Winning is like a drug and Ferraris Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher is not kicking the habit.																								After sealing the most successful year in the Italian teams history with his 11th win of the season in Japan, the German looked forward on Sunday to further milestones.																								Ignoring those who clamour for change to boost flagging television ratings and inject excitement into a sport stifled by Ferrari success, Schumacher said he would rather be criticised for being dominant than slow.																								Its not the driving that is my motivation, he added after leading Ferrari to a fifth successive one-two finish and straightforward but record-equalling 15th win of the year.																								Its simply the love of the sport that is the drive for what Im doing and Im still hungry for more. I dont know when the next generation is coming, who it will be, because I will be around for quite a while.																								Ferrari have finished 53 races in a row on the podium and Schumacher 19 in succession with 22 races in succession in the points.																								The results speak for themselves and it is fantastic, he said. And what has been the most fantastic is that we have not been for one race (off the podium).																								We have finished all the races and not only that, but all on the podium and that shows the quality of job the mechanics have done.																								I dont believe its anything to do with luck. Its hard work. Our guys get the car as reliable as they can and what I do in the car on the other side.																								Schumacher smashed Argentine Carlos Reutemann 1980-81 record of 16 races in a row in the points in France in July, when he also equalled Juan Manuel Fangios record of five titles. (Reuters)

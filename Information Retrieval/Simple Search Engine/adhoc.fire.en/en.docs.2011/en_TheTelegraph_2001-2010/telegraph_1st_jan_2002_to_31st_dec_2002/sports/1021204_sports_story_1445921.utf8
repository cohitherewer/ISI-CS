(AFP)																								Dhaka: Solid performances by opener Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels helped West Indies pile up 281 for five in the third and final one-day International against Bangladesh on Tuesday.																								The pair contributed 108 for the second wicket in 24.3 overs to give their team a solid foundation after losing Wavell Hinds, for 16.																								West Indies beat Bangladesh by 86 runs to win the series 2-0. Chasing 281, Bangladesh scored 195 for nine in 50 overs. For Bangladesh, Alok Kapali top-scored with an unbeaten 89. Vasbert Drakes took four for 33.																								Sanwar Hossain broke the stand in the 33rd over when the 23-year-old left-handed batsman Gayle was caught behind by keeper Khaled Mashud for 73.																								Gayle was given a lifeline in the 29th over on 62 when bowler Enamul Haque dropped a powerful return catch. Gayle hit 11 fours off 90 balls. 																								Samuels, who hammered a fine 82 in the second one-dayer on Monday, proved his worth again, scoring a superb 77 off 101 balls including four fours and two sixes.																								He was dropped on 70 by Tapas Baishya in the 42nd over and the next delivery hit off spinner Mohammad Rafique for a towering six. Rafique bowled him the next ball. (REUTERS)

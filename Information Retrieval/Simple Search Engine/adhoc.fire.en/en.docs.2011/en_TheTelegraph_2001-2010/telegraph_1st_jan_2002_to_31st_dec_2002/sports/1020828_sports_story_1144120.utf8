		 Wednesday, August 28, 2002 				 Glam brigade gets new face
																								New York: Russia has Anna Kournikova, Slovakia has Daniela Hantuchova, and the US has Ashley Harkleroad. All are blonde, and all have been drawing attention for their looks as well as for the way they fashion a forehand. Harkleroad is just 17 and the junior member of the Glamour Girls. On Monday she tackled 1997 French Open champion Iva Majoli in the first round of the US Open and was overpowered 3-6, 2-6. But she recently showed promise by following up a win over world No. 36 Rita Grande in San Diego by winning an ITF event in the Bronx.																								Add in a runner-up finish at another recent ITF tournament, mix in the final of this years French Open junior event and a Wimbledon junior doubles title in 2001, and the signs are that Harkleroad should hit the headlines for her on-court achievements as well as for her teenage good looks. Nicknamed Pebbles while she was living in the tiny town of Flintstone, Georgia, it is easy to see how she got into sports. Her father, Danny, played college football while her mother, Tammy, played college tennis. (Reuters)

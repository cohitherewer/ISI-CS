 							 - EAST ZONE ONE-DAYERS BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Aurijit: Called up																								Calcutta: The CAB selectors Monday made a surprise choice in Nikhil Haldipur, naming him as possible opener for Bengals East Zone one-day engagements, starting Friday (versus Assam), in Agartala.																								Nikhil comes in at the cost of the likes of in-form Alokendu Lahiri, who scored a 222 in a recent CAB league tie (for Tollygunge Agragami versus High Court).																								Also coming into the 14-man squad was another opener, Aurijit Basu. Amitava Chakraborty, Subhradeep Ganguly and Murtaza Lodhgar were dropped from the 15-man Ranji Trophy squad that won against Railways in Siliguri.

Nikhils selection ahead of Alokendu did raise quite a few eyebrows. He has been chosen to have more options for the opening slot. Haldipur has been selected because of his good record as an opener, CAB joint secretary Bablu Koley explained.																								The squad now boasts of three specialist openers, Deep Dasgupta, Moyanko Chakraborty and Aurijit, besides Nikhil. Devang Gandhi and Laxmi Ratan Shukla have also opened the innings in the past. 																								THE SQUAD																								Rohan Gavaskar, Devang Gandhi, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Subhomoy Das, Nikhil Haldipur, Deep Dasgupta, Sanjib Sanyal, Utpal Chatterjee, Sourashish Lahiri, Ranadeb Bose, Aurijit Basu, Shib Shankar Pal, Anirban Chatterjee, Moyanko Chakraborty. 																								U-19 squad																								Avik Chowdhury will lead the Bengal under-19 squad in the Cooch Behar Trophy pre-quarter final tie against Uttar Pradesh in Bilaspur (Himachal Pradesh) from Saturday.																								THE SQUAD																								Avik Chowdhury (captain), Ambar Roy, Sourav Sarkar, Dilip Yadav, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Arup Tripathy, Soujan Biswas, Subhajit Banerjee, Aditya Sengupta, Aranya Deb Sarkar, Abhishek Chowdhury, Amit Biswas, Soumya Pal, Mayukh Biswas.

Junior meet																								Centuries by Aniket Basu and Bazlur Rehman helped Sambaran Banerjee CCC drub Tollygunge CC by 387 runs in the CAB junior (110 points) meet Monday.

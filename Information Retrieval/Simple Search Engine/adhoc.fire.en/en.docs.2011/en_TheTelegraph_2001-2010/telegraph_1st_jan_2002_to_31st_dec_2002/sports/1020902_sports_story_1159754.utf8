																								New Delhi: Causing further headache to the BCCI, the ICC has rejected the current proposal of Sahara to sponsor the Indian team during the Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka.																								ICCs executive board, which met in Dubai Saturday, rejected the sponsorship idea due to a potential conflict of interest between Air Sahara, one of the companies of Sahara India group, and South African Airways, who are the tournament sponsors, an ICC release said.																								However, the BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said Sahara can continue its association with the Indian team in a different form.																								In its present form, the sponsorship by Sahara has been rejected by ICC. But we have asked the Sahara group to use different logos, Shah said from Mumbai.																								Sahara has so many companies. They can continue to sponsor the team in a different form. It should not look like conflicting the interests of South African Airways, he said. 																								The executive board, comprising all Test playing countries along with three representatives of associate members, heard submissions from both BCCI and ICCs commercial partner, Global Cricket Corporation, and decided that the sponsorship in its current form would create a direct conflict between Air Sahara and South African Airways, the release said.																								ICC president Malcolm Gray said it was essential that ICCS commercial partners were protected. South African Airways is an important partner of the ICC and today the ICC members have reaffirmed their commitment to protect its partners rights, Gray said.																								However, it may be the BCCI and Sahara wish to provide an alternate proposal to the ICC that does not have the same potential for conflict. (PTI)

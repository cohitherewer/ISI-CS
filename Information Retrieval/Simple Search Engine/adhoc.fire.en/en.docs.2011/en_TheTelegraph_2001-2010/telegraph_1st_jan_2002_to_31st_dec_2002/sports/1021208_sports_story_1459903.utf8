 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 7: Mukesh Kumar showed his true mettle on Day three of the Tata Steel Open, when he took a four-stroke lead with a tournament-best round of five-under 65.																								Overnight leader Ashok Kumar slipped to second at three-under 209. He finished the day two-under 72, according to information received here.																								At the Beldih and Golmuri Club courses, Calcutta men Inderjit Bhalotia, Rahil Gangjee and Amritinder Singh of Chandigarh submitted identical cards of level-par 70 to be in joint third place at one-under 211. 																								Mukesh birdied the second, sixth and seventh holes, thereby reducing the gap with Ashok Kumar. He made two bogies  the first coming from the bunker on the third and the second on the ninth, where he missed a two-footer par putt.																								Mukesh cracked a 4-iron to 10 feet on the difficult 202-yards par-3 hole and then his six-footer birdie putt on the 11th lipped out. He then made birdies on the 12th and 13th holes, before his birdie putt on the 14th stopped short of the cup by less than a roll.

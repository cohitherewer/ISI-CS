The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, November 27, 2002  Cristopher is the man to watch 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Jockey Cristopher Alford may be followed to profit in Wednesdays race-card. Of his four rides on the day, the champion rider is expected to land all three trophy events on the cards.				 										Cristophers best ride appears to be Allaying in the feature event of the afternoon  the 1,400m Maharajadhiraja Uday Chand Mahtab Of Burdwan Memorial Cup for horses in the highest class. The Excaliburs Lake-Amalita mare from trainer Bharath Singhs yard had placed a good third behind Royal Satin and The Archer. The fact that The Archer went on to beat the likes of Allodiums, Alternators and Bold Chieftans in his subsequent start, it may come as a surprise if the five-year-old mare decides to disappoint on the day.				 										Cristophers other rides  Arcaro and Callisto  are also strongly fancied to land their respective events.Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

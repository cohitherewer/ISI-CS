		 Friday, November 15, 2002 				 Insulin should not be banned
																								Madrid: Insulin is one of a number of drugs that should be removed from the list of banned substances as part of a more scientific approach to the anti-doping battle, a member of the IOCs medical commission said Thursday.																								Dr Harm Kuipers told a conference in Madrid that only substances that could be shown both to enhance performance and to produce adverse effects in athletes health should be prohibited.																								He also warned that some substances currently prohibited, including insulin and possibly even human growth hormone (hGH), did not help performance but were being used by some athletes simply because they were on the banned list.																								He argued that insulin should therefore be removed and said that further study was needed on hGH, but stressed that it should stay on the list for the time being. (REUTERS)

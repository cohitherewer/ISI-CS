				 																																	Montreal: The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) approved the draft of a global doping code Tuesday under which professional athletes would face the same suspensions as Olympic athletes.				 																																	But the head of the watchdog set up by Olympic authorities after the doping scandal at the 1998 Tour de France said a lot of details needed to be ironed out to get the code approved by all governments and sports bodies.				 																																	The agency hopes to get the code approved in time for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, so all athletes would face the same two-year suspension if found guilty of doping offences.				 																																	Getting professional sports like tennis and soccer on board is proving more difficult because some of the organisations fear that suspensions could lead to lawsuits from athletes deprived of multimillion-dollar salaries.				 																																	Bucharest: Israel may play European championship qualifiers in Romania because the security situation in the Middle East prevents them from playing at home. Uefa has instructed Israel to play their home group one matches at neutral venues until the security situation improves. They play Malta away on October 12 and are supposed to be at home to Cyprus four days later.				 																																	We are in contact with the Israeli FA but no final decision has been taken yet, Cristian Bivolaru, general secretary of the Romanian Football Association said Wednesday. The talks are very difficult. I can only tell you that the chances to schedule Israeli matches in Romania have risen. 				 																																	According to British newspapers, Israel had also considered playing the Cyprus match at the White Hart Lane home of Tottenham Hotspur.				 																																	Rome: AC Milan striker Filippo Inzaghi, scorer of both goals in his sides 2-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich Tuesday, has set his sights on Gerd Muellers record of 67 goals in European competition.				 																																	To equal Mueller is my dream, he was quoted as saying in La Gazzetta dello Sport Wednesday. But like all dreams I believe it will be very difficult to achieve. For now Im happy with the 42 goals Ive already scored. You look at the numbers at the end of your career, not now.				 																																	Last week Inzaghi became Italys most prolific striker ever in European competition when he scored a hattrick against Spanish team Deportivo Coruna.				 																																	Bucharest: Real Betis defender Iulian Filipescu is injured and will miss Romanias Euro 2004 qualifiers against Norway and Luxembourg, a Romanian soccer federation (FRF) spokesman said Wednesday. Filipescu has acute back ache and he needs special medical treatment, the spokesman said. Real Betis Spanish doctors said Filipescu would be out of action for the next two weeks. 				 																																	n Cricket: Pakistan vs Australia, 1st Test Day, 1 live from 12 noon on STAR Sports n Cricket: Legends of cricket from 11.30 pm on ESPN n Soccer: Champions League from 2.30 pm on ESPN

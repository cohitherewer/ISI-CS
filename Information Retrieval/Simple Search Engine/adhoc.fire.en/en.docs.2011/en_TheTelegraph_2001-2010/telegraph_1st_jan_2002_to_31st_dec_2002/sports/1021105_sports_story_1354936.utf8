				 	 Beckham: Wants to be with kidnap-threatened wife																								London: David Beckham could have a week off from football in the wake of an alleged plot to kidnap his wife.																								Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is set to field a weakened team against Leicester Tuesday in their English League Cup.																								Beckham, meanwhile, is also suspended from Saturdays derby match against Manchester City at Maine Road. It is also a possibility he sits out next weeks final first round Champions League match against Bayer Leverkusen as United have already qualified for the second phase.																								Meanwhile Ferguson confirmed he would again be fielding a second string side in the League Cup.																								 Ill be playing a mixture of first team and reserves. We have been unlucky in the Worthington (League) Cup over the years, getting away draws with Arsenal, Aston Villa and Sunderland, Ferguson said. 																								Being away from home when you have younger players in your team makes it much more difficult. Although we have played very well in those games, we have been knocked out.  (AFP)

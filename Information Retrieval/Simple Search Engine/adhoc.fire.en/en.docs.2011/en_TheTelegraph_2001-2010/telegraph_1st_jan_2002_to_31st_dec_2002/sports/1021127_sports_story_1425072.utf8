The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 Win, any which way: Bhowmick
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh discusses a point with (from left) Jo Paul Ancheri, Daljit Singh and I.M. Vijayan at the SAI Tuesday																								Calcutta: Two wins from two games, but the East Bengal fans arent happy. They want beautiful soccer from Subhas Bhowmicks team, but the coach is in no mood to satisfy that demand.																								On the eve of their third National Football League match against JCT, the coach said that three points are all that matters. Theres no point playing attractive football if you cant win. Ill go according to the situation and try to ensure full points, Bhowmick said at the end of practice at the East Bengal ground Tuesday.																								However, the coach wants to take his lessons from the last game against Mahindra United. In that match, the defenders were coming too close to each other. Ill have to see to it that it doesnt happen here again, Bhowmick added. He also seemed worried at the number of mispasses that they are playing. Ill ask them to hold the ball a bit more.																								Bhowmick also sounded extremely respectful about the opposition. Jo Paul Ancheri, to my mind, if the best central midfielder of the country. So, its imperative that we keep an eye on him.																								Another player, who might just be a bit of a bother for the East Bengal coach, is veteran war-horse I.M. Vijayan. Theres always a mystery factor about him, and Bhowmick also revealed that concern. Hes such a great player, its impossible to predict what hell do. May be, he himself doesnt know what is in store, the coach pointed out.																								It can be noted that both the players were with East Bengal last season and it was the clubs lack of interest about retaining Vijayan that led to their shift to JCT.																								The coach also pointed out that hell stick to the 3-5-2 formation. However, Gilmer, their new Brazilian recruit, couldnt be signed Tuesday either because the necessary papers havent come as yet. But that isnt too much of a worry for the coach, especially with the quality of the reserve bench that he has at his disposal.																								On the other hand, JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh is a worried man. He was expecting the International Transfer Certificate of his Ghanaian recruits Mansuru Mohammed and K. Yeboah to arrive, but that didnt happen. Thatll leave us a bit weak, Sukhwinder said. So, the only foreigner available to us is Musah Aliu.																								However, the fitness of the tried and tested duo of Vijayan and Ancheri has relieved the coach. They are free of any injuries and havent done badly. Though Vijayan has aged a bit, he looks quite agile, he added.																								TEAMS 																								East Bengal (likely): Sandip Nandy; Douglas De Silva, Arun Malhotra, Deepak Mondal; Subhashish Roy Chowdhury, Suley Musah, Chandan Das, S. Venkatesh, Anit Ghosh; Alvito DCunha, Mike Okoro																								JCT (likely): Arvind Kumar, Jagjit Dhawa, Musah Aliu, Saranjit Singh (Harpreet Singh), Daljit Singh, Jaswinder Singh; Jo Paul Ancheri, Hardeep Saini, Jaspreet Singh, Harvinder Singh; Hardeep Gill, I. M. Vijayan.

		 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 PCB blame players, team management
 (PTI)																								Islamabad: Pakistan cricket authorities have blamed the team management for the dismal show in the just-concluded Morocco Cup and said captain Waqar Younis had to be more consistent with his performance.																								The team management and players are both responsible for failing to reach the final of the Morocco Cup. 																								The team had no game plan to chase a target of 250 or 197, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia told the media in Lahore. 																								Zia said he was not completely satisfied with the captaincy of Younis during the three-nation tournament. He is a good captain, but he should be more consistent with his overall performance.																								He said lack of consistency in batting was the other reason for Pakistans early exit in the Morocco Cup. 																								Asked about the other likely venues of Pakistans Test series against Australia, he said negotiations were still in progress with the Australian Cricket Board.																								 While the first Test will be played in Colombo, the venues for the remaining two Tests had not yet been finalised. 																								Personally I would have preferred Bangladesh as it is the most ideal venue but it was ruled out mainly due to logistic problems. Currently Pakistan has no flights to Dhaka. Moreover, Pakistan players too prefer Sharjah and Colombo and feel more comfortable playing there.																								Zia said the inauguration of the National Cricket Academy could be delayed since PCB wanted to upgrade the facilities and had sought assistance from foreign experts in this regard.																								 The tentative date for the inauguration of National Cricket Academy was September 30, but there could be a delay due to re-designing of indoor practice facilities for which a foreign expert had been approached, he added. copy;  Copyrights 2002.

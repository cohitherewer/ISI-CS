				 																																	London: Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren has given up his coaching role with Englands national team to concentrate on his club duties.				 																																	McClaren, who has been one of England coach Sven-Goran Erikssons assistants since 2001, said the decision was not connected with the resignation of English Football Association chief executive Adam Crozier on Thursday.				 																																	I have decided to step down from my role to concentrate fully on the affairs of Middlesbrough Football Club, McClaren said on Friday.				 																																	This is purely my own decision. Indeed it is a decision I have been considering for some time as my role with Middlesbrough  which must of course be my first priority  has taken up more time.				 																																	Bangkok: Tennis star Paradorn Srichaphan will be appointed as a cultural ambassador for Thailand and honoured with a diplomatic passport, the government announced on Friday.				 																																	Deputy Prime Minister Korn Dabbaransi said the title would be bestowed on Thailands newest sporting hero on November 11 in a ceremony at Government House.				 																																	Paradorns father and coach, Chanachai, will also be granted a diplomatic passport, he said.

Rome: Franco Carraro, president of the Italian football association (FIGC), is to meet national team boss Giovanni Trapattoni on Monday to discuss the countrys poor run of results.				 																																	Trapattonis job could be in danger following the 1-2 loss to Wales in a Euro 2004 championship qualifier earlier this month, a defeat that leaves the Italians facing an uphill battle to qualify for the Portugal tournament.

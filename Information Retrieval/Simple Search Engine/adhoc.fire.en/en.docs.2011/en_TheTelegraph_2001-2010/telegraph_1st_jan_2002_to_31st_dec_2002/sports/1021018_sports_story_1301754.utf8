		 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 Manipur whip HP 8-0 
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Imphal: Bijen Singh pumped in four second-half goals in quick succession as Manipur launched their campaign in grand style, thrashing Himachal Pradesh 8-0 on the opening day of the 58th LG Santosh Trophy. 																								The home team was leading 2-0 on the back of Ravinder Thakurs suicidal goal and an opportunistic strike from Ksh. Kanta. N. Helen, W. Tomba and L. Tiken were the other scorers. 																								Manipur took control of the match right from the word go. However, they had to wait as long as the 36th minute to open the floodgates. Bijen hit a powerful goalward grounder from near the box and Thakur slotted the ball in trying to clear it. The second goal came in the 43rd minute from Kanta, who slammed home from inside the box off a goalmouth melee. Thereafter, there was no looking back for Manipur as they pumped in half a dozen goal in the second half.

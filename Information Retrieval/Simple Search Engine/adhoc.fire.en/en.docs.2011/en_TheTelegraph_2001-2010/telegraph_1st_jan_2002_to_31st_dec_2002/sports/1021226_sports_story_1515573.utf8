		 Thursday, December 26, 2002 				 ICC welcomes BCCI move 
																								London: Brushing aside Indias reservations to its final offer on the Player Terms issues, the International Cricket Council on Wednesday welcomed the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) decision to honour December 31 deadline for announcing the 15-member squad for the next years World Cup.																								ICC president Malcolm Gray said in a statement that the world body was seeking nothing more than what the BCCI had committed to when it signed its Participating Nations Agreement for the event in March this year.																								The BCCI committed to a series of obligations in its PNA and the most immediate one is to name its squad by December 31. It is pleasing (to know) that it will meet this obligation, Gray said.																								The critical issue is to ensure that the best team represents India at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2003. That is what the players want. This is what the people of India want and this is what the rest of the cricketing world wants.																								It is now up to the BCCI to make sure that this happens. It has the right and responsibility to select its team and to ensuring that its players play under the terms that the BCCI first agreed with ICC in March 2002,he said. (PTI)

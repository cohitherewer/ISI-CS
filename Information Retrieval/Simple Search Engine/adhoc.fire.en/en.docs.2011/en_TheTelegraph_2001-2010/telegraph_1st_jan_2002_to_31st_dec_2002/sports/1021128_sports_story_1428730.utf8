The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, November 28, 2002 				 Sourashish, Utpal skittle out Railways 
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sourashish amp; Utpal: Sharing nine wickets																								Siliguri: Bengal, desperate to open their account in the Ranji Trophy, had an impressive start to their match against Railways at the Kanchenjungha Stadium Wednesday. The Bengal spinners Utpal Chatterjee (five for 89) and Sourashish Lahiri (four for 87) had a field day as they bundled out the defending champions for 246 in their first innings.																								At stumps, Bengal were four without loss, with Deep Dasgupta and Amitava Chakraborty unbeaten on two each.																								Railways were off to a confident start after stand-in-skipper Yere Goud (doing duty in place of an injured Abhay Sharma) won the toss and elected to bat. 																								Openers J.P. Yadav and Amit Pagnis put up 66 for the first wicket, but it was the introduction of spin that started to make things happen for the hosts. Veteran Utpal had Yadav caught behind for 33 and Pagnis also followed suit, Sourashish being the lucky bowler.																								The two spinners bowled well in tandem to have Railways reeling at 85 for four at lunch. They kept on losing wickets after lunch, being reduced to 129 for six. 																								A 79-run seventh wicket stand between Sudhir Wankhede (84 not out) and Shreyas Khanolkar (38) only briefly resurrected the innings.																								Subhradeep Ganguly made his debut for Bengal, replacing Shibshankar Paul.

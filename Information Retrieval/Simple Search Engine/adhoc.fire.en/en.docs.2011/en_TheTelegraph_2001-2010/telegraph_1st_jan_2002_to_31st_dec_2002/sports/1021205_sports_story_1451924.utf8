		 Thursday, December 05, 2002 				 Zaheer may miss next practice game
																								Christchurch: Brendon McCullums heroics in the Super Max game did more than dent the pride of the visiting Indian team  it also raised injury concerns over its pace spearhead Zaheer Khan. McCullum crunched a shot to mid-off in the closing minutes of New Zealands second innings at the Jade Stadium and it hit Zaheer bang on his right knee. 																								The left-arm pacer immediately signalled to the pavilion and limped off the field at the end of the over, assisted by physio Andrew Leipus. He left the field immediately and coach John Wright later confirmed that the bowler was quite badly bruised and would probably be rested from the three-day practice game against Central Districts starting at Napier Friday.

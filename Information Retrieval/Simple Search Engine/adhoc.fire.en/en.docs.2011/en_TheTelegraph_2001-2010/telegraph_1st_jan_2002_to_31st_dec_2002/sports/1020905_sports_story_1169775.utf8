		 Thursday, September 05, 2002 				 Shabbir to coach Goan club
																								Margao: Former Bhratri Sangha coach Shabbir Ali has taken over the coaching of Fransa Sports Club (FSC), Goa, from Wednesday.																								Addressing reporters after the teams practise session, Shabbir said he had offers to join a local club and a Bangladesh club when FSC president Micky Pacheco approached him.																								This will be the second Goan club Shabbir would be training after his successful stint with Salgaocar from December 1997 to April 2000 winning Super Cup twice, National League (1998) Rovers Cup, Durand Cup, Carvalho Cup and Goa professional league.																								Salgaocar is an established team and training them was not a tough job as compared to Fransa which is relatively a new and inexperienced team, he said. (PTI)

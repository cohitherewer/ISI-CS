																								Durban: Ali Bacher on Sunday warned Indian companies that ticket packages sold to them will be cancelled if they dont immediately stop using them as prizes in competitions and lotteries.																								The warning came after the organising committee claimed that there had been recent incidents of ambush marketing in India. Bacher said he had personally written to the companies concerned to stop using the tickets as prizes in competitions or lotteries. The returned packages could then be used for legitimate purposes and the holders of tickets would be assured of smooth entry, said Bacher.

		 Sunday, December 01, 2002 				 Legal action likely for Zimbabwe boycott
																								Harare, Nov. 30 (Reuters): Teams who refuse to play in Zimbabwe during the 2003 World Cup could face legal action, the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said on Saturday.																								That (refusing to honour World Cup fixtures) would be in breach of the agreement and there would be consequences, Speed said. 																								The first consequence, I expect, would be an issue of points for the match. There would also be an issue of damages under the various contracts. I certainly hope it wont come to that.																								Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabes political stand-off with the international community have drawn calls for the matches to be moved to South Africa.																								Australia and England have shown the most concern about playing in Zimbabwe. India, Pakistan, Namibia and the Netherlands are also due to play there. Countries can dissent from the majority opinion, Speed said. 																								If the conclusion in the report is that its safe to play, and the board endorses that, then the country is bound to play here. But we cant force countries to play anywhere in the world.																								Cullinan included																								 South African batsman Daryll Cullinan was on Saturday named in a 30-man probables list for the 2003 World Cup.																								the probables																								Shaun Pollock, Nicky Boje, Loots Bosman, Mark Boucher, Daryll Cullinan, Alan Dawson, Boeta Dippenaar, Steve Elworthy, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Mornantau Hayward, Jacques Kallis, Lance Klusener, Gary Kirsten, Charl Langeveldt, Neil McKenzie, Makhaya Ntini, Justin Ontong, Robin Peterson, Ashwell Prince, Jonty Rhodes, Jacques Rudolph, Errol Stewart, Graeme Smith, David Terbrugge, Roger Telemachus, Thami Tsolekile, Martin van Jaarsveld, Mondi Zondeki.

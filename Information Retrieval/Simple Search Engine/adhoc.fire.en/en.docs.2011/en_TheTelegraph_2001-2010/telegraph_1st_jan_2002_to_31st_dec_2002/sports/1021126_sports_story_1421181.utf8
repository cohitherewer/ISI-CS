		 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 				 Pillay back with tantrums
																								New Delhi: The indisciplined and temperamental side of star hockey player Dhanraj Pillay reared its ugly face once again here Monday when the mercurial forward manhandled the umpires in the final of the Nehru Cup hockey tournament between Indian airlines and Punjab Police.																								Pillay, who plays for airlines, did nothing to improve his image  that of a talented but volatile player prone to temperamental bouts  as he argued, pushed and threatened the umpires in the match won by Punjab Police 3-2 via the golden goal.																								The trouble started when Punjab Police were awarded a penalty corner by umpire Javed Sheikh in extra time which was converted in to a golden goal by skipper Gagan Ajit Singh. An infuriated Pillay argued with the umpire asking him to disallow the goal. He claimed that the ball had hit his legs before going into the net.																								As Sheikh turned down his appeal, Pillay abused the umpire and pushed him repeatedly.																								Even during the first half, Pillay had a scuffle with the other umpire Satinder Sharma. Irked over a decision that went against him, he mouthed expletives and threw away his stick in disgust.																								Later, an unapologetic Pillay misbehaved with the journalists as well. I dont want to say anything as I know my career is finished. You can write what you want. I dont care any more, Pillay shot back at reporters without any provocation.																								Technical director of the tournament committee Kuku Walia said he would put the matter before the technical committee and later forward it to the Indian Hockey Federation.  (PTI)

				 																																	Athens: Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes has dismissed suggestions he is unhappy with the club following the recent attempt to include him as part-exchange in the deal to sign Ronaldo. I am very satisfied with the club, the Spanish international said on Thursday, ahead of Spains Euro 2004 against Greece. I am a very positive person and believe that I am lucky to be doing something I enjoy. The only negative aspect was the uncertainty about my future, but I am happy the way everything has turned out.				 																																	The 26-year-old centre forward was poised to leave Real for Inter Milan or arch-rivals Barcelona in order to raise funds for the 45 million euro deal to sign Ronaldo.				 																																	I am not stupid and know that ahead of me will be one of the best players in the world but my intention is to give 100 per cent to ensure I play at Real, he said.				 																																	Tokyo: Japan coach Zico is intent on calling up European-based players Junichi Inamoto, Shinji Ono and Hidetoshi Nakata for next months home friendly against Jamaica, his first match in charge. The Japan Football Association (JFA) confirmed on Thursday that the Asian champions will face Jamaica on October 16 in Tokyo after Zico had pushed for a second match to be scheduled before the end of the year.				 																																	Japan will also play Argentina in a second Kirin Challenge Cup fixture on November 20. The JFA announced, however, that they have switched the venue from Tokyo to Saitama. Of course I am intending to call up the players in Europe, so I will have to negotiate with their clubs to make sure they are available, said Zico.

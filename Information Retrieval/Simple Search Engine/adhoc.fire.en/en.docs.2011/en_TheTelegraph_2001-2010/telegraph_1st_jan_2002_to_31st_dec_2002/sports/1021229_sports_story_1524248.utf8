																								London, Dec. 28 (PTI): After threatening to slap the BCCI with hefty compensation claims if it failed to meet its contractual obligations, the ICC on Saturday sought to put more pressure on India, saying it was bound to send its best team to the World Cup.																								The ICC said that given the recent speculation that the Indian team may not play in the World Cup, it was important to understand the contractual obligations that the BCCI had undertaken. It disclosed the four key clauses in the contract that it thinks should make things clear. The following are the clauses.																								n Clause 5.1: The competitor (BCCI) will ensure that all players in its squad and the team selected for each match are the competitors best players available to the competitor at the time of the squad and team selection respectively, accepting as reasons for non-availability of players only insurmountable and verifiable practical issues such as suspension, injury or serious and unavoidable non-commerical reasons such as bereavement of a close family member.																								n Clause 13.3: The competitor hereby undertakes to co-operate and to procure the co-operation of all squad members with IDI and GCC to avoid any conflict between the commercial rights and the interest of the competitor and its players, including but not limited to conflicts involving the rights or actions of any team sponsor of player sponsor. In the event of any such conflict arising the competitor shall take all steps reasonably necessary to avoid or alleviate conflict so as to avoid any adverse effect to the value of the commercial rights.																								n Clause 13.4: The competitor shall procure that each player and team official provides (at no cost to IDI, UCBSA [i.e. The United Cricket Board of South Africa] or sub-licensees) authorization to enable IDI and UCBSA to use and to sub-license the use of his name, image, autograph, biography, photograph, likeness and other relevant details and to replicate (by electronic or by any other means) his image and any other performance rendered by him during the event, including (where relevant) his batting and/or bowling action for the purposes of promoting the event and exploiting the commercial rights (but excluding the hosts rights) provided that such name, image, autograph, biography, photograph, likeness other relevant details or performance shall not (without the prior written consent of the relevant player or team official) be used in any manner which may reasonably be considered to constitute a personal endorsement by any such player or team official of any product or service.																								n Clause 14.1: The competitor shall procure that, without cost to IDI, each member of the squad (including for the avoidance of doubt not only all of the players but also the non-playing members of the squad) shall have signed the player terms, the form of which is set out in schedule 3, and that all of the signed player terms for the squad (bearing the squad members original signatures) are delivered to IDI by 14 January 2003.																								 The competitor shall procure that each potential member of the squad (to the extent that the competitor is reasonably able to predict the same) has been provided with a copy of and shall use its best endeavours to ensure that each squad member has read and fully understood the provisions of this agreement (including, without limitation, the doping regulations) as soon as practicable following the signature of this agreement by the competitor and, in any event, no later that prior to their signature of the player terms.																								 The competitor shall thereafter use its best endeavours to procure compliance by each member of the squad with all the player terms and shall take all steps necessary to enforce the player terms as IDI or the event technical committee may require.

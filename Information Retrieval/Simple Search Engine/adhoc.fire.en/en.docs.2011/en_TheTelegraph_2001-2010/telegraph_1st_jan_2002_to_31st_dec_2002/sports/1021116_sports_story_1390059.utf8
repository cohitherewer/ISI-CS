		 Saturday, November 16, 2002 				 NFL to be dearer for city
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: The National Football League, with new title sponsors, will be costlier this year, at least for the city. Local organisers Indian Football Association (IFA) have decided to increase the prices for all tickets for an NFL match. 																								Tickets for public sale will now be priced at Rs 15 while those for VIP, Special and VVIP categories will also be charged at Rs. 20, 25 and 30, respectively. In case of an East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match or any other exhibition ties, these rates will be hiked by a further Rs. 5 in each category. 																								The IFAs move follows its decision to allot a number of free tickets to the three city-based clubs  Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Tollygunge Agragami  during the NFL. It is, however, up to the clubs discretion to distribute the tickets among their members. 																								East Bengal had earlier called for free tickets for their members. The IFA governing body on Friday stamped their approval on the proposal. The IFA, however, rejected Mohun Bagans proposal of organising their home matches in the league. The city leg of the NFL kicks off with the match between East Bengal and Tollygunge Agragami on Sunday. 																								The IFA Shield has been planned to be held between December 25 to January 23, when the NFL will be put on hold. The governing body also passed the IFAs bid to stage the next Santosh Trophy and Federation Cup in the city. 																								Meanwhile, Ghanas Suley Musah signed for East Bengal on Friday.

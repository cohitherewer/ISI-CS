		 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Nasir back as Pakistan manager
																								Karachi: Pakistan have re-appointed a former brigadier as the manager of the national cricket team after the departure of Yawar Saeed, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Thursday.																								A statement said Saeed had asked to be allowed to step down due to personal circumstances and that Brigadier (retd.) Khawaja Mohammad Nasir would be manager for next months series against Australia.																								Saeeds departure had been widely predicted following the removal of coach Mudassar Nazar after the teams recent poor performances.																								The media held Saeed equally to blame for the squads rapid plunge in form just three months after they beat Australia in Australia.																								Saeed recounted the teams recent poor performance and said fitness problems were the main reason behind the teams slump, the PCB said.																								Nasir was manager between November 1999 and December 2000. He sparked a controversy when in June 2000 he accused India of being the hub of match-fixing.																								Meanwhile, pace bowler Mohammad Zahid has been cleared to join the team in Sri Lanka after passing a fitness test.																								Pakistan meet Australia in Colombo from October 3 in the first match of a three-Test series. The second and third Tests will be played in Sharjah from October 11-15 and October 19-23.																								The home series was shifted to neutral venues over security fears.  (AFP)

(Reuters) 																								Perth: Scotland caused the first major upset of the womens hockey World Cup here on Thursday, beating highly rated New Zealand 2-1 in pool A while Argentina defeated Germany 1-0.																								Scotlands Louise Carroll put New Zealand on the back foot after 22 minutes, converting a penalty awarded against Lizzy Igasan for impeding Cheryl Valentine as she was striking at goal. 																								Helen Clarke in goal went to her right and Carroll put the ball high into the middle of the net to convert the stroke. Diana Weavers struck New Zealands equaliser, driving their second penalty corner past Tracey Robb in goal for Scotland four minutes before the break.																								Scotland started the second half with a sparkling goal to Linda Clement who dived to finish Vikki Bunces pass from the left at the right post.																								We were indecisive and tentative until the last six minutes, said New Zealand coach, Jan Borren. We have to start the way we finished not the other way around.  (AFP)

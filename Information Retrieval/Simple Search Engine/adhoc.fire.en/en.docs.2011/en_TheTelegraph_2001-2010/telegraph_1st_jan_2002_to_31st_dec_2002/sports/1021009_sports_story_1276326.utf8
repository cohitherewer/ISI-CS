		 Wednesday, October 09, 2002  Royal City may strike 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Royal City may be hard to toss in the 1,800m National Flag Cup on Wednesday, the concluding race-meet of the 15-Day monsoon season. The Inner City-Ruby Lights youngster from Daniel Davids yard was an impressive second to Smart Ruler in the 2,000m Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes. Up against a poor opposition, the three-year-old gelding may gallop to victory in the hands of Amyn Merchant.				 										Race card and selections				 										1.

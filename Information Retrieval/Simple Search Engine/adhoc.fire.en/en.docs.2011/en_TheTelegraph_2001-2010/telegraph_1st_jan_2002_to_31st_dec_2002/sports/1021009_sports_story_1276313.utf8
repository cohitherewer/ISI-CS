		 Wednesday, October 09, 2002 				 I just wanted a medal: Soma
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Soma Biswas, after winning the heptathlon silver in Busan Tuesday																								Busan: Ranaghat, in Nadia, has, finally, more than the pantua to offer its Puja revellers  Soma Biswas. 																								This heptathlete missed the Asian Games gold in Busan Tuesday, but she isnt too disappointed, stating that it was any medal, of any colour, that she was aiming at.																								My coach (Kuntal Roy) said that a gold was in the offing, but my aim was to win any medal in the event, said Soma after her silver effort. In fact, when the heptathlon event was on, she was not sure whether she will be able to clinch a medal or not. I didnt start very well and was not even in the first five in the initial events. But I made the comeback in the 800m. 																								If only I had clocked 0.1 second less in the 800 or done 10 cms more in javelin, gold would have been mine, lamented Soma. Her first reaction, after completing the 800 at least 10 metres ahead of Svetlana Kazanina was to look back how far the Kazakh was.																								Before the last event, I was fighting with her for bronze, so I wanted her to come in as far behind me as possible. And then I realised I could be in line for a bigger medal, said Soma.																								The gold eluded her, but it was a brave performance by someone who finished a poor fourth at last months Colombo ATF meet.

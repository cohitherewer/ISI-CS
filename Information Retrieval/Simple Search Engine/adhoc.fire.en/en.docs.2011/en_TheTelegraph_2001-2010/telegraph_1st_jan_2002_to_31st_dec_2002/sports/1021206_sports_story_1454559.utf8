		 Friday, December 06, 2002 				 Knight sees chance to fight back
				 	 Knight																								Sydney: England view the limited-overs series against Australia and Sri Lanka as a fresh start after demoralising losses in the first three Ashes Tests, one-day opening batsman Nick Knight said on Thursday.																								We know its going to be tough, but what a great challenge, said Knight in Sydney, where New South Wales host England in a warm-up match on Friday. Our guys are down, no doubt about it, added the 33-year-old left-hander who has played 17 Tests and 85 one-day Internationals.																								Now they can chance their arms and try to get back into cricket. It gives them the chance to perhaps win some battles and take that into the Tests, said Knight, who joins the one-day squad after missing out on Test selection. 																								The New South Wales team for Fridays game includes Steve Waugh, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee, and Mark Waugh.																								Knight said Lees raw pace, would also cause problems in the one-day arena. England face the Australians in Sydney on December 13 and in Melbourne two days later. 																								The Test series resumes in Melbourne from December 26-30, with the fifth and final match due to start in Sydney on January 2.  (REUTERS)

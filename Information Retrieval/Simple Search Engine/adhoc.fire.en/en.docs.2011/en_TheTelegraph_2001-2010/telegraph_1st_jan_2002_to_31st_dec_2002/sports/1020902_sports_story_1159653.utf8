		 Monday, September 02, 2002  BRIEFS
				 																																	London: England soccer captain David Beckhams wife Victoria gave birth to their second child on Sunday, a boy called Romeo. Victoria, the former Spice Girl known popularly known as Posh, underwent a two-hour caesarean operation before delivering the seven pound-four ounce boy.				 																																	Beckham admitted to being nervous but said that he wouldnt swap the experience for anything. Its always nervous having children but it is the greatest feeling in the world, he told reporters.				 																																	Beckham said they had chosen the name Romeo for the simplest of reasons. Its just a name we love, said the 26-year-old, adding that his first son Brooklyn was already doting on his younger brother in the hospital room. Brooklyn is in awe of him, he said. Beckham said his new-born son did not look unlike his eldest. He has Brooklyns nose and Victorias chin, he said. 				 																																	Rome: Hard-core fans of Serie A side Lazio, angry over the sale of two of the clubs best players, wreaked havoc late on Saturday night wrecking offices and burning cars around Romes main stadium.				 																																	Some 300 fans left the Olympic Stadium at the start of a friendly match between Lazio and Juventus and broke into some of the nearby national sports associations offices smashing computers, photocopiers and desks before setting fire to papers. On the way to the offices they burnt five cars, three kiosks and knifed two Juventus supporters in their buttocks. 				 																																	Spa-Francorchamps: Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone warned on Sunday that Belgium could lose its Spa Grand Prix unless they back down on a ban on tobacco advertising.				 																																	Ecclestone said the circuit  world champion Michael Schumachers favourite  could be dropped from the calendar unless Belgium backtracked on the ban, which is due to come into force on August 1, 2003.				 																																	I would give some very serious thought to doing that, yes, Ecclestone told reporters. Weve agreed in 2006 that were going to stop all tobacco advertising and its not fair that these people cannot play in the meantime. We hope they are going to be able to keep tobacco here to fall in line with everywhere else basically.				 																																	Melbourne: Australias Ian Thorpe is set to base himself in Monaco to strengthen his bid to become the worlds top 100m freestyle swimmer, an Australian newspaper said on Sunday.				 																																	Thorpe, 19, who is rumoured to be ready to announce a split with long-time coach Doug Frost, won five gold medals at the Pan Pacific Championships in Japan this week.				 																																	The teenager is keen to race more often against rivals such as Dutch Olympic 100m freestyle gold medallist and world record holder Pieter van den Hoogenband, the Sun-Herald said.				 																																	I reckon if he wants a change and wants to experience life in another country, we shouldnt stand in his way, Dawn Fraser said.				 																																	Berlin: Tottenham Hotspur defender Christian Ziege will miss Germanys opening Euro 2004 qualifier against Lithuania next Saturday after the death of his mother. I cannot imagine myself playing with the national team on Saturday, Ziege said on his website.				 																																	Ziege said he had returned to Munich on Friday to be with his father after learning that his mother had died from heart failure. 				 																																	Germany coach Rudi Voeller said he would decide on Monday whether to replace Ziege in his squad for the game in Kaunas. 				 																																	Dubai: World No. 1 Tiger Woods will compete in the 2003 Dubai Desert Classic from March 6-9, organisers of the PGA event announced on Sunday. It will be the second time in three years that the 26-year-old American has taken part in the Dubai tournament.				 																																	On his last trip to Dubai, Woods ended up losing out on the 72nd hole when he hit the water and had to settle for a share of second place with Padraig Harrington of Ireland, behind Dane Thomas Bjorn.				 																																	n Cricket, tri-series: Kenya vs Australia, from 11.55 am on ESPN n Tennis, US open, live from 8 pm and 4.30 am (Tuesday) on STAR Sports n Soccer, English Premier League: Liverpool vs Newcastle United, live from 12.25 am on ESPN

																								Colombo: Pakistan captain Waqar Younis says the continuing lack of international cricket in his country is a big disaster for players, administrators and supporters.																								The absence of teams going to Pakistan has also hit the PCB hard through a resultant lack of potentially lucrative sponsorship deals.																								While Waqar understands the reasons why teams are currently opting not to visit his country, he said it did not make it any easier to take.																								Waqar also hinted at the stresses and strains the current arrangements are placing on the players, who have become a nomadic team roaming from country to country without a base.																								From the Champions Trophy and the first Test against Australia in Colombo they head to Sharjah, followed by tours of Zimbabwe and South Africa.																								The hectic schedule has seen Wasim Akram and Saeed Anwar opt out of the Australia series and Waqar had sympathy for that decision. We dont really go home. I havent seen my parents, my wife and my kid for a while, he said. (Reuters)

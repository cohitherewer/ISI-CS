The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, December 29, 2002 				 Whispers of framework for solution
 							 - player terms controversy BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Dec. 28: Its probably a measure of the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) desperation that chief executive Malcolm Speed chose a traditional non-working day to disclose the contents of the Participating Nation Agreement signed by India. In any case, he is supposed to be on vacation. 																								This evenings leak, of course, has everything to do with the on-going Player Terms controversy.																								The Board of Control for India (BCCI), however, has no intention of promptly reacting and triggering another verbal war. President Jagmohan Dalmiya wasnt available for comment, but a very influential member did tell The Telegraph: If it comes to that, our lawyers alone will respond to the legality of what has been signed. For now, nothing needs to be said.																								Strong words but, then, nobody will publicly backtrack on an issue where stakes are sky-high.																								In fact, even though the ICC has been going overboard with the final offer bit, a source close to its commercial partners revealed that the framework of a solution is actually being put in place.																								Speaking exclusively this afternoon, the source pointed out: This framework should be ready by January 2/3 My understanding is that it will straightaway be placed before the BCCI and the players.																								Apparently, the solution is being jointly authored by the ICC and the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), which holds marketing rights for ICC events till the 2007 World Cup.																								Given the mood, it wont surprise if talk of negotiating a commercial rebate figures in what is offered afresh. Its another matter how that will be received. 																								Look, everybody must compromise to some extent  even the Indian players who, today, arent on a winning streak and cant afford to adopt that we-wont-budge attitude The lead-up to the Champions Trophy was different, as the Sourav Gangulys were on a roll. In the past few weeks, their bargaining power has definitely suffered, the source added.																								The BCCI (which alone is representing the players) may not quite agree with this assessment, but the ODI series (in New Zealand) is just one match old  in other words, Sourav and Co. do have the opportunity to re-claim lost bargaining power.																								Incidentally, as the two biggest sponsors, Pepsi and LG, are committed to supporting the ICC till 2007, both want the Terms business settled once and for all. Indeed, they can do without adverse publicity before every Champions Trophy and World Cup.																								As it turns out, even the BCCI wants this controversy to end for good. So, without much of an effort from either party, there already is a meeting point for both

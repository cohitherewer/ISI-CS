				 																																																	 It was a rare battle between father and son and in the end, the progeny won. 				 																																																	Upcoming Saurav Kothari got the better of his illustrious father, Manoj, by 1322-1144 points in the final of the Coca Cola state billiard championship at Bengal Rowing Club on Sunday. 				 																																																	In the final, Saurav got off to solid start, taking a lead of 173. However, Manoj reduced the margin on the back of an 87-point break. 				 																																																	In the next frame, Saurav again made the highest break of the meet  167, and extended the lead by 398-150. A couple of good breaks of 87 and 110 by Saurav increased his lead farther to 660-314 and it appeared he had clinched the issue. 				 																																																	After the first session, Saurav was leading by 736-418 points.				 																																																	Manoj, however, came back strongly in the second session and reduced the margin to 916-877. But it was a steep mountain to climb for Manoj and he had to settle for a 1144-1322 scoreline. 				 																																																	He was in very good form today and I just couldnt catch up, and said Manoj when asked if everything was fair, especially the beneficiary of the evening being his son. The veteran, however, added he was not in ideal form. 				 																																																	 Young shuttlers from Haldia stole the limelight in the inter-coaching centre invitation meet, held at Garfa on Sunday. Souvik Mondal of Haldia beat colleague Subhrajit Pal 11-8, 11-1 to win the under-8 boys and girls meet. In the girls under-12, Haldias Rimita Das edged past East Calcutta Anushilan Samitys Seshadri Sanyal 6-11, 11-7, 11-9 in the final while Subhankar Dey, another Haldia boy, won the under-12 boys title, beating Pallab Bose .

																								Colombo: The West Indian batting star Brian Lara will miss his teams tour of India due to illness, the West Indies team management said on Thursday. Lara was hospitalised with suspected hepatitis after scoring 111 against Kenya in the Champions Trophy on Tuesday.																								Brian has been advised by medical specialists in Colombo that he will miss the West Indies immediate cricketing commitments, team manager Ricky Skerrit said in a statement. That will obviously rule him out of the Indian tour and I have advised the West Indies selectors that a replacement will be needed for that tour.																								The statement however did not clarify whether the detailed medical tests on the star batsman had confirmed that he was suffering from hepatitis.																								The West Indies, scheduled to arrive in India after the Champions Trophy, will play three Test matches and seven ODIs against the hosts. The first Test starts in Mumbai on October 9.  (PTI)

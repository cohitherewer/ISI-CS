		 Thursday, December 12, 2002 				 Pakistan penalised in age scandal
																								Karachi: Pakistan were Wednesday slapped with a fine and suspensions by the AFC in Kuala Lumpur for fielding overaged players in an event earlier this year. Officials of the national federation here later said they will appeal.																								We have not yet been officially told of the decision, but once it is conveyed by the AFC we will appeal against the penalties because we never fielded overaged players, Pakistan Football Federation secretary Agha Liaquat Ali said.																								Wednesday the AFC slapped fines and sanctions on Pakistan and Yemen for fielding overaged players in Asias under-17 main rounds held in the United Arab Emirates in September. Eight Pakistani and four Yemeni players were found to be over-age.																								The players concerned and managers of both teams are suspended for two years while Pakistan and Yemen would be suspended from taking part in the next AFC under-17 event in 2004. Both countries were also fined $ 10,000. (AFP)

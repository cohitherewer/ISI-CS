		 Sunday, August 25, 2002 				 Hauritz gets maiden Test call-up
																								SERIES vs PAKistan																								Sydney, Aug. 24 (AP): Twenty-year-old Test rookie Nathan Hauritz was named in a 14-man Australian Test squad for the upcoming series against Pakistan.																								The squad, announced on Saturday, also includes Mark Waugh. Twin brother Steve remains skipper.																								The venue for the series has not been confirmed, although it will be played at a neutral location because the Australian Cricket Board wont send a team to Pakistan for safety reasons.																								Hauritz is an off-spinner who has represented Australia in limited-overs Internationals.																								Stuart MacGill was dropped from the squad that toured South Africa, with chairman of selectors Trevor Hohn saying his panel had opted for an off-spinner to partner Shane Warne rather than sending two leggies.																								Hauritzs inclusion will also give us some added variety in the spin department by having a player that can offer us quality spells of off-spin, he said.																								Hauritz said touring with the Test team would be a fantastic opportunity and it has come so soon after the selectors put me in the mix for the one-day team. 																								He is also part of the limited overs squad leaving on Monday for the tour of Kenya and the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka																								Steve, 37, hasnt been included in Australias limited-overs squad in recent series and earlier this month embarked on a short stint with Kent.																								SQUAD																								Steven Waugh (capt), Adam Gilchrist (vice-capt) Andrew Bichel, Jason Gillespie, Nathan Hauritz, Mathew Hayden, Justin Langer, Brett Lee, Darren Lehmann, Damien Martyn, Glenn Mcgrath, Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne, Mark Waugh.

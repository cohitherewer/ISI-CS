				 	 Youhana: 10th century																								Bulawayo: Yousuf Youhana scored his tenth century and completed 3,000 Test runs to guide Pakistan to a commanding position on the Day II of the second Test against Zimbabwe on Sunday.																								The Pakistani number five was unvanquished on 116 at stumps, with his team on 295 for five in reply to the hosts first innings 178, a lead of 117.																								Giving Youhana company in the unbeaten sixth-wicket stand of 70 was Kamran Akmal on 27.																								Youhana, who put on 127 for the fourth wicket with Younis Khan, was dropped on 88 by substitute Blessing Mahwire off left arm spinner Ray Price.																								The centurion survived again when, on 105, he drove Mluleki Nkala and was dropped by Hamilton Masakadza at short cover.																								At close, Youhana had been at the crease for almost five hours, faced 225 balls and hit 15 fours. 																								Pakistan resumed on 29 without loss and lost their first wicket in the 13th over when Salim Elahi dragged a delivery from Olonga on to his pads and then his stumps to be bowled for 27.																								That ended an opening stand of 63 shared with Taufeeq Umar, who departed in Olongas next over.  (REUTERS)

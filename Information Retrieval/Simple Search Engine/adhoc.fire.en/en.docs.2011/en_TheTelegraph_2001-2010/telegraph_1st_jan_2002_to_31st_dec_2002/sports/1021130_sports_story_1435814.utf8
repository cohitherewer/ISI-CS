		 Saturday, November 30, 2002  Priceless may bounce back to form 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore: Ganapathys ward Priceless, who surprisingly lost the Mysore 2000 Guineas as an odds on favourite, may bounce back to her old form to lift the 1,600m Bangalore 1000 Guineas, the first classic of the season on Saturday.				 										Going by her recent gallops, the Placerville-Queen To Conquer filly looks to be in great heart and the Guineas could be an easy picking for her in the hands Mark Gallagher.				 										Incidentally, the Mysore Turf Club has decided to cancel races scheduled for December 2.				 										SELECTIONS				 										1.30 pm: Noble Fantasy 1. Cybergenic 2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, December 17, 2002 				 Bangla fall for 194
																								Chittagong: West Indies pace bowlers Pedro Collins and Daren Powell took three wickets each to help dismiss Bangladesh for 194 on the first day of the second Test on Monday.																								Sanwar Hossain and skipper Khaled Mashud scored 36 and 32 respectively in the home sides modest total, while tail-ender Manjurul Islam hit 21 from 22 balls. Mohammed Ashraful struck Collins for two boundaries in the same over but was then caught at wide mid-off trying for a third.																								Sanwar tried to pull Jermaine Lawson in the next over but only managed to edge the ball to West Indies captain Ridley Jacobs behind the stumps. He struck four boundaries.																								Alok Kapali (two) failed again, offering a catch to Chris Gayle, while Enamul Haque became Lawsons second victim when he was caught for eight. 																								At close West Indies, who won the first Test in Dhaka by an innings and 310 runs within three days, were 38 for one, with Chris Gayle on 10 and Ramnaresh Sarwan on 14. 																								Stumps were drawn early because of bad light after Wavell Hinds was caught behind for 14 off quick bowler Tapash Baishya.  (REUTERS)

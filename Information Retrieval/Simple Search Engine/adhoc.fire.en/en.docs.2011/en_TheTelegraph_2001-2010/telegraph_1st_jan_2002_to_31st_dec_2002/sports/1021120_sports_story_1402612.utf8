		 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 Injured Giles out 
				 	 Hussain: More injury worries																								Adelaide: England suffered another injury setback here tonight with spinner Ashley Giles ruled out for six weeks with a broken wrist. Giles joined Darren Gough, Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff in the injury brigade when he was struck on the wrist by a delivery from rookie paceman Steve Harmison while batting in the nets at the Adelaide Oval Tuesday.																								It robbed England of their most successful bowler from their crushing first Test loss at the Gabba nine days ago, leaving Paceman Andrew Caddick as the only bowler with any genuine experience in the tourists attack.																								England must now call upon Yorkshire off-spinner Richard Dawson to bowl against the Australian batsmen.																								Giles would have been the backbone of any fightback by England after taking six wickets in the 384-run drubbing at the Gabba. It was the first ball I faced from Harmy and it hit me on the point of the wrist, Giles said in the evening.																								At first I thought it was bruising so I kept batting and completed my net but it got worse and worse and now Im told Im out for six weeks, which is disappointing.																								Giles hopes to return for the fourth Test in Melbourne on Boxing Day.Captain Nasser Hussain must now put his trust in 22-year-old Dawson, who has played just three Tests, taking six wickets at an average of 46.50 in India last year.																								Flintoff remains unlikely																								Meanwhile, Hussains all-rounder Andrew Flintoff remained unlikely for the second Test, the skipper had conceded earlier in the day.																								Flintoff, who underwent surgery on a groin injury before England left for Australia, missed the first Test in Brisbane, which England lost by 384 runs. Our general opinion is that Andrew is not fit enough to play in the Test match, Hussain said.																								However Hussain was not prepared to say that all-rounder Craig White, who replaced Flintoff in the first Test, would fill the role again in Adelaide .																								White scored just 25 runs and took two wickets in the first Test and Kent batsman Robert Key whose 174 in Englands second innings against Australia A in Tasmania saved the game for the visitors is tipped to take his place. (He) has a good chance of playing... the old days of chopping and changing certainly arent where were at and were going to give people a good chance to show what they can do and that includes Robert Key.																								Hussain said dismissing Australias opening batsman Matthew Hayden was key for England. When someone gets 300 runs in a Test match youre stupid if you dont go away and re-think.																								He spoke positively of his bowling attack on Tuesday, despite conceding 364 for two on the first day of the first Test and finally dismissing Australia for 492 in their first innings.Its about time we put it to Australia and that wont come from being down. It will come from hard work, a bit of guts and digging deep, Hussain said. (REUTERS)

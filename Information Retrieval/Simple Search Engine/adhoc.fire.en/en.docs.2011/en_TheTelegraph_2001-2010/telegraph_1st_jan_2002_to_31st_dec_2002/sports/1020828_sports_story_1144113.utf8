		 Wednesday, August 28, 2002 				 Pak pack off Youhana
 (AGENCIES)				 	 youhana: False stroke																								Karachi: Yousuf Youhana has been dropped from the squad and sent back home from Kenya on disciplinary grounds. I will not comment on the issue until I meet the PCB chairman and tell him my side of the story, Youhana said Tuesday.																								It happened to be the batsmans 28th birthday. I would term it as my bad luck and dont want to say anything more. Pakistan team manager Yawar Saeed offered no explanation.																								Pakistan take on world champions Australia and hosts Kenya in a double-leg tri-series from Thursday, an event shifted from Karachi over security fears.																								Saeed said a detailed report has been sent to the PCB but declined to give further information. Officials of the Kenya Cricket Association refused to discuss the issue.																								The Pakistan team, currently on a two-day safari trip to the Masai Mara reserve forest, is expected back in Nairobi later.																								Youhanas expulsion could be a body blow for a Pakistan team which lost three of their four matches in the Morocco Cup earlier this month.																								Youhana becomes only the second Pakistani player to be sent home on disciplinary grounds. Leg-spinner Abdul Qadir was sent home from New Zealand in 1984-85 following a dispute with captain Zaheer Abbas.																								A PCB source said Youhana was sent home on disciplinary grounds and his expulsion was endorsed by PCB chairman Tauqir Zia. The PCB chief has endorsed Youhanas expulsion, the spokesman said.																								Aussies arrive																								The Ricky Ponting-led Australian team arrived in Nairobi Tuesday after one of their longest breaks from international cricket in almost a decade. Australia will be keen to avoid a repeat of their last visit to Kenya when they were beaten in their first match of the ICC KnockOut Trophy in October 2000.																								Kenya coach Sandeep Patil said his team wants to keep up the tempo after beating Bangladesh A 3-0.

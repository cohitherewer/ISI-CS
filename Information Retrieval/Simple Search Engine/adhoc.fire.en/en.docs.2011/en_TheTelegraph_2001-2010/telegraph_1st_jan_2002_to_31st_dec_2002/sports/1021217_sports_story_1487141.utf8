																								Wellington: After a harrowing experience on a lively Basin Reserve pitch in the first Test, the tourists might have to face a similar challenge at Hamiltons Westpac Park for the second Test of the series.																								India struggled on a seamer-friendly track to score 161 and 121 in the Wellington Test and were handed a 10-wicket drubbing. The Westpac groundsman sounded a warning saying even a faster and bouncier track would welcome the visitors there.																								The bounce on them (practice wickets) is the highest I have ever had  they are going through the roof. Hopefully that will be reflected on the main pitch, said groundsman Doug Strachan.																								The shorter players could find things a little tricky.																								Strachan however added that rain could play spoilsport in giving final touches to the track.																								We gave the pitch the final dose of water last night and early this morning. But it was scary when you saw the forecast last night. 																								Though I think we might miss the worst of what was forecast. But if I can get a good couple of days in, we might just edge the Basin, he said.																								That should not be good news for the Indians if their showing in Wellington is anything to go by. (PTI)

		 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 Tiger closes in on sixth title
																								Thomastown (Ireland), Sept. 21 (Reuters): Tiger Woods birdied the last two holes for a five-under-par 67 and a five-shot lead after Day III of the WGC-American Express Championship on Saturday.																								The world No. 1, two clear of the field overnight, finished at 19-under 197 and is comfortably placed to win the sixth WGC title of his career.																								Sharing second place at 14-under 202 were David Toms, Scott McCarron, Steve Lowery, Jerry Kelly, Vijai Singh and Retief Goosen, while Rocco Mediate was in eighth a stroke back.																								With his 54-hole aggregate, Woods shattered the previous tournament record of nine-under 207, set by Japans Hidemichi Tanaka in Valderrama in 2000. 																								Several spectators, meanwhile, were injured after being hit by an out-of-control golf buggy. None of the injuries was serious with the worst of them a suspected ankle. 																								The driver of the buggy lost control of his vehicle and ploughed into the spectators flanking the fairway.

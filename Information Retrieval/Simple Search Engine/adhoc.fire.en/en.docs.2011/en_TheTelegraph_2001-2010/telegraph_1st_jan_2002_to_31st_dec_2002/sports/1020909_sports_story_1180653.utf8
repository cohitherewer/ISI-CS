The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, September 09, 2002 				 Criticism has given me confidence: Kumble
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								London: Most people only seem to remember that Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid made their Test debut in England. Yet, six years before their maiden appearance, Anil Kumbles first Test was also in England.																								This tour-about-to-end, then, hasnt just been like any other for Kumble  only the second bowler to have got all ten wickets in a Test innings. Kumble, who is reluctant for one-to-one interviews, did speak to The Telegraph on the eve of The Oval Test.																								The following are excerpts																								On a dozen years of Test cricket (debut at Old Trafford, 1990)																								Its been a good 12 years... Back in 1990, I didnt expect to be where I am  with well over 300 wickets in Tests and close to 300 in the ODIs... Feels nice, certainly. At the same time, one or two ambitions are yet to be achieved.																								On whether he has sights on anything in particular																								Well, yes... I would like to be part of a World Cup-winning team... That we lost in the semi-finals, in 1996 (to Sri Lanka, at the Eden), still hurts.																								On the experience factor																								Every game teaches something new, one can learn from every situation... Actually, Ive had to learn from my own bowling because there havent been many bowlers like me. For instance, its been difficult going back to someone and checking whether what Im doing is right... I dont see myself as an orthodox bowler.																								On those he is indebted to																								Quite a few, in fact... Plenty of former cricketers... Chandrasekhar, Bedi, Prasanna... Viswanath... Even many teammates... I would even say that interacting with outstanding contemporaries like Warne and Murali has helped. Its nice to exchange ideas, share thoughts.																								On the phases in his career																								Let me answer this generally: Ive never shirked responsibility, have never ever thought I cant do it... Ive been pretty consistent and have always been positive.																								On how many marks would he give himself on a scale of ten																								(Laughs) Back in 1990, probably four-five... One is wise after an event but, yes, I was absolutely raw... Today, Ill probably give myself seven... One learns with experience, learns from mistakes... In any case, nobody can ever give himself ten on ten.																								On whether he agrees the learning process would have been expedited had he been picked for the 1991-92 tour of Australia																								(After a pause) Though people do say that, its difficult for me to answer... Even otherwise, being the positive sort, I dont look back and say I should have done that or I ought to have been there... I didnt brood, but worked hard at everything  batting and fielding included. It helped that Daljit Singh, who was then working with Karnataka, gave a number of tips (fielding, fitness)... However, its a fact that Ive been to Australia just once in 12 years.																								On criticism that, overseas, he is only half as good as at home																								Ive always given that hundred per cent... Moreover, if you scan the teams I played in throughout the Nineties you will find we often missed a fourth bowler... It would invariably be Srinath, Prasad and me... My role would be both to block one end and try to take wickets... I wouldnt be wrong in saying I often ended up bowling around 30 overs on the very first day of a Test overseas... I dont think statistics always reflect the true picture. To cite an example, people talk of batting averages... Forty-plus, 45-plus... The question is: How effective have the runs been? To what extent have they contributed to the team winning?																								On whether the criticism has affected him																								On the contrary, thats given me confidence... Somewhere, at least, Im a good bowler. Im, at least, given credit for wins at home.																								On the about-to-end England tour																								Ever since Ive come back from injury and surgery, there seems to be something working against me... I got injured in the West Indies and had to return home, then I had to miss the Trent Bridge Test (owing to a left calf muscle strain)... The last injury, which first surfaced during the NatWest, came at such a wrong time because I was feeling really good about my bowling... I think I did well at Headingley and, now, its all about trying to end on a high. Rhythm helps, as do results...																								On missing international cricket for almost a year, from mid-October 2000																								Yes, negative thoughts did crop up... There was that fear I may not return the same bowler, that I could... Even three months after surgery, I was trying to lift my right hand and, so, it really was a tough period. But, then, the family  especially my wife (Chetna)  gave plenty of support and Srinath was an inspiration. That he could come back so well after surgery is what helped me drive away negative thoughts.																								On the batsmen who have made him work harder																								Look, every wicket is important and every batsman can be difficult to dislodge... The Waugh brothers have been very fine players of spin, Aravinda, Kallis... Lara as well... The conditions, too, play a part.																								On how he psyches himself																								I picture the wicket, think of what my role could be and, in the mind, work out ways to get all ten wickets... I think of options, of the field placements... Indeed, while preparing, I assume we will be bowling first... Thats because, honestly, Im a bit nervous the previous evening and that nervousness remains till the toss... After all, till the coin is flipped, you dont know whether the team will bat or bowl first.																								On being regarded as a thinking cricketer																								Well, these labels get stuck... Even if I perform overseas, Im still seen as somebody who can only help win at home...																								On records																								Till you told me, I wasnt even aware Id crossed Willis (325) and Donald (330)...																								On whether he envies any bowler																								I would love to have Warnes variation, love to get the amount of turn he extracts... While you definitely cant be somebody else, there will always be something to learn. Its important to try and be one-up on the batsmen. If I may add, bottomline is creating a doubt in the batsmans mind... Currently, Im trying a different grip.																								On what makes a complete leg-spinner																								(Laughs again) Dont know... Dont think anybody can be complete... If somebody does come close, its Warne. Generally, while experience helps you to improve, it also makes you aware of limitations.																								On his courageous act in Antigua, earlier this year																								Look, if your mind says you can do it, you shouldnt move away from the firing line... So, despite the broken jaw, pain and that bandage, I decided to bowl... The only time I havent bowled all these years is when I had that shoulder injury...																								Finally, on bowling in tandem with Harbhajan Singh																								Its great... Hes aggressive, is very talented... At the same time, hes young and should be allowed to mature. Its not always easy and people must continue to have faith in him... The expectations shouldnt become unreasonable.

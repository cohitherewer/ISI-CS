		 Thursday, October 03, 2002 				 3 Malaysians test positive
																								Busan: Three Malaysian sepak takraw players were sent home on Wednesday after testing positive for morphine in the first doping case of the Pusan Asian Games, a senior Malaysian sports official said.																								The three Malaysians  Mohamed Haniff Azaman, Mohamed Aznan Raslan and Mohamed Firdaus Ghani  were disqualified after traces of morphine were detected in a test conducted in Malaysia, Malaysian delegation head Dr Khalid bin Yunus said.																								There was a positive result and as far as were concerned whenever that happens, we must take action, he said of the decision taken by the disciplinary committee of the the Malaysian team. There can be no compromise, he said.																								The departure of the trio left the Malaysian sepak takraw team with nine players, Khalid said. Malaysia face Brunei on Thursday.																								Morphine is banned in Malaysia and by the International Olympic Committee.																								Basketball face-off																								The recent thaw in North-South relations could count for little when the two Koreas face off in the Asian Games basketball on Thursday.																								Hosts South Korea have never lost to the North in five previous games, but will face a giant-sized headache in trying to stop 2.36 metre centre Ri Myung-hun at Gumjong Gymnasium.																								South Korea, who topped preliminary group B, will still be favourites to make it six straight wins after demolishing Mongolia 145-65 and then easing past Japan 79-62 in their opening games. (Reuters)

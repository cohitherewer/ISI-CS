				 	 cairns																								Napier: A fine show against the Indians in the three-day tie here earned Central Districts pacer Michael Mason on Sunday a place in New Zealands 12-member squad for the first Test starting in Wellington on Thursday.																								Mason, who grabbed three wickets in Indias first innings, will have a toss-up for the third seamers slot in the final XI with Jacob Oram, who pulled out of the three-day game because of a groin strain. 																								Orams ODI experience may, however, tilt the scales in his favour. Either of them will serve as back-up to Shane Bond and Daryll Tuffey. Oram, 24, who has represented the country in 25 one-day Internationals, is still looking to play his first Test.																								THE SQUAD																								Stephen Fleming (captain), Nathan Astle, Shane Bond, Robbie Hart, Craig McMillan, Michael Mason, Jacob Oram, Mark Richardson, Scott Styris, Daryl Tuffey, Daniel Vettori and Lou Vincent.

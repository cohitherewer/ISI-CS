 BY OUR STAFF REPORTERS																								Calcutta: He is there to ensure that Sourav and his boys are all fit and fine, but Indias physio Andrew Leipus himself turned up at the CAB medical unit Wednesday to get himself treated for a lower-back trouble. Nothing serious, informed unit in-charge Dr Sibu Dutta, adding that Leipus needed some ultra-sound treatment.																								Not the right end																								Cops posted at the Club House lower tier had this additional brief of controlling crowd movement over the sightscreen. Only, they forgot there was no need to do this when the bowler was running in from the opposite end.																								Dont move, do so only after the over, former Bengal and East Zone cricketer Joydeep Mukherjee was warned. It wont matter because movement from this end wont affect batsmen, Joydeep said. Nothing doing, came the reply and Joydeep had no choice but to comply.																								Scoring a ton																								S.A. Rahman, the popular press-box scorer, is keeping journalists happy for a long time now. This Test is his 100th as scorer. He made his debut in the 1969 Australia Test. Informed about this, CAB supremo Jagmohan Dalmiya announced that Rahman will be presented a CAB tie before the start of Day II.

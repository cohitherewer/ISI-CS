		 Monday, November 11, 2002 				 Parthiv best since my days, says Engineer
				 	 Parthiv Patel																								London: Young Indian wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel is been highly regarded following his impressive performance in the recently concluded Test series against the West Indies. 																								The latest addition to the growing list of admirers for the keeper is Farokh Engineer, who kept wickets for India between 1962 to 1976 in 56 Tests.																								Patel is the best wicketkeeper I have seen since my days, Engineer said. His eye co-ordination is very good. He rises with the ball and is a gutsy cricketer, he said.																								He also feels that India has a good chance of winning the next years World Cup in South Africa. I am not a gambler. But I am prepared to bet on the Indian team. If they can get to combine together, they can win the World Cup, Engineer said.																								He feels that India currently have the best batting line-up with Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman.																								We have also good bowlers in Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble and Ashish Nehra. Though Jawagal Srinath is a Test bowler, he is certainly good enough to walk into the side. 																								Terming Sourav as an improved captain, he added: If we improve the fielding a little and hold our catches, we can definitely beat any team. (PTI)

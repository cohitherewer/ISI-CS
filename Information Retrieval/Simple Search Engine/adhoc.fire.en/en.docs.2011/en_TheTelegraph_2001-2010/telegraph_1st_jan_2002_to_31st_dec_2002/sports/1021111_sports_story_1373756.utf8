 							 - first test l Sri Lanka fold up for 130, suffer innings defeat in three days				 	 Makhaya Ntini after taking the wicket of Russell Arnold for a duck on the third day of the first Test in Johannesburg Sunday. (Reuters)																								Johannesburg: Andrew Hall picked up three wickets for just one run as South Africa beat Sri Lanka by an innings and 64 runs in the first Test at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on Sunday.																								Hall wrapped up the tail 25 minutes before tea on day three as Sri Lanka were dismissed for 130 in their second innings. Earlier, South Africa totalled 386 in their first innings. South Africa now have a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series. The second Test starts on Friday.																								Hall bowled Ruchira Perera to wrap up the match just as rain started to fall at the Wanderers. His demolition job was all the more important as by the time the South African players finished their lap of honour in front of the 7,000 spectators rain was falling heavily and thunder rumbling nearby.																								With a first innings deficit of 194, any thoughts Sri Lanka had of saving the game quickly evaporated as they were reduced to 25 for four with Makhaya Ntini and Shaun Pollock both claiming two wickets each.																								First Russell Arnold edged Ntinis first ball to Jacques Kallis at second slip to depart for a golden duck and suffer a pair. Ntini then struck again in his fourth over with Kumar Sangakkara turning him down the leg side only to see wicketkeeper Mark Boucher take a spectacular catch.																								Pollock then had Mahela Jayawardene snapped up expertly by Gary Kirsten at short-leg for one to leave the visitors struggling at 21 for three. The South African captain grabbed his second wicket four runs later when Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya edged onto his stumps for a duck.																								Although Maravan Atapattu and Hashan Tillekeratne steadied the innings briefly with a partnership of 52 for the fifth wicket, Steve Elworthy had Atapattu caught at third slip by Graeme Smith for 43.																								Debutant Hasantha Fernando became the second Sri Lankan to record a pair in the match when he was leg before to Elworthy for nought. Chaminda Vaas contributed 32 before pulling Ntini straight to mid-wicket and Hall struck with his first ball with no addition to the score when Tillekeratne was caught at mid-off by Elworthy for 27.																								Hall struck again three balls later when Muttiah Muralidharan was clean bowled for a duck.																								Earlier, Sri Lanka wrapped up the South African innings quickly as the home side added just eight runs to their overnight 378 for seven. Muralidharan trapped Hall leg before without adding to his 31 with the fifth ball of the day.  (REUTERS)

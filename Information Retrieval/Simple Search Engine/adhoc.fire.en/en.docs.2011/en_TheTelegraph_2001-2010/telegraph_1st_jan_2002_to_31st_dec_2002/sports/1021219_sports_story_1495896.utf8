																								Rio De Janeiro: South Americans were surprised and upset at Fifas decision to reduce their places saying the continents soccer tradition was overlooked in favour of simple numbers.																								Fifa agreed to a shake-up in the World Cup allocation system on Tuesday. The South American confederation (CSF), had their allocation trimmed by half a place and they will have four teams at the next World Cup.																								Uefa will lose half a place, meaning 13 countries will qualify from Europe, plus hosts Germany. Concacaf, the North and Central American Confederation, gain half a place to 3-1/2, while the African confederation continue to have five places and Asia stay with 4-1/2. (Reuters)

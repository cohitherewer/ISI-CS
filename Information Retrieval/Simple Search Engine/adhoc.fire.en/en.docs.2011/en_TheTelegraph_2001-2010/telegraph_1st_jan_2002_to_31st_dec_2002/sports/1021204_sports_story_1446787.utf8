																								London: Former England captain Ian Botham has said current skipper Nasser Hussain should lose his job in the wake of the teams Ashes thrashing in Australia.																								An innings defeat by Steve Waughs men in Perth saw England lose their eighth successive Ashes series, Australia taking an unbeatable 3-0 lead.																								It was too much to take for legendary allrounder Botham who, apart from calling for Hussains also said wicketkeeper Alec Stewart and fast bowler Andy Caddick should have their international careers terminated.																								Enough is enough. After yet another Ashes series defeat, its time to clear out the dead wood and build a brave new England, Botham told Tuesdays edition of The Daily Mirror.																								England must bite the bullet and bid farewell to Alec Stewart, Andy Caddick and, Im sorry to say, Nasser Hussain as Test captain.																								Botham said he had often waved the flag for England since Hussain took over and he deserves the nations gratitude for restoring their credibility.																								But he added that the current series had clearly taken its toll.																								Nasser did a great job in marshalling those memorable wins against the West Indies, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, but now he looks shell-shocked. (AFP)

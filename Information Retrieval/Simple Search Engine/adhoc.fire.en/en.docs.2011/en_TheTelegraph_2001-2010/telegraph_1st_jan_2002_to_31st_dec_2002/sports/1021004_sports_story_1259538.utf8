		 Friday, October 04, 2002 				 Pak open to venue shift to get India
																								Islamabad: Pakistan has said that it is willing to move the venue of next years Asia Cup from Lahore to Bangladesh if India confirmed its participation in the tournament.																								I have proposed to move the competition to Bangladesh but only if the Board of Control for Cricket in India submits its governments approval in writing to the Asian Cricket Council, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Lt Gen Tauqir Zia said on Wednesday.																								The offer was made when Zia met BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya during the ICCs Executive Board meeting in Colombo on Monday and Tuesday.																								Dalmiya conveyed to me that he had verbal permission from New Delhi to play Pakistan in any multilateral tournament on neutral venues. But I have asked for written permission before formally agreeing to shift the tournament, Zia said.																								He said the ball was in Indias court and reiterated that Pakistan will not play in India until the Indians visit Pakistan.																								May critical of ICC 																								The International Cricket Council shows a lack of respect for cricketers, Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica) chief executive Tim May said in Sydney Thursday.																								May said the ICCs lack of respect comes over their refusal to accept greater player representation within its organisation. Crickets world governing body on Tuesday rejected moves to recognise a players association, raising fears of a prolonged battle to settle contracts ahead of next years World Cup.  (AGENCIES)

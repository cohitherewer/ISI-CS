																								Zurich: Crowning a triumphant year in which he fought off allegations of corruption to be re-elected Fifa president, Sepp Blatter is reported to have married a former dolphin trainer.																								According to a report in a Swiss daily on Friday, the low-key ceremony last Monday at a registry office in Blatters home state of Valais came as a surprise even to friends of the most powerful man in world soccer.																								It may be unexpected for some people, but for us its sheer good fortune, wrote Blatter and his new bride, Graziella Bianca, in a wedding announcement to friends and relations, according to the paper.																								Bianca, 40, is a friend of Blatters 39-year-old daughter Corinne. She used to work as spokeswoman and dolphin trainer at a Swiss entertainment park, Conny Land, before quitting 18 months ago because she disagreed about how the animals were treated, the daily said.																								Bianca is the third wife of 66 year-old Blatter, who has long proclaimed that soccer and Fifa, its world governing body, are the loves of his life.																								Fifa offices and Valais civil authorities could not be reached for confirmation of the wedding because offices were closed for the seasonal break. 																								The daily, which enjoys close links with Blatter, said the happy couple had left for honeymoon in an unknown destination on Christmas Day.  (AP)

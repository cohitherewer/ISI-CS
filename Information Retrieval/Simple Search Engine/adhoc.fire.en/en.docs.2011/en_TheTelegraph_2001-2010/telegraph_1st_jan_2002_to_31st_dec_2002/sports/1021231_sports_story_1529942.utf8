Hewitt reckoned it was weird for the former world No. 4 to try to play on the ATP Tour in January and yet pull out of the Davis Cup tie against Australia in Sydney in February.				 																																	I think I know my body better than Lleyton, replied Rusedski. He hasnt undergone two foot surgeries. When you havent got the gist of the whole story its pretty hard to make an assessment. I think I am the best judge of the situation.

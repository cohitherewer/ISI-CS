		 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 Pollock all praise for Pakistan
																								Port Elizabeth: South African captain Shaun Pollock said his team had been outplayed in every department after their record defeat to Pakistan in the second one-day International Wednesday.																								South Africas reply to Pakistans 335 for six with 153 all out.																								When youre chasing a huge score like that you tend to either get close or get bowled out cheaply. Theres no point in aiming for 280, you have to try to make the score but we just couldnt get any partnerships going, Pollock said after the match.																								Obviously we didnt play well but they did and they deserve a lot of credit, particularly the two batsmen who put the partnership together, Pollock said.																								Opener Salim Elahi (135) and all rounder Abdul Razzaq (112) posted 257 runs for the second wicket. We would be even more disappointed if the result had anything to do with complacency from our side but I dont believe it did. It just puts into perspective how good this Pakistan team can be.

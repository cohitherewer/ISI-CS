The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, August 26, 2002 				 Hewitt runs into an even field
 (AP)				 	 HEWITT: Unenviable task																								New York: Andre Agassi was trading practice shots with Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 32-degree Celsius heat under a midday sun. Along the edges of the court and in parts of the stands at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, workers were hammering and drilling, putting up signs and setting up electronic equipment.																								Agassis game long ago ceased being that sort of work-in-progress.																								Im just trying to get better as an all-around athlete at this point, he says. At 32, Im not going to make real changes, although youre always tweaking.																								When the US Open starts Monday, the sixth-seeded Agassi will be among a group of contenders aiming to take the title from defending champion Lleyton Hewitt of Australia.																								In womens tennis, discussion of challengers for the years last Grand Slam title pretty much begins with one name: Williams.																								Not so with the men.																								It looks like theres a bunch of guys who could come out of the woodwork, said John McEnroe says. Theres total openness in mens tennis now.																								Indeed, when the top-ranked Hewitt won Wimbledon in July, he ended a stretch in which eight men had won the preceding eight major championships.																								Unheralded players such as Albert Costa and Thomas Johansson (who withdrew from the US Open with a shoulder injury) have emerged to add Grand Slam champion to their resumes.																								Its awfully tough to handicap the Open, with Hewitt, two-time winner Agassi, 2001 semi-finalist Kafelnikov, 2000 champion Marat Safin, No. 3 Tommy Haas and No. 11 Andy Roddick all boasting games that could take them to the title.																								And then, of course, theres Pete Sampras. Hes struggled through a disappointing year with a 20-16 record and early exits from Grand Slam tournaments.																								Sampras keeps changing coaches, has talked about switching to a different kind of racket, and has generally seemed more out of sorts on court than ever before.																								Hes obviously playing with as little confidence as hes had probably his whole career, says McEnroe, who won seven major singles titles, including four at the Open.																								I still dont believe that hes ready to throw in the towel. He could still do something.																								For all his problems  more than 30 tournaments without a title since he won his 13th Grand Slam event in July 2000  Sampras has played superbly at the last two US Opens.																								He reached the final on both occasions, and last years run included consecutive victories over past champions Agassi (in a four-tiebreaker thriller), Safin and Pat Rafter.																								My goal is to win another major and I believe I can in this years US Open, even though I havent shown much this year, Sampras says.																								When I didnt play well five years ago, I could still win. Thats not true today.																								The pool of possible winners is distinctly smaller in the womens section with the Williams sisters starting as overwhelming favourites. Not that there is no challenge, with the likes of Jennifer Capriati, Justin Henin and Kim Clijsters lurking around, but Venus and Serena are already plotting another family final.																								The sisters have met in three of the last four Grand Slam finals with Serena emerging the winner in France and in Wimbledon. She has, in fact, topped Venus on all three occasion the sisters have met this year so far.

Senegal midfielder Salif Diao scored the goal in the 66th minute as Gerard Houlliers side won their fifth consecutive league match.																								Midfielder Dietmar Hamann created the breakthrough when his through-ball split the Leeds defence, releasing El Hadji Diouf whose cross was stabbed in by Diao at the near post.

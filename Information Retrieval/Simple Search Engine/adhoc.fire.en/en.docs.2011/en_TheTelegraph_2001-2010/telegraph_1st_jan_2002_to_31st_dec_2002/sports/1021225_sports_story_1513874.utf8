The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, December 25, 2002 				 BCCIs legal cover before offensive
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Jaitley: Special invitee																								Calcutta: Before taking on the International Cricket Council (ICC) one more time, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is getting its defence in order.																								Towards that end, former Union law minister Arun Jaitley will be present at Wednesdays EGM as a special invitee, while Justice (retd.) R.S.Pathaks opinion on the controversial Player Terms for theWorld Cup will be circulated amongst the 30 affiliates.																								[Though Jaitley is the Delhi amp; Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) president, he will be around purely as a legal luminary. Jaitley enjoyed the same status during a working committee meeting, earlier in the year. The DDCA, one learns, will be represented by another office-bearer.] 																								Understandably, the BCCI doesnt want to leave anything to chance if push comes to shove in its on-going tussle with the ICC.																								Going by the mood during the meeting of key functionaries last week, the BCCI (as reported by The Telegraph on December 21) is set to reject the ICCs final offer on the Terms.																								An announcement is expected after the EGM.																								The final offer, after all, remains loaded against Indian interests and the BCCI cant be seen as letting the players down  more so after the Sourav Gangulys and Sachin Tendulkars have left it to president Jagmohan Dalmiya to do the needful.																								The ICC is insisting the players dont feature in endorsements which conflict with its own commercial partners from 30 days before the February 8-beginning tournament till five days after the March 23 final, while the BCCI (for now) is firm on the clause being enforced during the tournament only.																								Additionally, while the ICC wants the players to make themselves available (to the event sponsors) for imaging over a period of three months after the final, the BCCI favours two. Moreover, it is opposed to players with conflicting pre-existing (personal) contractual agreements being listed for imaging.																								If the ICC is to be believed, its commercial partners wont offer any more concessions. Yet, this could change if the EGM authorises Dalmiya to open a dialogue with the three key commercial partners (Pepsi, LG, Hero Honda) who have millions at stake in India.																								Really, that will be logical as the World Cup calls for fielding the very best.																								The BCCI, for its part, will be looking for an undertaking that no compensation will be sought (from the ICCs business arm, the IDI Ltd) even if the Indian players dont respect the Terms in full.																								According to well-placed sources, the BCCI may even lobby the government to suitably exercise influence. If it does come to that, its unlikely that the three sponsors will be as rigid.																								Its another matter that all three (as also others) were promised the moon by the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC) and the IDI Ltd. The GCC, or World Sport Group as it was then known, bagged marketing rights for all ICC events till the 2007 World Cup in the summer of 2000.																								Its a fact, of course, that India signed the Cricket Events Agreement without a fuss and, so, its own defence has holes. No surprise, then, that the ICC keeps reminding Dalmiya and Co. about obligations listed in that (mother) Agreement.																								At the same time, the ICC is off the mark in claiming that the list of its commercial partners was conveyed to all 14 participating nations in January this year. The BCCI, at least, was informed as late as May 9																								While the ICC has sought to rubbish distinctly uncomfortable questions raised by the BCCI, specially with regard to its contract with GCC, failure to provide crystal-clear answers is reducing its stock even more.																								With the EGMs one-point agenda ( to discuss latest developments in the matter pertaining to sponsorship and players endorsements) scheduled to be discussed in a few hours, a full-fledged war is set to replace the skirmishes.

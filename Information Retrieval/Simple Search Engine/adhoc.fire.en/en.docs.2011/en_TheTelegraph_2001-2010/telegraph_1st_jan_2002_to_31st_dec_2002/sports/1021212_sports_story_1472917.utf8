		 Thursday, December 12, 2002 				 Campbell, Friend star in victory
																								Kwekwe (Zimbabwe): Zimbabwe comfortably took a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series against Kenya here Wednesday with one match to play. The first encounter produced no result in Harare because of rain.																								This time the hosts pulled off the victory aided by fine innings from captain Alistair Campbell and Travis Friend, who put on a match-winning second wicket partnership of 146.																								Zimbabwe, put into bat by Kenya captain Steve Tikolo, scored 273 for four. In reply the Kenyans were 181 for the loss of six wickets when umpires Alim Dar of Pakistan and Ahmed Esat of Zimbabwe offered them the light with six overs left.																								This gave Zimbabwe victory based on the Duckworth-Lewis calculation. At that stage, with 93 runs needed for victory from six overs there was no prospect of a Kenyan victory. (AFP)

		 Saturday, August 31, 2002 				 Sehwag blasts 104
				 	 Sehwag: Lights up dull day																								Derby: Virender Sehwag struck a blistering hundred in the second innings as the three-day game between the Indians and Derbyshire ended in a tame draw Friday.																								Sehwag blasted 14 fours and four sixes in his 97-ball 104 as the Indians finished 182 for three in their second innings at close of play. Derbyshire had earlier been bowled out for 358 to concede an 87-run lead to the visitors who had declared their first innings at 445 for eight.																								Sehwag set the ground ablaze with an electric knock and raised his hundred when the total was just 122.																								His opening-wicket partnership with Sanjay Bangar, who scored only seven, was worth 69 runs. His partner in the 59-run second-wicket stand, Shiv Sundar Das was a mute spectator as Sehwag tore apart the home bowling.																								His century, which came off 90 balls, was however far from the fastest recorded in this County season. Kent batsman Matthew Fleming scored a ton off just 66 balls against the touring Sri Lankans in a first-class game earlier this summer.																								Sehwag was finally dismissed when he holed out to long-on to Gunter off the bowling of Steve Selwood.																								Das made a stylish 52 with 10 fours. (PTI)

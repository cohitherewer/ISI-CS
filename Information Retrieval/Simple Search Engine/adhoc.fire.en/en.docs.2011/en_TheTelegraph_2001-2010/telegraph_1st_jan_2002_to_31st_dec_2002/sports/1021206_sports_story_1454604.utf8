				 	 Indias Digvijay Singh in action on Day One of the Volvo Masters of Asia at the Kota Permai Golf and Country Club, Kuala Lumpur, Thursday. (AFP)																								Shah Alam (Malaysia): South African Craig Kamps fired an eagle to grab a one-stroke lead Thursday in the regions season-ending Volvo Masters of Asia at the Kota Permai golf and country club. Kamps finished with a sizzling six-under 66, just ahead of Indias Digvijay Singh.																								Kamps, 37, landed the eagle on the 480-metre 12th hole with the help of a driver, three-wood and a sensational 15-foot putt.																								Indias Arjun Atwal, ranked No. 3 in Asia, shared third place with eight others on four-under 68. The current Asian Order of Merit leader, Jyoti Randhawa, birdied the last hole for a three-under 69, remaining well in contention.																								Both Randhawa and Atwal are seeking good results to finish the season as the Asian number one. A three-under is not too far off the lead. Im pretty happy with my score, Randhawa said. I dropped a shot on the 17th but made up for it with a birdie on the last hole.																								Thai ace Thongchai Jaidee overcame a double-bogey on the 15th to end with a one-under 71. 																								Jaidee is aiming to be the first player in the eight-year history of the asian pga to complete back-to-back order of merit title.																								Randhawa and Atwal are also looking for a place in the history books, since no Indian golfer has won the Asian title. (AP)

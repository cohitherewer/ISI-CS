The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Eden facilities upgraded
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: With the third Test match between India and West Indies scheduled to start from October 30 at the Eden Gardens, the CAB has decided to upgrade the facilities at the ground. 																								The first in their list is a one-tonne mechanised roller. This type of roller was suggested to us by BCCI appointed curator of Eden Gardens, a senior CAB official told The Telegraph Wednesday. 																								It was told that the cost has been estimated to Rs 2.5 lakhs. The CAB has also decided to get a new lawn mower and a vibrator with the Test match in mind. The vibrator, estimated around Rs 3 lakhs, will help crush the soil which in turn will help in the preparation of the pitch, the official informed.																								But the biggest renovation work will be done with the scoreboard. For the first time since the inception of the board, the 61,880 dots in the scoreboard will be changed, the official added. It was told that the changes, that earlier used to take 30 seconds, can be now done in five to ten seconds. 																								The official also informed that new imported stickers will be added to the dots to enhance the visibility factor of the scoreboard. As part of the renovation, when the third umpire gives a not out decision, it will be flashed on the scoreboard. Also when the ball goes to the fielder, his name will blink on the scoreboard. It was further told that the clock inside the scoreboard will be made bigger in size.																								Moreover, following instructions from the Anti Corruption Unit, four television cameras will be fitted in front of the entrance and exits of the dressing rooms to monitor the movement of the players.

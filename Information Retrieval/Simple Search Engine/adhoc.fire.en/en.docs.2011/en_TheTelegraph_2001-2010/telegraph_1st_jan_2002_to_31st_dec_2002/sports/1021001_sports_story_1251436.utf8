(Reuters)																								Indianapolis: Rubens Barrichello gratefully accepted his fourth win of the Formula One season Sunday as Ferrari flaunted their supremacy with another one-two in the US Grand Prix.																								The Brazilian had followed teammate and five-time world champion Michael Schumacher from the start but won the closest finish ever  a hundredth of a second  as the German slowed.																								The two cars crossed the line side by side in a deliberate, successful and ultimately controversial attempt to secure another slice of Grand Prix history after a season of record-breaking success.																								Barrichello was also confirmed as runner-up in the championship, the best placing of his career. 																								Barrichellos win also paved the way for a final flourish at Suzuka next month, with Ferrari now just a race away from equalling McLarens 1988 record of 15 wins in a season.																								McLarens David Coulthard finished third, ahead of Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya of Williams and Italian Jarno Trulli for Renault.																								Schumacher was asked whether he had deliberately given Barrichello the victory as payback for the Austrian Grand Prix in May that the Brazilian had to forego after being ordered by the team to let the German win.																								He said Barrichello deserved to triumph but there was no plan with the drivers themselves unclear about who had won as they crossed the line.																								We tried to be side by side, said Schumacher. We have always supported each other. I thought today was a great opportunity to finish equal, to go together over the line, but we failed, eventually Im happy he won. (REUTERS)

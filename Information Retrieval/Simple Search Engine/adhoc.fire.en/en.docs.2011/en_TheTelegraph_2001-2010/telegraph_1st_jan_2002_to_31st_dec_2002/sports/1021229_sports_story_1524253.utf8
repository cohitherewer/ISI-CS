		 Sunday, December 29, 2002 				 Another British minister raps ICC 
																								London, Dec. 28 (AFP): Britains international development minister on Saturday launched a scathing attack on the ICC over its decision to allow Zimbabwe to host World Cup matches.																								Clare Short described the decision as deplorable and shocking and hinted she would be trying to reverse current government policy on the issue, which is that the decision should be left to cricket officials.																								British MPs, including another minister, have led calls for a boycott of Zimbabwe in protest over President Robert Mugabes alleged abuses of human rights.																								The ICC ruled earlier this month there was no reason for not allowing the matches scheduled for Zimbabwe to go ahead.

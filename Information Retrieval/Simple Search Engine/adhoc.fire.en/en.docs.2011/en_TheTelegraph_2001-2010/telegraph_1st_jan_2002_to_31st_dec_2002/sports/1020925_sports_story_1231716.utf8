																								London: PSV Eindhoven coach Guus Hiddink has received a death threat, warning that if he has as much success with the Dutch club as he enjoyed with South Korea at the World Cup, he could be shot.																								Hiddink told the London Evening Standard he had thought of retiring from the game after receiving a letter six weeks ago with two bullets in it.																								The message was along the lines of, if you have the same success in the league with PSV as you did with Korea, well kill you with one bullet. Or if you succeed in the Champions League, well kill you with the other, he said.																								Hiddink took the World Cup co-hosts to the semi-finals before losing to Germany.																								Maybe it wasnt a serious threat but it was serious to me. It was a shocking time and, speaking from the heart, I was thinking of retiring and going to live in Madrid.																								PSV said at the time that police were investigating several threats aimed at Hiddink. (REUTERS)

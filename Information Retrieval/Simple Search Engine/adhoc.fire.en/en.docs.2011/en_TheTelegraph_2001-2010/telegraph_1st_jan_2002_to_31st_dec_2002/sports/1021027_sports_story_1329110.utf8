																								Durban, Oct. 26 (PTI): In a fresh case highlighting the rift along racial lines in South African cricket, two White players in the provincial Kwazulu-Natal team have threatened to resign if a player of Indian origin was selected in the side.																								Matters came to a head early this month when Natal captain Dale Benkenstein and Nixon McLean objected to the inclusion of spin bowler and batsman Goolam Bodi in the team.																								President of Kwazulu-Natal Cricket Union, Logan Naidoo, refused to accept the team without Bodi but had to relent later after it was reported in newspapers that he was calling for the spinners inclusion on racial grounds and not on merit.																								My inquiry was based on merit, not on colour as was reported, Naidoo later clarified.

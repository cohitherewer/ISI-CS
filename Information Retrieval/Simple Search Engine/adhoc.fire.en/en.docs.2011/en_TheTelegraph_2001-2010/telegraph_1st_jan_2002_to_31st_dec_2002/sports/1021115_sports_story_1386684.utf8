																								New Delhi: Riding a fine 83 by opener Ritesh Jaiswal, Tripura were 304 for seven against Services on the third day of the Ranji Trophy match here Thursday.																								Jaiswal was associated in a 87-run third wicket stand with Subhash Chander who made 45.																								Tripura made a bad start to the day when they lost Rajeev Dutta early, but progressed to 171 with Jaiswal and Chander batting confidently. But wickets fell in quick succession.																								Jaiswal, who hit nine boundaries in his 282-minute stay, finally became the third victim of off-spinner Sanjay Dhull who finished the day with four for 92 from 36 overs. Chander was trapped leg before to Saeed Javed as Services, who had declared their first innings at 491 for 8, hit back with two big wickets within a space of three runs.																								In Kochi, Sujith Somasunder hit a magnificent ton as Kerala reached 245 for four in their second innings on the third day against Goa.

				 	 Chanu: Injury-induced pullout																								Busan: Emphatic victories in league matches of mens hockey and football events were offset by a disappointing show by the women weightlifters as India started their campaign in the 14th Asian Games on a mixed note on Monday.																								While the mens hockey team thrashed Hong Kong 5-1, the footballers beat Turkmenistan 3-1. 																								 The Indian women weightlifters, Kunjurani Devi and Sanamacha Chanu, triple gold winners in the Commonwealth Games, failed to make an impact in the womens 48 kg category in the weightlifting event.																								While Kunjurani had to be content with seventh position, Chanu had to pull out due to a shoulder injury after taking part in the snatch event.																								Kunjurani managed a total lift of 172.5 kg which was not enough to come anywhere near the bronze medal. Chanu managed 77.5 in the snatch but could not complete the event.																								Kunjurani tried to lift 80 kg in the third attempt in snatch but could not manage while in clean and jerk her last attempt of 102.5 kg also did not bear fruit.																								 In squash, the Indians Joshna Chinappa and Vaidehi Reddy romped into the quarter finals in the womens section while Saurav Ghosal went down fighting to Mohammed Saoud al Sulati in the mens section.																								Indias rowers kept their chances alive in five events, while the remaining failed to qualify in the heats held at the Nakdong River. In the womens single sculls, Manjula Rai finished third while Gurpreet Kaur in light weight single scull also has a chance to make it to the event proper.																								Mujeeb Rehman, Ratheesh Kumar, Saji Thomas and Kasam Khan in mens lightweight four oars without coxswain and Jincymol Verghese and Rajan Sobhni in lightweight double sculls finished fourth but have a chance. Likewise, Roshan Lal, R.K.Pillai, Udaybir Singh, Jenil Krishnan, Inder Pal Singh, Sunil Kakde, Kudrat Ali, P.T.Paulose and K.V.Sajith will be fighting for qualification in the mens eight oars with coxswain on Monday. 																								In the pool, Indias Richa Mishra and Rehan Poncha put up a lacklustre display.																								While Richa finished ninth in the womens 200m butterfly event clocking 2:22.09 sec, Poncha finished last in the mens 200m individual medley in 2:14.17 seconds. (PTI)

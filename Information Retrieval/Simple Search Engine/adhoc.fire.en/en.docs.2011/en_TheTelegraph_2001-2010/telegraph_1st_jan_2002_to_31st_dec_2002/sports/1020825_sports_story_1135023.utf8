																								Kuala Lumpur, Aug. 24 (PTI): Indian boys turned in another good show when they held second seed China A to a 2-2 draw in the fifth round of the World Youth Chess Olympiad.																								The draw however relegated India to third place as China A and Ukraine emerged joint leaders on 15 points each. India, third with 14.5 points follow the two leaders closely. Five more rounds remain to be played in this 28-team event that will determine the best under-16 team in the world. 																								Playing on the top board, newly-crowned Asian junior champion IM Deepan Chakravarthy had the advantage of white pieces but in the end a solid defence by Chinese Fide Master Wang Yue (rated 2455) held the day and the game ended in a draw. 																								IM norm-holder Somak Palits form remained a concern for the Indian squad as he lost his second successive game in the championship on the second board, going down to Zhao Jun from the black pieces. Somak fell under opening troubles and could not recover. 																								Former world under-12 champion Deep Sengupta also could not use his white pieces to advantage and had to be content with a draw against Zhao Weiqi but on the fourth board G Rohit put in a splendid effort to beat Li Chao with the black pieces that settled the scores.																								Rohit has so far won all the three games he played in and is a prime contender for the gold medal on fourth board.																								Earlier in the fourth round, the Indians beat Romanians 2.5-1.5. Deepan outclassed IM Andrei Murariu from the black pieces and Rohit got the better of Gabriel Grecescu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, September 07, 2002 				 Indians can only hope for a bronze 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: India should be hoping for a bronze in the Asian Games archery, chief coach Chae Woong Lim of South Korea said, pointing out that the top two positions are almost a certainty for his native country. 																								South Koreans are too good for us and even the rest can hardly match them. At best, we can hope for a bronze, Lim said during the Indian contingents practice on Friday. 																								The boys and girls are doing quite well during practice. But since it is a tough meet and to be played under new rules, nothing can be predicted at present, felt the coach. 																								The meet will be played on a knock-out basis, with each player having to throw 12 arrows in each round, and 40 seconds in between their releases. 																								The Indian squad  comprising of Satya Dev Prasad, Kailash, Ved Kumar, Limba Ram, Dola Banerjee and Chekrovolu Swuro  will leave for Pusan next Saturday and the game will be held between October 6 to 10. 																								Lim subjected his wards to a daily dose of rigorous practice, stretching from morning to night. In the new rules, a players concentration level should always be at a premium. But Indians lack in sound foundation to work on this. Besides, they have only three-months for preparation, Lim pointed out. 																								A host of other factors also contribute to the success. A player has to negotiate with winds and other atmospheric changes, apart from the proverbial luck, the coach said.																								He, however, expressed satisfaction over his wards performance. Its good to see that players are scoring 10 and 9 regularly, he said. 																								Archery Association of India (AAI) officials, however, are pinning their hopes on Prasad. He is a genuine medal-hopeful, AAI technical committee chairman, Paresh Mukherjee, said. 																								 National champion Dola said: Itll be a challenge for all of us. If we can also show the same kind of performance we are having at practice, we can for sure hope for a better result, she said.

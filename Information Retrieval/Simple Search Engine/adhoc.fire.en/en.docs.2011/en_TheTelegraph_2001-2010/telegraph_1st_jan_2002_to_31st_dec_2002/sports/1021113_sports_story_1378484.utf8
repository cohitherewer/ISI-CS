		 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 Hewitt, Agassi to play fewer tournaments
																								Shanghai: The worlds two best tennis players, Lleyton Hewitt and Andre Agassi, have indicated they will play fewer tournaments in a bid to prolong their careers and maintain peak fitness.																								Both players said Monday they had endured a gruelling 2002 and wanted to cut back on their schedules.																								Its been tough, its been a grind, its taken its toll... But its been a great year and that is something I am proud of, said Agassi, who is hoping to overtake Hewitt and finish the year as world No. 1 here.																								Agassi, 32, had a slow start to the year after missing the Australian Open in January and played 15 tournaments in a bid to get enough points to claim the No. 1 ranking.																								He said although he was feeling very strong for his Shanghai campaign, he believes the season is too long.																								I think we would be served really well to have a shorter season, something we can intensely focus on, then recover and prepare for the next, he said.																								Hewitt said he would cut back on his tournament schedule for 2003 after battling health problems this year.  (AFP)

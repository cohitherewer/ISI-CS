		 Wednesday, December 04, 2002 				 Graveney not to step down
																								London: Englands chairman of selectors, David Graveney, insisted that he would not be resigning from his post despite Englands thrashing in the Ashes series.																								Australia claimed a record eighth successive win with Englands innings defeat at Perth. Steve Waughs men took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the best of five Test campaign.																								But Graveney, taking his cue from embattled England captain Nasser Hussain, said he was not about to quit. 																								Its a tough job, said Graveney. But it pales into insignificance to the pressure the players are under. Its an honour to do this job. But Im like Nasser. Im not going to walk off because theres still a lot of work to do.																								He also added that calls for Hussain to be replaced were misguided. 																								The most important thing for me is the relationship between Duncan (Fletcher, the England coach) and Nasser.																								Thats been a foundation for what weve achieved in recent seasons, said Graveney.  (AFP)

 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Uttam Singh Mundy, looking increasingly good after winning the Surya Nepal Masters last month, raised hopes of another title on foreign soil this season as he placed himself jointly on top after the opening round in the Rs 16 lakh Dutch-Bangla Bank Open golf tournament on Wednesday.																								According to information received here from Dhaka, Mundy hit a four-under 68 to share the lead with local pro Lutfor at the Kurmitola Golf Club. This is the third major on the Hero Honda Golf Tour.																								Malaysias S. Murthy was following the leaders at three-under 69 along with Bangaldeshs Mohammed Jibon Ali and Indias Digvijay Singh and Pappan.																								 Mundys bunker play, however, did not match his exceptionally good iron shots as he bogeyed the par-three fourth and par-four sixth. Apart from the two errors, Mundy maintained a clean slate shooting birdies in the seventh and 11th.

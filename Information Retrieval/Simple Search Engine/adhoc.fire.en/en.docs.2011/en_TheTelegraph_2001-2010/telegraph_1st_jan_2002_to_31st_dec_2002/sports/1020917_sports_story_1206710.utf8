The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Bhaichung for Bagans home tie
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Saunders SC of Sri Lanka arrive in the city Friday evening for their AFC Champions League away match with Mohun Bagan two days later. In the first leg, in Colombo last Wednesday, Mohun Bagan had won 2-0, Bhaichung Bhutia and George Ekeh scoring.																								On September 22 the city will not only witness the return to club soccer of Bhutia after way over three years, but will also for the first time see the Bhaichung-Jore Ramirez Barreto do duty for last years National Football League champions.																								Mohun Bagan want to sell at least 60,000 tickets for their home match. While Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra said at a press meet Monday that he is optimistic that all tickets will sell, the fact is that this will depend heavily on the result of tomorrows derby tie versus East Bengal. Mitra said 20 centres will be opened for sale of tickets from Wednesday with prices varying from Rs 10 (ordinary) to Rs 50 (VVIP).																								Arrangements will be as per AFC requirements, and it need be so, because there is a $ 10,000 payment purse for even the first round of the meet. The second round of the meet (Bagan will play their second round in the Maldives, if they move up, on October 9) gives $ 15,000, and the same amount for the third round.																								Doordarshan will telecast the match live, said Mitra, though no exclusivity rights have been sold.

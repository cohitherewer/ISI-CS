				 	 Hinds: Sizzling 147 																								3-DAYER vs BOARD XI																								Board XI 275/8 decl. West Indies 341/2																								Bangalore, Oct. 5 (Reuters): Opener Wavell Hinds scored a sizzling 147, including four sixes, as the West Indies totalled 341 for two to take a 66-run first-innings lead on Day II of their three-day tour opener against a Board Presidents XI on Saturday.																								The left-hander hit 17 boundaries and three sixes in his 187-ball knock and starred in two century partnerships as the West Indies top order gained useful batting practice in their only warm-up game before the first Test in Mumbai starting on Wednesday.																								Hinds compiled 128 for the first wicket with Chris Gayle (62) and 150 for the second with Ramnaresh Sarwan (batting on 93, 13 fours and one six) to put his team in command in reply to the home sides 275 for eight declared.																								The West Indies, 20 without loss overnight, lost Gayle before lunch when he hit off-spinner Sarandeep Singh for a six but was caught at mid-off by skipper Mohammed Kaif while going for a repeat shot.																								Hinds trailed Gayle during the days first hour but then raced past with a flurry of boundaries, which included two exquisite square drives off medium-pacer Sanjay Bangar.																								The 26-year-old also hit leg-spinner Amit Mishra for a six over mid-off and punished left-arm spinner Murali Kartik with four sixes to raise his century off 132 balls.																								But Kartik got his revenge having Hinds trapped leg-before with a ball that held on to its line.																								Sarwan, who looked rock-solid in defence and deftly mixed caution with aggression, hit Kartik for a six over mid-on and then for two fours through the off-side later in the same over.																								ACU clean-chit 																								 Paul Condon, head of the International Cricket Councils Anti-Corruption Unit, said West Indies manager Ricky Skerritt had been a victim of bad and unfair experience by the Sri Lankan police in the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy in Colombo, said a report from London.

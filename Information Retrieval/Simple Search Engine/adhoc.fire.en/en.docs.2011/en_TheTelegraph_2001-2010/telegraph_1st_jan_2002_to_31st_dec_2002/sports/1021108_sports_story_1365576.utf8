																								New Delhi: The one-man Sushil Salwan inquiry committee, set up by the Amateur Athletic Federation of India (AAFI) to probe into the Sunita Rani doping scandal, has completed the inquiry process but will still need three or four days more to submit the report. 																								The inquiry process is over, but Ill need three-four more days to compile everything and submit the report, Salwan said Thursday. He said compiling all the documents and findings in such a short time was a tough task but would try to submit his report as quickly as possible.																								Salwan, who is also one of the vice-presidents of AAFI, had initially been given one weeks time to submit the report but had been granted ten more days.																								On whether he would call Sunita Rani to depose again in the wake of reports that there was a huge difference in the amount of the banned substance nandrolone in her A and B samples taken after the 1500m event, Salwan said there is no need to call anyone now.																								Sunita, who was stripped of her gold and bronze medals after failing the dope test in the Asian Games in Busan, had appeared before the inquiry committee twice and vehemently denied having taken any performance enhancing drugs. 																								The AAFI had said that it will decide its future course of action only after receiving the report from its inquiry committee.																								Although Sunitas fight for proving her innocence has received a shot in the arm after the report which quoted medical expert as saying that the huge difference in the nandrolone level in the two tests was unheard of, her fate will largely depend on the Salwan committee report.																								Salwan said that his probe will also focus on whether such variations were possible and he would seek medical opinion on all these aspects before finalising the report. I will be going into all these matters. I will have to take into account many factors. All these aspects will be covered in the report, he said.																								Salwan said eleven persons were asked to depose before the committee. Apart from Sunita, her coach Renu Kohli and Dr. Jawaharlal Jain, the doctor who had accompanied the Indian contingent, appeared before the committee twice. (PTI)

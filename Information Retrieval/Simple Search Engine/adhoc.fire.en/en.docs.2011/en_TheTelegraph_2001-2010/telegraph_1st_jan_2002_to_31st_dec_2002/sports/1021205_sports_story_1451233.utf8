 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: India could host the inaugural world junior table tennis championships in 2004 with Delhi being the likely venue.																								According to Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) vice-president Probir Mitra, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) will announce the host country early next year. India stand a very good chance even though there is another contender. 																								If TTFI is awarded the prestigious meet, Delhi will be the frontrunners. 																								As of now, Maharashtra is the only other association to have shown some interest in staging it, said Mitra at a press conference to announce the Bengal Veteran Table Tennis Players Association-organised meet on Sunday at the SAI indoor training Hall.																								Mitra further informed that the proposed national academy in the city is expected to be set up by 2005.

				 																																	London: England soccer captain David Beckham and his wife, former Spice girl Victoria, are test-driving a pair of armour-plated BMWs worth nearly 350,000 ($525,000). Theyre considering adding the beemers to their automotive stable  which includes two Ferraris, an Aston Martin and a Lincoln Navigator  after an alleged plot to kidnap Victoria and sons Brooklyn and Romeo was foiled three weeks ago.				 																																	A BMW spokesman confirmed Friday that, at the Beckhams request, the German automaker was loaning them a fully-armoured 750IL, worth up to 250,000, and a lighter 540I, which sells for 90,000. A mass-circulation newspaper said Beckhams bodyguards were also trying out a four-wheel-drive X5, stock versions of which sell for up to 50,000 in Britain. 				 																																	Toulon: France soccer captain Marcel Desailly was ordered by a court here Thursday to pay 1,200 euros ($1,200) a month maintenance to his 12-year-old illegitimate daughter. The inflation-linked payments will be backdated to February 1998, when the paternity case was first brought to the courts, and will continue till the child reaches 18. In March last year, a Toulon court ruled Desailly had fathered Aida by Helene Mendy who said her legal claims for maintenance had been justified. Testimony of witnesses produced by the mother had been enough to convince authorities Desailly was the father without recourse to genetic tests. 				 																																	Glasgow: Scotland defender Christian Dailly has said he was raging after Portugal captain Fernando Couto apparently spat at him during Wednesdays international friendly. The West Ham United player, whose side lost 0-2 to the Euro 2004 hosts, was involved in the incident with Couto during the first half of the rain-soaked match in Braga. 				 																																	Couto and I were involved in a tussle in the penalty box in the first half and that was when it happened. He spat right at me, 29-year-old Dailly was quoted as saying in Fridays Scottish press. I was raging and I went looking for him to sort him out, but he was away. 				 																																	Dailly said the Lazio defender apologised to him at half-time but that did not stop Scotland manager Berti Vogts from seeking out Couto at the end of the match. 				 																																	Lagos: Former England international John Fashanus hopes of becoming the head of the Nigerian Football Association have been given a boost after a protest against his candidacy was thrown out. 				 																																	After a hearing, we discovered that the allegation against Mr John Fashanu is not correct, Muyiwa Daniel, spokesman for the committee responsible for the NFA board election, said Friday. 				 																																	Hong Kong: Betting on soccer matches may soon be legalised in Hong Kong, sources close to the administration said on Friday. Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwas cabinet and the legislatures Home Affairs Panel are expected to discuss the likely legalisation next Tuesday.				 																																	Debrecen (Hungary): Olympic champion Svetlana Khorkina will continue her foray into the acting world rather than compete in the World Cup finals in Stuttgart next month.

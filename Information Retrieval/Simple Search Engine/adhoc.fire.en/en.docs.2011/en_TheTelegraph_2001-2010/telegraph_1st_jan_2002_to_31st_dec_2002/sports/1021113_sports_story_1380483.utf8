																								Johannesburg: Sri Lanka suffered a double injury blow to two of their top players on Tuesday ahead of the second Test against South Africa. 																								Captain Sanath Jayasuriya is highly unlikely to play after damaging ligaments in his right ankle during a warm-up at the Wanderers. Although X-rays revealed the ankle was not broken, Jayasuriya will need two weeks rest before playing again.																								Off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan has a hernia problem that could require surgery immediately after the match.																								Left hander Jean Mubarak is likely to replace Jayasuriya, with Maravan Atapattu taking on the captaincy. (REUTERS)

																								Shimla: Sachin Tendulkar Sunday said he would start regular practice in the next 10 days as he was recovering well from a hamstring injury that forced him to take a break from the game.																								Tendulkar, who is holidaying here with his family, said his stay in Shimla had helped in a quick recovery and he should be fully fit in the next few days.																								I am recovering well and will resume practice in about ten days, he said.																								Tendulkar was not too worried about the performance of the bowlers in the one-day series. We are a good bowling side. At times there are difficulties and you have to do as best as you can, he said. (PTI)

		 Tuesday, September 03, 2002 				 McGrath, Gillespie run through Kenya en route to final
 (AP)				 	 Australian players celebrate the dismissal of James Kamande at the Nairobi Gymkhana Monday. (Reuters)																								Nairobi: New ball bowlers Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie tore through the Kenya top order with three wickets apiece at the Nairobi Gymkhana on Monday to set up an emphatic eight-wicket win for Australia in the fourth match of the ongoing one-day tri-series.																								Kenya, who had slumped to 17 for six at one stage, were eventually routed for 84, their lowest one-day total ever. McGrath took three for eight off eight overs. Gillespie followed up his career-best five-wicket haul against Pakistan last Friday with three for 40 off 10 overs.																								Brijal Patel, in his first match of the series, top-scored with 28 as the lower order managed to mount some resistance.																								But Australia made light work of the target, racing to 85 for two off 17 overs to secure a berth in the final against Pakistan. Matthew Hayden, a century-maker against Pakistan in Australias first match, continued his rich form with an unbeaten 40 off 49 balls, studded with five fours and a six.																								Adam Gilchrist swatted 22 off 18 balls with five boundaries before he fell to Martin Suji.																								Joseph Angara claimed the other wicket, Jimmy Maher (5) edging a catch to wicketkeeper David Obuya. Michael Bevan hit three fours in an undefeated 15 off 18 balls at the end. 																								Earlier, McGrath and Gillespie left the Kenyan innings in ruins after an hours play.																								McGrath, Man-of-the-Match, started the procession in the third over when he knocked back makeshift opener David Obuyas off stump for a duck.																								Gillespie joined in with the wicket of Kennedy Obuya (10). Matthew Haydens brilliant diving catch at fourth slip taking care of the Kenyan. McGrath then claimed Jimmy Kamande (1) caught behind and Thomas Odoyo (0) to a catch to mid-on, while Gillespie sent back captain Steve Tikolo (4) and Maurice Odumbe (0).																								At 17 for six, Kenya was in danger of eclipsing Zimbabwes 38 against Sri Lanka at Colombo in 2001 as the lowest ever one-day total. But Patel rallied with the lower order to avoid that embarrassment. The 24-year-old right-hander, forced into the team because of injuries to opener Ravindu Shah and Hitesh Modi, added 36 runs for the seventh wicket with both Tony Suji and Collins Obuya.																								Suji retired hurt after being pinned on the helmet by a McGrath bouncer but returned to finish eight not out. 																								Obuya hit three fours in the second top score of 13 off 25 balls before he edged to wicketkeeper Gilchrist off medium pacer Shane Watson, who also claimed last man Joseph Angara to finish with two for 13. Leg-spinner Shane Warne ended Patels vigil through a stumping. Brett Lee yorked Martin Suji for one.

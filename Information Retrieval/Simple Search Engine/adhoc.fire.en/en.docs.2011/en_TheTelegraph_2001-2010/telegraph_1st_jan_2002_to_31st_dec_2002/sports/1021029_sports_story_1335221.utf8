		 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 Anwar blasts selectors, may quit
				 	 Anwar: Pak Cricket going the hockey way																								Lahore: Opener Saeed Anwar hit out at Pakistans national selectors Monday for ignoring him for the forthcoming Zimbabwe tour and hinted at possible retirement.																								If Pakistan has a better opener he must be selected, but I cant understand how they ignored me by saying I lack confidence, Anwar said.																								I am consulting my seniors and may opt for retirement if the situation remains the same.																								If they continue like this, Pakistan cricket will meet the same fate as squash and hockey, the left-hander said.																								Anwar, who last year became a devout Muslim after the death of his only daughter, blamed selectors for not giving him a chance in this months series against Australia.																								SoS to Hanif, Javed																								The PCB has asked former captains and two of Pakistans greatest batsmen Hanif Mohammed and Javed Miandad to help coach the Test team ahead of next months tour to Zimbabwe. The PCB asked me would I be interested and I said no problem, Miandad said. 																								PCB cracks fine whip																								The PCB has decided to fine players who perform badly or show up unfit in future. It said players would lose 20 per cent of match fees for every match lost, but receive a bonus of the same amount for every game won.																								The new regulations provide for a penalty of up to $1,000 for players who report unfit.  (AGENCIES)

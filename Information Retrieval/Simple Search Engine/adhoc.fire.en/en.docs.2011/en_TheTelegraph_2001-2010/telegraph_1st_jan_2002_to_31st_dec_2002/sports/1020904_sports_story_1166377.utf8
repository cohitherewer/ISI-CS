The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, September 04, 2002  Focus today on Vijay wards 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: The focus may shift from trainer Daniel David to his fellow tradesman Vijay Singh who returns to business, definitely, hungry for winners after spending two months on the sidelines due to drug related offence. Vijay, however, has only three runners in the Wednesdays card against Daniels nine.				 										It is Anolini that Vijay may be banking upon to open his monsoon season account. The six-year-old by Placerville out of Above has done enough in his last start to suggest that he may beat his younger rivals in the 1,800m Hovercraft Cup, the afternoons main event. 				 										Abridge, Vijays other ward, is likely to go out as a favourite in the 1,400m Best Of All Cup. The Cristofori-Guest Forthe Night four-year-old, however, enjoys a reputation of letting down as a favourite thus giving an edge to the R. Alford-trainee Odyssey. In her last start, the Santiago-Royal Crail filly, despite negative tactics of Tamang, had placed a good third. Rutherford Alford partners Odyssey now.Read as: Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

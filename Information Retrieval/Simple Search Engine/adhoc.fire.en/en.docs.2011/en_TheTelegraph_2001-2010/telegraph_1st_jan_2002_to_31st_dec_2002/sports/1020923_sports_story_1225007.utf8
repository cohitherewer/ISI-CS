		 Monday, September 23, 2002 				 We want to win, says Constantine
																								New Delhi: Indias football coach sounds positive about his teams chances in the 14th Asian Games beginning in Busan on September 29.																								We have performed well against Uzbekistan, Jamaica and in the LG Cup in Vietnam, said Stephen Constantine Sunday.																								The coach said he would take one game at a time instead of going in with a specific strategy. Our aim would be to qualify for the quarter finals and then see from thereon, he said.																								We want to win, Constantine added. Asked about Indias first match against Bangladesh, he said: Bangladesh are our neighbours and rivals and we look forward to a competitive game against them.																								We havent played against Turkmenistan as yet, but would certainly benefit from the recent games we played against Uzbekistan here. China is the other team in the group. (PTI)

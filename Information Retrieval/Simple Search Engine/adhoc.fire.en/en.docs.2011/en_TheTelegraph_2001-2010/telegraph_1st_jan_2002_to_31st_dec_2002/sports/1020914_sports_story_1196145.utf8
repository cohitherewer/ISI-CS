																								Abu Dhabi: India qualified for the quarter finals of the 10th AFC under-17 championship after holding UAE to a 1-1 draw Thursday.																								Playing an attacking game, Malsawma scored a superb goal from nearly 30 metres to give India the lead in the seventh minute.																								Malsawma, along with Jerry Zirsanga and Lamare Rocus made some brilliant moves to pierce through the hosts defence many a time but were unsuccessful.																								UAE skipper Saeed Al-Saygh converted a penalty to score the equaliser for the hosts. UAE, ranked second in the group, after China and ahead of India, have also qualified for the quarter finals.																								Much to the UAEs dismay, Saeed was sent off three minutes before the final whistle after receiving his second yellow card of the match, He will miss the quarter finals. (PTI)

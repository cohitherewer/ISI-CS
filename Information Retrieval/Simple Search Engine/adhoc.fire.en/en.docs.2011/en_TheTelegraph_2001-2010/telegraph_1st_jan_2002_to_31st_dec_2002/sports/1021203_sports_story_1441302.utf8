																								Melbourne: Australia left out World Cup-winning captain Steve Waugh when they named a 30-man squad on Monday for their Cup defence in South Africa in February next year.																								The ACB did not name a skipper for the squad. However, Ricky Ponting has led the one-day side this year and was named on Monday to captain Australia in the opening two tri-series matches against England on December 13 and 15.																								Shane Watson, Ian Harvey, Andrew Symonds and Greg Blewett will be among those in the squad vying for the allrounders role in the side.																								Waugh released a statement on Monday to say he was obviously disappointed.																								I still believe there is a chance I can make it to the World Cup as players can come from outside that 30-man squad to make the final 15, said Waugh.																								Shane Warne said he was surprised selectors could not squeeze the veteran into a 30-man squad. Thirty cricketers, thats a few cricketers, he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. Radio.																								The ACB said they would reduce the squad to 15 by December 31 for the 14-nation event. Players not named in the 30-man squad can still be drafted in, it said.																								THE PROBABLES																								Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Michael Bevan, Andy Bichel, Jason Gillespie, Matthew Hayden, Brett Lee, Darren Lehmann, Damien Martyn, Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Shane Watson, Justin Langer, Jimmy Maher, Greg Blewett, Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark, Michael Clarke, Ryan Campbell, Nathan Hauritz, Brad Hogg, Mike Hussey, Ashley Noffke, Andrew Symonds, Brad Williams, Brad Haddin, Ian Harvey, Cameron White, Mark Higgs, Damien Wright.

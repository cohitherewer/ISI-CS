		 Wednesday, August 28, 2002 				 Use pad as the second line of defence while sweeping
																								cricket 																								online																								I am a left-handed batsman. Whenever I try to play the paddle sweep I end up missing the ball, getting bowled or padding it up. Please advise.																								(Shoubhik Bose, 12, Hooghly)																								I think you are not getting into the right position while playing the shot. Youre going too far across while playing the shot and getting bowled. You have to get the pad in the right position and play the shot late to a delivery pitched outside the leg-stump.																								I am a right-handed opener. I face problems while playing the square cut against short pitched deliveries outside the off stump. Please help. 																								(Arijit Mukherjee, 18, North 24 Parganas)																								You have to get back and across while playing the shot and your weight should go into the shot.																								I am a right-handed batsman. How do I improve my front foot play?																								(Dipnarayan Chakraborty, 18, Calcutta-34)																								Getting into the nets and asking the bowlers to pitch the ball up so that you can get your feet moving.																								I am a left-handed opening batsman. How do I improve my on-side stroke making?																								(Shekhar Pradhan, 21, South Sikkim)																								Its again all in the nets. You make the bowlers bowl a line which will make you play on the on-side.																								I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I attempt the cover drive, I get caught in the cover region. Why does this happen?																								(Abhra Roy Chowdhury, 10, Bandel)																								You are lifting your head and not getting to the pitch of the ball.																								I am a right-handed batsman. I often fail to negotiate the inswingers, the ball hitting my stomach or chest. How do I overcome this?

What are the basics that should be kept in mind while running between the wickets?																								(Utsav De, 15, Calcutta-32)																								Calling quickly and loudly and judging the pace of the ball you have hit. It is also important that you have a knowledge of the throwing arm of the fielder.																								I am a right-arm medium pacer. I end up bowling a wide while attempting to gain some extra pace. Why does this happen?																								(Rajeev Kumar Pal, 10, Bokaro Steel City)																								In striving for an extra yard of pace, your head position is not right. You got to watch the spot you want to bowl.																								I am a right-handed batsman. I find the going tough against bowlers who come round the wicket. Please help.

I am 5 ft 2 inches and can bowl both medium pace and leg spin. But which one should I concentrate on for the moment?																								(Biswajit Ganai, 22, Berhampore)																								Leg-spin if you can. It puts less strain on the body and with your height, youll get a good loop.

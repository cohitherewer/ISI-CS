																								Islamabad: Even as Pakistan were stunned into disbelief by the disgrace suffered by their national cricket team in the second Test against Australia in Sharjah, former stalwarts rushed to the defence of the young and inexperienced team.																								You cant really blame the young lot because they were short on experience, especially when pitted against the worlds best side, former batting great Zaheer Abbas said.																								They are our future and we must bank on them, Abbas, who now heads the junior selection committee, was quoted as saying in media reports on Sunday.																								Pakistan succumbed to their lowest ever Test scores twice in the same match, being shot out for 59 and 53, to suffer an embarrassing innings and 198-run defeat to Australia in the second Test on Saturday.																								Former captain and coach Javed Miandad also defended the team saying the youngsters needed more time to settle down.																								The only thing I can say is that since it is a young team it will take time to get used to playing someone like Australia. After all, these youngsters performed exceptionally well in the first Test, he said																								Another former captain Hanif Mohammed, however, felt that the youngsters were over-confident after their reasonably good performance in the first Test in Colombo despite ending on the losing side.																								Youngsters were over-confident after their good showing in the first Test. The inexperienced batting line-up could not stand up to the pressure applied by the Australians, who are the top side in the world  he said.																								Abbas also lambasted some of the senior players for not making themselves available for this series. (PTI)

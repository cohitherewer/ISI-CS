(AFP) 																								Atlantic City (New Jersey): Chris Byrd won the vacant IBF heavyweight championship with a unanimous points decision over 40-year-old Evander Holyfield on Saturday.																								Neither fighter scored a knock down and neither appeared to be seriously hurt at anytime, but Holyfield appeared tired during parts of the fight against his 32-year-old opponent.																								As the fight wore on, his power wasnt really strong, Byrd said afterwards. 																								It looked good, but it wasnt really strong. I knew I could sit there and trade (punches) with him a little.																								Holyfield throughout swung wildly at Byrd, who dodged most punches while landing twice as many of his own during the course of the fight.																								Byrd won on two judges scorecards by 117-111 and 116-112.																								Holyfield was trying to win the IBF title as a prelude to another shot at being the undisputed heavyweight champion.																								The title was vacated by Lennox Lewis after the Briton refused a mandatory defence against Byrd.  (REUTERS)

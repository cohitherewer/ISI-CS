				 																																	London: Injured England fast bowler Darren Gough is to fly to the United States next week in a bid to salvage his career, the Daily Telegraph reported on Wednesday.				 																																	The newspaper said the 32-year-old, who has not played a Test match for more than a year and whose long-term knee problems ruled him out of the Ashes tour, plans to consult an American surgeon after three failed operations.				 																																	The Yorkshire player, who last featured for England in August 2001, has taken 228 wickets in 56 Tests and also played 111 one-day Internationals.				 																																	Gough flew out to Australia with England for the five-Test Ashes series but was ruled out of the tour after failing to prove his fitness.				 																																	Bucharest: The Romanian League (LPF) had to postpone a local first division soccer match due to a visit by US President George Bush to Romania this week, a LPF senior official said on Wednesday.				 																																	The Romanian Intelligence Service asked us not to organise (Saturdays) match between Dinamo Bucharest and Brasov because Bush visits Bucharest, LPF General Secretary Valentin Alexandru said.				 																																	Romanian authorities took unprecedented security measures ahead of Bushs four-hour visit to Bucharest on Saturday, seen as expressing approval of the countrys efforts to join NATO.				 																																	The match was rescheduled for Sunday, Alexandru said. 				 																																	Clairefontaine: Ronaldo should not be named European Footballer of the Year said French international Thierry Henry on Tuesday.				 																																	The awards must take into account what a player has done throughout the whole season and not what he has achieved in a single tournament, the Arsenal striker said.				 																																	When I look at the outcomes, Im a bit confused. For example, I still dont understand why (Real Madrids) Raul has never been awarded. Its a bit weird. But for this year, I dont think Ronaldo has been the best player in Europe.				 																																	The Brazilian striker hit eight goals in his countrys triumphant World Cup campaignto finish top goalscorer at the tournament.				 																																	Tirana: Police detailed to patrol a soccer match in Albania beat up a coach and a player from one of the teams, it was alleged on Tuesday.				 																																	The municipal council of Polican accused regional police director Ilirjan Dida of ordering his subordinate, police chief Medi Hasani, to rough up second division club Polican in a game against Memaliaj.				 																																	Councillors allege that the Polican coach was beaten up and a player was dragged from the pitch into the changing rooms where he was beaten by other officers on the orders of Dida. 				 																																	Manchester: Englands Football Association on Wednesday rejected a French Football Federation (FFF) request to ban Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka for two matches for refusing a national call-up.				 																																	Anelka angered France coach Jacques Santini this week after refusing to join up with the squad for Wednesdays friendly with Yugoslavia in Paris. City manager Kevin Keegan had earlier insisted that Anelka would face Middlesbrough on Saturday. 				 																																	n Cricket, England vs Australia, second Ashes Test, Day I session 2 amp; 3 live from 8.30 am n Cricket, India vs West Indies sixth ODI live from 9 am on DD Sports n Soccer, Premier League from 4 pm on ESPN

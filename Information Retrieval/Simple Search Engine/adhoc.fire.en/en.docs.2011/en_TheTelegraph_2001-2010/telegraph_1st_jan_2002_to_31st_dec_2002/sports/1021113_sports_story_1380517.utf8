		 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 England should bat first: Allan Border
				 	 BORDER: In defence of Bichel																								Gold Coast: Australia selector and former captain Allan Border said Tuesday Englands best hope of winning next weeks second Test was to bat first and put pressure back on Australia.																								If they get the opportunity to bat first on a good day, take it, take Australia on and try and put runs on the board and put Australia under some pressure, Border said. But its going to be difficult for them because theyve just taken a huge knockout punch.																								England play Australia A in a three-day match starting in Hobart on Friday ahead of the second Test starting on November 21 in Adelaide.																								Even months ago I felt England would be competitive as long as all the stars turned up each day to play, Border said.																								But you cant have hot and cold sessions against Australia  you fall behind the eight ball and thats what happened. Australia have got a group of guys together now that are going to end up on the all-time great list.																								Border also defended the move by selectors to include Queensland veteran Andy Bichel for the first Test ahead of Australias fastest bowler Brett Lee.																								Lee responded by taking 10 wickets for New South Wales in a four-day inter-state match against Tasmania at Sydney Cricket Ground last week.																								Hes done exactly what we wanted him to do. Go away, bowl fast, take some wickets, which he hadnt been doing, Border said. We dont mind being embarrassed by those sorts of things.																								Emotional chokers																								The English cricket team choked on their emotions and consuming desire to win the first Ashes Test, an Australian sports psychologist said Tuesday, adds reports from Brisbane.																								Phil Jauncey, who assisted the Australians, said emotions hindered Englands performance on the way to their 384-run defeat at the Gabba last weekend.																								You could see that because of their feelings they were making choices they couldnt execute and they were poor choices, Jauncey said.																								Jauncey said perhaps England players focussed more on winning rather than the step-by-step process which would get them there. The English, who do not have a tour psychologist, indicated it was possible they would recruit one for the rest of the Australian tour, before the second Test.  (AGENCIES)

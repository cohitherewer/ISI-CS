The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 Pakistan maul The Netherlands
				 	 Shahid Afridi on his way to a whirlwind 55 not out in Colombo on Friday. (Reuters)																								Colombo, Sept. 21 (Reuters): Shahid Afridi smashed the second fastest 50 in one-day Internationals as Pakistan raced to a nine-wicket victory over The Netherlands in the Champions Trophy on Saturday.																								With Sri Lanka already through to the semi-finals from pool four the match meant little in terms of the competition.																								But Pakistan at least had the satisfaction of disposing of the part-timers quickly with Afridi providing the fireworks.																								First he took three for 18 with his leg-spinners as the Dutch were bowled out for 136 from the last ball of their 50 overs. Extras top-scored in the innings with 33, only the 24th time that has happened in one-day history.																								After Imran Nazir had hammered 59 from 40 balls in an opening stand of 85 with Saeed Anwar (28 not out), Afridi then wrapped up the match in double-quick time with an unbeaten 55 from only 18 balls.																								He smashed four sixes off one over from Adeel Raja, and ended the match with his sixth six, again off the young off-spinner, as Pakistan reached their target in only 16.2 overs.

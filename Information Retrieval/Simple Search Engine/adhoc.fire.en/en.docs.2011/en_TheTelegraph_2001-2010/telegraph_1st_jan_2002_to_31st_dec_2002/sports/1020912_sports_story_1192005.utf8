				 	 patil: Avoids Bangla comparison																								Colombo: Kenya coach Sandeep Patil is hoping that a strong showing by his team at the International Cricket Council (ICC) Champions Trophy will strengthen the countrys case for elevation to full Test status. 																								The talent in this team deserves Tests but its not in our hands, said Patil ahead of Thursdays start to the 12-team tournament, which is being hosted by Sri Lanka.																								Our job is to play good cricket, to put the scores on the right track and that will push our case and make it stronger. Its up to the ICC to recognise that talent but Im sure Kenya deserve Test status.																								Kenyas application to become the 11th Test-playing country has already been lodged with the ICC and is being reviewed on an ongoing basis.																								While that review  including an assessment of the infrastructure for cricket in Kenya  takes place, Patil sees the Champions Trophy as an ideal opportunity to help the teams advance, following the tri-series with Australia and Pakistan.																								The last country to be granted Test status was Bangladesh in 2000 and they have struggled to justify that elevation, losing 13 of their first 14 matches.																								I dont want to comment on Bangladesh, Im very happy for them but I dont like to compare Kenya to any other international side, Patil said.  (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, October 25, 2002 				 White called up
																								Perth: Englands injury-ravaged squad will be bolstered by Yorkshire allrounder Craig White, who will provide cover for the out-of-action Andrew Flintoff, England coach Duncan Fletcher said here Thursday.																								White, 32, who has been playing grade cricket in Australia, will fly from Adelaide to Perth Friday, Fletcher said. He will be available for Englands three-day match against Western Australia, starting at the WACA ground here Monday.																								Whites call-up comes 24 hours after it was announced that Flintoff would fly to Adelaide Thursday for intensive treatment on a groin injury. Flintoff has not yet regained full fitness after having a hernia operation seven weeks ago.																								Fletcher said: Craig performed well against India in England this summer and is now fully recovered from his injury problems. He will provide us with cover in the all-rounder position until Andrew is able to return. White made an unbeaten 94 in the second Test against India at Trent Bridge before being ruled out of the rest of the series with a side injury. (AFP)

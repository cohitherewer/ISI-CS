				 	 Boycott																								London: Former England cricketer Geoffrey Boycott has been told by doctors that he has a good chance of beating cancer following three months of treatment.																								Boycott, one of the greatest opening batsmen in Test history, was diagnosed with cancer in his neck in September and has since undergone chemotherapy and radiotherapy at a hospital in Leeds, Yorkshire.																								There were four lots of chemotherapy and then I began the radiotherapy on October 22, Boycott was quoted as saying in Mondays Yorkshire Post newspaper.																								I asked her (the oncologist) what the prognosis was and she was very positive, very relaxed. Of course there are no guarantees in this situation, but she says I have a good chance and Ill be fighting it. I have to take a months rest now and Im seeing her (the oncologist) again in the middle of January.																								The treatment has left Boycott over 12 kg lighter and unable to eat solid food, the newspaper reported.																								It is the treatment that takes so much out of me. The side-effects are terrible  burns in the neck and chest, the 62-year-old said. As the radiography slowly takes then burning starts on your neck and throat and tongue. Now I cant bear having anything on my mouth or tongue.																								Boycott, who made his debut for England against Australia in 1964, scored 8,114 Test runs at an average of 47.42 in a 108-match career spanning three decades. (REUTERS)

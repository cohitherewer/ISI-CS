				 	 Queen Elizabeth II greets England captain David Beckham and manager Sven-Goran Eriksson during a reception for the Football Association at the Buckingham Palace Tuesday. (AFP)																								London: Two weeks after police foiled a plot to kidnap his wife  Posh Spice Victoria  and sons Brooklyn and Romeo, England captain David Beckham chatted about security with Queen Elizabeth II Tuesday.																								The Manchester United star went to Buckingham Palace with coach Sven-Goran Eriksson and the rest of the England squad for a reception with the Queen and the subject strayed from soccer to security.																								She raised the subject of security and if anyone is going to know about that, its the Queen, Beckham told reporters after the reception. We spoke about increased security and how it would change our lives. It definitely will change things but its just something that has to be done.																								She does know about football but spoke about security, Beckham said. Its something on my mind and obviously something the Queen lives with every day.																								Called together by Eriksson for a two-day training camp, the England squad went to the palace with the Football Association staff but not with their wives and partners.																								Beckham, who suffered a broken rib in a game against Southampton two weeks ago was unable to take part in the training session and is set to be out of action for three weeks. He was the first player to be introduced to the Queen by FA chairman Geoff Thompson and was followed by striker Michael Owen. (AP)

		 Saturday, November 16, 2002  Amber Regent best for Stewards Trophy 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore: Trainer S. Ganapathys ward Amber Regent, who was a big let down in the Mysore Derby, may make amends when he takes on his eight rivals in the 1,800m Stewards Trophy on Saturday here.				 										Smartest of all in his workouts, the Razeen-Hablitzia gelding may have the measure of the field that includes Whatmore and Mr. Belvedere who look best to put in a fight. But the former with an elephantine load to shoulder and the latter yet not hundred percent fit, Mark Gallagher may not have to do much to do to steer the Regent home.				 										In the Sandur Trophy, the sporting event in the card, the S. Padmanabhan-charge Baffert is likely come good in the hands of Paul Eddery. The three-year-old by Local Talent out of Relaxed is also doing very well in his morning trials.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2.30 pm: Surprise Gift 1. Clear Cut 2.

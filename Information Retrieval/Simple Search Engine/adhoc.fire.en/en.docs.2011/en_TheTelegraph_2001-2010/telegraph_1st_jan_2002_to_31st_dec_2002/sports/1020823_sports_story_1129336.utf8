A brilliant 71 earned the captain the Man of the Match award and he was named Man of the Tournament after blasting 300 runs in five matches.																								But the injury, sustained when he fell awkwardly after taking a catch, may rule him out of next months Champions Trophy. due to be played in his home city of Colombo from September 12-30.																								It was disappointing but we won the tournament which was the main objective of coming here, Jayasuriya told reporters after the match. Maravan (Atapattu) has played a lot of cricket so I was not worried about the team.																								Asked about his prospects following his injury, Sri Lankas captain said: It is too early to say. 																								I will have more scans when I get home on Friday and we will know more then. It was dislocated on the field but I put it back in  it is just very swollen now. 																								Physiotherapist Alex Kontouri said Jayasuriya was probably only 50-50 for next months tournament but did not rule out hope that he might recover.																								South African captain Shaun Pollock said his team had been outplayed throughout the tournament by Sri Lanka. They played the better cricket and deserved to win, Pollock said.																								The fact that it is the beginning of the season for us does not lessen the disappointment. We really wanted to win, he added.																								The fact that it is World Cup year is on all of our minds, for sure, and everyone is gearing up for that. But the best way to do that is to win  unfortunately we didnt manage to do that, Pollock said. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

																								Harare, Nov. 30 (Reuters): Faisal Iqbal struck a century to steer Pakistan to an eight-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the fourth ODI on Saturday.																								He scored 100 off 97 balls, including 10 fours and three sixes, as Pakistan cruised to 211 for two in reply to Zimbabwes 210. 																								Kamran Akmal and Iqbal added 53 runs for the first wicket before the former was caught by wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu off Douglas Hondo for 44 in the eighth over. Iqbal and Younis Khan then added 156 for the second wicket in a stand that took Pakistan to within two runs of victory.																								It ended when Younis was run out for 56 by Brian Murphy in the covers as the batsmen attempted a tight single that would have brought Iqbal his century. 																								Earlier, Grant Flower hit an undefeated 105 off 146 balls.

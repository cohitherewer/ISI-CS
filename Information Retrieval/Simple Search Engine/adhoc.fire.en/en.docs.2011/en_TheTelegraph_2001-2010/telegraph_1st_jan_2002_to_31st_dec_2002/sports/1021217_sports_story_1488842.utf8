				 	 SELES: No animosity																								St Paul (Minnesota) : The fact that Anna Kournikova has achieved widespread fame without winning a single tournament causes resentment among many players on the womens tour.																								Monica Seles isnt one of them.																								After beating Kournikova 7-6 (7-6), 6-4 on Saturday night in the Minnesota Tennis Challenge, Seles scoffed at the suggestion that theres any animosity towards the 21-year-old Russian, who is known more for her beauty than her forehand.																								I dont think theres animosity. My gosh, thats a strong word to use, Seles said after the exhibition match. Shes dedicated her life to this sport. Shes one of the hardest workers on tour.																								And if Kournikovas fame is based on a pretty face, not a French Open or a Wimbledon title? Its understandable, said Seles. But shes a gorgeous girl. What can she do about that? She cant just hide her face.																								Seles pointed out that Kournikova was ranked as high as eighth in May 2001 before an ankle injury slowed her down. Now 35th in the WTA rankings, Kournikova is getting ready for the 2003 season. She hasnt won a Grand Slam singles match since the 2001 Australian Open.																								Her goal? To stay healthy, go back and try to play a full season this time, Kournikova said. 																								The same goes for Seles, the nine-time Grand Slam winner who was hampered by a foot injury this year and lost in the quarter finals in each of the last three majors. Shes ranked seventh.																								The off-season is not very long, Seles said. You basically have to start training right away. 																								Im pretty much healed, but we dont have much time. Its very tough to come back from an injury because the ranking system is so brutal.																								The 29-year-old Seles had her return game working well and served three aces to finish off Kournikova in the final game. 																								She looks ready for a full schedule in 2003 and doesnt seem to be thinking about retirement.																								As long as shes still having success, I dont see why she wont continue, said Tony Godsick, Seles agent. 																								She hasnt said anything to me about it.																								Seles and Kournikova have played each other in a number of exhibitions. They left St Paul on Saturday night for Canada, where they were scheduled to play in Winnipeg.																								Its tiring, but these matches are great, Seles said. Its a relaxed atmosphere where we can work on our game a little bit. 																								It also gives Kournikova, who grew up as a huge Seles fan, a chance to pick up a few pointers.																								Its amazing to play against Monica, Kournikova said. Its like the best feeling in the world. (AP)

																								Thrissur: T.A. Sujith of Services and Tamil Nadus Saba Sait set meet records in the 200m freestyle and 50 m breast stroke (heats) respectively, on the fourth day of the 56th senior national aquatic championship on Friday, which saw Karnataka leading overall with 165 points.																								In womens 100m backstroke, Bengals Amrapali Das Gupta got the silver at 1:12.48 seconds. Sumy Cyriac of Railways secured gold at 1:09.87 and Keralas Sony Cyriac bronze at 1:12.58. 																								In waterpolo, Bengal women defeated Maharashtra 4-3 to take the third slot. 																								In the mens section, Railways defeated Police 7-4 in the semi-finals, while in another match Services beat Bengal 12-2.																								On his way to the gold, Sujith bettered by 0.12 seconds Hakimuddins record of 1:58.70, set in 1998. 																								For 16-year-old Saba, who set a new meet record in the heats, the day, however, proved to be a mixed one as she could not repeat the same performance in the finals and had to be content with the silver clocking 37.34s while the gold was bagged by Mrudula of Karnataka with a time of 37.21. Saba had eclipsed the previous record of 37.12s by Zeba Wadia of Maharashtra, set in 1999, at 37.05. 																								Sixteen-year-old Ambica Iyengar (Karnataka) increased her individual gold medal tally to four by winning the 200m individual medley comfortably.  (PTI)

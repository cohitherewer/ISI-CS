		 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 India got huge advantage: Steve
				 	 STEVE: Ill bowl off-spin if required																								Sydney: Australias former one-day captain Steve Waugh believes Indias delay in naming a provisional World Cup squad has given them a huge advantage.																								[As it turned out, the Indian probables were named a few hours after what Steve had to say.]																								Every side has to pick 30 players yet India havent. There didnt seem to be any penalty or any urgency to get those players named, the 1999 World Cup-winning captain said in Sydney on Wednesday.																								If you cant be picked from outside the 30 then I think India have got a huge advantage because they havent named their players yet.																								For me that seems pretty ludicrous. That means India has a huge advantage. I think thats crazy.																								The ACB had originally stated it retained the right to choose from outside the 30-man squad for the final 15-player list, however the ACB is now clarifying that with the ICC.																								All we can do is wait and see the answer we get from the ICC, ACB spokesman Peter Young said.																								Australia may seek to include Stuart MacGill, also not part of the 30-man squad, in the final list of 15 following Shane Warnes shoulder injury last week which will keep him out for at least a month.																								Steve said: If I am playing well and theres a spot there Ill be happy to take it. I could bowl off-spin if they want me to.																								Meanwhile, Waugh said that fellow New South Wales player MacGills chances of playing in next weeks fourth Test against England in Melbourne were strong.																								Hes a world-class bowler, probably the second-best spinner in the world. Were lucky to have both those guys in Australia and hed obviously be a good chance, Steve said. (REUTERS)

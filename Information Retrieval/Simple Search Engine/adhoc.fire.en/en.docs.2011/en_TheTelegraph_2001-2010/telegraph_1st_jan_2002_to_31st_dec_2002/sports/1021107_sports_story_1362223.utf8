																								Bled (Slovenia): Fortunes fluctuated for the Indian contingent as the men and women went down to England and Russia respectively in the tenth round of the 35th Chess Olympiad Wednesday.																								Russia stretched its lead to a full point in the mens section with a convincing 3-1 victory over China. The Georgian women took a 2.5 point lead with a 2-1 victory over Hungary.																								The Indian men were relegated to the joint 13th with 24 points. England proved too superior on the top boards and that turned out to be the deciding factor. 																								GM K. Sasikiran failed to put up a resistance against Michael Adams. Playing black, Sasikiran opted for the Sicilian defence and had to withstand some fierce attack. Adams, closed in on Sasikirans centre-right and did not give any respite to the young Indian in the complexities that ensued. Sasikiran went for a counter-attack only to lose a few queen side pawns in the endgame.																								GM Pentyala Harikrishna lost his second successive game against Nigel Short in less than a months time. Up against a Queens Indian Defence with white pieces, Harikrishna blundered going for an all-out attack against the king with a knight sacrifice in the mid-board.																								Surya Sekhar Ganguly and R.B. Ramesh, however, drew their games.																								WGM S. Vijayalakshmi pulled one back for the Indians beating Ekaterina Kovalevskaya of Russia with white pieces. But it was not enough to wipe out the 0-2 as Arthie Ramaswamy and S. Meenakshi went down tamely. (PTI)

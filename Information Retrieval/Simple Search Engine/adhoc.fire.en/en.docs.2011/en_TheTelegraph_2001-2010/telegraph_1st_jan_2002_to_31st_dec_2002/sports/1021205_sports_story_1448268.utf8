		 Thursday, December 05, 2002 				 Dudek faces long lay-off
																								Liverpool: Dont expect to see Jerzy Dudek back in goal for Liverpool before 2003.																								Manager Gerard Houllier had already decided to give England under-21 goalkeeper Chris Kirkland a long overdue start against Ipswich in the League Cup on Wednesday.																								But Dudeks blunder against Manchester United on Sunday  he let a header from teammate Jamie Carragher slip through his hands and legs for Diego Forlan to score the first in a 2-1 United victory  means the Polish star will be on the bench for a few more games.																								Chris deserves a run of games and he will have that now, Houllier said on Tuesday. I spoke to both goalkeepers and told them Chris would get his run 																								Dudek, considered one of the worlds best goalkeepers before the World Cup, has made several mistakes in Liverpools recent run of three losses in four Premier League games and elimination from the Champions League. 																								Kirkland, signed from Coventry at the start of last season, is considered one of Englands most promising goalkeepers and has patiently waited for a chance.  (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, December 21, 2002 				 Barreto earns full points for Bagan
				 	 BARRETO: Precious strike																								Bangalore: Riding a 43rd minute strike by their star Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto, defending champions Mohun Bagan beat Indian Telephone Industries 1-0 in an Oil PSU seventh National Football League match here on Friday.																								The Calcutta giants, without the services of star forward Bhaichung Bhutia who is expected to be out of action for six weeks with a torn calf muscle, held on to their lead in the face of a spirited fightback by ITI.																								With this victory, Mohun Bagan moved to 12 points from seven outings.																								The local outfit, who are yet to win a match, are at the bottom of the table with just two points from as many matches.																								The excitement of the encounter at the Bangalore Football Stadium was marred by a string of missed opportunities. Mohun Bagan had a chance to forge ahead in the 21st minute but Sunil Chhetri missed shot off target with no opposition to beat.																								Then, ITIs Seth Osais powerful 28th-minute hit was well collected by goalkeeper Bivash Ghosh who had a good match.																								Mohun Bagans Amar Ganguly and Ajoy Singh and ITIs Firoz were shown yellow cards. 																								Churchill manage win																								In Mumbai, striker Yakubu Uisofs 25th minute goal helped Churchill Brothers, Goa pip Mahindra United, Mumbai 1-0 at the Cooperage.																								After a dull and drab encounter, the Goans managed only their second win in seven matches. The local team has just one win from seven games.																								After a few good moves by the Goans, which did not bear fruit, Yakubus fine run in the 25th minute, after getting the ball from the mid-field, resulted in the only goal of the match. 																								Keepers blunders 																								In Margao, goalkeeper Subhash Kumars lapses cost Bangalores Hindustan Aeronautics Limited dearly as they lost 0-3 to Goas Dempo Sports Club.																								Dempo, who led 3-0 at half time, scored through Francis Silveira (15), Sergey Andreev (18th) and Olubiyi Majek Bolaji (22nd).																								With this win, Dempo with 16 points from seven matches are breathing down the necks of leaders East Bengal, who are just a point ahead. HAL stay on at four points from six matches.																								The Goans scored first in the 15th minute when Wilton sent a diagonal pass from the right into the box and the keeper, who was standing close to Silveira, just about managed to get his fingertips to the ball, not enough to stop it going in.																								Three minutes later, Kumar messed up again as he allowed Andreev to head in after Silveira headed to him off a cross from Clifford Miranda from the left. (PTI)

		 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Bergkamp fined 5,000
																								Birmingham: Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp avoided a ban but was fined 5,000 ($8,023) after being found guilty of improper conduct by the English Football Association on Thursday.																								The Dutchman was also warned as to his future conduct following an incident involving Blackburns Swedish defender Nils-Eric Johansson, the FA said in a statement on its official website.																								Television replays showed Bergkamp stepping on Johansson towards the end of the English champions 1-2 defeat at Highbury on October 26.																								Referee Graham Barber did not punish Bergkamp at the time but the FA acted after viewing video evidence. 																								If he had been found guilty of violent rather than improper conduct, Bergkamp would have faced a possible three-game ban.																								The Dutchman was suspended for three matches last January after being sent off following a similar incident.  (REUTERS)

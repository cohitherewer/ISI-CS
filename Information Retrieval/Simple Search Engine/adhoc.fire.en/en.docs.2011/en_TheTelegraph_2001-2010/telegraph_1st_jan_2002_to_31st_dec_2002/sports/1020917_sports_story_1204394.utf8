		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Aussies unsure of second singles
																								Adelaide: Australian Davis Cup captain John Fitzgerald is undecided on his second singles player for the matches against India this weekend at Memorial Drive.																								World No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt is one of the singles players, but Fitzgerald said Monday he hasnt decided whether Wayne Arthurs or Scott Draper will play the other opening singles match on Friday. The draw will be held on Thursday.																								The winner of the best-of-five series will remain in the 16-team World Group next year. 																								They have played a lot of tennis on the American circuit, most of our guys  particularly Lleyton, Fitzgerald said. 																								But Wayne has had a lot of tennis and Scott also. They probably dont need as much practice as normal so keeping fresh is a big part of their preparation.																								Power server Arthurs has won three matches and lost two davis Cup singles matches, while Draper has two singles losses, both against Argentina earlier this year. 																								Australias doubles team will feature Todd Woodbridge with either Hewitt or, most likely, Arthurs.																								French duo injured																								France captain Guy Forget has decided on Sebastien Grosjean and Arnaud Clement as his singles players for the Davis Cup semi-final against the United States this weekend but both have injury problems, adds a report from Paris.																								Sebastien Grosjean is suffering back problems. 																								I got my back blocked and stiff in training on Friday. I was unable to train for two days but I was able to resume playing today and it didnt hurt, he said at a news conference Monday.																								Clement has been suffering from tendinitis in his wrist since July but still made it to the US Open fourth round.																								I had an X-ray examination yesterday and it showed that things were heading in the right direction. Im taking painkillers and I dont feel any pain. Everythings fine, Clement said ahead of the World Group semi-final on clay at Roland Garros.																								Forget said: I will tell them Wednesday evening at the latest and Tuesday evening at the earliest. I want to keep them under pressure.																								American captain Patrick McEnroe looks certain to pick James Blake and Andy Roddick for singles. Big guns Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi made themselves unavailable for the tie.  (AGENCIES)

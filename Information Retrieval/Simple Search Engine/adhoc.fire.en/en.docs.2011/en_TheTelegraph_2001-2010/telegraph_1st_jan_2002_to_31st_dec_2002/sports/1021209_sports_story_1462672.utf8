Amrintinder and Gangjee were richer by Rs 57,000 each.																								Mukesh started off shakily at the Golmuri Club when he hit his tee shot out-of-bounds and wound up with a double bogey. He followed it with a bogey from the bunker on the second . 																								However, he found his rhythm soon and after parring the next four holes, made a 15-footer birdie putt on the seventh and was one-over at the turn. 																								Ashok fell back with a bogey on the seventh and a double bogey on the par-3 ninth, where his tee shot got stuck next to the wall. 																								At Beldih, however, Mukesh was on song from the moment he teed off. After missing close birdie putts on the tenth and 11th, he made birdies on the 12th and 13th, and the contest was virtually over with Gangjee bogeying on the 11th where he pushed his tee shot into the right jungle. 																								On the 14th, Mukesh made a double bogey after hitting his tee into the right jungle and his second into the hazard. On the 16th hole, he pushed his tee shot out-of-bound and ended up with a bogey.

				 	 Brett Lee celebrates after dismissing Azhar Mahmood in Nairobi Wednesday. (AFP) 																								Nairobi: Australia needed just 19 overs to complete a nine-wicket rout of Pakistan in their triangular one-day International Wednesday.																								Having dismissed Pakistan for 117 in 32.3 overs, Ricky Pontings side strolled to their third straight victory in the tournament and their second crushing defeat of Pakistan.																								Matthew Hayden struck an unbeaten 59 while Damien Martyn struck the winning runs to finish on 20 not out.																								Pakistan skipper Waqar Younis took the only Australian wicket to fall, bowling Adam Gilchrist for 15 while Ponting retired hurt on 21 with a knee injury.																								The result was never in doubt once Pakistan were reduced to 48 for seven at one stage of their innings as Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath caused havoc.																								Pakistan, bowled out for 108 in a 224-run defeat against Australia in their first meeting of the event, lasted just 32.3 overs as their top-order succumbed to a series of rash shots.																								Pace bowler Lee finished with four for 32 while McGrath was his usual miserly self, taking three for 15 off 7.3 overs.																								Only a ninth-wicket partnership of 44 between Misbah-ul-Haq and Waqar spared Pakistans blushes  Haq hitting 39 from just 49 balls including four fours and two sixes.																								He hit consecutive boundaries off Jason Gillespie before being caught behind next ball to give Gilchrist his 195th one-day International catch. Waqar, hammered 24 including a six off leg-spinner Shane Warne before being bowled by McGrath.																								Pakistan had won the toss and elected to bat but were soon in trouble when opener Imran Nazir was sent back by Gillespie, caught by Martyn at cover. 																								Shoaib Malik and Younis Khan both fell in the 11th over with the score on 24. Lee bagged his first wicket by having opener Saeed Anwar caught by Warne for 22 and then removed Azhar Mahmood and Shahid Afridi as the middle order disintegrated. Australia and Pakistan will meet again in Saturdays final.  (REUTERS)

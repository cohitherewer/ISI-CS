				 																																	Gold Coast: Former world number one Martina Navratilova attacked Damir Dokic on Sunday over the Yugoslavs homophobic comments about lesbian players.				 																																	Navratilova, 46, is playing doubles this week at the Australian Hardcourt Womens Championships as a warm-up to next months Australian Open.				 																																	She took time out from her preparations on Sunday to respond to a threat Dokic had made earlier this month to commit suicide if he found out his tennis player daughter, Jelena, was a lesbian.				 																																	Its a good thing that I am not his daughter then, Navratilova said. Maybe its too bad Im not. Dokic also told a Serbian newspaper that more than 40 percent of women on the world tour were lesbians.				 																																	Thats a pretty stupid comment to make obviously if his sense of worth as a father is whether your daughter is a lesbian or not, said Navratilova. If thats the most important thing to him then I really feel sorry for him.				 																																	Colombo: Sri Lankan batsman Aravinda De Silva blamed lack of confidence for his teams poor performance in the tri-nations series in Australia, a news report said on Sunday.				 																																	We shouldnt be worried about the outcome of this series too much, but should focus on the World cup and get the combination right to do well there, the Island newspaper quoted De Silva as saying.				 																																	Sri Lanka has lost all three matches in the tri-nation series  two to England and one to Australia. Batsmen De Silva, Hashan Tillekeratne, Avishka Gunawardena and medium pace bowler Charitha Buddhika Fernando are leaving for Australia on Monday to take part in the five remaining matches. in the second phase of the tournament beginning January 9.				 																																	Its going to be tough for us. We need to fire all our cylinders to get to the final from now onward, De Silva said. Lack of confidence has caused the teams downfall and he was looking forward to do his best to reverse the trend, he said.				 																																	Perth: Tim Henman has pulled out of next months Australian Open having failed to recover from shoulder surgery in time.				 																																	The British number one feels his shoulder has not recovered sufficiently since undergoing arthroscopic surgery in November, he said on Sunday. 				 																																	This was a very difficult decision to make. Ive been working hard and much progress has been made but its not quite there yet and Ive said all along that I was only going to make the trip to Australia if I felt my shoulder was fully recovered, Henman said.				 																																	The news is a blow to organisers of the opening Grand Slam of the year which will also be without last years semi-finalist Tommy Haas who is also suffering from a shoulder injury.

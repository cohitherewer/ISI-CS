The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 08, 2002 				 City leg on November 24
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The sixth leg of the third JK Tyre national karting championship will be held on November 24 on a new track in the refurbished Clown Town on the south-eastern fringe of the city.																								Apart from the fact that this will be the first time that any karting meet in this country will be held over multi-layer (a bridge effect) track of 350m, it will also be the first time that JK Tyres sporting division will be offering the Genesis 6.bhp (Briggs and Stratton OHV Vanguard engine) karts that has been used in all five previous events.																								Sanjay Sharma, the motorsports head of the company, explained that offering identical karts to all participants cuts out any bias that may have been in the different vehicles at different venues.																								While the earlier arrangement made good business sense (with each centre being able to use their karts), it did create problems when the winners went over to the grand final. Hence this decision.																								The event will be co-sponsored by, among others, Maruti Suzuki, and Amaron batteries. Bengal Motor Sports Club (BMSC) will be looking after the technical aspects.																								Three categories																								From this year, the karting scene is witnessing three age categories. 																								The seniors will be above 16 years, the junior class will be between 12 and 16, and the cadet class will be between eight to 12 years.																								To stress on safety, ace trainer and techie Akbar Ibrahim will be around from November 20 to train aspiring racers. The track is unique in that part of it is in the form of a flyover. 																								It may be a good try, even as safety has been assured, but it is to be seen if 6 bhp karts can maintain uniform acceleration on such gradients. Cadets will, of course, have cadet karts.																								Entry fee remains at Rs 100 (as earlier), and the champion will be sponsored to the grand final.

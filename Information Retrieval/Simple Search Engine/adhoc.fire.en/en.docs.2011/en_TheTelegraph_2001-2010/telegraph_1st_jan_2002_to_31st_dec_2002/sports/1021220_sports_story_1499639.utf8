The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Mohun Bagan aim to extend winning run
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: It has been a roller-coaster ride for Mohun Bagan in the National Football League this season. But they have not lost any match away from home, and the city giants are keen to keep that record intact.																								In fact, after an emphatic 3-1 victory in their last match against HAL, the green-and-maroon brigade have their eyes fixed on another win against ITI. But they know that it will not be an easy task.																								ITI have a couple of Ghanaians in their ranks. Though lately they havent played well, they can come back any time, the Bagan manager said.																								He also informed that the team had a couple of hours of practice on Thursday, though Bhaichung Bhutia was obviously missing. 																								It is a huge blow for us to go into such a match without a player of the stature of Bhaichung. But nothing can be done, the manager added.																								Bhaichung suffered an injury in the last match and has been sidelined for at least one-and-a-half month.																								Though it has not been decided who will take his place, it is likely that either Sunil Chettry or Sheikh Sanjeeb will take his place. 																								One revelation for Bagan has been Liberian import George Ekeh. He has seven goals with two hattricks under his belt. 																								We really want him to fire, Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya said. And left-back Lolendra Singh, who was a bit feverish after the last match, has recovered and will play.

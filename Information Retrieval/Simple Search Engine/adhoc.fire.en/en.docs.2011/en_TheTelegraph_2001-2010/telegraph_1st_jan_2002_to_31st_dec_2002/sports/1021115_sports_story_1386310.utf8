The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 15, 2002  Comedy Of Errors lifts main event 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 I. ChistyTrainer Richard Alford leading-in his ward Comedy Of Errors (I. Chisty up) after the horse won the Hyderabad Race Club Cup at the RCTC Thursday. 				 										Calcutta: Back from Dubai where he saddled a winner last week, trainer Richard Alford continued with the winning ways on his city home track when Comedy Of Errors landed a rich gamble for the stable in the 1,200m Hyderabad Race Club Cup, the chief event in Thursdays race-card. Imran Chisty partnered the five-year-old to victory over the ring favourite Immaculate from Daniel Davids yard.				 										Daniels Another Time also performed very poorly in the Eagle Pines Cup that was easily picked up by Vijay Singhs trainee Inside Story. Considered to be a Derby prospect by her connections, Another Time, a 5-4 favourite, raised some hope 300m from home before the Steinbeck-Alarming three-year-old petered out to suggest that she needed the run badly. Cristopher Alford Guided Inside Story to a four-length victory having earlier in the afternoon helped Vijays wards Modesto, lift the baby race, Prince Blossom Plate, and Artisia win the Tubal Cain Handicap.

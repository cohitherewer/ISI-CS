(AP/PTI)																								Maspalomas (Gran Canaria): Daniela Hantuchova put in a scintillating display of power and precision to guide Slovakia to their first Fed Cup title with victory over favourites Spain on Sunday.																								The 19-year-old produced a mature performance under intense pressure to beat Conchita Martinez 6-7, 7-5, 6-4 before Janette Husarova sealed the 3-1 victory by defeating an injured Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 6-0, 6-2.																								Playing under their own flag only since 1994, Slovakia exceeded expectations by beating the five-time winners on their own turf.																								It just meant so much to me, Hantuchova said. I gave everything I had out there and I wanted to win so much. I was just doing everything I could to win.																								In a pulsating match, Martinez cleverly mixed up her game and it looked to be working when she took the first set 10-8 in the tiebreak.																								But despite being unsettled by a time-delay warning at the end of the first set, Hantuchova maintained her composure in the second to level the match on her fourth set point.																								The Slovakian then surged to a 3-0 lead in the deciding set, and served for the match at 5-3, only to be broken by a resurgent Martinez. 																								But the respite was only brief as another Hantuchova forehand brought the match to a fitting end after three hours and 21 minutes.																								Martinez also cast doubt on whether she would be back to play for Spain in next years competition.																								I have no idea. All I know now is that I dont have to play tomorrow, and I am on holiday, she said.																								Sanchez-Vicario became the first woman to play 100 Fed Cup matches when she bravely stepped on court for her match with Husarova despite suffering from a thigh injury.																								But the decision backfired as she struggled with her mobility throughout the clash.																								The doubles, which had been due to complete the best-of-five tie, was cancelled with the agreement of both teams.																								Slovakia will begin the defence of their title away to Germany in April 2003, while Spain entertain Australia. (REUTERS)

																								Margao: Churchill Brothers would be looking forward to score their first win when they clash with ITI in the National Football League on Monday.																								Having collected four points from five matches, Churchill have their morale high after holding East Bengal.																								The home conditions will also give them an edge over their rivals, who have two points from five matches (three losses and two draws). Churchill will pin their hopes on their star striker Yusuf Yakubu, who has been their mainstay in the upfront. 																								Defenders Osumanu Hussein, Mahesh Gawli and keeper Edward Ansah have given solidity to the defence, but their midfield has not played to their potential and with the absence of Noel Wilson (double booking), their attack would lack the thrust.																								ITI will be strengthened by the three foreign recruits medio Osei (Ghana), and strikers Ibrahim (Ghana) and Ali Hassan (Iraq). 																								The first two played against JCT in their last drawn match, while Hassan will make his debut on Monday.																								Churchill coach, Marcus Pacheco said: We need a victory very badly to collect more points as we have too many drawn encounters, which we want to stop.																								 ITI coach, Sabir Ali said the three foreign recruits had strengthened the side. 																								Our boys did better in the last match against JCT and I expect them to do better tomorrow also.  (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, September 06, 2002 				 Our best yet to come: Owen
				 	 Michael Owen at a press conference in Birmingham Thursday																								Birmingham: Michael Owen will captain England for this weekends friendly against Portugal in place of injured David Beckham, the Football Association (FA) said on its website on Thursday.																								Owen had been widely expected to take over the captaincy for Saturdays match at Villa Park once Beckham withdrew from Sven-Goran Erikssons squad after suffering a calf strain in Manchester Uniteds win over Middlesbrough on Tuesday.																								Owen first became skipper  and the countrys second youngest ever captain after the late Bobby Moore  in April when the Liverpool striker scored in Englands 4-0 victory over Paraguay in a pre-World Cup friendly at Anfield.																								With Beckham then recovering from a broken bone in his foot, Owen was also captain for Englands friendlies against South Korea and Cameroon just before the start of the World Cup.																								Beckham returned in time for Englands group opener against Sweden and held on to the captains armband throughout their run to the quarter-finals.																								 Owen said on Thursday that England cannot afford to dwell on their World Cup disappointment and must look to the future.																								Owen revealed that the squad and coach Sven-Goran Eriksson would be holding a meeting to discuss the World Cup, where they lost to Brazil in the quarter finals, later on Thursday.																								Were going to have that meeting tonight, said Owen, who will lead the side in Saturdays friendly against Portugal at Villa Park in the absence of injured David Beckham.																								Were going to have a general chat about what happened. The main part of the meeting will be on the future, Owen said. The managers not one to dwell on the past. We may spend a few minutes talking about the World Cup but apart from that it will be used as an exercise to try to improve our performances.																								Owen said he was delighted to have the honour again. Its just as good, he said. You never get tired of captaining your country.																								England are using Saturdays game as a warm-up for their 2004 European championship qualifying campaign, which starts next month against Slovakia in group seven. Obviously it was not nice going out of the World Cup but we have got to look forward now, Owen added. The best of this team is still to come.  (REUTERS)

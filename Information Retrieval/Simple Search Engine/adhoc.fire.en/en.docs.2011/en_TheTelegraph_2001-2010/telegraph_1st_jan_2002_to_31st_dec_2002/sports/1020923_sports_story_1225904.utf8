The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, September 23, 2002 				 Waugh no to Hussain strategy
				 	 Waugh: No need to follow negative plan 																								London: Australian captain Steve Waugh would not have followed the negative bowling tactics against Sachin Tendulkar as adopted by England captain Nasser Hussain.																								When asked whether he would have asked his bowlers to bowl an outside the leg-stump line to Tendulkar, the way English left-arm spinner Ashley Giles did, Waugh said: I would hope not.																								With my attack, we would try to bowl him out. You get more satisfaction trying to get a guy out conventionally, Waugh said.																								However, he justified Hussains strategy saying the England skipper was only looking after his teams interests.																								Im in a pretty privileged position. But he (Hussain) worked out his tactics and stuck by them. Youve got to respect him for that.																								Waugh informed he was committed to raise half a million Australian dollars for the new centre at the Calcutta girls foundation that he founded at the Udayan school established 30 years ago by an Englishman, Rev. James Stevens.																								Its a life commitment, Waugh said. Fate leads you in different adventures. I was invited to visit a rehabilitation centre for the children of lepers when we played in Calcutta, and I asked why only boys were catered for. He followed his inquiry by setting up a wing that now houses 53 girls. (PTI)

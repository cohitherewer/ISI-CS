The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, September 18, 2002 				 Dalmiya at ease, Shah is marked
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 DALMIYA: Caught between loyalists																								Calcutta: The build-up to the last AGM of the Board, in Chennai, had seen Jagmohan Dalmiya work overtime to topple A.C.Muthiah from the presidents chair.																								Dalmiya won with a comfortable 17-13 margin and, even if an ambush is being plotted, should come through unscathed in the AGM being held held here Thursday-Friday.																								In any case, this time, much of Dalmiyas energy is going towards trying to resolve a ticklish (intra-group) problem: Who should be official candidate for the secretaryship?																								According to The Telegraphs sources, the contenders are joint-secretary Jyoti Bajpai and finance committee chairman S.K.Nair.																								Though incumbent Niranjan Shah hasnt put a foot wrong  except asking the cricketers to sign the Player Terms when they were struggling to save the Lords Test  he still remains someone who got through (last year) on a Muthiah-ticket.																								Bluntly put, the Dalmiya-led group continues to see Shah as an outsider and he simply cant be accommodated. Moreover, given the power-driven equations within the Board, being politically correct matters immensely. 																								While Muthiah himself was defeated in Chennai, Shah upset the Dalmiya groups Jaywant Lele 16-15  thanks, of course, to the then presidents casting vote. A year on, therefore, Shah is very much a marked man.																								Actually, had Bajpai been fielded instead of Lele, theres a good chance he would today have been the secretary. Bajpai, after all, would have scored on the acceptability-front.																								Tactically, keeping faith in Lele was a blunder.																								Having been joint-secretary for five years, the Dalmiya group should unanimously be projecting Bajpai. However, Dalmiya is understood to have made some commitment to Nair, a former treasurer, and so is caught between loyalists.																								While its unlikely a (group) decision will be taken much before the AGM gets underway, a compromise could see Nair as the official nominee with Bajpai being persuaded to continue as joint-secretary for one year more.																								In such an eventuality, Bajpai will be the Dalmiya groups candidate to succeed Kishore Rungta as treasurer in 2003.																								Significantly, while the Boards constitution specifies the upper-limit for the president (three years), secretary (five years) and treasurer (five years), it is silent on the joint-secretary.																								Bajpai, then, wont be breaching any provision if he does agree to the arrangement being talked about.

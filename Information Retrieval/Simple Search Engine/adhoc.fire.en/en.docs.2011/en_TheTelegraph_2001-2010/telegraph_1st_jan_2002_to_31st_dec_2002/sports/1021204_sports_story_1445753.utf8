		 Wednesday, December 04, 2002 				 Pak ask ICC for compensation
																								Karachi: Pakistan has filed a compensation plea with the ICC disputes committee against New Zealand for refusing to play a triangular series in September, a cricket official said on Tuesday.																								Since New Zealand pulled out of our triangular one-day contest this year after conveying their participation, they should compensate for the loss of revenues, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Director Chishty Mujahid said.																								He said that the compensation claim had been submitted at the last executive board meeting of the ICC in Colombo in October and had been sent to the disputes committee.																								New Zealand refused to play in Pakistans Golden Jubilee triangular contest also involving Australia in September, saying they had never given final confirmation.																								But Mujahid said that New Zealand had agreed to play in the one-day contest. They agreed to play the triangular in lieu of their decision to play just two Tests and not the regular three Tests during their rescheduled tour of Pakistan in April, Mujahid said.																								Pakistan eventually had to shift the Golden Jubilee tournament to Nairobi after Australia expressed safety concerns about playing in Pakistan. After New Zealands withdrawal, Kenya agreed to play in the tournament.																								Our point is as the tournament was shifted to a neutral venue there was no reason for the New Zealanders to have any security concerns about playing, Mujahid explained.																								He said Pakistan was waiting for a reply from the ICC on the matter, but declined to say how much compensation Pakistan was seeking. (REUTERS)

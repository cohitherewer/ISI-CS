				 	 Sachin Tendulkar autographs souvenirs in Colombo Friday																								Colombo: Sachin Tendulkar Friday said Indias present one-day combination of experience and youth was just right for next years World Cup.																								I think we fit the combination right, Sachin told reporters when asked if the present balance between the younger players and the established stars in the team would be the ideal one for the World Cup.																								We still have five months to go (for the World Cup), and its hard to predict. Hopefully, this lot stays together. The confidence is very high, he said.																								Sachin said he felt no additional pressure to perform after relative new-comers like Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag and Mohammed Kaif started contributing significantly to the teams overall performance.																								Sachin said the recent tour of England was one of the most satisfying in his career as India won the NatWest Trophy and came back from 0-1 down to level the Test series. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, November 24, 2002 				 WI register protest
																								St. Johns (Antigua) Nov. 23 (Reuters): West Indies have registered strong disappointment and protest at the decision by Match Referee Mike Procter to award India victory in the third one-day International in Rajkot 11 days ago.																								Chasing 301, India were cruising at 200 for one in 27.1 overs when crowd trouble brought the game to an end. The home team were declared winners by 81 runs using the Duckworth/Lewis method but WICB president Wes Hall has written to ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed saying a no-result would have been more reasonable.																								Hall argues: (There is) no basis in merit, as the match was not interrupted by rain or any other force of nature. If we accept the foregoing then the match referees decision has set a dangerous precedent by paving the way for unruly crowds to influence the outcome of matches. We cannot entertain this possibility.																								The stoppage in Rajkot happened after West Indies fielder Vasbert Drakes was struck on his leg by an object thrown from the crowd. Attempts were made to restart but play was called off after 90 minutes. Procter is reporting to the ICC on the trouble.

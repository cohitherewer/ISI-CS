		 Monday, December 16, 2002  BRIEFS
				 																																	Leicester: Gary Lineker, the former England striker, has been given the go-ahead for his consortium to take over English first division promotion contenders Leicester City.				 																																	The cash-strapped club, who beat Millwall 4-1 Saturday, were placed in administration seven weeks ago but their major creditors have accepted Linekers rescue package.				 																																	A statement on the official Leicester website Saturday said: The administrators are delighted to announce that the major creditor and effective owner (US-owned Teachers Bank) of the stadium has accepted their recommendation to back the Lineker consortium in their bid to purchase the club.				 																																	There remains some work to do to conclude a deal but the process will now be totally geared to concluding a deal with the Lineker group. A spokesman for the Lineker consortium said: Gary and the consortium aim to conclude this deal as soon as possible to allow (manager) Micky (Adams) and the team to focus on winning football matches.				 																																	London: Leeds United manager Terry Venables has hit out at the transfer window system saying it merely delays the movement of players between clubs and does not make allowance for squads hit by a large number of injuries.				 																																	Its no secret that I want to sign  and need to sign  new players to help turn things around here at Leeds United. But Im not allowed to right now because of the ridiculous new transfer window system that has been imposed on our domestic game this season, Venables said in the News of the World.				 																																	The transfer window, introduced by world governing body Fifa and Uefa in March, means clubs are restricted to two transfer periods, one between the end of the season in May and August 31 and the other between January 1-31.				 																																	But Venables, writing in his weekly column, showed his frustration with the system, saying: I will have to wait until next month before I can go out and recruit some fresh blood, even though I need additions to the squad right now.				 																																	Cairo: African Champions League runners-up Raja Casablanca have been fined $15,000 after displaying a banned logo on their playing kit during the final, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said Sunday. 				 																																	The Moroccan club were handed the maximum fine and also stand to lose part of the $750,000 they earned in the competition after the incident at the first leg of the final in Casablanca on November 30. 				 																																	CAF have suspended Rajas share of the marketing and television revenue until the competitions marketing company decide on a possible claim for compensation.				 																																	Mexico City: Three first division coaches in Mexico, one a Peruvian, have been sacked after their clubs were eliminated in the Apertura championship quarter finals.Julio Cesar Uribe and Daniel Guzman were sacked by the two Guadalajara sides, UAG Tecos and Chivas respectively, the clubs announced Friday. 				 																																	Cruz Azul have dismissed Jose Luis Trejo who had been at the club for five years, the last three in the top flight.				 																																	Antwerp: Australian David Palmer, the former world No. 1, added the only major title missing from his collection as he to beat John White of Scotland in the final of the World Open squash Saturday.				 																																	The fifth seed had flown his mother and father to Europe from Alligator Creek, Queensland, and he rewarded them with two games of breathtaking brilliance.				 																																	I knew I had to attack, White said. But from the third game onwards David changed tactics and didnt open up the court so much. That got his confidence up and it put me under pressure.				 																																	 n Cricket, Bangladesh vs West Indies, 2nd Test from 9 am live on ESPN n Cricket, South Africa vs Pakistan, 4th ODI live from 4.30pm on ESPN n Soccer, Spanish League, from 12 noon on STAR Sports n Soccer, Premier League, Bolton Wanderers vs Leeds United live from 1.25 am (Tuesday) on STAR Sports

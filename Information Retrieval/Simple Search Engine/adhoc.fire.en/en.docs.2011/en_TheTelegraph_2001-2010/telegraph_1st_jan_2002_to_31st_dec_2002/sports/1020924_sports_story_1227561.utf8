				 																																	Leeds: Leeds United and England midfielder Lee Bowyer says he fears going out following the high-profile court case that cleared him of assault charges against a teenage student.				 																																	The 25-year-old, who made his long-delayed England debut against Portugal this month, said on Monday that he has decided to live the quiet life. Its not me I am concerned about  its my mum, he said. When she picks up the paper she is reading all about this scumbag  its not right. I cant afford to be caught up in anything that I shouldnt. I dont like going out because it scares me. I go to work then I go home. I dont really do much else except go fishing and walk my dogs. Thats how it has got to be in football now with me, especially after what has happened.				 																																	Bowyer was found not guilty of all charges relating to an attack on Sarfraz Najeib in January 2000. 				 																																	Athens: The unsightly forest of rooftop television aerials in the Greek capital will be removed before the 2004 Olympics to make a more attractive background for events such as the marathon.				 																																	Officials said on Monday that thousands of aerials crowding the rooftops of apartment buildings on main avenues would be removed, as owners responded to incentives to replace them with underground cables.				 																																	Priority will be on Olympic Games related routes. The state will pick up part of the cost, Victoria Kesisoglou, head of special projects at the Environment Ministry, said.				 																																	Officials estimate more than 3,000 aerials will be removed, affecting some 10,000 apartment dwellers.				 																																	Dubai: Korea won the 10th AFC under-17 championship beating Yemen 5-3 in a penalty shootout in the final at Al Nahyan Stadium in Abu Dhabi Sunday.				 																																	The outcome of the match was decided in a shootout after both sides were locked 1-1 at the end of regulation and extra-time. In fact, Yemens fate could have been sealed earlier if a shot from Koreas Dong Hyun Yang had not struck the upright with a minute left of extra-time. Yemen, appearing in their first AFC Championship finals, played most of the extra-time with ten men, following the injury of a player  they were unable to field a replacement for him as they had utilised all substitutes. 				 																																	London: Former French Open champion Michael Chang could be making his final appearance at the Hong Kong Open this week when he takes on fourth seed Alex Corretja in the first round. The three-time winner of the tournament, handed a wildcard for the event since his world ranking has plummeted to 118, has made no secret during the season that his playing days are numbered.				 																																	With the 30-year-old Chang having enjoyed huge popularity in Asia throughout his career, the American said he was looking forward to his 12th and possibly last outing in Hong Kong.				 																																	n Table Tennis: Japan Open, from 9.00 am on STAR Sports n Soccer: English Premier League, from 9.00 pm on ESPN n Soccer: Champions League live, from 12 midnight on ESPN

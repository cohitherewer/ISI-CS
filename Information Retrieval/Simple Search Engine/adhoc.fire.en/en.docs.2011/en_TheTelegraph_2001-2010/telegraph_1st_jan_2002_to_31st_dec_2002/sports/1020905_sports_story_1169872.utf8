The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, September 05, 2002 				 No male lifter named yet
				 	 Saraswati: Pusan-bound 																								New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association Wednesday released the first list of the Indian contingent for the 14th Asian Games to be held in Pusan, from September 29 to October 14. The 320-member list, which also includes coaches and officials, has been cleared by the government and there would be more additions to the second list. 																								Athletics account for the biggest squad with 33 athletes and 18 officials. The mens and womens hockey teams and the 35-member shooting contingent have also been cleared in the first list. The Indian contingent, which returned with a record haul of 30 gold medals in the recent Commonwealth Games in Manchester, is likely to take part in 25 disciplines in Pusan.																								While five women weightlifters have been cleared, none of their male counterparts find a place in the first list. This assumes significance in the wake of the dope scandal in Manchester. Two of the male lifters Krishnan Madasamy and Sateesh Rai had failed the dope test in the Commonwealth Games. 																								 Kunjurani Devi and Sanamacha Chanu, who made a clean sweep of all the three gold medals in their respective weight categories in Manchester, are among the five weightlifters cleared in the first batch. Neelam Sethi Laxmi, Pujari Shailaja and Pratima Kumari are the other three named.

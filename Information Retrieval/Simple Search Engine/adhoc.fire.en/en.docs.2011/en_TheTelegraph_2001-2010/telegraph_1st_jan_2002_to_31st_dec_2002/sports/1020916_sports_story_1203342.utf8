The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Seven players opt for a break
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta: Seven Indian cricketers, including captain Sourav Ganguly, have been given a break from the on-going Champions Trophy in Colombo.																								Accordingly, Sourav arrived in the city late Sunday  for the first time in three months  while Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, V.V.S. Laxman, Ajit Agarkar, Virender Sehwag and Ashish Nehra were also expected to hit home.																								Thanks to the tournaments peculiar schedule, the gap between Indias first and second match is as many as eight days and, so, the cricketers had sought per- mission to come home a few days back itself.																								However, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya didnt immediately give the green signal. He did so Sunday afternoon.																								As there could have been complications, I told the boys that the ICC would first have to accord permission. As that came through in the morning, I then gave the BCCIs approval, Dalmiya told The Telegraph.																								The cricketers are to report back in Colombo by Thursday morning. Indias next match, against England, is on Sunday.

		 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 Ronaldo in no hurry to take field
 (REUTERS)																								Madrid: Real Madrids 47 million Euro ($46.31 million) signing Ronaldo is in no hurry to make his first appearance for his new team and says he is looking forward to fighting it out for a place at the best club in the world.																								I am going to take my time, make sure I dont rush things and concentrate on enjoying playing again, Ronaldo said on Tuesday during his first official press conference since joining the European champions.																								Real are the biggest and best club in the world, the players have got fantastic technical skill and there will be a lot of competition to play. But that sort of competition is what motivates players.																								The Brazilian striker explained that he was suffering from a minor muscle strain in his left leg and that he hoped to begin training next week, but added that he did not expect any repetition of the knee problems that plagued him during his last three seasons at Inter Milan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, September 14, 2002 				 Tennis queen may hit the screen 
				 	 Serena Williams tries out a traditional Chinese outfit  in Hong Kong Friday. (Reuters)																								Hong Kong: If cat-suited tennis queen Serena Williams gets her wish, the newly-crowned US Open champion could be appearing on the silver screen in future  as a high-kicking martial arts star.																								The powerfully built world No. 1, who flew into Hong Kong early Thursday to play an exhibition match, glided into a press conference 20 minutes late after the renowned shopaholic indulged in a bout of pre-shopping and charmed her way through a barrage of questions.																								One asked her whether she had been serious about wanting to become a martial arts star and when the first seeds of interest had been sown, she said, Im a big Jackie Chan fan. 																								It must have been when I watched a Jackie Chan movie, confessed Serena before adding with a twinkle in her eye, I was probably never really serious about it. But Id like to do some acting. Ive done some before. But probably not for a career, just to have fun.																								Adorned in her now famous black skintight cat-suit, Serena captured her third consecutive Grand Slam title a week earlier, demolishing her elder sister Venus in a US Open showdown for the No. 1 ranking.																								She said the fact the siblings had become so dominant would not bore tennis fans. Not at all. Its very exciting for the game... To see a rivalry unfolding and history in the making. (AFP)

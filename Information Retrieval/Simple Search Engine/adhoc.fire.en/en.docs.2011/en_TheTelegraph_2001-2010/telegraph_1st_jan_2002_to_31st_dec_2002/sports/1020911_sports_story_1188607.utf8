																								London: Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said Nasser Hussain could have adopted a more attacking strategy in the final Test to force a result.																								In this Test, Nasser could have attacked more on the second day  though it is fair to say that he stuck to the same attritional tactics he used at Lords where England came up with a victory, said the Indian captain.																								England have had more than their fair share of drawn series over the last couple of years, and that goes to show the way they play the game, said Sourav. If you want to turn those draws into series wins, sometimes you have to risk losing Test matches to do it.																								Sourav said though solved now, the sponsorship issue was again going to come to the fore during next years World Cup. 																								At the end of the day, we want the ICC to make money for the good of the game and we were determined to come to terms with them. But the World Cup is inevitably going to throw up the same problems. We have to name our team by October 31, a month after the Champion Trophy ends and we want everyting sorted out by then. (PTI)

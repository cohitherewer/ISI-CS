		 Friday, October 25, 2002 				 Blatter to retire in 2006
																								Zurich: Sepp Blatter has said he will stand down from his role as Fifa president in 2006. Blatter, who will be 70 in 2006, said in an interview with the December issue of Sports Business magazine that he would leave at the end of his second four-year term as the head of soccers world governing body.																								I have said I am in the second half of the football game, Blatter said.																								From the very beginning I said my presidency will not be more than two mandates. I am now in the second mandate and at the end of it I will be 70 years old. I think it will be the correct time then to leave the organisation.																								Blatter was re-elected in May on the eve of the World Cup finals in South Korea and Japan, defeating Cameroons Issa Hayatou, the head of the Confederation of African Football.																								He said he would begin considering a suitable replacement in 2004, the year in which Fifa celebrate their 100th anniversary. (Reuters)

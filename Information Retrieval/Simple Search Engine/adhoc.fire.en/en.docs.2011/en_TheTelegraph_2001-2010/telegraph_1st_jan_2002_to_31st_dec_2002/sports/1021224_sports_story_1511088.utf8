 BY DEREK PRINGLE 				 	 Hoggard: Edgy about recall																								The season of goodwill, which has been extended to Stuart MacGill following the leg-spinners selection for Australias squad for the fourth Test, may have turned sour for England fast bowler Matthew Hoggard.																								Although Hoggard hopes for a return after spending a fortnight working on his bowling, his tour record of one wicket for 248 runs in two Tests, means it would be based on faith rather than form.																								While MacGill can celebrate his call-up for the match starting Wednesday, it will be an uneasy Christmas for Hoggard, who will also be on tenterhooks over the World Cup squad, to be named by the end of this year.																								Ill be apprehensive but, hopefully, itll be a happy Christmas if I get my Test place back and make the World Cup squad, Hoggard said, before adding, with an enigmatic smile: I dont know if itll happen, Ive not heard from the management for a while.																								After taking 45 wickets in nine Tests, it was Hoggards lack of wickets in his next two that saw him dropped for the third Test in Perth. Like the other Test players deemed surplus to one-day requirements, Hoggard remained there like a castaway, rebuilding his action, though not, as team management claimed, his confidence.																								In his column for the BBCs website, Hoggard said that he had not lost confidence and that he had been made a scapegoat for Englands woeful performances. On Sunday, he claimed the words had been put into his mouth.																								The point I was trying to make was that everyone was struggling against Australia, not just me and England, Hoggard said. The Aussies are playing out of their skin and I wasnt bowling the best I could. Instead of expecting to take wickets, I was running up and hoping to take them. The management saw fit to drop me and in the long run it may have done me good.																								Hoggards problems stem from being too predictable when the ball does not swing. On true Australian pitches, he has been cannon fodder, his whippy, round-arm action unable to get much bounce.																								Ive shortened my run-up by four paces and got my rhythm back, Hoggard said. Also, the balls shaping again and Im staying taller at the crease so the time spent with [bowling coach] Graham Dilley has worked well. Being dropped was a bit of a shock, though if anything, its made me even more determined to get back in.																								To help facilitate that, England coach Duncan Fletcher has given him a copy of a piece Glenn McGrath wrote about the factors that make him such a good bowler. Although McGrath and the superb Jason Gillespie will be back to torment Englands batsmen, Shane Warne, having dislocated his shoulder, will not.																								Hoggard reckons England will gain a psychological lift from his absence, but then so will MacGill. In the Ashes series here four years ago, MacGill took 27 wickets in four Tests.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

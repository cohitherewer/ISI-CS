The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, November 25, 2002 				 Anil Kumble not available
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Vijayawada: Senior pro Anil Kumble has made himself unavailable for the two-Test series in New Zealand. As a result, Murali Kartik, who made a comeback in the ODIs, which ended Sunday, has emerged a certainty for one of the 16 berths.																								According to a very well-placed source of The Telegraph, Kumble has asked for a break on personal grounds. Its not clear whether he will be available for the second half of the tour, when seven ODIs will be played.																								The national selectors, with Brijesh Patel in the chair, meet in Mumbai Monday to select the squad for the Test series. Patels colleagues are Kirti Azad, Pranab Roy, Kiran More and Sanjay Jagdale.																								Meanwhile, in another development late Sunday, some of the selectors are inclined to rest another veteran, Jawagal Srinath, for the two Tests. He will, of course, be around in the ODIs.																								However, its to be seen whether captain Sourav Ganguly will agree to Srinath being given a break. Look, we wanted to rest him during the just-ended ODIs, but couldnt because of the way the series shaped up. Now, weve got to give him a break. He needs to get stronger and fitter, is how one of the selectors put it.																								Srinath, it may be recalled, came out of a short (Test-specific) retirement in end-September.																								After some debate, its more or less confirmed that a second wicketkeeper (besides Parthiv Patel, that is) will be picked. Deep Dasgupta still stands a reasonably good chance  as has already been reported in these columns. Only, quite a few have taken note of his shoddy keeping in the Ranji game against Himachal.																								Clearly, Deeps backers arent going to have it easy.																								Incidentally, theres much speculation over whether both Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh will make the cut. The suspense, so to say, should clear not many hours from now.

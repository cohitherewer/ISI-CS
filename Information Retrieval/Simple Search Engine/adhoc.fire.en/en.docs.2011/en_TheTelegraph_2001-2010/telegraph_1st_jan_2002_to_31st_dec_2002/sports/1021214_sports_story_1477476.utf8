		 Saturday, December 14, 2002 				 Vandalism in Wellington
																								Wellington: Two persons were arrested for vandalising the Basin Reserve ground, venue of the ongoing first Test between India and New Zealand, an official said here Friday.																								They were caught early this morning when they were burning a small patch of grass with petrol to write a slogan on the bowlers run-up, said NZC media manager Simon Wilson. They could write only no wa.. before being arrested by the security staff. They were charged with vandalism and tresspassing, he said. They were locals and probably protesting against war and terrorism. They were not targetting the Indian team. The Indian team management played down the incident, saying it had not affected the players. We are not concerned about it, said India manager N. R. Choudhary. (AFP)

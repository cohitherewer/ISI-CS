																								Johannesburg: South African batsman Daryll Cullinan made a public apology Monday over his refusal to play against Australia in March this year.

Id like to apologise to the team, cricket supporters and the United Cricket Board for bringing the game into disrepute and Id like to reconfirm my commitment to the game.

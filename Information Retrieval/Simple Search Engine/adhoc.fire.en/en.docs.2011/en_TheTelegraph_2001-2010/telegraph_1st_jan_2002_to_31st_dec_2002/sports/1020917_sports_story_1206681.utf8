The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 The secret lies in McGraths new run-up 
																								Colombo: Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath has revealed he used a new run-up to wreck New Zealands top-order in Sundays Champions Trophy clash.																								McGrath took five for 37 as defending champions New Zealand were shot out for just 132 to be beaten by 164 runs. But afterwards the fast bowler said he had taken his fifth five-wicket haul with a run-up he had used just once before, in practice. I tried it out for about ten balls in the nets and it felt okay so I decided to give it a go in the match, he told reporters.																								McGrath had reduced his original 27-metre run to 17 metres during the recent triangular series against Pakistan and Kenya but found he was struggling for rhythm.																								He lengthened it to around 22-1/2 metres in the nets on Saturday and when it felt good he decided to use it in the match.																								I have two markers in my run-up now as a point of reference, he said. I didnt have them before and I was getting lost. I got my rhythm back and got nough balls in the right area so Ill take that.																								Despite his run-up problems, McGrath said he felt his method was very straightforward. I dont bowl quick and I dont do much with the ball, he said. I just land the ball where I want to. I think accuracy is my biggest key and a bit of bounce as well. (REUTERS)

		 Monday, September 09, 2002 				 Lift ban on Azharuddin, Jadeja: Kapil
				 	 Azhar																								Ludhiana: Kapil Dev thinks the ban on former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja should be lifted.																								The players were suspended by the BCCI for match-fixing, Azhar for life and Jadeja for five years. Both have challenged the decision at the court.																								Kapil said there was no proof against Azhar and Jadeja. It is unjust to hold a player guilty merely on the basis of some statements by one or two individuals, said the former India captain. 																								Kapil, recently chosen Indian Cricketer of the Century by Wisden, added: In the case of Azhar and Jadeja, nobody has so far informed these poor victims of what their real fault is. Everything appears to be fishy.																								Kapil clarified he was not out to defend anybody. (PTI)

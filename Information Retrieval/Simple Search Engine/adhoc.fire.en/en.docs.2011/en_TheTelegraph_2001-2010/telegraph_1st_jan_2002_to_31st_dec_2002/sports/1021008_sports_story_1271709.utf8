The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, October 08, 2002 				 Mohun Bagan serve notice on coach
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 SUBRATA: Tie vs Valencia more important																								Calcutta: In a significant move aimed at curbing anti-club activities, Mohun Bagan Monday served coach Subrata Bhattacharya a showcause notice and accepted vice-president Chuni Goswamis resignation. 																								The clubs executive committee met Monday and decided to serve the notice for Bhattacharyas reported outburst at some club officials, general secretary Anjan Mitra said. The committee, however, took for granted Goswamis resignation letter with a warning that any future criticism of the club by its officials and players would be dealt with strongly and in an exemplary manner, Mitra added. 																								The committee will send Subrata the notice after pujas and he will be asked to reply within 15 days on receiving it, he said. 																								Subrata went on record saying that organisers IFA, rivals East Bengal and some section of Mohun Bagan officials, including the clubs assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury, were involved in hatching a conspiracy to deny his team the Super Division title, because they were envious of his success as a coach. 																								The Mohun Bagan coach, however, puffed away such warning and refused to read too much into it till he gets to know contents of the letter. 																								My mind is now fixed on Wednesdays AFC Champions League qualifier against Valencia (of Maldives). It is our home match and nothing can satisfy me other than a win, Bhattacharya said. 																								Ive not seen Valencia playing, but heard they boast of having eight national players in their ranks. Its going to be a tough fight, he added. 																								Bhattacharya, however, was relieved at the news that the quartet of Bhaichung Bhutia, Rennedy Singh, Satish Bharti and Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, who were on national assignment at the Busan Asian Games, would be available for the match. 																								I prefer to keep my squad against Saunders SC unchanged Wednesday and start (Jose Ramirez) Barreto with Bhaichung upfront, he revealed. 																								He, however, feared that jetlag could come in the way of the quartets performance in the match, but hastened to add that their very presence would be a confidence booster for the entire team.

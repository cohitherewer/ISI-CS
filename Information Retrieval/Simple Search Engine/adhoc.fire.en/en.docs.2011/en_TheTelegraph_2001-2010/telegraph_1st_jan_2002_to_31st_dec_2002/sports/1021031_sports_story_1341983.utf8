The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, October 31, 2002  R. Alford to train in Dubai from today 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Richard Alford, the city-based trainer, will be making history of sorts on Thursday when he saddles his first runner in Dubais Nad-al-sheba racecourse. Last Sunday, the champion trainer was awarded a licence to train in the gulf state. He also intends to train simultaneously at his home turf  RCTC, thus becoming the first Indian to do so, though it is a common practice abroad. Richard will, however, miss out the opening two race meetings in RCTC as he is unlikely to returns to the city before November 13.				 										Speaking from his hotel in Dubai, the veteran trainer said: Its going to be a big challenge. Training simultaneously at home and abroad is not going to be easy. Lets see how things work out. Alfords chief patron will be Rashid Bouresly, a Kuwait-based owner who has bought him a string of 20 horses. Bouresly has, however, no problem if Richard desires to shuttle between India and the gulf states. Richard will be chiefly training in Dubai but weekly visits to the Al-Jebel racecourse in UAE during the month of Ramzaan are quite on the cards.

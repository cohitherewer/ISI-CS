The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, November 17, 2002 				 Rlys taught me to fight it out: Bangar 
 FROM ATREYO MUKHOPADHYAY				 	 bangar																								Vadodara, Nov. 16: The gentle Railways opener, who earned the nickname Gautam Buddha from Rahul Dravid for his patient vigil at the wicket during the Test series in England earlier this year, has shown he can operate at an altogether different gear if and when required.																								Sanjay Bangar, the soft-spoken 30-year-old from Aurangabad, now residing in Mumbai, is promising to be the answer to quite a few of the Indian teams problems. 																								Bangar spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday on his philosophy of cricket and what keeps him ticking in the big league.																								Following are excerpts																								On lessons learnt from representing a relatively low-profile team like Railways 																								It was a good learning experience. It was a team devoid of stars and we had to perform together to ensure we succeeded. We had to earn each point. It taught me the importance of shouldering responsibility. It helped me develop into a total cricketer. The Railways days taught me how to fight adverse conditions.																								On the experience of playing with cricketers from almost every corner of the country																								This cant be expressed in words comprehensively. It gave me important insights into the culture of players from other parts of the country. Their upbringing, their ways of being and the way they think.																								On whether he considers himself as an allrounder or a batsman who can bowl.																								I am yet to perform exceedingly well as a bowler. So in that sense I think I am a batsman who can bowl. I wouldnt say I have improved as a bowler. But I would like to add that I am yet to deliver what Im capable of as a bowler. 																								On making his Test debut as an allrounder, then being asked to open and subsequently making the one-day grade as allrounder.																								Primarily, it is very satisfying to being able to do whatever you have been asked to do. Its a question of adjusting yourself according to requirements. Thats how you prepare yourself. But Im yet to seal a slot in the one-day squad. One good outing doesnt earn you that.																								On whether he has really been tested as Test opener yet.																								Probably the New Zealand series will be a bigger test. Conditions will be different. There will be more pressure. But then, the experience of opening in Tests will also be there.																								On whether he deserves the label of being too slow in Tests.																								The seniors have told me that you need a little bit of time to get used to it. I think Ill have to make full use of the loose deliveries more consistently. I think I have to work on this aspect.																								On how it felt to be rubbing shoulders with the Sachin Tendulkars.																								There is a lot to learn from the hunger they have. They are never satisfied with what they have achieved and working religiously on their game. Also, the way they handle sustained pressure.																								On whether his upbringing helped in his achievements																								It has been the most important part. Things like working hard, being disciplined and honest are just a few things to mention.

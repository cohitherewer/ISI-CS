		 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 				 Paul Collingwood gets English call-up
																								Adelaide: England, 0-2 down in the Ashes Test series called uncapped Durham allrounder Paul Collingwood to their squad on Monday as cover for injured batsmen Michael Vaughan and John Crawley.																								We are concerned about Crawley and Vaughan for Perth (where the third Test starts on Friday), said England coach Duncan Fletcher. Especially Crawley, he doesnt look too good. Vaughan has got slight discomfort but we are still pretty hopeful about him playing. Weve called in Collingwood, who is flying from Melbourne. Hes playing grade cricket there and is flying in to provide back-up for the batters.																								Vaughan has a bruised shoulder after he was struck by a delivery from Australias Jason Gillespie while scoring 177 in the second Test. Crawley missed the match with a thigh injury.																								If there is a problem with both Collingwood will have a very good chance of playing, Fletcher added. To some degree it was the most convenient. He is out here playing grade cricket and he is in our one-day squad as a batting allrounder. With jet lag, its important to have someone out here.																								England paceman Andy Caddick will have a scan on his injured back on Monda. The 34-year-old Somerset player, who suffered back spasms during the second Test, is hoping to recover in time for the game in Perth.																								England trained at the Adelaide Oval on Monday. All-rounder Andrew Flintoff and left-arm spinner Ashley Giles are already out of the Perth Test through injury, while fast bowlers Darren Gough and Simon Jones have been ruled out of the five-match series because of knee problems.

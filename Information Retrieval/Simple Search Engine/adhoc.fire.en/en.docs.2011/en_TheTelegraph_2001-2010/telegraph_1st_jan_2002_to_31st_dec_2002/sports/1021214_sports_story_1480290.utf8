		 Saturday, December 14, 2002 				 Pollock sets up SA win
																								East London: South Africa beat Pakistan by 62 runs in the third one-day International on Friday. Set to score 183, the visitors were bundled out for 120 in 36.1 overs, Shaun Pollock doing the star turn for the hosts with a three-wicket haul.																								Earlier, Shoaib Akhtar took three for 50 as South Africa fell for a modest total. The hosts, who won the toss and elected to bat on a sound pitch, were dismissed in 47.5 overs.																								Herschelle Gibbs was the first casualty of the innings in the eighth over when he mistimed a drive off Waqar Younis and was well caught by Abdul Razzaq at mid-on for 13. (REUTERS)

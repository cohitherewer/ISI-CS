		 Monday, December 16, 2002 				 Series victory for Zimbabwe
				 	 OLONGA: Six for 28																								Bulawayo: Zimbabwe thrashed Kenya by nine wickets in the final one-day International of a three-match series at the Queens Sports Club to take the series 2-0 on Sunday.																								Zimbabwe cruised to the thumping win thanks to a 130-run stand between Mark Vermuelen (62 not out) and Andy Blignaut (63 not out) .																								Earlier, Kenya avoided an embarrassing rout thanks only to captain Steve Tikolo and Maurice Odumbe. The tourists could only manage 133 in 28.5 overs in their build up to the World Cup.																								Kenya began badly, losing Ravindu Shah caught behind for a duck. When Brijal Patel was dismissed for eight and Kennedy Otieno for 11, the tourists were 23 for three and reeling from the Blignaut and Douglas Hondo opening spells.																								Zimbabwe took an early grip on the match thanks to much improved bowling from Blignaut, back in following an ankle injury, and Hondo on an excellent batting pitch.																								But fast bowler Henry Olonga was the main destroyer as Kenya failed to handle accurate bowling. He finished with six for 28.																								This was not his career best as he took Six england wickets for 19 three years ago.																								Kenyas meagre total on a good wicket after winning the toss would have been much lower had it not been for Tikolos 34 and Odumbes 48. The partnership added 82 off 85 balls, bringing up the hundred in the 20th over. (AFP)

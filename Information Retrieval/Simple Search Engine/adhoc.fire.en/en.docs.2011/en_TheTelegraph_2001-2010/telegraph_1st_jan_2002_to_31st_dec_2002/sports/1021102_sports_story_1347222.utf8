		 Saturday, November 02, 2002 				 The Wright way to fitness
 BY OUR STAFF REPORTERS				 	 Harbhajan takes a breather at the Eden Friday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Calcutta: His spends his time planning strategies and working with the players at nets. Even in his hotel room, he is at work with the teams computer analyst, sorting out technical shortcomings that sometimes trouble the players.																								John Wright gets very little time to keep for himself. However, when that is available, he just cannot ignore his own fitness. At the Eden Friday, the early close of play meant some extra time for the coach. He took time off to set off for a few rounds of running at the ground. So involved was he with his fitness routine that he decided to return to the hotel after the team.																								Police story																								Though they can make life miserable for spectators and scribes during international matches at Eden Gardens, the cops sometimes show that they can also care for the public. While the fear of using edibles as missiles prevents spectators from entering the stadium with fruits such as apples unless they are sliced, the cops have ensured that the fruits are not wasted. 																								A gentleman, whom the cops stopped at the gate for bringing along an apple, was pleasantly surprised to find that they also offered him a knife so that he could enjoy his stuff without flouting the law.																								Police story II																								Water bottles of every kind are banned at the Eden Gardens during international matches. Those carrying any kind of bag are thoroughly checked at every entry-point, but some sneak in with the banned substance. One plastic bottle was seen doing the rounds at the Club House upper tier and when pointed out, the cop on duty came up with a you-caught-me kind of expression. The odd mishtake, came the hesitant reply.

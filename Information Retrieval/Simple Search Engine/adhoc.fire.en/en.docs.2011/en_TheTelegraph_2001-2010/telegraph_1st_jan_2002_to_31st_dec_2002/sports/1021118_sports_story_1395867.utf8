The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, November 18, 2002  Special Happening, Capistrano impress 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Almost all horses went full steam when 19 of the 20 catalogued lots tested their hooves at the RCTC raceground on Sunday morning. As usual, horses were breezed (spurted) before the auction sales billed for Tuesday evening. A two-year-old chestnut gelding by Be Fresh out of Romantic Bliss was spared from spurting in view of her training setback that was learnt to be a minor one. It is going to be a Breeze Up sale with a difference, said Vineet Verma, ceo and secretary RCTC. In a way he is right if gauged by the mood in the racingcircles. Again, judged by the quality of horseflesh and their present looks, at least 12 of them appear to be a ready-made winners. From among those who impressed most were the three top class horses who are favourably handicapped too. The lower class lots are also expected to attract brisk bidding. The likes of Crimson Rages, Flying Stars, Capistrano, Millenium Stars, Deep Finesse and Last Resorts were fluent in their movements, while two of the three babies  Be Fresh and Young Senor progenies  who matched strides up in the straight promised early win. The following observations were made and time recorded when horses were breezed:				 										Winter race track  800m-first batch: Special Happening (C. Alford), Crowning Moment (Shanker) , Way To the Stars (Rutherford) and Say It Loud (A. P. Singh) in 49s; (400m) 26s. They finished in the order named. Each of the first three were separated by half-a-length. The last named finished far behind. Second batch: Crimson Rage (Islam), Idolize (Surender), Sweet Revenge (Maseyk) and Kings Crest (Domingo) in 52s; (400m) 25s. First three finished in close order but Crimson Rage impressed. The last named was 3 ls behind. 				 										Third batch: The Flying Star (C. Alford), Capistrano (Rutherford) Majestic Crown (Shanker) and Millenium Star (A. P. Singh) in 50s; (400m) 26s. The first named just about finished ahead by a length while the rest followed closely. However, the horse who impress most was Capistrano.				 										Fourth race: A chestnut two-year-old filly by Be Fresh/Current Affair (Islam), a bay two-year-old filly by Young Senor/Aberlady (Domingo) and a bay filly by Concordial/Maid Of Vision (Surender) in 57s; (400m) 28s. The first two named were handy and they finished together while the last named was outpaced.				 										Fifth batch: Last Resort (C. Alford), Shes A Star (Shanker), Deep Finesse (Rutherford) and Rigged For Revenge (A. P. Singh) in 49s; (400m) 25s. The first named finished ahead by 2 lengths while second and the third placed horses were easy. They were separated by a length and a half. The last named was further 3 ls behind.

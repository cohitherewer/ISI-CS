		 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 Ashes my biggest challenge: Fletcher 
																								London: England coach Duncan Fletcher insisted on Wednesday that his injury-hit side would all be available for selection come next months first Ashes Test against Australia.																								Fletchers men flew out to Perth on Thursday with injury concerns over pace bowlers Darren Gough (knee) and Simon Jones (side strain) as well as batsmen Michael Vaughan and Mark Butcher (both knee).																								Earlier on Wednesday, allrounder Andrew Flintoff, who had had a double hernia operation, said he was unable to run three weeks before the first Test that begins at the Gabba on November 7. But Fletcher, 54, told reporters at the teams Heathrow hotel: Everyones in line to be available for the first Test, including Darren. Everythings going to plan. The only person who is slightly behind is Andy Flintoff, but we can get him ahead of schedule in the next 10 days, two weeks in Australia. 																								However Fletcher, who announced he had signed a one-year extension to his England deal to take him through to 2004, was under no illusions about the size of the task he was facing. 																								This has to be my biggest challenge, but that is what we are all here for, he said.																								Australia have just hammered Pakistan by an innings in the second Test in Sharjah, twice dismissing their opponents for record low scores inside two days. It is a strong team, Fletcher readily conceded. But the only way to approach any Test series is with a positive attitude and the belief that you can win every Test.																								Youve got to be on top of all three areas, batting, bowling and fielding. If you can do that and play above yourself, youve got a chance of winning. 																								And he added that most of Englands walking wounded were all healing quickly. Darrens been bowling off a short run-up and weve got to build it up from here. 																								Simon Jones has been bowling at the nets in Cardiff. Hes had no problems with the injury hes been bowling at 85-90 per cent so hes building up nicely.																								And turning to his batsmen, Fletcher added: Butcher and Vaughan are ahead of schedule and will play from the start.																								As well as the Ashes, England will have to contend with an ODI tri-series, also featuring Sri Lanka, that interrupts the Test campaign before jetting off to South Africa for the World Cup that begins in February.																								Fletcher admitted that for players involved in all three campaigns, combating tiredness would be a problem. Were going to have to try to ensure players dont get mentally fatigued. Its something, along with their physical condition, were going to have to manage as we go along. 																								Fletcher, since becoming England coach in 1999, has forged a productive partnership with captain Nasser Hussain which has seen the side become a match for most opponents in world cricket, although Australia comfortably won last years Ashes series in England 4-1.

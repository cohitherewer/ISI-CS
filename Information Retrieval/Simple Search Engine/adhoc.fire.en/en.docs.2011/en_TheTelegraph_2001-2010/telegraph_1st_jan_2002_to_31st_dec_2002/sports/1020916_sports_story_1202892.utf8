The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Inzamam, Akram, Anwar out 
																								Karachi: Pakistan cricket was plunged into crisis on Sunday as top players Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar and Inzamam-ul-Haq opted out of next months series against Australia.																								While Inzamam is out due to a heel injury, Akram and Anwar have opted out to take some much needed rest from a team that has been plagued by a recent run of poor performances.																								Its disappointing that some senior players have opted out of the series but its their decision and we have to honour it, chief selector Wasim Bari said.																								Bari, while refusing to comment on the situation, tried to downplay the crisis saying the absence of the senior players will give the PCB a chance to start the rebuilding process earlier than planned.																								Wasim has been playing regular cricket but Anwars decision looks strange but now the selection committee will sit down and consider the available options, Bari said. Coach Mudassar Nazar is arriving home on Monday and we will get his word before taking decisions.																								Former captain and coach Intikhab Alam termed the developments as shocking and disappointing. Its shocking and disappointing and what I smell is there is something terribly wrong in the team which led to Wasim and Anwars pull out. (AFP)

				 																																	Johannesburg: African footballers, who supported Sepp Blatters successful bid for re-election to the Fifa presidency, have been dropped from the Confederation of African Footballs structures.				 																																	Roger Milla, Abedi Pele and the Ivorian-born French international Basile Boli have been removed from CAFs football committee, while Irvin Khoza, the controversial head of South Africas World Cup bid, has been taken off the powerful club competitions committee.				 																																	It had been expected that many of CAF president Issa Hayatous vocal opponents in the run-up to his challenge for the Fifa presidency election in May would lose their positions in the various committees that helped run African football affairs. Ghanas Abedi and Boli were high profile backers of Blatter and lobbied among African members ahead of the election in Seoul, which Blatter comfortably won. 				 																																	Milla had also backed the bid by the Swiss over that of his Cameroonian compatriot, although later attempted to tone down his support of Blatter.				 																																	Bucharest: Romania striker Viorel Moldovan says he has retired from international football after deciding to concentrate on his club career with French side Nantes.				 																																	I want to focus exclusively on Nantes, Moldovan said on Tuesday. Sometimes I find it difficult to rush from a match to catch a plane and meet a strict deadline to play elsewhere. I dont feel old, I just want to do a good job at Nantes. I think my decision is right.				 																																	Moldovan said he had already notified Romania coach Anghel Iordanescu about his decision. The 30-year-old scored 23 goals in 64 matches for Romania. 				 																																	Paris: Arsenals Robert Pires aims to return to action for the English double winners by late October, the injured French midfielder said on Tuesday.				 																																	I would love to resume playing for the Champions League match against A.J. Auxerre (at Highbury) on October 22, Pires told sports daily LEquipe.				 																																	Pires suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in March and missed the World Cup finals in Japan and South Korea. He had surgery in May and has been recuperating at a sports injury clinic in Saint Raphael, in the south of France. Im working hard and Im improving every day, he added. Now I can drive the ball, I can run and I can dribble. Im looking forward to this match at Highbury.

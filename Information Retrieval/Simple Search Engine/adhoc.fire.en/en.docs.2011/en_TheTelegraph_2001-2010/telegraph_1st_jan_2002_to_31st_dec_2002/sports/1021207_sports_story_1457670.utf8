		 Saturday, December 07, 2002 				 Amritraj Jr cleared to play for India
																								New Delhi: The US-based Prakash Amritraj, son of Indian legend Vijay, is now eligible to play for India in Davis Cup competitions.																								The Davis Cup committee of the International Tennis Federation has communicated to us its decision to allow Prakash play for India yesterday, Anil Khanna, secretary general of the All India Tennis Association, said Friday.																								The ITF rules governing Davis Cup say that a player has to hold a passport of the country he wishes to represent but the fact that Prakash was of Indian origin was enough for the world body to relax the conditions for Prakash, Khanna added.																								He said the United States Tennis Association president had also written to the AITA, expressing his no-objection to Prakash playing for India.																								Prakash, however, will have to wait till April next year to make himself available for India, as the ITF rules stipulate a six-month duration from the date of permission being sought by the player, Khanna said.

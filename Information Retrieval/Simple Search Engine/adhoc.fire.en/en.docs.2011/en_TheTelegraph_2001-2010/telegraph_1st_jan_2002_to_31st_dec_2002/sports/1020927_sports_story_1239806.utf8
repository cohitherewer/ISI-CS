		 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Real, Arsenal in runaway wins 
				 	 Arsenals Dennis Bergkamp jumps over PSVs Wilfred Bouma during their Champions League match in Eindhoven Wednesday (AP)																								London: Fast-starting Arsenal ended their away jinx in the Champions League in spectacular style Wednesday, while holders Real Madrid hit six goals and fellow Spanish side Valencia also made it two wins out of two.																								Brazilian Gilberto Silva scored the quickest goal in Champions League history, timed at 20.07 seconds, as Arsenal crushed PSV Eindhoven 4-0 in The Netherlands.																								Real demolished Belgian side Genk 6-0 at the Bernabeu while Spanish champions Valencia were comfortable 3-0 winners at Spartak Moscow.																								In other results Inter Milan sneaked a 1-0 victory over Ajax Amsterdam, Liverpool were held 1-1 at home by Swiss outsiders Basel and French side Olympique Lyon romped to a 5-0 victory over Rosenborg Trondheim in Norway.																								Lyon were the side Arsenal beat in their last away Champions League victory, back in February 2001.																								But Arsene Wengers side comprehensively ended their eight-game barren run at PSV to take a firm grip on group A, in which they are the only side with maximum points.																								Almost straight from the whistle PSV lost the ball and Thierry Henry ran forward before crossing to Silva who sidefooted home.																								The goal was timed by ruling body Uefas website at 20.07 seconds, five-hundredths of a second faster than Alessandro Del Pieros effort for Juventus against Manchester United in October 1997.																								Fit-again Freddie Ljungberg and Henry, twice, scored in the second half to wrap up a stunning victory.																								Borussia Dortmund, beaten 0-2 at Arsenal last week, bounced back with an important 2-1 home victory over AJ Auxerre  Jan Koller and Marcio Amoroso scoring the vital goals. They have three points while Auxerre and PSV are on one.																								Real invincible																								Despite the absence of a still unfit Ronaldo, holders Real continue to look invincible in group C, and they hit Genk with two goals right on the stroke of half-time at the Bernabeu.																								Genk defender Didier Zokora deflected in a Guti drive for Reals first after 44 minutes and before the half-time whistle Michel Salgado had made it 2-0.																								Portugal forward Luis Figo, with a penalty, Guti, Albert Celades and Raul completed another rout for the nine-time European champions, who won 3-0 at AS Roma last week.																								Roma dropped more points when they could muster only a 0-0 draw at AEK Athens in Greece.																								Spanish champions Valencia, impressive 2-0 winners over Liverpool last week, dominate group B after a comfortable victory in Russia.																								Miguel Angel Angulo put them in control after only five minutes and second-half strikes by Mista and Juan Sanchez  after a terrible error by Spartak goalkeeper Stanislav Cherchesov  completed the 3-0 win.																								Spartak have now lost both their opening games and have not won a Champions League match in 13 attempts.																								Valencia top the group on six points with Basel a surprise second on four after their draw at Anfield.																								Owen misfires																								With Michael Owen still firing blanks, Milan Baros gave Liverpool a 24th-minute lead but, against the run of play, Basel levelled before half-time through Julio Hernan Rossi and held out for an important point.																								Twice former winners Inter leapfrogged four-time champions Ajax at the top of group D, thanks to Argentine Hernan Crespos 74th-minute winner at the San Siro.																								Inter have four points but Lyon are also in contention after a comprehensive 5-0 win over Rosenborg in France.

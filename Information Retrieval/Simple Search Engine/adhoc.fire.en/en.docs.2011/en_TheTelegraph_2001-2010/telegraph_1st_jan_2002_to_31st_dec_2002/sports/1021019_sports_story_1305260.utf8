																								Colombo: Sri Lanka added seamer Ruchira Perera, who was reported for a suspect action earlier this year, to their squad to tour South Africa, the BCCSL said Friday.																								The left-armer became the 17th man in the party for two Tests next month in Johannesburg and Centurion.																								The 25-year-olds action was reported following the drawn first Test against England in May and he was not selected for the remainder of the series. 																								Perera, who has taken 17 wickets in seven Tests, joins a group of untried pace bowlers providing support for the experienced Chaminda Vaas and off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan. They include Thilina Thushara and Tharanga Lakshitha, who have been selected for the first time for the two-Test series.																								The left-armed Thushara, rated the quickest bowler in Sri Lanka, and Lakshitha are both 20. Also in are fast bowlers Sujeewa de Silva and Chamila Gamage.

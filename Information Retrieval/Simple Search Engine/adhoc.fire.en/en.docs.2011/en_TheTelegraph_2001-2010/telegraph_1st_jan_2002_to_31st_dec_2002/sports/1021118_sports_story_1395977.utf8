The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, November 18, 2002 				 Specific steps on ICC agenda, says Procter 
																								Vadodara: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is considering laying down very specific guidelines for matches affected due to crowd violence, Match Referee Mike Procter said here Sunday.																								Procter said there were no rules governing such incidents and the Match Referee had to use his discretion to decide on the future course of the match.																								At their next meeting, ICC will try and formulate clear-cut guidelines for matches hit by crowd disturbances, he said ahead of the fifth ODI between India and the West Indies on Monday. 																								The first three matches of the on-going series were marred by crowd trouble, the third in Rajkot having to be abandoned after 27.1 overs in the second session. The match was awarded to India on a better run-rate. 																								Procter said: I took the decision on my own and not from the rulebook, he said, adding that the safety of the players was the most important consideration for him then.  (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, December 23, 2002 				 EB to go all out for win
				 	 okoro: Key man																								Chennai: East Bengal had a brilliant start to their National Football League campaign this season, but a couple of draws in the last two games have left them only one point clear of Dempo at the top. So, Mondays match against Indian Bank will be an acid test for the Calcutta giants.																								We had aimed for four points from the two games. We were somewhat successful in getting one from the first game against Vasco. But a victory here is absolutely vital for our chances, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said on the match-eve. 																								Indian Bank are having a horrendous run (they lost three consecutive matches against Vasco, JCT and Salgaocar). 																								East Bengal frontline consists of the likes of Gilmar Goncalves and Mike Okoro, and they are sure to give the bank defenders a real run for their money. Their defence havent been doing well and I would like Okoro and Gilmar to fire, Bhowmick said. 																								However, one worry for the East Bengal team is the injury to defender Dipak Mondal. With Ghanaian Suley Musah also out of action and M. Suresh nursing an injury, it will be tough for Bhowmick to find his replacement.																								Salgaocar hold edge																								Salgaocar Sports Club, Goa, will have the clear edge when they play Mahindra United in another NFL match at Mumbai. With the Salgaocar forward line consisting of Dennis Cabral, Dudu Omagbemi and Alex Ambrose combining very well in the last few matches, the defensive frailties of the Mahindra team can come under serious scanner.

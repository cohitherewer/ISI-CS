 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Vijay Kumar hit a superb six under 66 to take the lead in the opening round of the Rs 10-lakh WWICS Forest Hill Golf Open in Chandigarh on Wednesday. 																								Mhows Mukesh Kumar was second two-strokes behind the leader at four-under 68, while Delhis Vinod Kumar shot a two-under 70 for the third place. The duo of Meeruts Digvijay Singh and Calcuttas Rahil Gangjee were tied for fourth position at one-under 71, according to information received here. 																								Incidentally, Delhis Pappan hit a hole-in-one. His moment of glory came on the par-3 11th where his 7-iron tee shot saw the ball bounce twice on the green before settling comfortably into the cup. 																								Vijay, who is the latest Hero Honda Golf Tour Pro to qualify for the Asian PGA tour, started the day with a birdie. However, bad news followed in the form of back to back bogeys on the second and the third with the stocky golfer three-putting on the holes. 																								Vijay more than made up for his twin errors with a hat-trick of birdies on the sixth, seventh and eighth on his front nine followed by four more birdies on the 10th, 14th 16th and 18th.

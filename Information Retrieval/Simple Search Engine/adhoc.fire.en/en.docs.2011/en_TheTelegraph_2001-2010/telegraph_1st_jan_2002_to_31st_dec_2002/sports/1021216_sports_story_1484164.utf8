																								Melbourne: Shane Warne is in doubt for next February-Marchs World Cup after dislocating his bowling shoulder Sunday. Warne dived to stop a single off his own bowling and landed with his full weight on his right elbow during the tri-series match against England here.																								Though the champion leg spinner has been ruled out for four to six weeks as of now, medical opinion was that given the extent of the shoulder injury, Warne could be facing between eight to 12 weeks in rehabilition. This will put him out of the World Cup in South Africa. Warne was carried from the field on a stretcher, clutching his right shoulder in pain in front of a home crowd of 34,887.																								Physio Errol Alcott said Warnes injured right shoulder had been put back into place in the dressing room and he would see a specialist.																								It was put back in by the ACB medical (staff) and it went in pretty well so were happy about that, Alcott said.																								Now we need to just wait and see if there is any further damage. First of all we need to establish if there is any bony injury so we need to get some plain X-rays done on it and then hell be seen by a shoulder specialist whos actually done his surgery before.																								Our main concern is his prior history. Hes had surgery on that shoulder before so we need to have a look and see if there is perhaps further damage done to that already damaged joint.																								Were looking at four to six weeks (out) to start with. He might be (out for) more than six (weeks) but it depends if there is anything else injured. If there is something more, then wed probably have to add on the weeks.																								Ponting told reporters: Its pretty safe to say he will be out for quite a while yet. It was a sad thing to happen in a great game and we dont know the full extent of it yet.																								We probably wont know until late tonight or early Monday morning how bad it is.																								Warne needed a reconstruction on the right shoulder in 1998, ruling him out of the first four Tests of the 1998-99 home Ashes series against England. He also missed much of the 2000-01 summer when he broke his spinning finger in a fielding accident.																								The 33-year-old is Test crickets second-highest wicket-taker with 491 wickets.																								He rejuvenated his international career this year with a strict fitness regime that resulted in a much trimmer, more muscular frame.																								n Tri-series report on Page 18 (AGENCIES)

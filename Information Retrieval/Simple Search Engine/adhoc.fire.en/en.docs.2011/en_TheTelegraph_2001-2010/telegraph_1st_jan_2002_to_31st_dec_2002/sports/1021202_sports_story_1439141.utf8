(AP/PTI)																								Perth: Netherlands ensured top position in pool B of the womens World Cup Sunday beating Australia 3-1.																								Australia played better than us; they attacked more but we were smarter with our possessions, Dutch coach Marc Lammers said. 																								The quality of our circle penetrations was better and every time we were in the attacking circle we had good chances to score. We closed down the centre of the pitch and Australias forward passes to Katrina Powell.																								Australias defence played tentatively in the first five minutes, which allowed the Dutch centre forward Mijntje Donners to take possession inside the circle and push a goal between the pads of goalkeeper Rachel Imison.																								Australia dominated possession in the Dutch half through the rest of the first quarter, with two passes across goal going untapped.																								Katrina Powell and Sarah Taylor of Australia had shots on goal but the rival keeper was up to the task. Femke Kooijman shocked the Aussies with the second goal eleven minutes from time in the first session.																								In an earlier pool A match Germany beat New Zealand 3-1 to secure fourth place in pool A. (AFP)

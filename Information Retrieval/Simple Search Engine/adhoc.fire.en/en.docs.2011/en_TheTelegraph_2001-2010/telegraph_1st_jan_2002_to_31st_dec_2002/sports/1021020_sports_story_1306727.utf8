The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, October 20, 2002 				 Bengal eye big win
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Dipendu: Confident 																								Calcutta, Oct. 19: Bengal assistant coach Sishir Ghosh, in absence of chief coach Subrata Bhattacharya, said his team will attack Rajasthan in their Santosh Trophy-opener in Imphal Sunday.																								Speaking on Saturday, Sishir said Rajasthan were unknown opponents even as tight security arrangements and a chilly weather forced the players indoors at the hotel. We have not seen Rajasthan but we hope to win big, Sishir said.																								Apart from going for practice, the boys cant leave the hotel following security guidelines, Sishir said. He added the team couldnt practise at the main ground. It would have been better if we got a feel of that ground. But practice facilities are good.																								However, the team is under a bit of a pressure as Jammu and Kashmir (the third team in the group) had scored four against Rajasthan. 																								If such pressure has anything to do with Sishirs worry, striker Dipendu Biswas has simply puffed it away. There is no wavering about it. Well have to score five, period, he said. 																								Sishir feels his team is a good blend of senior and junior players and the absence of some of the key players (who are away with either club or national duties) wont weigh too much on it.																								All of them know the importance of performing for Bengal. I dont think I have to remind them of that at this stage, the coach added.																								Bahadurs hattrick																								Services trounced Uttar Pradesh 5-0 with a hattrick by Pritam Bahadur, adds Our Correspondent from Imphal. In other matches, Gujarat beat Haryana 1-0 and Karnataka thrashed Tripura 4-0. Delhi and Orissa were locked in a 0-0 draw.																								Arunachal Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar were scratched for failing to turn up versus Sikkim and Nagaland, respectively.

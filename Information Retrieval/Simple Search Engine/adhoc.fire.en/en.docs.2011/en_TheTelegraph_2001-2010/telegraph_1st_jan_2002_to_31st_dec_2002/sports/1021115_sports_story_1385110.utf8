The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 15, 2002 				 Lazio put up for sale
																								Milan: Serie A club Lazio was put up for sale by struggling Italian company Cirio on Wednesday as part of an emergency restructuring after the canned foods maker was declared in debt default, the company said.																								The Rome-based company was officially declared in default on the bond last week. The Milan bourse said it would make a statement on Cirio on Thursday without giving more details.																								Cirios highest profile investment is its 51 per cent stake in Rome-based Lazio, which earlier this year shed star defender Alessandro Nesta and striker Hernan Crespo as it sought to revamp its own shaky finances for 48 million euros.																								Despite the teams fame, it was unclear how much financial interest it would attract given its own problems and a wider crisis plaguing other Italian soccer teams, weighed down by slumping pay-TV revenues and expensive player contracts.																								Cirios chairman Sergio Cragnotti, whose management of Lazio has been criticised by some of the teams former players, was also denounced by one of Italys top unions on Wednesday.																								The logic with which the financier Cragnotti has used Cirio to underwrite his financial and ex-industrial adventures is bringing the company to the abyss, said union leader Vincenzo Lacorte.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, October 12, 2002 				 Anand shocked; big win for Surya
				 	 Surya: Beats Morozevich																								Hyderabad, Oct. 11 (PTI): In a major upset, defending champion Viswanathan Anand of India was shocked by compatriot Grandmaster Krisnan Sasikiran in a second round match of the second World Cup chess tournament here today.																								Deviating from the regular openings, the Chennai-lad surprised Anand by adopting the Reti opening variation and caught the Super GM, with an Elo rating of over 2700, on the wrong foot to force a tactical supremacy and positional advantage and Anand resigned after 53 moves.																								Another Indian in the fray, Surya Sekhar Ganguly defeated second seeded Alexander Morozevich of Russia in a Ruy Lopez opening. 																								Though the Russian tried to rip open Suryas defence, he could not succeed and surrendered after getting himself into a hopeless situation.																								In other matches of the day Koneru Humpy scored an emphatic win over D. Stepovia of Russia while Indians Bhagyashree Thipsay, Swati Ghate and Sai Vijayalaxmi lost.																								After his maiden victory over Anand, and perhaps the greatest victory of his career, Sasikiran said he benefited from the errors made by the world champion. 																								Anand was very unclear in his pawn sacrifices and he missed some very simple moves, the 21-year old said.																								Anand, with half a point from two games, would still be in the reckoning if he wins at least two of his next three matches.																								Playing a rare Petroff defence, Humpy emerged victorious against Stepovia who tried to attack her kingside constantly. 																								However, mid-game manoeuvres swung the advantage in favour of the Indian.																								Pendalya Harikrishnas prospects of moving to the next round suffered a serious setback when he lost to Alexander Beliavsky of Russia. 																								Now, the GM from Andhra Pradesh would have to win his next three matches to keep his hopes alive.																								Fifteen-year old Teimour Radjabov (Azerbaijan) prevailed over Wato Kobese of South Africa in a group B game involving Slav defence to take his points tally to 1.5. 																								Brazilian Giovanni Vescovi drew with Vassily Ivanchuk of the Ukraine after 50 moves in a rarely placed Scottish opening.																								In group B Jing Chuan Ye of china settled for a quick draw after 11 moves against Macieja Bartilomeij of Poland while world champion Chinese Chen Zhu, who lost her opening match against S. Meenakshi of India, called truce after 16 moves against compatriot Pin Wang.																								Meenakshi also drew against Arathie Ramaswami to take her points tally to 1.5.

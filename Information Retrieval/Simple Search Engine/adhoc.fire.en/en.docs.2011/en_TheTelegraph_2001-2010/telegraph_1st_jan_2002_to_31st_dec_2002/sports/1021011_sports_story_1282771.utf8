The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, October 11, 2002 				 Dravids 4th in-a-row corners Windies
 							 - first test l Sourav admits to gaining distinct strength despite getting another poor verdict FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Rahul Dravid cuts loose during his knock of 100 at Wankhede Stadium Thursday. Picture by Vikas Khot																								Mumbai, Oct. 10: Having gone through 16 innings and 13 months without a Test fifty, not many moons ago, Rahul Dravid appreciates the worth of big scores and cashing-in when the going is good. As an approach, its simple and sensible.																								The year 2002, of course, continues to be excellent: At the Wankhede Thursday, Day-II of the first of three Tests for the Exide Cup, the India vice-captain became the fourth batsman to register four hundreds in successive innings. So elite is this club that even Sir Don Bradman didnt qualify. 																								Indeed, Dravid now has the chance of equalling Sir Everton Weekes record of five hundreds in as many innings. At the moment, the vice-captain is level with Jack Fingleton and Alan Melville. Dravids phenomenal sequence began with 115 in the second innings at Trent Bridge and his scores since have been: 148 (Headingley), 217 (The Oval) and 100 retired (Wankhede).																								With Dravid producing the consistency which is the countrys pride  coinciding with superb individual and team efforts in Busan  and the envy of just about everyone else, India have moved into a truly muscular position. Having lost both openers in the 14 overs before close, the West Indies will have to dig deep to save this match.																								Dravids 350-minute innings (in tormenting conditions), though, took its toll and he couldnt return after being helped off following severe dehydration and muscle-cramps. The score then was 407 for five and, with The Wall breached, the West Indies knifed through the tail without much resistance.																								Quite like what happened in Calcutta, during his epic against Australia last year, Dravid was injected fluids at the stadium itself and, on returning to the team hotel, headed for physio Andrew Leipus room.																								Frankly, I cant pick the reason for having a great year... Its got to be a combination of factors... Im a lot more relaxed about my batting and, equally, Im more confident. Also, Im fitter  the cramps here notwithstanding, Dravid told The Telegraph from the physios room.																								As Leipus was working on the vice-captain, the conversation had to be brief. Dravid, however, did add: Eventually, I judge my performances in the light of the teams showing... Hopefully, we can win this Test. That will be the biggest satisfaction.																								The vice-captain, by the way, has reached close to 1,200 runs for the year and, besides the four consecutive hundreds, had one in Georgetown early on. Its a measure of the respect he enjoys, universally, that almost the entire West Indies team rushed to his side as he collapsed. 																								While Dravid monopolised centrestage in a big way, the talking point was also Sachin Tendulkars quick dismissal (in the third over) and the poor Asoka de Silva decision which limited captain Sourav Gangulys stay to 27 minutes.																								A lack of footwork proved fatal for Sachin. As for the captain, he was adjudged leg-before (to Cameron Cuffy) when TV replays confirmed the ball pitched outside leg. The ICCs Code of Conduct prevented Sourav from saying anything, but its an understatement that he is terribly upset.																								That Sourav keeps getting atrocious decisions  be it in Sri Lanka or England or even at home  only made the latest one that much harder to accept.																								Sourav didnt reveal his purely personal thoughts, but he did look ahead to the remaining days. Well, the turn isnt appreciable, but the bounce is certainly there... We are in a position of distinct strength. Now, we should consolidate, he remarked, speaking exclusively. 																								Resuming on 278 for two, India lost Sachin  who didnt add to his overnight 35  and Sourav to the second new cherry, which was taken straightaway. Yet, if Carl Hooper thought his prayers were answered, Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman forged a fine 105-run partnership for the fifth-wicket. It ended with Laxman, who hasnt got a fifty since the second innings at Lords, being stumped down the leg-side.																								There were times  for instance, when there was no boundary for 94 deliveries  when it appeared the pair was losing initiative but, at least, Dravid and Laxman were together till the stroke of tea. 																								Dravid himself had to retire, immediately after completing his 14th hundred, and the visitors made the most of that lucky break. The vice-captains 100 came off 242 balls and included a dozen boundaries.																								Towards the end, Parthiv Patel showed pluck and Jawagal Srinath chanced his arm to ensure India got past the psychologically-critical 450-mark. The innings ended 87 minutes after tea. 																								Mervyn Dillion, who was both spot-on and aggressive at the start, finished with the best figures (three for 54), while Mahendra Nagamootoo also became richer by three wickets. That he tended to bowl a negative line during his marathon 20-over spell after lunch, though, surely dilutes his performance. 																								To be competitive, the West Indies needed to keep wickets intact till the close. That didnt happen, with Zaheer Khan catching Chris Gayle leg-before and Harbhajan Singh capitalising on Wavell Hinds ultra-cautious approach.																								Fridays opening session should determine whether this Test will go the distance.

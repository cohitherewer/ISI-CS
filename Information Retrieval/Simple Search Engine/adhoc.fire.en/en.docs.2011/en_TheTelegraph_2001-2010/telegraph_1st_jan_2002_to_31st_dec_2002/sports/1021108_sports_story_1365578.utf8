The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 08, 2002  Royal City may be hard to toss 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Royal City may be hard to toss in the 1,400m Gavin Johnston Cup on Friday. Although, the Daniel David-trainee failed to win a Class II race during the monsoon season, the experience gained on that occasion must help the Inner City-Ruby Lights three-year-old come to terms in the handicap races. Royal City had failure to create a favourable impression on the classic front. The three-year-old is likely to face some challenge from Vijay Singhs ward Calamint who is on the up but with age on his side Royal City may gallop to victory in the hands of Amyn Merchant.Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, October 07, 2002 				 Hayden taunts fired up Shoaib
				 	 Shoaib: Back to his best																								Islamabad: After a sensational five-wicket burst in 15 balls which saw Australia bundled out for 127 in their second innings, Pakistani pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar said the insulting remarks made by Aussie opener Mathew Hayden provoked him to produce his best.																								 Shoaibs devastating spell Saturday helped Pakistan get back into the match strongly after conceding a 188-run first innings lead to Australia and now they require 315 to win the first of the three-Test series.																								When Australia batted a second time, Hayden made remarks about my bowling and the team and I promised him today I will see how good and great this Australian batting line-up is, Shoaib said after the end of the days play Saturday.																								He said Hayden reminded him of his none-so-impressive past performance against the Australians and I told him I was not fit then but today I would see how good you Australians are.																								I dont like anyone making personal comments or saying anything about the team. I vowed to show them that I am back and I can bowl fast, said Shoaib, who twice missed out on hattricks in the match.																								Shaoib kept on reminding the Australians of his awesome bowling prowess when after each of his scalps he kept on pointing towards the Australian dressing room. 																								It was a gesture to remind them of my promise, Shoaib said. However, he added that It was all done in competitive spirit. 																								I am very happy with my performance today. I knew I had not bowled well in Nairobi and Colombo because my rhythm was missing.																								I always want to see that my performances have set up a win. Or it counts for nothing. I love doing well for myself, the team and the country.  (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, December 31, 2002 				 No change in NZ squad
																								Christchurch: New Zealand on Monday announced an unchanged 12-member squad for the third one-day International against India here on Wednesday. 																								The selection panel decided against recalling all-rounders Andre Adams, Scott Styris and Chris Harris, to give them more time for playing State Shield domestic cricket. The New Zealand team arrived here on Monday on a high after their 35-run win in Napier gave them a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series. 																								The selectors also decided to give captain Stephen Fleming and Craig McMillan an extra opportunity to hit form for their Wellington and Canterbury provinces respectively. Pace bowler Daryl Tuffey was New Zealands only injury concern with a swollen knee, suffered while running out Virender Sehwag on Sunday. 																								The in-form Tuffey, now a World Cup certainty, was a prime candidate to be rested for the third match on the bowler rotation. 																								New Zealand: Stephen Fleming (captain), Nathan Astle, Mathew Sinclair, Craig McMillan, Lou Vincent, Brendon McCullum, Jacob Oram, Kyle Mills, Daniel Vettori, Daryl Tuffey, Shane Bond, Paul Hitchcock.																								Cairns back at nets 																								Allrounder Chris Cairns was a surprise visitor at the New Zealand practice Monday and it is likely that he will make an international comeback late in the ongoing series against India. 																								Cairns confirmed he would make his comeback from knee surgery for Canterbury B in a two-day game against Auckland B on Thursday. He was reluctant to speculate on a comeback date for the national side but said he was likely to return for the sixth match against India in Auckland on January 11. 																								Cairns remained cautious about his progress but said he was raring to get back in the middle. Its great to be involved. Im really happy with how its going, Cairns said.His bowling fitness is still under scanner although he hopes he will be able to bowl. Ill just take it easy, have a bat and maybe bowl a few overs.

				 	 GOUGH: Absence extended																								Brisbane: England have called up Surrey seamer Alex Tudor as cover for leading strike bowler Darren Gough who has suffered another injury setback.																								Gough left for Adelaide on Monday to see a specialist at the Australian Cricket Academy for further treatment on his injured knee. There is no forecast on his immediate return to action.																								England coach Duncan Fletcher said that Tudor, who has been training with the England national academy squad in Adelaide at the Australian academy, would join the touring team.																								Fletcher said Gough, who had already been ruled out of the first Test starting in Brisbane on Thursday, needs intensive treatment.																								The Yorkshire paceman reported swelling and discomfort in his knee on Sunday after bowling in the nets with the England team on Saturday.																								Its very disappointing as I felt that I was nearly there with my recovery and ready to start playing again, Gough.																								The injury has kept him out of competitive cricket since mid-July.																								The team spokesman informed Durham fast bowler Steve Harmison was suffering from shin splints. 																								Gilchrist put on drip																								There is injury concern in the Australian camp as well. Wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist was receiving hospital treatment for an infected elbow, team officials said.																								Gilchrist, the vice-captain of the team, was hooked up to an intravenous antibiotic drip and would remain in hospital overnight, the team physiotherapist said.																								He informed the treatment was precautionary and Gilchrist was expected to be fit for the first Test.																								Gilchrist became aware of the problem on Saturday when he noticed an area of tenderness on his elbow. 																								The area became more uncomfortable Sunday, and after examination by the medical staff it was decided to admit him to hospital.																								Its frustrating not being able to train straight away and interrupt the build-up to the Test match but Im working on the basis this is a frustration and nothing more, Gilchrist said.																								Lillee sorry for Poms																								Meanwhile, former Australian speedster Dennis Lillee feels Englands decision to tour Australia with several unfit players has left captain Nasser Hussain with an impossible job of regaining the Ashes, adds a report from London																								I never thought Id feel sorry for a Pom, Lillee told The Daily Mirror. But I must admit I cant help but sympathise with England captain Nasser Hussain at the moment. 																								Fair dinkum, how could England hand Hussain a team it hopes will win back the Ashes with so many crocks on board.																								England arrived in Australia with injury worries over a number of players notably Gough and opening batsman Michael Vaughan (both knee), all-rounder Andrew Flintoff (hernia) as well as rookie quick Simon Jones (side strain).																								Lillee said the way in which Gough, who has not played Test cricket for 15 months, and Flintoffs problems had been dealt with reflected little credit on England.																								I think its absurd that Gough and Flintoff were allowed to leave England in that condition in the first place.																								Hughes wants Lee																								Former Australian paceman Merv Hughes believes Brett Lee should play in the first Ashes Test because he strikes fear into the England batsmen. Lees place is under scanner for the Gabba Test following a disappointing recent run and a strong challenge by Andrew Bichel.																								If you have a look at Brett Lee at the Gabba, when he comes in to bowl, the crowd just lifts and if you watch the English batsmen they just seem a little bit more nervous, Huges added.																								Hes there for the fear factor. When hes running in to bowl it is the same as (former Rugby League star) Mal Meninga running in off the 10-yard line  sheer fear factor. (AGENCIES)

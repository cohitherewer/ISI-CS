The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, October 31, 2002 				 Behind the stumps, I cant afford not to concentrate on every ball: Parthiv Patel
 							 - More than anything else, I have realised not one run comes easy BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Parthiv Patel in action on Day I of the final Test																								Parthiv Patel doesnt have to shave more regularly to make it evident he is maturing. In fact, his performances remain his best advertisement. Clearly, both behind and in front of the wickets, one never gets the impression he is just 17. The youngest wicketkeeper-ever, who idolises Adam Gilchrist, spoke to The Telegraph on the eve of the Eden Test.																								Following are excerpts																								On the lessons learnt in his short international career																								Bahut kuch seekha hai Behind the stumps, Ive learnt to concentrate on every ball Actually, that I cant afford not to Then, where my batting is concerned, Ive learnt its wiser to play off the front foot more often.																								On whether he is religiously following any one piece of advice 																								Bob Taylor, whom I met in Mumbai, suggested I keep watching the ball very closely. Ive been doing just that.																								On whether Taylor (174 victims in 57 Tests) had something else to say																								Kuch jyada nahin Its just that he asked me to keep working on the basics He didnt, for example, suggest I change my style.																								On his thoughts when both Ajay Ratra and he were named in the Board Presidents side, for the West Indies tour-opener (in Bangalore)																								Man mein ek hi baat thi  perform karna hai. As it turned out, I was picked in the XI At no time, though, did I think of anything else Didnt worry about, perhaps, not making the Test squad.																								On his thoughts on the eve of the Mumbai Test, his first at home																								I knew it would be a big test and, gradually, settled down well enough. The wicket had turn and much bounce It was, by and large, a nice learning process.																								On keeping to Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh																								The key is concentration and confidence Of course, its difficult when Anilbhai unleashes the faster one and when Bhajji bowls the one which turns the other way With experience, Ill get better. In any case, I keep psyching myself after each ball.																								On preparing to keep to the duo 																								Main nets mein unko kafi kareeb se dekhta hoon For instance, I closely watch Anilbhais googly and the top-spinner.																								On whether theres an understanding between him and the spinners																								(Smiles) Not really																								On his approach to what obcvbviously is a difficult job																								Perform karna hai, aur kya?																								On regularly interacting with former India keeper Kiran More, now a national selector																								We talk generally, every two-three days Interacting with somebody of his experience can only be beneficial.																								On the emphasis on his own batting																								Quite a bit. After all, whatever runs I get, down the order, will help the team Today, instead of 60-40, the effort I put in is 50-50.																								On his courageous unbeaten 19 (84 minutes), which helped India save the Trent Bridge Test																								More than anything else, I realised not one run comes easy (in international cricket) and that tight khelna parta hai Bowlers jyada chance nahin dete.																								On his most cherished dismissal																								The low catch off Zaheer Khan which ended Ridley Jacobs stay in Chennai (second innings) That Jacobs is himself a wicketkeeper gave more satisfaction.																								On whether having to keep before a mammoth Eden turnout has added to the butterflies in his stomach																								Nahin Ive told myself dekha jayega																								Finally, on the pressure he faces as a 17-year-old																								 (Smiles again) Kuch nahin I dont even think about it In fact, to the extent I can, I try and relax. Just the other day, before coming to Calcutta, I saw Dil Vil Pyar Vyar Picture theek thi.

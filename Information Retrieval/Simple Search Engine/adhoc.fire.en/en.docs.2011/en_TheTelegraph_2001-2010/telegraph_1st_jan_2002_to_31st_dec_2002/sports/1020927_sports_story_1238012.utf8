		 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Cuper harmed my career: Ronaldo
				 	 Ronaldo: Serious problems																								Rome: Twice World Footballer-of-the-Year Ronaldo has launched a fierce attack on Inter Milan coach Hector Cuper, accusing him of endangering his career.																								With Cuper, I risked my career, Ronaldo said in an interview in La Gazzetta dello Sport on Thursday. He didnt play me when I was fit, and he made me train or kept me on the pitch when I wasnt. At times he didnt even follow the advice of the doctors, he added.																								The Brazilian had previously refused to reveal the reasons behind his transfer from Inter to Real Madrid, but said he had changed his mind after personal attacks by Italian fans. No one was immediately available for comment at Inter.																								Ronaldo spent most of last season injured or on the bench and was substituted by Cuper in Inters final match of the season, when his side agonisingly let the Serie A title slip through their fingers, losing 2-4 to Lazio in Rome.																								He compared his stop-start season in Italy with his explosive  and injury-free  performances at the World Cup, where he scored eight goals.																								I injured muscles four or five times (at Inter), he said. They were serious problems, not little ones. His own relationship with Cuper was strained, he said. (REUTERS)

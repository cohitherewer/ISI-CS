		 Sunday, October 13, 2002 				 Paes should talk to me first: Bhupathi
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bhupathi																								Busan, Oct. 12: Mahesh Bhupathi is in no mood to open a dialogue with Leander Paes on a possible reunion.																								I initiated the split in March obviously because I had some problems. If those are to be sorted out, he has to come up and talk me. Whats the point in his going to the media? Bhupathi said, referring to Paes comment that he was ready to play with the Bangalorean.																								Paes left for Madrid Saturday morning while the rest of the tennis team turned up at the Gangseo Hockey Stadium to cheer Dhanraj Pillays boys in the final against South Korea.																								Bhupathi, Vishal Uppal, Mustafa Ghouse and Enrico Piperno had the Tricolour painted on their face. There was a sprinkling of a golden hue too. Unfortunately, the hockey team had to settle for silver.																								Bhupathi leaves for Madrid Sunday while the others go back to India.

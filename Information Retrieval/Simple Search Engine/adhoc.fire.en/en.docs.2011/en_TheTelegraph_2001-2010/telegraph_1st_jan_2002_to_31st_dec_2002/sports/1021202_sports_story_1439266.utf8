				 																																	Tehran: A woman has applied to head the Iranian Football Federation despite the countrys ban on women even entering football stadiums, a website reported Saturday.				 																																	Kadijeh Sepanji told www.womaniniran.com that she wanted to blaze a trail for women. Someone has got to open the way to other people so that women have the courage to show what they are capable of, Sepanji said.				 																																	Sepanji, who is described as having 30 years of experience at the federation, said she was under no illusions that the odds were stacked against her. The federations executive committee is made up of 43 members, of which two are women. To show that they dont even consider women, I am applying, but I am sure that none of the 41 male members of the committee will vote for me.				 																																	Coolum: Australias Jarrod Moseley and Peter Lonard jointly won the Australian PGA Championship on Sunday after carding four-round totals of 17-under-par 271 and squaring one playoff hole in fading light. The pair both made par on the first playoff hole, the par-four 18th, at Queenslands Coolum course before conferring with officials and shaking hands as joint winners.				 																																	Lonard started the final round five strokes behind Moseley but fired a four-under-par 68 including a 40-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole while Moseley closed with seven consecutive pars in his final round of 73. 				 																																	Berlin: Brazilian World Cup defender Lucio joined Bayer Leverkusens long injury list on Saturday with a damaged foot.

Toppmoeller was speaking after a 2-3 home defeat by Hamburg SV sent last seasons runners-up down to 13th in the German first division standings. The Leverkusen coach was without Juan, Jens Nowotny, Zoltan Sebescen and Pascal Ojigwe all missed the clash through injury.				 																																	Karachi: Former Pakistan pacer Ata-ur Rehman Sunday said he had launched a court challenge against a life ban imposed on him after a match fixing inquiry two years ago.

				 																																	Sharjah: Pakistan, Sri Lanka and South Africa will feature in the Sharjah Cup in April.				 																																	All three teams have confirmed their entries and we have also finalised the itinerary, Zahid Noorani, chief executive of the Cricketers Benefit Fund Series who organise international cricket in Sharjah, said on Wednesday. It will be the first tournament after the World Cup. The winners of the event, running from April 1-10, will receive $120,000, with $80,000 for the runners-up and $50,000 for third place.

The Lawn Tennis Association announced Rusedskis withdrawal from the world group first-round tie in Sydney in February on its website.				 																																	Britain captain Roger Taylor, quoted by the BBC, said he was extremely disappointed, adding: It is a real blow.				 																																	Rusedski said he still hoped to be back in action in January in time for the Australian Open but had made the decision because he did not want to unsettle the Davis Cup team with a last-minute withdrawal. 				 																																	Zurich: Swiss club FC Aarau have raised 2.88 million Swiss francs ($2.04 million) to create a limited company and avoid bankruptcy.				 																																	The club announced it would form FC Aarau Corp within a few days. The money was raised by supporters, club president Michael Hunziker  who donated 80,000 Swiss francs  and Swiss Nationalliga president Jean-Francois Kurz.				 																																	London: Middlesbrough midfielder George Boateng is likely to be sidelined for several weeks following surgery on his left knee, the English Premier League club said on Tuesday.				 																																	Dutchman Boateng was injured during the first half of his teams 2-0 league defeat by Arsenal on Saturday and immediately had an operation to repair cartilage damage.				 																																	Boateng was injured after falling awkwardly in a challenge with compatriot Giovanni van Bronckhorst.				 																																	Troyes: Struggling French first division side Troyes have appointed former Bosnia manager Farouk Hadzibegic as their coach, the club said on its website. Hadzibegic replaces Jacky Bonnevay, sacked last week because of the clubs poor results this season. Troyes are second from bottom of the first division with 16 points from 20 games. 				 																																	Berlin: Bayern Munichs win over Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund last month may well have saved Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld his job, Bayerns commercial manager Uli Hoeness said.				 																																	If we had lost, it must have been possible to have had a talk with him, asking how do we continue? Hoeness said.				 																																	n Cricket, India vs New Zealand  First ODI live from 6 am on ESPN n Cricket, Australia vs England  4th Ashes Test, live from 8 am on STAR Sports n Cricket, South Africa vs Pakistan  1st Test, live from 4 pm on STAR Sports

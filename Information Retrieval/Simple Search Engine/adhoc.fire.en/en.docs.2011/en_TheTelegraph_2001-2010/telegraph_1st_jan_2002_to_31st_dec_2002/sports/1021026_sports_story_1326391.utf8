				 	 Hannan Sarkar is hit on the helmet on the first day of the second Test in Potchefstroom Friday. (AFP)																								Potchefstroom: South Africa recovered from an embarrassing start to gain the upper hand by the close on Day One of the second Test against Bangladesh on Friday.																								The hosts were 61 for one wicket in reply to Bangladeshs first-innings total of 215 as the North West Cricket Stadium at Potchefstroom became South Africas 11th and the worlds 86th Test venue.																								Herschelle Gibbs was undefeated on 36 after his opening partner Graeme Smith was dismissed in the final over of the day, fending at the first delivery from occasional off-spinner Sanwar Hossain to be caught behind for 24. Earlier, Bangladesh made the most of winning the toss, reaching lunch at 124 for one on a pristine batting strip.																								Hannan Sarkar and Al Shahriar compiled an opening partnership in excess of 50 for only the second time in Bangladeshs Test history.																								The South African bowlers appeared to have little answer to the blazing strokeplay of the Bangladeshi openers.																								When South Africa did eventually force the breakthrough there appeared to be an element of luck about it, Al Shahriar (30) caught at third slip off Mornantau Hayward. Replays suggested the ball had struck Shahriars body rather than the bat. (REUTERS)

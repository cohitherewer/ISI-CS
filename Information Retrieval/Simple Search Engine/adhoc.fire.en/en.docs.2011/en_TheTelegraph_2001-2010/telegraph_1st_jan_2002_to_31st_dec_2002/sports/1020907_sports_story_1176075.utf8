		 Saturday, September 07, 2002 				 High hopes from rowers
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The Indian rowing squad has had the best of training facilities and should do well in the Asian Games, feels team manager Subrata Dutta.																								The rowing team includes 13 men and six women and has been training under Romanian coach Nicolae Vulpe for close to six months. They have also toured Germany and Belgium as part of the preparation and the very best of equipment have been provided, said Dutta Friday.																								The contingent will reach Pusan well in advance, on September 15, before the Games Village opens on September 23. They will do so to get used to the boats which will directly be flown there from Germany, said Dutta.																								The Indian men will take part in seven events and the women in six. The men had won two bronze medals  coxless fours and double skulls  in the Bangkok Asian Games in 1998. Before that, India had won a silver in Beijing in 1990.																								Dutta admitted that after all kinds of assistance from the government, anything less than what was achieved last time will be a below-par performance.

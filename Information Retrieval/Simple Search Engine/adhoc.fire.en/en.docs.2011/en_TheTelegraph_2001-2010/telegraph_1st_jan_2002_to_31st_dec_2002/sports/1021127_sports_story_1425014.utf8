				 	 SACHIN TENDULKAR: Never under pressure																								Chennai: Master Batsman Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday put his weight behind Indias World Cup hopes saying the team would try its best to realise the dreams of millions of Indians.																								We are going to try and realise the hopes of the Indian masses and bring back the World Cup to the country, said Tendulkar who, along with dashing batsman Virender Sehwag, was here to launch an energy drink.																								It is going to be a big tournament, coming every four years. Indian supporters are looking forward to it. They are hoping the Cup comes back to India. We are hoping for it too. We are going to try our best to realise their hopes, Tendulkar said.																								Revealing his plans for after the World Cup, Tendulkar said, After the World Cup is over, I will be spending time with the kids on cricket, he said. I have gone through this as a kid and I know how important it is for a youngster to meet an international cricketer and get to know his experience. I want to meet them and spend time with them and share their feelings too.																								The master blaster also showered praise on Sehwag, saying it was a treat to be on the other end of the wicket when he plays.																								It is a treat to watch him. I like players who play big shots. It is an understatement that he plays big shots. We are all proud of his abilities. The whole world has seen what he is capable of, Tendulkar said about the rise of Sehwag at the international level. As a team member, I appreciate him. I will be happy to watch him bat like that and it will be treat to be on the other end of the wicket, Tendulkar said.																								In course of time, Sehwag will be in my shoes and tell others about his feelings, as it all starts at the grassroot level. 																								On whether he would open with Sehwag, Tendulkar said it was not possible for him to answer since the team management would decide this. It is not an individuals decision. It is going to be a team decision. It is not an individual sport. Whenever you make a specific move, you have to remember that you have ten other players with you, he said. 																								On his own game, Tendulkar said he was never under any pressure. It is not an individual sport. It is a team sport. There are a few players who click and not all the eleven can click at a time.

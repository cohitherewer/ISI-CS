The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, September 05, 2002 				 My only ambition was to play for India, not break records: Sachin Tendulkar
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								London: Thursday will see yet another Sachin Tendulkar milestone and, with such a momentous landmark around the corner, the otherwise intensely private icon has been having even less time for himself. Sachin, however, did speak to The Telegraph for a shade over an hour on the eve of his 100th Test.																								The following are excerpts																								On ambitions as a kid																								I was fond of tennis and soccer, especially the former, and probably wouldnt have been unhappy had I seriously taken to one of them... I was, then, a huge fan of McEnroe and Borg. As it turned out, our 1983 World Cup win changed everything. From then on, it was just cricket... As Ive said, though, I didnt look to becoming a cricketer right from the time I became aware of everything that happened around me.																								On whether his family wanted him to focus on studies																								My late father (Ramesh), in particular, appreciated what I should be doing in life and never put pressure... Never tried to impose himself. Rather, he often said I should do what I wanted to  only, I shouldnt ever be found wanting in effort... I recall he once said dont do anything which, in the later years, you could regret. That one piece of advice keeps guiding me, remains a source of so much strength.																								On his family																								(Emotionally) Has always been the single biggest influence... I doubt if theres something more important than what the parents teach a child... I learnt quite a bit from my father, merely by watching him lead a simple life... Really, he didnt have to keep saying do this or dont do that. The values he held dear rubbed off on me  honesty, sincerity... Its given me strength.																								On elder brother Ajits influence																								Where cricket is concerned, yes, he has played a big part... Generally, Im indebted to the entire family for support  my mother (Rajani), eldest brother Nitin, sister Savita and, of course, (wife) Anjali.																								On the sacrifices made																								As a kid, there were days when I thought of having an evening out, of simply enjoying bhelpuri... Of watching a movie, perhaps... But, I couldnt because I had to be regular at the nets... However, as I enjoyed my cricket, I wouldnt really term missing all that as a sacrifice. Nobody forced me to skip movies or bhelpuri.																								On his idol																								Vivian Richards... I wanted to emulate him and him alone... (Adds laughing) I remember asking Manjrekar to introduce me to him when I learnt he was in the same hotel as our teams, in Melbourne, during the 1992 World Cup... I also recall getting tongue-tied... Didnt know what to say. In more recent years, Ive had occasions to actually speak to him. Keep hitting the ball has always been Vivs advice.																								On whether, as a kid, he dreamt of owning something in particular																								(Smiles) Cars fascinated me... Wanted to own many... In fact, still want to!																								[Sachins favourite, predictably, is the recently-gifted Ferrari.]																								On being a role model																								Ive done what I thought was right and what my family thought was correct... Ive never tried to cultivate an image, have never tried to be different... Ive been genuine and, at no time, have I thought of either behaving differently or doing something differently only because Im seen as a role model. Im aware of my responsibilities.																								On not endorsing liquor and tobacco																								Yes, its been a conscious decision... My father, too, would feel I shouldnt lend my name to certain products... My stand isnt going to change.																								On his association with Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based charity																								As often as possible, I try and help... Thanks to friends across the world, Im regularly able to auction my clothes, cricket gear... Every single paisa goes to the charity which is devoted to the betterment of children in the slums of Mumbai... Recently, even TVS-Suzuki, one of my sponsors, chipped in by donating a bike which I could auction.																								On the commercial side of Sachin Tendulkar																								The spin-offs have come about because of cricket and, as long as I keep playing, the spin-offs will continue... The point Im making is that I dont have to think of money or whatever. I just need to think of my game, need to think of helping Team India. Cricket will remain the No. 1 priority and, if a situation arises where I have to compromise with my first love, I wont.																								On his thoughts on the eve of his 100th Test																								Im treating the occasion normally... Ill play my natural game... Im aware not many have got to play 100 Tests... Yet, at the same time, Ill still only be playing cricket. The milestone isnt going to change things... Ive given the game my best shot, have always wanted to be remembered as someone who consistently gave everything for the country.																								On whether, today, he is especially indebted to somebody																								My coach, Mr Achrekar... Without him... His attention towards me was so complete that if, on some days, I got late for nets, he would himself drive over in his scooter and take me to Shivaji Park... Then, Sunil Gavaskar... Whenever Ive had some doubts, Ive gone to him. Its been the same with Shastri.																								On whether he still interacts with Achrekar																								I seek his blessings before every tour... We talk generally (in Marathi), the interaction isnt cricket-specific.																								On his debut innings and Test (November 1989, Karachi)																								I didnt get many (15) and the first thought was whether I was good enough for Test cricket, whether I had it in me to come good among the best... Not having played anybody as quick as Imran, Akram and Waqar, I thought I was out of place... For a while, I did think it could be my first and last Test.																								On how long it took him to settle down																								Fortunately, I got another opportunity and, in the very next Test (Faisalabad), got 59 in the first innings... By the end of that knock, I was fine... I had been determined not to give it away and, to an extent, succeeded. As you may remember, I didnt leave the field even after being hit on the nose by Waqar in Sialkot (last Test)... Had I gone off, at that crucial stage, it would have meant admitting defeat. I couldnt have done that.																								On the huge gulf between Test and purely first-class cricket																								The pace of the quicks is so much more, the wickets are different. Moreover, unlike the domestic scene, where you are up against the best in a state or zone, Test cricket pits you against the very best of a country... Its only at this level that you have three-four quality bowlers constantly coming at you. With no easy runs, its tough.																								On how conscious he is of records																								Look, I do know when Im either close to a record or have broken one... I would be lying if I said I wasnt aware. But, then, I dont keep thinking of records... When I took to cricket, my only ambition was to play for India, not break records. That hasnt changed. Im neither obsessed with nor am I driven by records.																								On his mental preparation before either a Test or an ODI																								Very early on itself, Ajit suggested I visualise the bowlers, mentally study the wicket and conditions... The possible field settings... Right through, Ive been doing that.																								On whether he agrees that the pressure-factor, brought about by such high expectations, has often made him curb his natural game.																								As with life itself, there are stages in cricket... Then, Im part of a team sport, Im only one of 11 individuals with a role to play... Therefore, while I could be in the first gear on some days, I could be in the fifth on others... I cant keep doing my thing all the time and, clearly, Ive got to respect the demands of the team. Of course, experience helps.																								On his most significant innings in recent times																								The 117 in Port-of-Spain, earlier this year, and the 92 at Trent Bridge... Probably even the 79 in Georgetown.																								On the bowlers who have made him concentrate that much harder																								So many! Obviously, while preparing, I tend to think more about the strike bowlers... While its difficult to pick one quick, I would certainly name a few spinners  Warne and Murali, for sure, and someone who is constantly underrated  Vettori.																								On whether he, too, agrees his explosive performance in Sharjah (April 1998) remains his best in ODIs																								Yes, perhaps... I was in very good nick and everything I hit went in the desired direction.																								[Sachin totalled 435 runs in five matches, at an average of 87.]																								On his favourite Test innings																								(Pauses) The 114 in Perth (1991-92)... Even the unbeaten 155 against Australia at the Chepauk (1997-98).																								On his biggest disappointment																								Our not winning the Chennai Test versus Pakistan (1998-99)... Because of a back problem, I couldnt continue beyond 136 and we fell short by a few runs. Had we won, I would have picked that hundred as my best knock... Its only later I learnt I had a stress fracture.																								On whether, during that back problem in 1999, he feared a premature end to his career																								Not worried, but till I took a break later that year, I couldnt concentrate in the usual manner... The pain would be too much... It was much the same when I suffered a crack beneath my right (big) toe last year... Again, I had to take a break... Forget playing, I could barely walk then.																								On his phenomenal concentration																								It has much to do with priorities, of knowing where I stand (vis-a-vis the bowlers)... If you want something in life, youve got to stay focussed on achieving that. If I want runs, well, Ive got to concentrate.																								On whether he sets goals																								Yes... It could be match-by-match, could even be for every series.																								On captaincy																								(Interrupting) Lets leave this out of the interview...																								[Sachin also didnt wish to speak on the Mike Denness controversy.]																								On Sourav Ganguly as captain																								Hes been doing a good job... If I may add, in passing, it cant just be the captains task to keep the team together. Believe me, every player has this responsibility. The great thing about this team is that everybody gets along with each other. We enjoy each others company... Thats how it should always be.																								On what makes a good team																								Talent... Once the talent is there, other things fall into place... The hunger, though, must also be there.																								On whether he reads much of what is written about him																								Good or bad, I try and avoid... In the middle of a match, for instance, Ive got to think of the bowlers and field settings, not get concerned about something which may have been written that morning.																								On whether he is deeply religious																								I do pray daily, its a tradition in our family.																								On heroes outside cricket																								McEnroe, most definitely... Among contemporary sportsmen, I admire Sampras and Schumacher. Should Sampras quit? The decision has to be his and his only... Hes a great and, instead of speaking about the lows in his career, people should remember the absolute highs. Whatever Sampras present form, nobody can take away his achievements.																								On what separates a champion from the run-of-mill performers																								Its a difficult question... I suppose mental toughness and the hunger to consistently do well.																								On his reaction when people keep treating him like a champion																								Does feel nice but, because I still am rather shy, I may not respond very openly... Frankly, Im a little reluctant to even say hello to people I dont know. I feel uncomfortable and will prefer to look down and walk on instead of looking up and responding. Thats the way I am.																								On his ideal vacation spot																								(Laughs again) If I tell you, it wont remain ideal! But, yes, my understanding of a vacation is spending time with family.																								On whether he treats both daughter Sara and son Arjun evenly																								Oh, absolutely... As a parent who cant get away from the limelight, I want them at least to lead a normal life.																								On the future																								 (Smiles again) I havent, in the past, thought much about the future... I dont wish to do so now either... If I do, theres the risk of putting myself under more pressure... In any case, why should I today be different?																								Finally, if he has a message																								I wish to thank fans across the world for so much love and affection... I know I cant repay that... However, I hope Ill continue getting the same treatment. Its nice to feel so wanted.

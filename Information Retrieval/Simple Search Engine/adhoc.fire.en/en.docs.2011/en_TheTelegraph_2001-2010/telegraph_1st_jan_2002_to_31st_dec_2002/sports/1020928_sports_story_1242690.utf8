																								Nagaon: Oil India Limited shocked East Bengal 1-0 in an eventful quarter final of the Independence Cup football meet at Duliajan on Friday. Tridip Khound scored in the 87th minute.																								In a bizarre incident, the game had to be stopped for 25 minutes in the second session after referee Dulal Basumatary flashed a second yellow card at OIL defender Jatin Das but forgot to show him the red card.																								On seeing this, the irate East Bengal players protested and left the ground, refusing to return to the ground unless the referee was changed.																								With the Calcutta outfit not ready to compromise, Basumatary was replaced by Ajit Deka and the match resumed. (PTI)

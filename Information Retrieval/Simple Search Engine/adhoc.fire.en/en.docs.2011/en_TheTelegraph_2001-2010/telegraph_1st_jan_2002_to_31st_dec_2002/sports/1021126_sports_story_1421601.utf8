Were waiting for their International Transfer Certificate. 																								Its likely to arrive Wednesday, their coach Sukhwinder Singh said.																								He, however, didnt sound satisfied with the fixture for the National Football League. 																								Our first five games are away fixtures, with the first three against Salgaocar, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. 																								So, you can very well understand our plight the coach lamented.																								When asked whether any protest will be lodged in this aspect to the AIFF, Sukhwinder said, I dont think thatll mean much.																								He was also a bit disappointed with the preparation of his team for the NFL. 																								We did play in the Punjab League, but otherwise there hasnt been much match practice, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, December 14, 2002 				 No venue on any ICC hit list
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta: The Australian Cricket Board (ACB) chief executive, James Sutherland, must be told to get facts right.																								Earlier this week, an out-of-turn-speaking Sutherland talked about two grounds in India featuring on the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) troublesome list.																								Well, no such compilation exists.																								Look, its quite a simple matter: No grounds are on any hit list  simply because one doesnt exist.  explained ICC spokesman Mark Harrison, when contacted by The Telegraph.																								Speaking Friday evening, from London, Harrison added: Instead, the ICC has a database of grounds worldwide and, with each match, that dossier keeps getting updated. In any case, the compilation is general.																								However, as comments by Match Referees are taken into account, any critical reference will naturally figure in the database, which is accessible to the ICC affiliates. Of course, even that has nothing to do with the existence of a list of good/bad grounds																								The ICC spokesmans clarification should put the Rajkot-based Saurashtra Cricket Association officials at ease. Even the Bihar Cricket Association (Jamshedpur) and Vidarbha Cricket Association (Nagpur) mandarins.																								After all, going by what happened in the recent ODIs against the West Indies, they must have been losing sleep after Sutherlands remarks.																								Its another matter that Jamshedpur, Nagpur and Rajkot do need to take many remedial measures. Perhaps, they need to learn from Indias newest one-day centre  Vijayawada.

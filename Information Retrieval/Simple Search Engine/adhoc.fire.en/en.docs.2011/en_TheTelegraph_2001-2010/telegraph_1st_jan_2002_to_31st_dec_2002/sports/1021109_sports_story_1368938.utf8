		 Saturday, November 09, 2002 				 Serena makes winning return
				 	 SERENA: Back in business																								Los Angeles: World No. 1 Serena Williams returned to work on Thursday after a vacation of nearly six weeks, opening her defence of her WTA Championship crown with a 6-2, 6-2 demolition of Anna Smashnova.																								Joining Serena in the final eight was third-seeded compatriot Jennifer Capriati, the Australian Open champion overcoming a slow start to tame Italys Silvia Farina Elia 7-5, 6-1.																								With a successful defence of the title she captured last year in Germany, Serena can cap off a memorable campaign  which includes Grand Slam triumphs at the French, US Open and Wimbledon  by becoming the first woman to win $4 million in a single season.																								Serena will now meet Yugoslavias Jelena Dokic, who advanced with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Russian Anastasia Myskina.																								Despite having not played since lifting her season-leading eighth title six weeks ago, Serena needed only a few games to shake off the rust and overpowered Smashnova in just 53 minutes.																								I guess I felt a bit rusty today, conceded Serena. I had a few errors too many. Its just a matter of focussing mentally and the tougher the opponent it automatically clicks in. (REUTERS)

		 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Grosjean puts France on par
																								Paris: French No. 1 Sebastien Grosjean destroyed Russias Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-6, 6-3, 6-0 to leave the Davis Cup final poised at 1-1 after the opening singles on Friday. 																								Russian No. 1 Marat Safin drew on his greater experience of the big occasion to beat Cup debutant Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 in the first match of the final as a gamble by the champions captain Guy Forget went badly wrong.																								Grosjean, ranked 16 in the world, sent the 14,000 French fans in the Bercy stadium into delirium with a superbly athletic display against the 28-year-old Kafelnikov.																								The former World No. 1, who has vowed to retire if he can lead Russia to their first Davis Cup title, was a broken man in the third set and was left flat-footed on the baseline as Grosjean blazed shots past him from every angle.																								I wouldnt have liked to end the day 2-0 down, said Forget.																								 I am full of confidence, I saw some good things today. Tomorrow will be crucial.																								Safin, World No. 3 doused the exuberant shot-making of his 20-year-old opponent with superior placement and coolness under pressure.																								Mathieu had beaten Safin in their only previous encounter in Moscow last month. He hit a hot streak of form in the second set of this match but his first serve was rarely a threat and Safin was far more calculated on the big points.																								The match was watched by former Russian president Boris Yeltsin and French President Jacques Chirac, celebrating his 70th birthday. (REUTERS)

				 																																	Hong Kong: A Pakistani cricket fan wearing an Osama Bin Laden mask paraded before a stand of spectators at the on-going Sixes tournament, provoking a brief bout of beer-spraying and can tossing, tournament organisers said on Tuesday.				 																																	The melee on Sunday lasted only a few minutes and injured nobody, and authorities did not impose any penalties on those involved. It was sparked when the Pakistani fan donned the mask and hoisted his national flag before a stand of mostly western spectators during the England-Pakistan final, tournament director Clive Howard said.				 																																	Somebody in the crowd sprayed beer on the man with the mask. All his friends came out from the Pakistani stand and started throwing cans and water bottles at a group of spectators in the next-door stand, said Howard, who is a Hong Kong police officer.				 																																	Stewards at the Kowloon Cricket Club restored order and called the police, but the man with the mask fled before officers arrived.				 																																	Aarau (Switzerland): FC Aarau will fold on December 19, 100 years after they were founded, unless 2.65 million Swiss francs ($1.80 million) can be raised to save the Swiss club, president Michael Hunziker said on Monday.				 																																	Aarau, bottom of the 12-team Swiss league known as the Nationalliga, need to restructure and become a limited company to avoid going bust, Hunziker told supporters at a public meeting in Aarau.				 																																	The club announced last month that they planned to raise five million Swiss francs to finance a move to a new home and clear debts estimated at 2.3 million francs by the floating of FC Aarau AG, as the company would be known.				 																																	But less than half the funds have been raised and Hunziker warned that Aarau will fold on December 19.				 																																	Liverpool: Germanys Markus Babbel will seal his recovery from a debilitating illness with his first Liverpool start in 15 months on Wednesday.				 																																	Babbel has not begun a competitive game for the English Premier League leaders since being diagnosed with Guillan-Barre Syndrome in August last year. The rare disorder causes the bodys immune system to attack part of the nervous system and left Babbel unable to walk for months. He will return to the starting line-up for the League Cup third round tie with Southampton at Anfield.				 																																	Seoul: South Korea captain Hong Myung-bo will join LA Galaxy from 2003, becoming the first player from the east Asian country to play Major League Soccer. LA Galaxy have agreed to pay one billion won ($819,000) for Hong, said a statement from his K-League club Pohang Steelers. Under the two-year contract, Hong will get an annual income of $275,000 and receive up to $225,000 worth of incentives.

		 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Scolari asks successor to start afresh
 (AGENCIES)																								Fortaleza (Brazil): Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari dismissed Wednesdays shock defeat against Paraguay, his last game in charge, and said his team would always be remembered for winning the 2002 World Cup.																								I started losing and finished losing but these defeats will be forgotten thanks to the Penta (fifth world title) said the man known as Big Phil.																								The game was a celebration. Seven or eight of the team who started are still in pre-season training, so a 0-1 defeat was a good result. It was worthwhile for meeting the players and the national team staff again, Scolari said.																								Whoever is picked ought to bear in mind that we always have difficulties and they should try and keep their feet on the ground. The Penta should be forgotten, Scolari said.																								For Brazilian football, the image that remains is one of a strong group which chased its targets with discipline.																								Scolari, who wants to coach a club in Europe, did not want to talk about Brazils future.																								Brazil may have to start their qualifying campaign for the 2006 World Cup as early as next July.																								Scolari took over Brazil with the team in disarray in June last year and led them to the world title only 13 month later. He finished with a record of 18 wins, one draw and six defeats in 25 games.																								Scolari, a strict disciplinarian, signed off in poetic flourish inspired by the words from a samba song. Let yourselves be carried along by life. We were born in difficult circumstances and we worked to achieve what we wanted. We are world champions for the fifth time, he said. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.

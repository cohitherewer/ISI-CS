The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, October 21, 2002 				 Agarkar in for Zaheer
 FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR				 	 Agarkar																								Chennai: Jawagal Srinath will partner Ashish Nehra or Ajit Agarkar with the new-ball in the third Test of the current series. The national selectors who met here Sunday decided to rest Zaheer Khan for the Calcutta match. Agarkar, who replaced Zaheer, was the only change in the 14-man squad.																								The decision to play Nehra or Agarkar will be taken after having a look at the Eden wicket. Agarkar will strengthen the batting while Nehra will offer the option of a right-left opening combination.																								Zaheer, nursing a shin bone injury, was advised two week rest after a fresh MRI done Saturday, BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said. While Nair was non-committal about Zaheers availability for the one-day series, Sourav Ganguly said the fast bowler would not be available for the seven ODIs.																								We have been playing constantly. The full 14-man squad has a niggle here and there. Its only natural that Zaheer be given some rest to keep him fresh for the New Zealand tour and the World Cup, Sourav added.																								Its also unlikely that there will be any more changes in the team.I dont think there is any place for Shiv Sundar Das. You dont experiment in Test matches. The team is playing well and youve got to earn your place, the skipper said.																								The selectors also named the Rest of India squadfor the Irani Trophy match against Ranji champions Railways in Delhi from October 28. 																								INDIA SQUAD: Sourav Ganguly, Shiv Sundar Das, Sanjay Bangar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman, Parthiv Patel, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Jawagal Srinath, Ashish Nehra, Ajit Agarkar, Amit Mishra.																								REST Of INDIA: Yuvraj Singh (captain), Akash Chopra, Wasim Jaffer, Abhijit Kale, Rohan Gavaskar, Vijay Dahiya, Sourashish Lahiri, Sarandeep Singh, Timil Patel, Irfan Pathan, Tinu Yohannan, Jyoti Yadav, Rakesh Patel, T. Rayudu.

 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta: The International Cricket Councils (ICCs) security delegation, which recently undertook a fact-finding visit to Zimbabwe, favours status quo over the hosting of six World Cup matches in that country next February-March.																								The ICC chief executive, Malcolm Speed, is expected to make a formal announcement later this week. 																								According to The Telegraphs sources, the delegation  which included top representatives of the six teams required to play there  has been pretty unanimous in agreeing that the present situation did not warrant Zimbabwes Pool A league matches to be shifted to South Africa, the tournaments principal host.																								The teams scheduled to visit Zimbabwe are: Namibia (February 10), England (February 13), India (February 19), Australia (February 24), Holland (February 28) and Pakistan (March 4). While the first three matches will be held in Harare, Bulawayo will stage the remaining three. Incidentally, Board secretary S.K. Nair was Indias nominee on the delegation.																								While the delegation does feel Zimbabwes political situation isnt of the most healthy kind, directly commenting on that will be overstepping its briefStrictly where safety of the players is concerned, though, there are no reservations  certainly not at this point in time, is how a source put it.																								Significantly, the local administration in both Harare (the capital) and Bulawayo has prepared a comprehensive action plan. That, apparently, is one of the factors which influenced the delegation  as also Pakistans just-ended incident-free tour of Zimbabwe.																								With the Zimbabwe issue settled  for now, at least  the ICCs focus is on Kenya. A security delegation will visit capital Nairobi, slated to host two league matches, for a full-fledged review.																								n British ministers view: Pg 18

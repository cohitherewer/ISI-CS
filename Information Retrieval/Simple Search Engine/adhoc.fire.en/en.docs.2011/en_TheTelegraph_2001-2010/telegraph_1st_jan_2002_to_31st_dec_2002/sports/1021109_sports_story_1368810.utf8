																								Jamshedpur: State cricket association officials here are passing the buck and have blamed spectators and a soft drink company for the shameful crowd disturbance during the first India-West Indies ODI at the Keenan Stadium on Wednesday.																								Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) secretary B. N. Singh said the organisers were in no way responsible. Not only were the spectators responsible, but a soft drink company which was to supply water as well as glasses did not do so. It only supplied the bottles (used as missiles), he said. Let there be an inquiry. (PTI)

				 	 Stephen Fleming with trophy Sunday																								Hamilton: His dream of winning an away Test series having been again shattered by New Zealand, a dejected-looking Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly unsuccessfully tried to hide his emotions on Sunday saying the team would come up with a better performance in the one-day series.																								I am disappointed with the way the (Test) series went for us. But this is not the end of the world, Sourav said after India were beaten by four-wickets in the second Test. We now have to prepare for the one-dayers and hopefully will come up with a much improved performance, he said.																								New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming was also expecting a much tougher contest in the one-dayers. Delighted at the 2-0 result, Fleming said his team would have to work more hard in the one-day series since the wickets would not be as unfavourable to the Indians as they were in the Tests.																								The Indians struggled on the pitches here but the one-day wickets will suit them a lot better, Fleming said.The Black Caps captain admitted his team was nervous while chasing the target on Sunday, especially after he himself got out.																								We knew the Indians were in for a good fight. It was a very tense finish. It is one thing to have helpful conditions and quite another to be able to use it to your advantage and put the balls in the right place. Its great to captain a bowling unit as the one we have right now, he said. 																								However, he admitted to being nervous throughout his teams chase on Sunday. It was pretty intense. Half an hour of lack of concentration could have turned the game. We were pretty nervous. I thought the game was in the balance. In such kind of conditions, none was able to dominate the game, he said.																								Indian coach John Wright conceded that his team did not look good enough for the home side in either of the Tests.																								We were not good enough to win on either occasion. We probably needed more runs to give us a better chance, Wright said. But I am pleased with the way we competed in this match, particularly in the field.Wright made a pointed reference to the pitches in the two venues being watered before the game when ideally they should have been left to dry out as much as possible.

				 	 Ponting: Not working to any timetable																								Sydney: Ricky Ponting has dismissed claims that theres a strained relationship with Steve Waugh over the Australian Test captaincy.																								Ponting, who took over as one-day skipper when Waugh was axed from the team earlier this year, says he is not working to any timetable as pressure builds on 37-year-old Waugh to hold on to the Test captaincy for the imminent Ashes series.																								Pakistan coach Richard Pybus has suggested there would be electricity between Ponting and Steve Waugh over the Test captaincy.																								Ponting, who is expected to lead Australia into next years World Cup, said he heard of Pybus comments when he spoke to his wife on the telephone this week from Sharjah where Australia are playing Pakistan in a three-Test series.																								I laughed at that. How would he (Pybus) know anyway, Ponting was reported as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday. He doesnt know anything about how our team operates or how we are as individuals. 																								Ponting, one of Australias key batsmen for the five-Test ashes series beginning in Brisbane on November 7, said he was focusing on his cricket rather than being distracted about speculation over the test captaincy. 																								Whatever happens, happens, Ponting said. I wont be losing any sleep about it at all. Its just cricket as usual for me.																								Ponting says his thinking is no different at Test level now that he is one-day captain.																								Ive always thought of myself as a captain on the ground, and tried to think as captain all the time anyway.																								Im still doing that now but Im certainly not doing any more than I used to, he said. (AFP)

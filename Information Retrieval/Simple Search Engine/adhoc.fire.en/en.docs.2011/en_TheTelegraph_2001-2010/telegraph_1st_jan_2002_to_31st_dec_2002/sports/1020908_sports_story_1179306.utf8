The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, September 08, 2002 				 Joint move on players release
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Sept. 7: In a joint move, the city-based big clubs have reiterated their demand that the players be released from the national camp, prior to a tournament. 																								Representatives from East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, Mohammedan Sporting and Tollygunge Agragami, had a meeting with the IFA on Saturday, reiterating their stand on the players availability for club assignments. They will also write a letter to All India Football Federation (AIFF) on September 18, asking the national body to release players, at least seven days prior to a tournament. 																								AIFF does not have any specific calendar for a national camp. On the contrary, it is the clubs who pay the players, so we cant suffer financially by way of letting our players be encamped for an indefinite time, or at whatever time the national body wants them to be made available, a senior Mohun Bagan official said.

		 Tuesday, December 31, 2002 				 ICC team on security recce 
																								Melbourne: The ICC is considering sending a delegation to Kenya to assess whether it is safe to stage two World Cup matches there next February.																								Kenya are due to play New Zealand (February 21) and Sri Lanka (February 24) in preliminary round matches in the capital Nairobi.																								ICC president Malcolm Gray said he would chair an international telephone hook-up later on Monday to consider whether to send a safety and security delegation to Kenya within the next two weeks. We may look at the situation there due to the fact that there has been a change of government there since last Saturday, Gray said.																								Among other things a bomb went off there recently and if we do send a delegation to Kenya it will be to establish whether it is safe and secure for the players, the supporters and the general population if the two World Cup matches continue to be held there.

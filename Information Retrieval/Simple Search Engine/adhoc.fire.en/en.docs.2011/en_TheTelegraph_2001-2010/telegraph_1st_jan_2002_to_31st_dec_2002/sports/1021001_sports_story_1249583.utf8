The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Tuesday, October 01, 2002  BRIEFS
				 																																	London: Demolition experts finally began ripping the heart out of Wembley Stadium on Monday, turning one of the worlds most famous sporting landmarks into a pile of dust and rubble.				 																																	With a new stadium set to rise in time for the 2006 FA Cup final, the Twin Towers that have watched over so many of English footballs greatest moments are being torn down and consigned to the history books. The stadium, that cost 750,000 to build in the early 1920s, will now cost more than 750 million to rebuild.				 																																	Manchester: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was full of praise for Sam Torrance on Monday after his fellow-Scotsman led Europe to victory in the Ryder Cup.				 																																	It was magnificent, Ferguson said. Im really delighted for Sam. I have known him since he was a young lad. We used to go to Largs and played with his father, who is a pro there. That was a long time ago. Im very pleased for him.				 																																	Ferguson admitted he was glued to the drama unfolding at The Belfry, where Europe sealed a 15-1/2 to 12-1/2 points victory over the US to reclaim the Ryder Cup.				 																																	Manchester: Ruud van Nistelrooy could miss Manchester Uniteds Champions League clash against Olympiakos on Tuesday because of a persistent hamstring problem, manager Alex Ferguson said Monday. 				 																																	Ruud van Nistelrooy is quite doubtful, Ferguson said. We took a risk and played him on Saturday (against Charlton), but with hamstrings, if you dont clear it up, it goes on and on and on.				 																																	In Van Nistelrooys absence, Paul Scholes would probably play in attack alongside Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.				 																																	Berlin: IOC president Jacques Rogge says Germany would make ideal hosts for the 2012 Summer Games. I see Germanys chances as fundamentally good, Rogge told Mondays issue of German sports magazine Kicker. Germany has a stable political system, a stable economy and is a big sports nation with great experience in organising major sports events. We would know that the Games would be in the best of hands there.				 																																	The German Olympic committee (NOK) will name its candidate for the 2012 Games in 2003. Dsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Leipzig and Stuttgart are in the race. 				 																																	London: Manchester United, the worlds richest soccer club, reported a 48 per cent rise in annual profits on Monday. They also kept players wages below their target of 50 per cent of turnover. United reported pre-tax profits of 32.3 million ($50.26 million) for the year to July 31.				 																																	n Cricket, Talk show: Best of Harsha Online, from 8.00 am and 2.00 pm on STAR Sports n Soccer: English Premier League, from 5.00 pm on ESPN n Soccer: Spanish League, from 5.30 pm on STAR Sports n Cricket: Legends of Cricket, from 8.30 pm and 11.30 pm on ESPN

																								Heraklion (Greece): Indias Dronavalli Harika and Ramya Krishna emerged joint leaders after registering comprehensive victories in the fifth round of the under-12 category of the world youth chess championship here Wednesday.																								In yet another fruitful day for Indian girls, Krutika Nadig secured a draw vs second seed Bela Khotenashvili of Georgia in the under-16 section, while M. Manogna beat Christina Tartacuta in a fifth round game in the under-10 category. 																								In boys section, Grandmaster P. Harikrishna continued to excel with white pieces and scored his third victory with the favourable colour in the under-18 section. 																								At the receiving end was German Drabke Lorenz who was outplayed in a complicated queen and pawns endgame arising out of an English opening.																								Harikrishna, with two draws with black pieces, is now in joint third position with four points. Georgian Ims Zaviad Izoria and Davit Artunian share the lead in this section with 4.5 points each.																								Playing an aggressive game, Harika crashed through the defences of overnight leader Muzychuk to emerge as joint leader on 4.5 points along side Ramya Krishna and Tan Zhongyi of China.																								Six rounds remain, and Harika plays Krishna in the next round. 																								Playing black in the fifth round, Harika opened with the Sicilian defence and was pleasantly surprised to spot an inferior move order employed by Muzychuk in the initial stages. 																								In a perfect follow up to cash on her opponents fault, Harika sacrificed an exchange as early as the 13th move and ended up with two extra pawns after a tactical battle.As the game progressed Harika took control of the situation to wrap up the board in 64 moves.																								Ramya Krishna was also not much behind Harika when it came to outplaying the opponent.He grabbed the initiative and struck with a perfect assessment of the situation.																								In the match against Khotenashvili, one of the favourites in her category, Krutika Nadig played a solid game right through and gave little chances.																								Among the boys Parimarjan Negi survived a scare at the hands of Arnold Marc Tyler of the US in the under-10 category. 																								Parimarjan who started poorly had a bad position in the middle game too. However with resourceful play, the delhi boy bounced back to post a win.																								Another contender in the under-10 category, Y. Sandeep was not so lucky as he went down fighting to Chinese Ding Liren. (PTI)

				 	 SHOAIB: Offence considered minor																								Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said Friday it was waiting for the team managers report on accusations of ball-tampering against fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar in Zimbabwe before taking action.																								The team management has conveyed the incident to us but we have asked the team manager in Zimbabwe, Brigadier Khawaja Mohammad Nasir, to submit a detailed report before taking the matter further, PCB spokesman Samiul Hasan said.																								Shoaib was found guilty in a disciplinary hearing at the Harare Sports Club on Tuesday evening of ball-tampering in the first Test against Zimbabwe.																								He was severely reprimanded by former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd in his capacity as Match Referee for the tour of Zimbabwe.																								We have reason to believe that the offence was of minor magnitude because history suggests that players involved in ball tampering have been severely punished and Akhtar has been reprimanded only, Hasan said. 																								Shoaib took seven wickets in the match which pakistan won by 119 runs. (AFP)

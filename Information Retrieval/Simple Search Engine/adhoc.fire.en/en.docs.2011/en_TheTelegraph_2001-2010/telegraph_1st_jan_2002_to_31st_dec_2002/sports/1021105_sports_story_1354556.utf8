(AFP) 																								London: Bayern Munich slumped to another defeat, English champions Arsenal ended their losing streak, and Inter Milan and Real Sociedad stayed top in Italy and Spain over the weekend.																								Bayern, reeling after Tuesdays 1-2 Champions League loss to Deportivo La Coruna, suffered a further setback when they were beaten 0-2 at Werder Bremen in the German first division.																								Bayern remained two points clear of champions Borussia Dortmund, who missed the chance to crank up the pressure on the leaders when they were held to a 1-1 home draw by lowly Hamburg SV. 																								TSV 1860 Munich stayed third after a 3-1 win over Arminia Bielefeld, while Bremen are fourth and Schalke 04 fifth following their 1-0 victory at bottom-placed Energie Cottbus.																								Last seasons runner-up Bayer Leverkusen continued to struggle as they slumped to a 0-1 home defeat at the hands of VfB Stuttgart.																								Inter Milan maintained their unbeaten start to the Serie A season with a 2-0 win at Como, Christian Vieri and Alvaro Recoba scoring the goals.																								The victory maintained Inters three-point lead over AC Milan who beat Reggina 2-0 with goals from Brazilian Rivaldo and Italian striker Filippo Inzaghi.																								AS Roma fought back from two goals down for a 2-2 home draw against Perugia despite playing the entire second half with 10 men after goalkeeper Francesco Antonioli was sent off.																								An Alessandro Del Piero header gave champions Juventus a 1-0 win at Modena.																								In England, champions Arsenal ended their run of four successive defeats when an own goal by French striker Steve Marlet gave them a 1-0 win at Fulham.																								Real Sociedad maintained their three-point lead at the top of the Spanish first division with a 1-0 success at Villarreal, courtesy of a goal from Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci.																								Valencia stayed second, a free kick from fullback Fabio Aurelio earning the champions a 1-0 away win at Espanyol.																								Real Mallorcas fifth successive victory, 3-1 at Valladolid, lifted them to third, while European champions Real Madrid dropped seven points off the lead in sixth place following a 0-0 draw at Deportivo La Coruna.																								Barcelona dropped further off the pace as they struggled to snatch a 1-1 draw at Racing Santander.																								In France, first division leaders AJ Auxerre crashed to a 1-3 loss to RC Lens but Paris St Germain missed the chance to go top after losing at lowly Sedan by the same score.																								Auxerre have 24 points, one ahead of PSG, while champions Olympique Lyon are in fifth after being held to a 2-2 draw by third-placed Nice.																								Ten-man Olympique Marseille moved up to fourth place after a 2-0 win over Montpellier.																								The most striking scoreline of the weekend came in Switzerland, however, where struggling St Gallen suffered a humiliating 3-11 defeat by local rivals FC Wil.																								St Gallen opened the scoring but were buried under a deluge of goals by newly promoted Wil, who act as a feeder club for their more illustrious neighbours.  (REUTERS)

 							 - Dingko crashes out, Shiv Kapur joint leader in golf				 	 North Koreas Choe Phyong Chol (left) lands a punch on Indias Dingko Singh in the third round of the Asian Games bantamweight (54kg) boxing preliminary bout in Masan Thursday. Choe beat Dingko 26-6 																								Busan: A silver medal in the mens team trap shooting event was all that India had to show for their efforts on the fifth day of the 14th Asian Games on Thursday. The day saw Indias challenge in womens weightlifting all but coming to an end and ace boxer Dingko Singh crashing out in the first round.																								The shooting team of Anwer Sultan, Mansher Singh and Manavjit Singh won the silver medal at the Changwon International shooting range but an individual medal once again eluded the shooters.																								Indias challenge in judo came to an end with the third participant, Akram Shah, also making an early exit in the 60kg category while in weightlifting, Pratima Kumari became the latest to crash out, finishing fifth in the womens 63 kg class.																								But there was some hope on the golf course where Shiv Kapur was the joint leader after the first round of the individual event. However, the lacklustre show of Keshav Mishra and G.Harendra affected Indias prospects in the team event being held simultaneously. India were placed fifth after the first round in the team event. 																								The boxing contingent suffered a jolt with Bangkok Games gold medal winner Dingko Singh being shown the door in the very first round by his North Korean opponent Choe Phyong Chol with a 26-6 margin.																								Dingko, billed as a medal prospect, seemed totally clueless against his much more experienced opponent and bowed out in a rather tame manner.																								The shooting ranges also did not bring much cheer today. After Mansher, Sultan and Manavjit won the silver with an aggregate of 340 points, there was only disappointment in store for India.																								Mansher and Manavjit finished fourth and fifth in the individual event but pistol king Jaspal Rana was way behind in the mens 10m air pistol event.																								In air pistol team event too, the Indian trio of Rana, Samaresh Jung and Ved Prakash finished eighth with a total of 1714 points.																								There was no change in the fortunes of the Indian volleyball team who suffered their second defeat in as many matches. India lost to Iran 2-3 in a keenly contested pool A encounter.																								The rowers, who had fetched a bronze medal on Wednesday, had no such luck on Thursday though the mens lightweight four-oars without coxswain team comprising Mujeeb Rehman Kollakoddan, Ratheesh Kumar, Saji Thomas and Kasam Khan came close to a bronze medal by finishing fourth.

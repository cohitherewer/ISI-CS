				 	 Cairns: Needs to prove fitness																								Hamilton: New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns is expected to miss the start of the seven-match one-day series against India later this month, a team official said on Tuesday.																								Cairns had keyhole surgeries on his right knee twice this year and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) medical co-ordinator Warren Frost believes the player needs to prove his fitness in domestic cricket before returning to the international game.																								New Zealands domestic one-day competition begins on December 28 and Cairns would then be able to play up to five games for Canterbury before the fifth one-day International against India in Wellington on January 8.																								Eight days ago, Frost had been optimistic that the allrounder would be fit for the one-day series that begins in Auckland on December 26. Cairns had the first surgery in March and, after making a tentative comeback for his province Canterbury, had to undergo another earlier this month.																								But Frost said that there had been no complications from the second surgery and that the all-rounder had begun cycling and pool work at the weekend.																								ICC no to NZ plea																								The ICC has rejected New Zealands plea for more time to name the countrys World Cup squad. The ICC has announced that all 15-member squads must be named by December 31, by which time only two of New Zealands seven ODIs against India will have been played. (AGENCIES)

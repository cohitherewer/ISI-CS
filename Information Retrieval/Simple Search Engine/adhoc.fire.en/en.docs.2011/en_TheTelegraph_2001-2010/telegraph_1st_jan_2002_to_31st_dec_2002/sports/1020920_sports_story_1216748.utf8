The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 Nobody will get a raw deal: Patel
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Patel: For consistency in selection																								Calcutta: Had adjustments within the dominant Jagmohan Dalmiya-led group taken a different turn, Brijesh Patel would probably have been the Boards new joint-secretary.																								As it turned out, Thursday, Patel got the chairmanship of the senior selection committee.																								You dont always plan for everything At times, things just happen and, today, my responsibilities have grown, a smiling Patel, the super-efficient Karnataka secretary, told The Telegraph soon after his appointment at the Boards AGM here.																								Patel, who is also director of the Bangalore-located National Cricket Academy, will (for the time being) continue to hold that post. 																								Significantly, only Centrals Sanjay Jagdale retained his seat, with all four remaining slots getting first-time occupants: Kirti Azad (North), Pranab Roy (East), Kiran More (West) and, of course, Souths Patel.																								That Patel, a former India player and manager, would be on the panel was known late last night itself. That he would actually be the chairman became clear in the afternoon when West dumped Chandu Borde, chief selector for the past three years, and nominated More.																								[According to well-placed sources, the Cricket Club of India and Maharashtra wanted Borde to be retained, while Mumbai offered Dilip Vengsarkar as a candidate. Eventually, the views of Baroda (Mores home association), Gujarat and Saurashtra prevailed.																								That Vengsarkar already holds a Board position  chairman of the Talent Resource Development Wing  was used as an excuse to brush aside his candidature. Last year, too, Vengsarkar became a victim of manipulations. More than anything else, Mumbai comes off very poorly.] 																								To return to Patel, just about everybody agrees he was good enough for more than 21 Tests (between 1974 and 1978). In other words, there is unanimity that he got a raw deal.																								Having gone through the pain of first being sidelined and, then, ignored permanently, Patel insisted nobody would be treated unfairly. Frankly, I dont see why anybody should get a raw deal Personally, Im for consistency in team selection and dont favour a policy of chopping and changing.																								He quickly added: In any case, Team India has been doing well and, so, this business of effecting rapid changes shouldnt even arise The teams performance in England, especially, was pleasing. Today, we do have a stable team.																								The new selection committee chairman, however, admitted the bowling-arm of Team India  particularly the new-ball attack  needs to be looked at.																								Asked whether he would request Jawagal Srinath to again make himself available for Test cricket, Patel promptly answered: Yes, Ill speak to him once he returns from Leicester Ill try and persuade him...																								Being Bangalore-based, Patel has known Srinath for years. Moreover, generally, his rapport with cricketers past and present is excellent.																								Srinath, it may be recalled, quit the sports longer version after the Test series in the West Indies, which ended in the second-half of May.																								Incidentally, assignment No.1 for the newly-constituted panel will be to pick XIV for the West Indies tour-opener, in Bangalore, from October 4-6.																								At some stage in my career, Ive played against the co-selectors  including More. Therefore, quickly being on the same wavelength shouldnt be an issue Im looking forward to interacting with Kirti and the rest, Patel signed off.																								When the chief selector himself is clear about priorities, the committee cant go off course.

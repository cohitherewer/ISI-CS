																								Milan: Inter Milan coach Hector Cuper has hit back at Ronaldo after the Brazilian twice World Player of the Year said Cuper had almost ruined his career.																								World Cup winner Ronaldo, who left Inter for Real Madrid last month, said he was forced to play and train when unfit and was left out of the team when he was ready to play.																								But Cuper said that was simply not true.																								Last season, before sending Ronaldo on the field, I always consulted the medical team and the players personal trainer, Cuper told the daily Corriere della Sera. I always asked what would be the right thing to do. 																								Cuper said Ronaldos training routine was verifiable as Inter kept detailed records.																								The work that every player does in training, day by day, is recorded in his personal file and we have all the details to offer a complete framework of what was done with Ronaldo through the season, said Cuper.																								He said it would have made no sense for him to try to wreck Ronaldos recovery. 																								I really cant understand what reason I would have to ruin Ronaldo. It was always my dream to coach someone like him... only an idiot would think about ruining a player, said the Argentine coach.																								The striker said it was his poor relationship with Cuper that led him to request a move from Inter and contrasted his misery at Inter with his joyful World Cup where he finished top scorer with eight goals.																								But Cuper said he was not unduly worried about Ronaldos criticisms. (REUTERS)

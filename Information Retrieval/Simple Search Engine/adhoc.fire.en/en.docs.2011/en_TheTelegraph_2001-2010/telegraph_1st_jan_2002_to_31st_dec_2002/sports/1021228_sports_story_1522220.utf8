				 	 ROONEY: Now the youngest to be sent off																								London: On the day Wayne Rooney lost his record as the Premier Leagues youngest scorer, the Everton striker made a new mark as the youngest player to be sent off in the competitions history. 																								Sixteen-year-old midfielder James Milner eclipsed Rooneys scoring record with his equaliser for Leeds United in their 2-1 win at Sunderland on Thursday.																								Rooney was shown a straight red card in the 81st minute of his sides 1-1 draw at Birmingham City (as reported in Fridays Late City edition).																								Rooney had come on 15 minutes earlier as a substitute for scorer Tomasz Radzinski, and his tackle left Birmingham also down to 10 men as Vickers was unable to continue and later had eight stitches in the wound.																								Since blasting on to the scene as a 16-year-old with a brilliant goal in Evertons 2-1 victory over Arsenal in October, Rooney, now 17, has quickly earned a reputation not only as a talented striker but also a tough customer.

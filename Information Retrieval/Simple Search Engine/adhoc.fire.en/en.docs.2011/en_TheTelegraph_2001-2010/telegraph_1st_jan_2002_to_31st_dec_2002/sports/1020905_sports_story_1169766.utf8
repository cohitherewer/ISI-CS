The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, September 05, 2002  Javed Khan leads in two winners 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: On a cloudy and murky afternoon that also witnessed heavy rain mid-way through the six-event card, favourites struck a balance with the lesser fancied winners at the RCTC Wednesday. Three favourites and as many outsiders shared the spoils and very few people complained.				 										It was also the afternoons feature event, the 1,800m Hovercraft Cup, that saw an exciting finish fought between the joint-favourites  Anolini and No Regrets  with the final verdict going in favour of the later  a Javed Khan trainee. In fact, it was Javeds day and the trainer, helped by jockey Mark Reuben this time, led-in another winner, Grand Lodge, in the Goldliner Handicap. The big guns, on the other hand, failed. Always among doubles trebles and more, Daniel David scored a solitary win through a much improved Primaticcio, while Vijay Singhs three runners, including Anolini, proved good enough for place money only.

		 Monday, September 23, 2002 				 Lanka the real test: Warne
				 	 warne: Confident																								Colombo: Shane Warne feels Australia shouldnt be thinking about a final berth in the Champions Trophy right now  that the teams semi-final against Sri Lanka will be their toughest match.																								If we can beat Sri Lanka... I think we can win the whole thing, Warne said before heading to the Maldives with his team-mates.																								Sri lanka will be the hardest to beat over here, in their own back-yard, they know the conditions and play well in front of their home crowd.																								Warne has been quiet so far in the tournament, bowling just two balls against New Zealand for a dropped catch and wicket to finish the innings, and then bowling 10 overs against Bangladesh.But the leggie thinks he will be a handful in the semi-final which will be played at the spin-friendly Premadasa Stadium.																								Ive always done well in Sri Lanka, he said. The spinners can play a big role here in these conditions. I suppose Im one of the key bowlers for us.  (AP)

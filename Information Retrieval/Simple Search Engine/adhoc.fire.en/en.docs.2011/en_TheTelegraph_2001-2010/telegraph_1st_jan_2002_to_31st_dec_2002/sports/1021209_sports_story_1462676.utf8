		 Monday, December 09, 2002 				 Jeev tied for 33rd place
																								New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh battled hard against the elements and the tough stadium course to shoot his second successive level-par 72 on Day IV of the US PGA Tour qualifying school at La Quinta, California.																								According to information received here Sunday, Jeev was tied for the 33rd place at six-under 282 after four rounds. Two more rounds are to be played before the top-35 players get their cards for the lucrative US PGA Tour, which is offering close to $225 million in prize money in 2003 season.																								Englishman John Morgan fired a 3-under-par 69 to take the fourth round lead. At 15-under-par 273, Morgan holds a one-stroke advantage over Scott Laycock (66) and a two-stroke cushion over Anthony Painter (68). Brian Bateman (68), James McLean (70), David Sutherland (69) and Donnie Hammond (69) are tied for fifth place at 11-under-par 277.																								Third-round leader Dean Wilson (77), while still safely in the top-35, struggled to a 5-over-par 77 and is currently tied for 11th place. 																								Jeev began inauspiciously, making a bogey on his very first hole. He then recovered with a birdie on the third, and was even-par at the turn with another birdie on the fifth and a bogey on the fourth hole. On the back nine, Jeev had birdies on the 10th and 15th holes and a bogey on the 12th. However, a double bogey on the par-3 17th threatened to ruin his round, before he closed with a birdie on the final hole. 																								The birdie on the final hole was very important for my morale. I had a slight loss of concentration on the 17th and that resulted in the double bogey. At this stage, I cannot afford to make such mistakes, said the ace Indian golfer over phone from La Quinta.																								The final stage of the PGA Tour Q-school is being played at TPC Stadium course and the Jack Nicklaus tournament course.  (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 Subhamoy doubtful starter
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 SUBHaMOY: Waist injury																								Calcutta: Bengals performance in the first two Ranji Trophy matches were far from convincing, but things just seem to be getting better after the outright win over defending champions Railways, which was followed by a clean sweep in the East Zone one-dayers.																								The crucial Ranji Trophy tie begins in Hyderabad on Thursday and the mood in the Bengal camp is upbeat. Team spirit is high, our boys are all motivated and even the fact that we lost outright the last time we came here doesnt matter at all, said coach Sambaran Banerjee from Hyderabad on Wednesday.																								He informed that Alokendu Lahiri is certain to make the XI, though he will not open as he had done earlier, and come in the place of Subhradeep Ganguly at No. 6. Subhradeep, the cousin of India skipper Sourav, may just retain his place if Subhamoy Das doesnt recover from a waist injury.																								Subhamoy sustained the injury during practice today and an X-Ray will have to be done tonight. Otherwise, there will be no more changes to the team that beat Railways in Siliguri, the coach informed.																								He added that Rohan Gavaskar was down with slight fever and a sore throat, while Utpal Chatterjee suffered a knock on his bowling fingers during training on Tuesday. But these two are expected to be fit for the match.																								Banerjee, under whose captaincy Bengal won the title in 1989-90, said his team would go step by step and try to ensure one point before thinking of a win. Of course, two points will be great, but our initial aim is to secure first-innings lead.																								About the pitch, Banerjee said it was hard and firm and felt it would offer something to the quicker bowlers in the first couple of hours. The toss will be important, felt the coach.

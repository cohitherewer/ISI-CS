		 Sunday, September 29, 2002 				 Srinath will be back for WI Tests: Sourav
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jayasuriya																								Colombo, Sept. 28: The war of words betweenIndia and Sri Lanka has reached fever pitch. Sanath Jayasuriya off the blocks first when he said that though both sides batting was on even keel, his team enjoyed an edge in bowling since our attack is more balanced.																								 I certainly dont agree with that. We will find out which team is superior in due course. We have scored runs in different conditions this year and that is most important, was Sourav Gangulys riposte after morning nets.																								Meanwhile, Sourav backed his decision to call-up Srinath despite the presence of Ajit Agarkar. Its a 14-member squad and weve got to replace him (Nehra). Theres no question of not having faith in Agarkars abilities. 																								Sourav also informed that Srinath would be available for the Tests vs West Indies at home. Ive spoken to him and he has agreed to play Tests versus the West Indies.																								Previous requests from both the skipper and the selection committee had proved futile. 																								But then, what really prompted Srinaths change of heart this time? Probably, a change in the selection committee, quipped the Indian skipper.

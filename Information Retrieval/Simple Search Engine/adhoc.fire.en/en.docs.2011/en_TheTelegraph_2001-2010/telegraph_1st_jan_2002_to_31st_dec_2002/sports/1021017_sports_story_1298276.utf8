The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Bagan-Valencia tie advanced
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Mohun Bagans AFC Champions League second-round qualifier against Maldives Valencia has been advanced by a day. 																								According to club officials, the return-leg match, originally scheduled for next Wednesday, will now be played on Tuesday. Bagan leave for Maldives on Friday.																								Meanwhile, the AIFF has allowed Bagan to organise their home matches in the forthcoming National Football League on their own. Of the gate receipts, 15 per cent will have to be given to the AIFF. The matches will be organised by Celebrity Management Group.																								In another development, Bagans star medio George Ekeh has been advised rest for a few days after sustaining an injury during practice.																								Incidentally, Bagans NFL opener against Churchill Brothers in Goa on November 15 will have to be postponed if they progress in the next-round of the AFC Champions League. This is because the third-round qualifier falls on the same day. In that case, Bagan will kick-off against Vasco on November 19. 																								The Derby clash between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan will take place on December 5. The city giants will again face off in the return leg on on February 22. 																								Meanwhile, Somatai Shaiza will sign for Mohun Bagan on Thursday. He has been included in the squad following a request from Bhaichung Bhutia.																								However, the fate of Debjit Ghosh will be decided on Tuesday in the Players Status Committee meeting. Though none of the Bagan officials will be present (because they will be at Maldives), Debjit will be there along with the Mahindra officials.																								On the other hand, East Bengal start their campaign in the NFL on November 17 against Tollygunge Agragami. 																								However, all the teams playing in the League have been called for a meeting by the AIFF on November 1 where the final decision on the fixtures will be worked out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, September 07, 2002  Close finishes were order of day 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: The RCTC handicapper was a man quite pleased with himself after the Fridays race-meeting. Thanks to his arithmetic of weights, four of the six events in the afternoons card were decided with the help of camera to make the days fare an exiting one. Equally overjoyed were the racegoers who virtually had a field day with the favourites. Barring the main event, the Balam Cup, and the Mountain Lily Handicap, punters liked it all. 				 										It was Daniel Davids 5-1 outsider Arctic Fancy who downed the public-choice Alsheim virtually at the post. Amyn Merchant, who partnered the winner rode a very competent race. He had the Tecorno-Chinzi mare dropped out of contention early on and utilised her short burst of speed to catch S. Shanker napping on the Vijay Singh trainee. Vijay, however, opened his account in the following event through Midnight Escape.				 										 RESULTS				 										1. Sermon Handicap 1,100m: (2-4-3-1) Calabash (C.

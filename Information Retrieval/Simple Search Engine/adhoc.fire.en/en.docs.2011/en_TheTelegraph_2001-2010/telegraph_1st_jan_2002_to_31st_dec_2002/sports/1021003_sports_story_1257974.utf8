Irani Memorial Gold Cup  to be run over a 1,200m Sprint  a terms race for horses four-year-old and over.				 										Working brilliantly, Bold Chieftan may not find it hard to make it two-in-a-row here considering that he has had the better of exchanges against most of his rivals here and also in Bangalore. Al Habib and Days Of Glory may not put up a challenge at weights, but going by their Bangalore performences against the Chieftan B. Prakash may not be hard pressed to kick him home.

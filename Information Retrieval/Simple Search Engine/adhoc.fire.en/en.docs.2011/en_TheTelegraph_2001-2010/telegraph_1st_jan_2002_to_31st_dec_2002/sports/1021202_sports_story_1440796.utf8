																								Perth: England assistant coach Graham Dilley has told fast bowler Steve Harmison not to panic after the young fast bowler had severe problems with his run-up on the second day of the Ashes Test against Australia on Saturday.																								Dilley, a fast bowler who played in 41 Tests, took Harmison aside at lunch to try to settle the big 24-year-old from Durham.																								The youngster repeatedly lost his stride as he ran in to deliver the ball at the WACA ground and was forced to return to his bowling mark to repeat his approach to the wicket.																								Most bowlers have been there, Dilley said. It is very difficult to explain  I have been there myself  but what happens is that you just lose where you are.																								What I was trying to get across to Steve is that you dont panic. As quickly as the problem has come, so can it go away, as long as you stay calm and recognise that it is not such a big thing.																								The start of a run-up and the end points are exactly the same. It is just that your brain tells you things that physically you are unable to take on board. 																								It is not technical  it is purely mental. While I was talking to Steve, he said: I am buggered if I am going to give up. And he didnt, and I thought that was fantastic.																								The spirit he showed, having to go through all that, under the gaze of TV and 20,000-odd in the crowd, showed that he has an awful lot of determination to do well.																								It is very difficult for him to realise it at the moment, but eventually he will be quite pleased that he came through this. Harmison finished the Australian first innings with one for 86 from 28 overs. (AFP)

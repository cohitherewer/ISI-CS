The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, August 28, 2002 				 The job isnt over: Sourav
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Leeds: Sourav Ganguly isnt the only one superstitious. Now, the entire team has been influenced by the captain. So much so that a team dinner, to celebrate Indias biggest win overseas, got scrapped Monday.																								Well, everyone decided not to go out collectively... After all, we did that in Bulawayo, Kandy and Trinidad... Celebrated our victories there, but each time, lost the very next Test. This time, then, we decided to put everything on hold till The Oval, Sourav told The Telegraph Tuesday, before the teams departure for Derby.																								[India won the Bulawayo Test by eight wickets (Shiv Sundar Das MoM), the one in Kandy by seven wickets (Sourav MoM) and Trinidad by 37 runs (V.V.S. Laxman MoM). Yet, the ones immediately after each victory  Harare, Colombo and Barbados  ended in disaster.]																								Speaking on the morning after Indias finest hour overseas, Sourav emotionally remarked: Im absolutely thrilled... Perhaps, I didnt give that impression right after we won, but Im actually so thrilled... How often do we see such convincing wins? Then, whats remarkable is that everybody played a part. A captain cant ask for more.																								That, indeed, is correct. Its the collective effort from Team India which made the difference  with even the unheralded Sanjay Bangar contributing big. Yet, as Sourav quickly reminded, the job isnt over.																								Of course, its comforting that The Oval is known to favour spinners  Shane Warne, Phil Tufnell and Muttiah Muralidharan will confirm that  but, nothing, is being taken for granted. Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singhs hunger, though, should increase.																								In just two Tests, by the way, Kumble has emerged joint highest wickettaker in the series  with 13, he is at par with Matthew Hoggard, who has played all three matches.																								Looking back, yes, its a regret I didnt field both Anil and Bhajji at Lords... Its possible we wouldnt then have ended up losing. But, then, nobody expected the wicket to turn so much. We all learn from experience... Sourav, who never quite gets the credit he deserves, observed.																								[Only Kumble played at Lords, alongside three seamers: Zaheer Khan, Ajit Agarkar and Ashish Nehra.]																								Despite the huge (innings plus 46-run) victory at Headingley, Sourav still regards the stunning win over Australia at the Eden as the best of his 11 victories as captain. That was incredible... Trailing by 274 on the first innings and, then, not losing a wicket an entire day... Here, we were in command right through. It wasnt so at the Eden...																								More than anything else, the Headingley win has proved that the balance must always be right. Full marks, therefore, to Sourav and coach John Wright for exercising the Bangar-option. Now, the ball is in Bangars court to be consistent and, thereby, provide the thinktank room to manoeuvre.																								Incidentally, MoM Rahul Dravid is now the series No.1 run-getter. With a total of 385 (77.00 average), the Indian vice-captain is 12 runs in front of Michael Vaughan. Sachin Tendulkar has 347, while Sourav is exactly on 300. The only other Englishman in the 300-plus list is captain Nasser Hussain (305).																								Dravid, though, isnt one to ever go overboard. Im very happy I could contribute in the best manner possible... Its great we won, but this series isnt over, he pointed out. For Dravid, life isnt changing right now, but it could after The Oval.																								Boards no to Joshi, Bahutule																								Meanwhile, the Board has turned down a request from the team management to either allow Sunil Joshi and Sairaj Bahutule (playing in the Yorkshire league) to turn out in the three-dayer versus Derbyshire, beginning Wednesday, or to release two U-19 bowlers.																								The request, obviously, was made to allow all frontline bowlers a break before the decider at The Oval (from September 5).																								While the XI hasnt exactly been finalised, Sourav wont be playing. Sachin, Kumble and Zaheer Khan may also rest. Then, young Parthiv Patel is still in some pain. So, he has to be counted out.

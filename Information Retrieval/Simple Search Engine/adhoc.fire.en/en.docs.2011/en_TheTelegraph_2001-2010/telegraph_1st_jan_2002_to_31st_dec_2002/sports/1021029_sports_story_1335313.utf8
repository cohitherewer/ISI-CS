				 																																	Berlin: Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn got away with playing golf while nursing a thigh injury, but might have pushed it too far by also spending the night in a discotheque.				 																																	Playing golf and going to a disco are two different things, coach Ottmar Hitzfeld told reporters on Monday. There will be a fine for that. If you get injured, you must work on getting fit, and a visit to a disco is not necessary in that respect.				 																																	Hitzfeld had reacted calmly to a report that his skipper, who will miss Tuesdays Champions League Group G match at Deportivo Coruna because of the injury, had been seen playing golf on Saturday.				 																																	But the coachs mood changed after it emerged that the Germany captain had also been spotted in a disco the night before. Kahn tore a right thigh muscle in last weeks 1-2 defeat at AC Milan that left the four-time European champions at risk of not surviving the opening stage of the Champions League.				 																																	Munich: German prosecutors said on Monday that they would not file an appeal to toughen the sentence handed out to Boris Becker for tax evasion. A spokesman for the state prosecutors office in Munich said it would accept the two-year suspended sentence and fine given to Becker by a court last Thursday. The spokesman did not give a reason for the decision.				 																																	Prosecutors had originally demanded that Becker should be jailed for three and a half years, and when the sentence was handed down said they would consider an appeal.				 																																	Doha: Jansher Khan, who was given free membership by the Professional Squash Association (PSA), is now to be reported to it after going missing from the Qatar Classic.				 																																	Jansher, a record eight time World Open champion, is accused of offering no explanation for his non-appearance at the $120,000 event, which was to have been his first Super Series tournament for four years.				 																																	Jansher had been aided both by the PSA, so that he could continue his unexpected comeback, and by the Qatar Tennis and Squash Federation, so he could gain entry as a local player. But now he has upset some his supporters.				 																																	We have treated him as something other than an ordinary player, tournament director Robert Edwards said. And yet he doesnt turn up, gives us no reason Its not professional. 				 																																	Pine Mountain, Georgia: American Jonathan Byrd shot a final-round nine-under 63 on Sunday to grab his first PGA Tour title by winning the Buick Challenge by a one stroke over David Toms. Byrd finished at 27-under-261 for the meet, one stroke ahead of Toms, who closed with a 65. World No.2 Phil Mickelson finished third at 23-under, while Australians Craig Parry (69), Robert Allenby (65) and John Huston (70) tied for fourth at 22-under. 				 																																	Berlin: Hertha Berlins Bartosz Karwan faces a fine after turning up for a Bundesliga match without his shirt. The 26-year-old was told to get ready to come on as a late substitute in Saturdays 1-1 home draw with Bayer Leverkusen. 				 																																	But when he removed his club tracksuit, Karwan discovered all he had on was a plain white T-shirt, not his No. 13 jersey. Physiotherapist Joerg Drill offered to go to the locker room to fetch a shirt but coach Huub Stevens was so upset he ordered Karwan back to the bench and did not send him on.				 																																	n Tennis: Asian Championships, from 7.30 am on STAR Sports n Football: AFC U-17 championship, from 3.30 pm on STAR Sports n Football: Premier League, Southmpton vs Fulham from 2.00 pm, Bolton vs Sunderland from 5.00 pm and West Ham vs Everton from 12.30 am (Wednesday) on ESPN

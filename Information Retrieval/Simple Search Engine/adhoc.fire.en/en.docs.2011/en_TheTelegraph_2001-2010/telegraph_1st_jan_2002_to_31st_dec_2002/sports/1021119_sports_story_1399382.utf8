The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Agarkar, Sarandeep in; Sourav rested
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Vadodara: Reetinder Singh Sodhis return to the Indian one-day squad was no surprise, but the team selection meeting held on Monday for the last two games against the West Indies did spring a big surprise.																								Captain Sourav Ganguly opted out of the Jodhpur (November 21) and Vijayawada (November 24) games even with his team trailing 2-3 in the series.																								The skipper doesnt want to risk aggravating lower back injury sustained during the second Test in Chennai, said BCCI secretary S.K. Nair, after the 90-minute selection meeting that followed the fifth match of the ODI series.																								Sourav, however, will be fit for the upcoming tour of New Zealand and that is why he has been advised rest, informed the official. Rahul Dravid will lead the team in Souravs absence.																								Apart from Sodhi, others making the squad are seamer Ajit Agarkar and off-spinner Sarandeep Singh. Barring Sourav, those missing from the squad on duty here are Lakshmipathy Balaji and J.P. Yadav.																								While Sodhi and Sarandeep are returning to the squad after a gap, Agarkar is back after being dropped for the fourth and fifth games of the on-going series.																								THE SQUAD																								Rahul Dravid, Dinesh Mongia, Virender Sehwag, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Sanjay Bangar, Ajit Agarkar, Murali Kartik, Harbhajan Singh, Jawagal Srinath, Ashish Nehra, Reetinder Singh Sodhi, Sarandeep Singh, Parthiv Patel.																								BCA felicitations																								Meanwhile, the Baroda Cricket Association (Vadodara has not been applied here) felicitated former India players Vijay Hazare and D.K. Gaekwad during the lunch break of the match.

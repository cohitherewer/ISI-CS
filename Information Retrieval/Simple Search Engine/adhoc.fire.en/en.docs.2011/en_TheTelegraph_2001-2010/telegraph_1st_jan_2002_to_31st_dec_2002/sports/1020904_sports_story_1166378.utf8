 (PTI) 																								Dubai: Former BCCI president I.S. Bindra feels that his rival Jagmohan Dalmiya is strong enough to take on the neo-colonial forces unleashed by the ICC.																								Knowing Dalmiya for more than two decades, I am quite certain he is fully equipped and competent to take on the vested interests and the forces of neo-colonialism as effectively as we had done from 1980-96 jointly.																								Asked whether he felt the BCCI chief was isolated in the recent ICC meeting here, Bindra said he was surprised the full members from Asia did not support Indias stand.																								BCCI, in 2000, had taken a stand vis-a-vis ICC just prior to the last ICC knockout tournament in Kenya, stipulating that India would not participate unless a substantial part of the profits from the tournament was devolved upon Asian Cricket Council on the ground that almost 80 per cent of the sponsorship and television rights revenue was generated from India. 																								The present situation is not different and, therefore, it is quite shocking that our Asian colleagues have not supported Dalmiyas stand in the ICC, Bindra said. 																								Emphasising that he had full faith in Dalmiyas ability to sort out the vexed issue, Bindra said, I think all cricket lovers in India and Asia have to strengthen Dalmiyas hands to take on the forces of neo-colonialism.																								I have no doubt that Dalmiya will be successful in protecting the bonafide interest of the Indian players vis-a-vis the exploitative global conglomerates who are trying to take over the world cricket at the cost of India and its players.

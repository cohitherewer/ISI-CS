		 Sunday, August 25, 2002 				 Ronaldo avoids angry fans on return to Italy
																								Milan, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Ronaldo returned to Italy from Brazil on Saturday but slipped home unseen avoiding about 100 weary Inter Milan fans waiting at the airport with demands for an apology after he said he wanted leave the club.																								Ronaldo, now you have to tell us you are sorry, read one banner held up by fans at Malpensa airport, outside Milan.																								If he still wants to be our hero he has to say sorry to all of us, said one embittered fan. But Ronaldo, returning after playing just 33 minutes for the world champions in their 0-1 defeat by Paraguay in a friendly on Wednesday, kept a low profile and stepped off the plane straight into the car of Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti.																								After stopping briefly at Inters training ground in Lombardy, where he reportedly spoke with Moratti, Ronaldo left through a side exit at about 6.00 p.m. (0400 GMT) to avoid the media and headed home, the Italian news agency, ANSA, said.

				 																																	Mumbai: Mark Philippoussis, who has nine ATP championship titles to his credit, on Monday confirmed his participation in the $400,000 Tata Open 2003 championships, scheduled to be held in Chennai from December 30 to January five.				 																																	Speaking at over the telephone from San Diego in the US, the Australian said he was really looking forward to playing in India.				 																																	I have heard great things about the tournament through other players and hopefully I can get a good start to the New Year at the Tata Open in Chennai, he said.				 																																	London: Manchester United captain Roy Keane goes before the English FA on Tuesday to fight two disrepute charges relating to his controversial autobiography.				 																																	The 31-year-old Irishman, who is currently recovering from hip surgery, could face a lengthy ban and heavy fine over comments he made in his book about an incident with Manchester Citys Alf Inge Haaland in a game in April 2001.				 																																	The FA have charged Keane on two counts. The first relates to the claim that he said he deliberately set out to injure Haaland as an act of revenge. The second addresses the question of Keane publishing an account of the incident for financial reward. Keane denied both charges. 				 																																	Rome: AC Milan striker Filippo Inzaghi has been ruled out of Wednesdays European championship qualifier against Wales because of a foot injury and also looks doubtful to return to Italian league action at the weekend. The forward aggravated a foot injury during Italys 2004 Euro 2004 qualifier against Yugoslavia on Saturday and is struggling to be fit for his clubs weekend Serie A match against Atalanta.				 																																	I played against Yugoslavia in pain, a pain thats now making it difficult to walk. I cant put my foot on the ground, he was quoted as saying in the Corriere Dello Sport newspaper on Monday. To continue playing would be an enormous risk. I dont want to make the same mistake I made when I was at Juventus and a slight groin strain ended up in a two-month layoff. 				 																																	Madrid: Deportivo Coruna goalkeeper Jose Molina will be giving up football for an indefinite period after he was diagnosed as suffering from testicular cancer, he said on Monday. The 32-year-old said he would be returning to his home city of Valencia to receive treatment for a malignant tumour that had been detected in a routine medical test last week.				 																																	Molina underwent an operation on a testicle lump in June last year, which until the recent test was thought to be benign.				 																																	Rome: Italy coach Giovanni Trapattoni has rejected calls for his resignation ahead of his sides European Championship qualifier against Wales on Wednesday. 				 																																	Italys lacklustre 1-1 draw with Yugoslavia on Saturday provoked a storm of criticism and calls for the return of Trapattonis predecessor, Dino Zoff.				 																																	The truth is that you journalists would like to change the coach every two months, he was quoted as saying in La Gazzetta dello Sport on Monday. 				 																																	When I was 40, I reacted to results differently. Now Im calm, I sleep at night, I dont see ghosts. 				 																																	Trapattonis popularity is at rock bottom after winning just two out of his last nine matches in charge, including a humiliating 1-0 loss in a friendly against Slovenia in August.				 																																	n General: Best of Harsha Online, from 8.00 am and 4.00 pm on STAR Sports n Cricket: Legends of cricket from 8.30pm on STAR Sports n Soccer: Futbol Mundial from 6.3pm on STAR Sports

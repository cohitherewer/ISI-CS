		 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 Pakistan plan to dismiss Mudassar
																								Islamabad: The Pakistan team is set to get their eighth coach in five years if the countrys cricket board implements its plans to hire a foreign coach to replace Mudassar Nazar before next years World Cup.																								The changes in the team management look imminent after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) assigned the task of searching for a foreign coach to cricketer-turned-commentator Rameez Raja during the triangular series in Nairobi.																								Rameez has reportedly been asked to get a new person to be at the helm of affairs before the team embarks on a twin tour of Zimbabwe and South Africa in November. 																								Pakistan play four Tests and 10 one-day Internationals in Zimbabwe and South Africa until January 6 before taking on Australia on February 9 in their opening World Cup fixture in Johannesburg. 																								The latest development is the fallout of the differences between Mudassar, himself a former cricketer, and senior players of the team including captain Waqar Younis on several issues including composition of the team, media reports said here Tuesday. Pakistan team manager Yawar Saeed is also likely to get the boot for spoiling the sides harmony and unity.																								The PCB is on the lookout for a coach who would be willing to work in Pakistan despite foreign teams reluctance to visit here because of security fears, , the report in local daily Dawn said. 																								Before the African tour, Pakistan will play the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka beginning Thursday and a three-Test series against Australia in Sharjah and Colombo next month.																								The differences between Younis and Mudassar surfaced during the Asian Test Championship final against Sri Lanka. It turned serious during the Nairobi triangular which resulted in a string of poor performances by the team.																								Prior to the last two games in Nairobi, Younis even conducted the teams practice and training and Mudassar was sidelined, the report said. The Pakistan team management faced accusations of poorly handling the squad and playing musical chairs with the openers. In nine matches, no less than half a dozen different combinations were tried while explosive batsman Shahid Afridi was shifted down the order.																								If Mudassar is shown the door, he will be the seventh coach in less than five years to get the axe. Previously, Haroon Rasheed, Javed Miandad (twice), Richard Pybus (twice), Mushtaq Mohammad and Intikhab Alam failed to complete their tenures. (PTI)

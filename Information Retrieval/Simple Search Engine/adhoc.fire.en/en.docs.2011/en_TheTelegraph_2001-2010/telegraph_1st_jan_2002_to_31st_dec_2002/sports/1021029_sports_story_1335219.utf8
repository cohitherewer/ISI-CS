The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 Witness to decadence
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: There may be an air of decadence looming large over West Indies cricket at present, but one man still stands tall among the ruins, a living link with its glorious past.																								Lester Armoogam has been a witness to Caribbean crickets ups and downs in a breathtaking stand of 118 Tests since 1969, when he first started cheering the West Indians from the stands. 																								When I see the present it pains me. But I have so many memories to cherish and I believe we must get back to where we were once, said the 62-year old Monday, during his maiden visit to Eden Gardens. 																								The youngsters are interested only in donning the national blazer but they lack the attitude and discipline, says the portly man, fondly called Uncle Les by the current Windies cricketers.																								He has a grandson, named after Sachin Tendulkar. But he does not play cricket, he is interested in basketball, Armoogam said.

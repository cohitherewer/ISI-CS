																								Harare: Thundershowers and bad light caused the first of three one-day Internationals between Zimbabwe and Kenya to be abandoned Sunday.																								Zimbabwe were 18 for one after Kenya were all out for 211.																								The match was later declared a no result leaving Zimbabwe unbeaten in eight years against their African near-neighbours but frustrated at a missed opportunity to recover from their recent 5-0 series hiding by Pakistan.

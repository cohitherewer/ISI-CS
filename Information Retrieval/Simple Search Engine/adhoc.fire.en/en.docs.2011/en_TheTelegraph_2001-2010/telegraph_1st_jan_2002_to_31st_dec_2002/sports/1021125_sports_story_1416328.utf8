The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, November 25, 2002 				 Well have to play the way we did at Trent Bridge and Headingley: Wright
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 John Wright																								Vijayawada: For John Wright, the upcoming tour of New Zealand wont be like any other. The former captain, after all, will be landing as Indias coach. And, after years in the home teams dressing-rooms, across New Zealand, he will now have a seat in the ones earmarked for visiting sides.																								Wright, who has just completed two years as India coach, spoke to The Telegraph at the team hotel (DV Manor) here Saturday evening. Pressed for time, he could largely only answer New Zealand-specific queries.																								The following are excerpts																								On his thoughts just before the start of Indias tour of New Zealand																								Ill be very happy if we can play good cricket... In fact, Ive already begun asking players to do me a favour by producing consistently good cricket. In some ways, its going to be special... People Ive grown up with will, after all, see me in a new role.																								On whether there will be mixed emotions																								(Smiles) Not where Im concerned. Indeed, Im part of a professional sport... If I was involved with New Zealand, I would want them to win. Today, Im associated with India and, so, would like Souravs team to win. Ive been working hard... Ive been going through the same highs and lows... Ive felt the pressure, rejoiced in moments of triumph... My emotions, then, simply cant be mixed... I cant have divided loyalties.																								On why visiting teams generally find the going tough in New Zealand																								Because, by and large, wickets seam... You could get the odd good wicket but, with the ball moving about quite a bit, its not easy. Then, it can get very cold and windy and wet. Its demanding.																								On what will remain a priority for the Indians																								Working hard, no question about that... Specifically, the task for our seamers will be cut out... I do see an opportunity for us in the Test series. As for the one-dayers, one would like to play tough cricket in the lead-up to the World Cup. Clearly, New Zealand will be very competitive. Much is at stake, isnt it?																								On whats required for a team to be successful in New Zealand																								Quite simple: Big scores. Well have to play the way we did at Trent Bridge and Headingley.																								On New Zealand crickets top strength																								Playing as a team and playing tenaciously... They hang around and dont give up. Without going into too many details, its quite evident that they bat till low down and, in recent times, Bond has been quite a find. Having said that, we do have the skill and talent to beat New Zealand.																								On whether, in the past decade, New Zealand cricket has improved																								The one-day team, certainly, is better... Purely in terms of organisation, I think its more professional. (Adds after a pause) New Zealand is a small country and, so, theres always the desire to do well versus the bigger nations. We had that feeling when I was playing and, Im sure, that continues. We always wanted to prove a thing or two when up against the superstars... Always wanted to prove a point. More than anything else, this attitude has helped New Zealand script a few surprises.																								On the ODIs versus the West Indies																								No one likes losing, but we did learn some hard lessons. Looking back, on the eve of the decider, we werent hungry enough in the series-opener (Jamshedpur) and, frankly, ought never to have lost after putting 283 (for six) on board. At the same time, the series seems to have solved one or two of our problems, one or two questions appear to have got answered. Its surely been a help towards getting the right personnel for South Africa. Bangar? He responded under pressure and hasnt done his (World Cup) chances any harm.																								On character and passion, key attributes in his book																								This team has both. At the same time, I dont wish to dismiss the contribution of the others Ive worked with. The Samir Dighes, for instance. Today, the youngsters have gained in confidence and, for any side, thats a big thing.																								On two years as India coach																								(Emotionally) We are on the right track and I must place on record the excellent work being put in by (physio) Andrew and (trainer) Adrian... Whats the biggest difference between now and November of 2000? Well, the boys are proud to be Indians and wont give up without letting fly all the ammunition. Theyve become fighters and dont get intimidated. (After a pause) What we do lack, though, is a bunch of quality fast bowlers... Basically, we need a pool of ten... That will ensure healthy competition and encourage better performances. If you ask me, we need to analyse the present system and, then, work out ways of unearthing fast bowlers. Im convinced some are around.																								Finally, if it comes to that, whether he will be comfortable having a specialist bowling coach as part of the support team																								Getting specialists isnt a bad idea. Yet, at the same time, you need to get the right person... Somebody who will fit into the support team as it exists. You cant make ad-hoc appointments and, personally, I havent asked for a bowling coach. In case I do, Ill first make a presentation to Mr Dalmiya. In fact, theres been no communication on this.

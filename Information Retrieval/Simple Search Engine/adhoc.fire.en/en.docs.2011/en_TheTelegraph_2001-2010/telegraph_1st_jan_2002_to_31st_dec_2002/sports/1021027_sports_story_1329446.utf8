		 Sunday, October 27, 2002 				 Becker may face another tax probe
																								Berlin, Oct. 26 (AFP): Boris Becker, having escaped jail on Thursday on tax evasion charges, may face another probe, media reports said Saturday.																								According to news magazine Focus, the German authorities are after back payment of 3 million euros covering 1985 to 1991.																								The magazine alleges the missing contributions cover false contracts between the multi Grand Slam champion and companies of his former manager Ion Tiriac.																								On Thursday, Becker was handed a two-year suspended sentence for failing to pay 1.7 million euros in tax between 1991 and 1993, a period when he claimed Monte Carlo as his residence while spending most of his time in Munich where he was taxable.																								l Santosh Trophy report: Page 15

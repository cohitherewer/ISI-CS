				 																																	Leeds: French international Olivier Dacourt was fined by Leeds United on Wednesday for comments about the Premier League team and manager Terry Venables.				 																																	Dacourt had been quoted in France Football magazine last week as saying that the team, which Terry Venables took over this season, was a disgrace after a poor run of form left them in the 16th position in the 20-strong league.				 																																	He added in the article that his relationship with Venables was distant and later his agent, Bruno Satin, was reported on BBC Online as saying Dacourt would leave if the manager remained at Elland Road. Venables responded by docking the 28-year-old an undisclosed amount of his wages. 				 																																	Verbier (Switzerland): Swiss junior downhill champion Werner Elmer has died after colliding with a course maintenance worker during a downhill race, police said. The 19-year-old died at the scene of the accident in on Tuesday afternoon despite immediate intervention by at least four doctors. The injuries to the employee were undisclosed, but he was taken by helicopter to a nearby hospital, police said.				 																																	Course director Jean-Philippe Rochat said Elmer had been the first of the male competitors down the course and that the employee was still preparing the run when the racer came down. 				 																																	London: South African allrounder Andrew Hall has been signed by English country cricket side Worcestershire as one of their two overseas players for 2003, the club announced on Wednesday.				 																																	The 27-year-old made his Test debut for South Africa earlier this year against Australia and will be joined at Worcestershire by an international fast bowler, who the county cannot name yet due to a confidentiality clause.				 																																	Barcelona: The two-match ground ban handed to Barcelona for the crowd violence in last months game against Real Madrid is down to a media campaign against them, club general secretary Josep Maria Coronas said on Wednesday.				 																																	The Spanish Football Federations competition committee ordered on Tuesday the closure of the Nou Camp for two games and fined the club 4,000 euros ($4,037) for the incidents that held up the Real game for almost 15 minutes.				 																																	Coronas said the club would not decide if they were going to appeal until they had had a chance to study the verdict. But in a strongly worded response, Coronas argued that media pressure had made it impossible for the case to be dealt with impartially. 				 																																	Mannheim: German investigators raided the house and offices of International Olympic Committee vice-president Thomas Bach on Tuesday, they announced.				 																																	Mannheim prosecutor Hubert Jobski said the searches were in relation to alleged tax fraud and abuse of confidence at the Tauberbischofsheim Fencing Club where Bach was a leading official. Bach was an Olympic gold medallist at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The raids were linked to the probe opened against former German national fencing coach and a former president of the club, Emil Beck.				 																																	Bilbao: Athletic Bilbao midfielder Carlos Gurpegi has tested positive for a metabolite of the banned steroid nandrolone, the Basque club said on Tuesday. Bilbao said they had been informed by the Spanish football federation that the player tested positive for 19-norandrosterone after their seasons first league match at Real Sociedad on September 1.				 																																	n Soccer, Premier League from 12 noon on STAR Sports n Cricket, India in New Zealand: First Test, Day I highlights, 2.00 pm and 5.00 pm on STAR Sports n Soccer: Champions League, highlights, 4.30 pm and 9.00 pm on ESPN n Cricket, India in New Zealand: First Test, Day II, live from 3.25 am (Thursday) on STAR Sports

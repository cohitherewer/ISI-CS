(AFP)																								Thomastown (Ireland): Tiger Woods fired a second successive round of seven-under-par 65 to strengthen his grip on the WGC-American Express Championship on Friday, moving two strokes clear of the elite 64-man field.																								The 1999 champion, one shot ahead overnight after a course-record 65, collected seven birdies in a blemish-free display to finish at 14-under 130 in calm conditions at Mount Juliet.																								Bidding to win the sixth World Golf Championship (WGC) title of his career, Woods was in unflappable mood, finding fairways and greens with regularity.																								Fellow-American Jerry Kelly was alone in second place at 12-under 132 after reeling off eight birdies and one bogey for a course-record equalling 65.																								A further stroke back, in a tie for third, were David Toms and fellow-American Steve Lowery, who both carded 67s, while Retief Goosen carded a second 67 to lie fifth at 10 under.																								Ernie Els was another shot back in a share of sixth, his 67 drawing him level with Australias Stuart Appleby (66) and Englands Gary Evans (68). David Duval was level with seven others, including Davis Love III (67) and Vijai Singh of Fiji (69). (REUTERS)

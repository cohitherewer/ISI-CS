		 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 Bengal look ahead after washout on final day
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: With the final day of their Ranji match against Rajasthan being washed out, Sambaran Banerjee couldnt hide his disappointment.																								Under the new rule, weve nothing to show for from our efforts... Now everything has to start from scratch, the Bengal coach lamented.																								Not a ball could be bowled Tuesday as the Eden Gardens resembled a waterpolo venue and umpires M.R. Singh and Vineet Gupta had no hesitation calling off play first thing in the morning. 																								Rajasthan were 200 for three Monday in reply to Bengals 413.																								The Bengal thinktank is contemplating a change in plan for the next match against Himachal Pradesh starting Sunday, with the focus shifting from pace to spin. 																								It was learnt that the team management isnt keen to have the pitch rolled for the next few days so that the soil loosens up.																								One pace bowler is likely to make way for a spinner. As of now, left-arm spinner Murtaza Lodhgar will come in for Shibshankar Paul.																								The Rajasthan team also felt they lost a chance to get off to a good start. 																								Bengal is a big team and we were in a good position, captain P. Krishnakumar said.																								He pointed out a few positives to come out of the rain-curtailed match. Our debutant pacemen did a commendable job. The batting also looked good, he added.																								Rajasthans next match is against Railways in Jaipur.																								Match Referees report																								Bengals complaint against umpires Gupta and Singh hasnt fallen on deaf ears. Match Referee Rajeev Shukla will mention about the umpiring in his report to the BCCI. It was learnt that Shukla wasnt at all happy with the way Doru and Krishnakumar were given not out when they looked clearly out.

A neat header from North Korea substitute Hong Yong-jo drew gasps in the 69th minute but was ruled offside.																								South Korea keeper Lee was one of six players from the South Korea side that finished fourth in World Cup in June, the best by an Asian side in the tournaments 72-year history.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, December 29, 2002 				 Mumbai pack off Bengal for 190
				 	 ROHAN: Fighting 52																								Mumbai, Dec. 28 (PTI): Mumbai spinners Sairaj Bahutule and Ramesh Powar skittled out Bengal for a paltry 190 in their first innings on the opening day of the group A Ranji Trophy elite group match at Wankhede Stadium Saturday.																								Mumbai too lost an early wicket, of Vinayak Mane, to reach three for one at stumps.																								After losing the toss, Bengal were in trouble straightaway, losing Deep Dasgupta with 22 runs on the board. The former India wicketkeeper was trapped leg-before by another former international and Mumbai skipper Paras Mhambrey.																								Bengal plunged into deeper trouble with Robin Morris too getting into the act. He dismissed Amitava Chakraborty with the total reading 30.																								But Bengal suffered a body blow four runs later, when the in-form Devang Gandhi was dismissed by Mhambrey. The former India opener, in good nick this season, managed just four.																								Rohan Gavaskar (52 off 91 balls) and Subhomoy Das (40 off 82) added 72 for the fourth wicket. It was a big test for Rohan, playing in his home ground, and he salvaged some grace by stroking a half-century.																								However, Once Bahutule got rid of Rohan and Powar accounted for Das in quick succession, the Bengal innings was once again in a shambles despite Utpal Chatterjee making a fighting 27 off 65 balls with two fours.																								Apart from Bahutule and Powar, Mhambrey (two for 31), Morris (one for 25) and debutant Rajesh Verma (one for 60) were the successful bowlers. 																								Bengals Ranadeb Bose returned some of the compliment and had Mane caught by Deep behind the stumps for a duck.

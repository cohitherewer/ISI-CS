																								Margao, Dec. 7 (PTI): Vasco overcame Goan champions Salgaocar 1-0 Saturday to register their third successive win in the National Football League.																								Vasco have 10 points from five matches and host Mahindra United on Wednesday. Salgaocar, who suffered their second defeat, have seven from five games.																								Vasco started aggressively and scored in the fifth minute. Menino Fernandes found Rui Wanderley Weis with an accurate pass from the centre. The Brazilian controlled the ball before essaying a rasping drive that beat Juje Siddi all ends up.																								The early goal gave Vasco the confidence to attack with renewed vigour. In the 18th minute, Wanderley failed to connect a Marcos cross from the left. The ball rolled to the unmarked Peter Rodrigues, who failed to score from close range.																								Soon after, Marcos himself had a chance to score but his chip from inside the box missed the target narrowly.																								Salgaocar did put some pressure but the Vasco defenders marked strikers Dudu and Sunday Seah efficiently. Salgaocar tried the long-passing game to no avail as Selwyn Fernandes and Seby Dias stood firm.																								Salgaocar were not allowed a single clear look at the Vasco goal in the first half. The introduction of Climax Lawrence in place of Dennis Cabral helped Salgaocar as their midfield started functioning well.																								ITI, JCT draw																								In Bangalore, local outfit ITI held JCT Mills, Phagwara, to a goalless draw.																								Both ITI and JCT went all out for their first win, but things did not quite work out well for them at the Bangalore Football Stadium. They have two points each from five outings.																								Hardip Gill had a good chance for JCT towards the end of the first half but his shot was off the mark. Soon after the breather, Hardeep Saini came up with a superb effort but the ball hit the bar and went out.

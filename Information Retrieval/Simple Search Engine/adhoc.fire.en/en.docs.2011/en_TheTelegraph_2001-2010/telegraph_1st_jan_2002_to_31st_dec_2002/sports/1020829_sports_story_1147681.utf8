The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 An extra silver for Indians 
 (AP)																								Lagos: A bit of what India lost through Sateesh Rai in weightlifting, was regained Wednesday when Nigerian wrestler Victor Kodei failed a drug test to lose the silver medal he won in the Commonwealth Games in Manchester. 																								That disqualification means Anil Kumar of India, who placed third in 96kg class behind Kodei, will now receive the silver.																								Kodei, the eight-time African champion, faces a two-year ban that is likely to mean the end of his 15-year career, Nigeria Olympic Committee spokesman Tony Nezianya said. He tested positive, but we dont know for what drug, Nezianya said.

		 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 No mercy for Bangla, says Boucher
																								East London: Mark Boucher has warned Bangladesh to brace themselves for the full brunt of South Africas assault in the first Test, which starts in East London on Friday.																								Bangladesh have played 13 Tests, and the only one they have not lost was a rain-affected draw against Zimbabwe in Dhaka last year. However, South African captain Boucher declined to accept that his team stood on the brink of an emphatic victory.																								Youve got to respect their international status, and we want to show the same ruthlessness against them that we would show against any other side, Boucher said.																								We dont expect any favours when we go to the sub-continent, and we want to make it difficult for them in our conditions. We want to bowl at them on bouncy pitches, for instance.																								Broader South African interest in the match would seem to concern individual performances. (Reuters)

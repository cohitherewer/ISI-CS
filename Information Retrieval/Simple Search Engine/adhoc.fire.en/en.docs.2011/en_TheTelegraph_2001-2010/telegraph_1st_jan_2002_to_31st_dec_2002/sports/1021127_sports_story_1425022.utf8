The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 A big test for Klusener
																								Johannesburg: South Africa allrounder Lance Klusener has one last chance to prove his value to the side in the five-match one-day International series against Sri Lanka starting at the Wanderers on Wednesday.																								Klusener, Player of the Tournament at the 1999 World Cup, has failed to reach similar heights in the past two seasons and his place is in doubt for the forthcoming World Cup.																								He was dropped for the recent one-day series against Bangladesh and struggled for form during the Morocco Cup.																								We know what he is capable of doing so its not a case of him having to prove his ability, but he has to show form with the World Cup looming, South Africa coach Eric Simons said.																								South Africa will miss Jonty Rhodes who was ruled out due to a hamstring injury.																								South Africa defeated Sri Lanka 2-0 in the Test series but lost three successive one-day matches to the same opponents at the Morocco Cup.																								They are better in one-day cricket in our conditions and they have a tried and tested line-up, Simons said. They have some destructive batsmen who showed in the Tests they will play aggressively.																								Sri Lanka have been boosted by the inclusion of Aravinda de Silva, who has played 288 one-day Internationals.																								De Silva is confident that Sri Lanka can win the series on South African soil. (Reuters)

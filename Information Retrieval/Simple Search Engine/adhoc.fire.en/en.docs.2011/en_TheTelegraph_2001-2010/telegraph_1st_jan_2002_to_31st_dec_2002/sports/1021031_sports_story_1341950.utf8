		 Thursday, October 31, 2002 				 Burgers, drinks and a weighty problem
				 	 RONALDO: Allegedly 7 kg overweight																								Madrid: Having won the World Cup and overcome a series of career-threatening injuries, Brazilian superstar Ronaldo is facing a new battle  conquering his love of hamburgers and fizzy drinks.																								The Brazilian is seven kilos overweight, screamed Spanish sports daily Marca Wednesday.																								The Real Madrid doctors have imposed a diet but its forgotten the minute he feels like hamburgers and sodas.																								Ronaldo made his debut for the Spanish giants on October 6 scoring twice in a 5-2 win over Alaves.																								However, since then he has struggled failing to find the net. Marca pointed out that he has gone 307 minutes without a goal while his team has lurched from one mediocre performance to another with a 1-2 defeat to Racing Santander as well as a 2-2 draw against AEK Athens and a 1-1 draw with Villarreal.																								Physically I am not one-hundred per cent, said Ronaldo. I have to rediscover my confidence. I need patience and some peace.																								He was interviewed by a TV channel after Sundays match but refused to be weighed when a scales was brought on to the set.																								Ronaldos weighty problem has become a major talking point in Spain. 																								Recently, Reals sporting-director Jorge Valdano admitted that the strikers extra few pounds were a problem and that they were not ideal for a top level sporting career.																								On October 11, the player himself admitted the situation was not ideal.																								I am not at my weight. I am 87 kg, one more than I was at the World Cup. Eighty-six kg is my ideal weight.																								However, the Brazilian is officially listed as weighing 82 kg and former national coach Luiz Felipe Scolari admitted after the World Cup, where Ronaldo finished top scorer with eight goals, that the star would always struggle with his weight.																								He had difficulties maintaining his proper weight and will never be 100-per cent again because of his two right knee operations, Scolari had said. (AFP)

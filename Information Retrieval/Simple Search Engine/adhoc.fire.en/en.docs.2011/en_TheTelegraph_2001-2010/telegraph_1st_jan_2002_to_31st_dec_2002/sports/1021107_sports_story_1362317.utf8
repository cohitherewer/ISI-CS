The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, November 07, 2002 				 My batting is influenced by my role in the team: Shivnarine Chanderpaul
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 CHANDERPAUL: Im the sort to admire fighters 																								Jamshedpur: Shivnarine Chanderpaul is surely a West Indian with a difference, both on and off the field. A key player for some years, the 32-year-old (top-scorer during the just-ended Test series) spoke to The Telegraph at The Regent Tuesday evening. 																								The following are excerpts																								On the early influences																								Growing up, I hardly got to see any big-time cricket and, in any case, I dont recall live telecasts. And, so, the biggest influences were my father (Khemraj) and chacha (Munilal). Both were very enthusiastic cricketers. While my father was a specialist batsman, my chacha was a wicketkeeper. Both, incidentally, were right-handers.																								On his idol																								(Grins) Because I hardly saw big-time cricket, I didnt have one... However, my father was keen that I be like Alvin Kallicharran. 																								On almost a decade of international cricket																								Its been decent, but I could have done better... Indeed, I should have.																								On why he hasnt done as well as he should have																								Injuries have definitely played a part... Being in and out, obviously, is never helpful. 																								On getting the first of his six Test hundreds after almost three years																								(Grins again) Dont know why... Was I relieved when I did get that maiden hundred (against India, in 1996-97)? Absolutely, it was a weight off my shoulders. The pressure was off...																								On what has he learnt in nearly a decade of international cricket																								That one has to be committed, that one must be disciplined  on and off the field. Also, that one must have that hunger and determination. 																								On whether he sets goals																								I dont, for the simple reason you never know whats going to happen tomorrow. 																								On being labelled a grafter																								My batting is influenced by my role in the team  which currently is that of a stayer. Given a chance, though, I can accelerate. In fact, whatever the role, Im comfortable. An individual is only one of 11 in a team, therefore he has to mould his game according to its requirements.																								On his approach to batting																								The same as the other batters... Get a start and, then, build on it.																								On whether he envies any one batsman																								Oh no... One shouldnt be jealous or envious... Everybody has some talent and the individual in question should make the most of that. Nobody can ever stop you from getting better. 																								On whether he admires any one contemporary																								Im not going to take names, but Im the sort to admire fighters... Guys who will give everything to get the team out of a sticky situation. 																								On whether the high expectations have been putting him under more than the customary pressure																								Everybody is under pressure, Im not the only one... Besides needing to improve generally, we do need to work hard on the fielding. Our lapses cost us heavy during the Test series.																								On his phenomenal concentration																								Actually, its not easy, not when you are playing at the Eden... The crowd, the noise... Its a huge test... Personally, Ive been helped by God and meditation. My Guruji (Vidyanandji Maharaj) has given some mantras and, at times, Ive even meditated on the field. Essentially, its remembering the mantras. Thats true meditation.																								On whether he is conscious of averages																								Wouldnt say so but, yes, I do look to improving. A batsman shouldnt stagnate.																								On the future																								Dont know... I take things as they come as, really, who knows what will happen tomorrow or next week? 																								On interests outside cricket																								But, wheres the time? If I do manage some, I would love to catch up on studies... After all, because of cricket, I couldnt even complete my schooling. 																								On heroes outside cricket																								My Guruji... Hes made a difference to my life. 																								On who is most religious in his family																								Everybody... From a very early age itself, my father and mother (Uma) instilled in me that one must believe in and have faith in Lord Shiva. Its been so since. (Adds after a pause) My wife (Amy) also worships Shiva. Did we have a traditional Hindu wedding? We did, with the priest taking centrestage.																								Finally, on his emotions every time he tours India																								That Lord Shiva is from these parts makes me feel good... Theres that bonding with God... Then, our roots are somewhere in India.

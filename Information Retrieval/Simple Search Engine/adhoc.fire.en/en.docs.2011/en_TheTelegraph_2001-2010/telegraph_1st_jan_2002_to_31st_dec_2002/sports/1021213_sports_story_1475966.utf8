The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 Maiden quarters entry for Indians 
																								Chennai: Riding on superb efforts from Siddarth Suchde and Saurav Ghosal, India made history storming into the quarter finals with a 3-0 victory over Scotland in the team event of the 12th world junior squash champiosnship for men here today. 																								Going into the match in a do-or-die situation with both teams having one win and one loss each in the four-team pool D, Suchde, who has been consistent throughout the tournament, yet again gave a flying start to the hosts defeating Kristen Johnson 9-1, 9-7, 5-9, 9-5. 																								Junior national champion Saurav pulled off a hard fought 9-2, 9-1, 3-9, 3-9, 9-3 win over Harry Gordon Leitch in a thriller to help India take an unassailable 2-0 lead. Gaurav Nandrajog completed the formalities with a 9-2, 9-5, 9-5 win over Alistair Gorrie in just 29 minutes. 																								The victory enabled India finish runners-up in their pool behind Egypt and book a berth in the last eight, the first time since they started competing in the championship in 1992.																								Incidentally, their previous best also came in that year when they finished 15. 																								However, India face an uphill task as they run into holders England, who topped their pool A with an all-win record, in the knock-out phase beginning Friday. England have won the last three championships. 																								Canada, who emerged runners-up in pool A with three wins, take on Egypt while second seeded Pakistan, with four wins, and the US, three wins, qualified from pool B and will meet Mexico and Australia, respectively.																								Australia with four wins topped pool C, but a three-way tie ensued for the second place involving Mexico, New Zealand and Kuwait. 																								But Mexico edged out others on better match tally.  (PTI)

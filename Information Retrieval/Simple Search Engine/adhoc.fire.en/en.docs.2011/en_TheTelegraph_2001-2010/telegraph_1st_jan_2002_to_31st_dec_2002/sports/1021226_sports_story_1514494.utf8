The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 26, 2002 				 Sachin, Harbhajan, Bangar out for today
																								Auckland: Three key players, including Sachin Tendulkar and Harbhajan Singh, were Wednesday declared unfit for the first ODI versus New Zealand here Thursday. This is a serious setback for a beleaguered Indian team seeking to put behind the disappointment of the Test series with a good showing in the ODIs.																								Tendulkar had sprained his right ankle while bowling at nets Tuesday, while Harbhajan developed some problem in his bowling hand, team officials said. And, as if that wasnt enough, all-rounder Sanjay Bangar has not recovered from a knee injury he sustained on the last day of the second Test in Hamilton.																								Sachin was also doubtful for the second match in Napier Sunday, team physio Andrew Leipus said. Harbhajans problem is a long-standing injury, team manager Nathu Ram Choudhary said. But he was definitely on for the second match, he said.																								With medium-pacer Rakesh Patel, one of the four players  with Jawgal Srinath, Anil Kumble and Yuvraj Singh  called for the one-day series, yet to join the team, the Indians are struggling to put together an XI to take on a pumped-up home side.																								Patel was scheduled to leave India Wednesday night.																								The 12 able-bodied men available for Thursdays game include all the four medium pacers  Ajit Agarkar, Srinath, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra  and wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel. According to all available indications, Patel would be asked to make his one-day debut considering the thin batting line-up India are left with.																								Despite Indias woeful batting display in the Test series, the national selectors paid no heed to the crying need for including an additional batsman in the one-day squad and the result is that there are not enough batsmen in the side for Thursdays game.																								Even after the news of the injury of the three players, there is no second thought being given to hold on to at least a couple of cricketers who are returning home Thursday after the Test series.																								With Parthiv almost a certainty for Thursdays game, the diminutive 17-year-old will most likely do the duties behind the wickets. As such, Indias batting is precariously placed and have a Herculean task ahead in putting up a decent total on the board.																								Thursdays match is being played on a drop-in pitch which is said to be consistent in pace and very helpful to the faster bowlers. 																								New Zealand, on the other hand, are much better organised and well prepared to carry their dominance into the seven- match one-day series. So clear are they about their strategy that they have decided to leave out paceman Darryl Tuffey  Man of the Series in Tests.																								Tuffey will yield his place to Kyle Mills who is quicker and is expected to make better use of a bouncy portable pitch at Eden Park.																								New Zealand will thus go into the game with a battery of fast bowlers  Shane Bond, Jacob Oram, Mills and Paul Hitchcock.																								Wicketkeeper batsman Brendon McCullum, who has a formidable reputation as a fierce striker of the ball, has been drafted in the side while Matthew Sinclair is expected to lend his experience to the batting line-up.

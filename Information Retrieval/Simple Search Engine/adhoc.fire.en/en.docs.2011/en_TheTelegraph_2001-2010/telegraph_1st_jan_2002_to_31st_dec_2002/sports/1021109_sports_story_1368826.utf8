The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, November 09, 2002  Accede may be hard to toss 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore: The S. Ganapathy-trained Accede, well rested after his disappointing summer Derby display  looks good to lift the 1,400m Kunigal Trophy, on Saturday. The Razeen-Blue Veryan gelding, who is blazing the track appears to have come back to his winning form. Zurbaran and Just Brave look best to put up semblance of a challenge, but it looks easy for Accede in the hands of Mark Gallagher who may have an armchair ride.

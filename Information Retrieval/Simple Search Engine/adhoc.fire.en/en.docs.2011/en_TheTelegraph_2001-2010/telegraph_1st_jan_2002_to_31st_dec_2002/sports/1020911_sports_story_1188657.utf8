		 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 Arthurs, Draper in Aussie squad
																								Sydney: Australia, without the injured Mark Philippoussis, named Wayne Arthurs (picture below), Scott Draper and doubles veteran Todd Woodbridge on Tuesday to join world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt in their team for the Davis Cup World Group play-off tie against India.																								Australia, 27-time winners of the prestigious team event, suffered a shock first-round loss to Argentina in February when they were without Hewitt.																								Hewitt will have a week off before the tie begins at Memorial Drive in Adelaide on September 20.																								This is a must-win tie for us and our team is committed to ensuring Australia rightfully remains in the World Group, non-playing captain John Fitzgerald said.																								Over the past few months the US hardcourt season has provided a solid preparation for the team and were looking forward to hitting on the Rebound Ace (surface) at Memorial Drive, Fitzgerald said.																								Ryan Henry, who reached the boys semi-finals of the US Open, and promising junior Peter Luczak were added to the Australian squad as hitting partners for the senior players. (REUTERS)

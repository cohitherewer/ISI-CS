The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 Lehmann named deputy
																								Melbourne: Australia named South Australia state captain Darren Lehmann as skipper Ricky Pontings deputy on Wednesday for the tri-series match against Sri Lanka in Perth on Sunday.																								The selectors promoted 32-year-old Lehmann, who played in the 1999 World Cup-winning side, following injuries to regular vice-captain Adam Gilchrist and leg-spinner Shane Warne.																								Lehmann regained his spot in the Test team at the expense of Mark Waugh for the first match of the Ashes series against England in Brisbane last month. The left-handed batsman said the vice-captaincy of the one-day side was a surprise and an honour.																								Its obviously probably only the one game with Gilly coming back. But its a feather in your cap and you take it as it is and hopefully I can help Ricky out, Lehmann told reporters in Adelaide.																								Gilchrist has minor groin and knee injuries while 33-year-old Warne is expected to be out of action for at least a month after dislocating his right shoulder against England in Melbourne last week.																								Australia have included left-arm wrist spinner Brad Hogg and wicketkeeper Ryan Campbell, both from Western Australia, in their 12-man squad for Sundays match in place of the injured pair.																								Campbell deputised for Gilchrist in a one-day International in 2001-02, while Hogg played one Test and seven one-day Internationals in 1996-97. 																								AUSTRALIA SQUAD																								Ricky Ponting (captain), Darren Lehmann (voce-captain), Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Michael Bevan, Ryan Campbell, Shane Watson, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath, Andy Bichel.																								Ashes team on Sunday																								Meanwhile, Australia will delay naming their team for the fourth Ashes Test against England until Sunday.																								This new date will allow the selectors the opportunity to view the latest round of Pura Cup (interstate four-day matches starting on Thursday), the ACB said in a statement. (REUTERS)

		 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 Pollock to return for final Test
																								Johannesburg: South Africa have brought back captain Shaun Pollock for the second and final Test against Bangladesh starting in Potchefstroom Friday.																								The allrounder has recovered from the knee injury that ruled him out of the first Test in East London, which South Africa won by an innings and 107 runs on Monday.																								Pollock is likely to replace either fast bowler Mornantau Hayward or seamer David Terbrugge, who were both retained in the 12-man squad named Tuesday.

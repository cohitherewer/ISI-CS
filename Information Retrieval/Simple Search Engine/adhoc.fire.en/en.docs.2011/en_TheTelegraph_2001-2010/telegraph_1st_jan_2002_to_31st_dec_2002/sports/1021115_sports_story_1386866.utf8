																								Asuncion: South American champions Olimpia have dropped the two lawsuits that would have excluded them from next months World Club Cup clash with Spanish giants Real Madrid. 																								La Nacion newspaper, owned by Olimpia president Osvaldo Dominguez, reported that Olimpia withdrew their legal action against Paraguayan Football Association (APF) president Oscar Harrison and vice-president Antonio Colman Rodriguez as from today (Wednesday). 																								The Paraguay champions have decided instead to take their grievances to Fifa, which clears the way for their clash with Real Madrid to go ahead in Japan on December 3. Fifa said in September that Olimpia could be thrown out of the final if they did not drop the court cases.																								Dominguez had filed a case of alleged fraud and misuse of some $2 million of APF funds against the national association for the expenses of a 96-person delegation sent to the 1998 World Cup finals in France.																								The other case relates to the alleged disappearance of $203,000 when Paraguayan defender Celso Ayala was transferred to River Plate of Argentina in 1994. (REUTERS)

				 																																	London: Former England international Dennis Wise is to be given police protection after receiving death threats, according to a report in a British newspaper on Thursday. Police were called in after Wise, now playing for first division club Millwall, was sent a letter saying he would be a dead man if he continued with a writ against former club Leicester City. Another letter said he would be blinded with acid and shot, The Sun said.				 																																	Leicester sacked the 36-year-old in August after an incident during a pre-season tour of Finland that left teammate Callum Davidson with a double fracture of his cheekbone.				 																																	Geneva: Ferraris world champion Michael Schumacher has bought an estate near Geneva where his next door neighbour will be Swiss biotech billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli, whose boat Alinghi leads the Americas Cup challengers series.				 																																	The German driver is believed to have paid 15 million Swiss francs ($10.28 million) for the vast lakefront property known as La Reserve in the town of Gland, the daily Le Matin reported. Schumacher and his wife Corinna announced last May they had decided to stay in the region after environmentalists blocked plans for a luxury home in German-speaking eastern Switzerland.				 																																	Naples: A Naples court on Wednesday rejected an appeal over the payment of $28 million in back taxes and interest from retired soccer great Diego Maradona. Maradonas tax case dates to a five-year period in the late 80s, when the Argentine played with Serie A team Napoli.				 																																	The appeal was made by a group of nearly 100 lawyers, legal advisers and commercial law experts  all self-proclaimed fans of Maradona  who have volunteered to defend him. Renowned Neapolitan lawyer Vincenzo Maria Siniscalchi leads the defence committee.				 																																	Melbourne: Australias Olympic champion Cathy Freeman says her husband Sandy Bodecker has beaten the throat cancer that was diagnosed in May.				 																																	Were obviously really happy with the news, Freeman said in a statement released on Thursday. It has been a difficult time, particularly for Alexander (Sandy), and we are happy that hes able to put it behind him. He will still require regular scans over the coming months and years, and with cancer there is always a risk of recurrence, however we are being told that they have successfully treated the cancer.				 																																	Bogota: Francisco Maturana, Colombias trainer at two World Cups in the early 1990s, has again been appointed his countrys top coach.				 																																	The Colombian football federation named Maturana on Wednesday to coach the team in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers and defend their Copa America title in the 2004 tournament in Peru.				 																																	Maturana, a 53-year-old qualified dentist, was in charge of Colombia in the World Cup finals in Italy in 1990 and the US four years later.				 																																	Barcelona: Spanish World Cup fullback Carles Puyol has agreed a new contract with Barcelona that will keep him there until 2007. My intention was always to stay at Barcelona so Im very happy with this agreement, Puyol told the clubs website on Wednesday. Now I just want to concentrate on helping Barcelona.				 																																	n Cricket: Ashes series, first Test, Day II, live from 5.27 am on STAR Sports n Cricket: South Africa vs Sri Lanka, first Test, Day I, live from 1.25 pm on STAR Sports n Soccer: English Premier League, from 8.00 am and 3.30 pm on ESPN n Soccer: Spanish League highlights, from 1.30 pm on ESPN

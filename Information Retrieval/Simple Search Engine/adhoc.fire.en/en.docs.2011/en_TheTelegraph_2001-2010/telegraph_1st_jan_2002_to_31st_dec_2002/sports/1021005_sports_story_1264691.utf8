 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Busan, Oct. 4: Indias medal count at the Asian Games may be progressing at snails pace but they registered a significant triumph Friday: a victory over Pakistan.																								The architect of that sweet moment was none other than Calcuttas own Ali Qamar. The boxer, competing in the 48 kg light flyweight category, needed just two minutes to floor Imran Hafiz.																								The Manchester gold-medallist went on the offensive from the opening second but the telling blow was a hard right, which knocked over the Pakistani. He managed to get up but the referee stopped the bout, which was credited to Qamar as an RSC. The judges awarded the Indian a 12-1 verdict.																								I was a little tense going into a bout against a Pakistani, so it was good it got over in the first round, Qamar said later. He faces Filippino Harry Tanamor next, on Tuesday.																								While Qamar provided some cheer on another gloomy day for India, his fellow-Calcuttans were left ruing what might have been. If only we hadnt conceded those silly goals, we would have been in the quarter finals, lamented football skipper Bhaichung Bhutia.																								Just a bronze																								India once again collected just one medal in an entire days work on Day VI of the Asian Games, a bronze in the equestrian team eventing, adds PTI.																								The equestrian team comprising Indrajit Lamba, Bhagirath Singh, Rajesh Pattu and Deep Ahlawat, finishing third conceding 224.08 points.																								Indias shooters drew a blank after winning a silver on each of the two previous days.																								Chandra in quarters																								Manan Chandra reached the quarter finals in snooker singles with a 63-9, 32-80, 70-14, 69-30 win over Marco Ka Chun Fu . He had beaten Noppadol Sangnil of Thailand 56-60, 66-54, 67-36, 88-1 earlier. Yasin Merchant lost in the first round.																								In nine-ball pool singles, Mukesh Rehani made the last eight beating Japans Akikumo Toshikawa 11-7.																								The mens volleyball team finally won a match, defeating Macau 3-0 in a pool A league game. But the victory came too late as they have already crashed out of medal contention. 																								In kabaddi India began with fluent victories in their first two matches. Hopes of a medal in wrestling were put on the mat when Ravinder Singh lost to Japans Makoto Sasamoto in the preliminary round of the mens 60kg Greco-Roman event.																								Kapur slips to 4th																								Overnight joint leader and Indias brightest medal prospect in golf Shiv Kapur slipped to the fourth spot with a disastrous three-over 75 in the second round of the indiviudal event.

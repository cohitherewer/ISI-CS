																								Chennai: Unseeded Siddarth Suchde, the lone Indian challenge, moved into the pre-quarter finals with a straight game win on a day when seven of the 16 encounters provided upset results in third round matches of the world junior mens squash championship here Thursday.																								Suchde, who has been training in Scotland for almost a year now, overwhelmed Peter David Creed of Wales in just 14 minutes for a 9-3, 9-0, 9-0 win.																								Creed only had the consolation of making it three all early in the first set.																								However, Suchde has to maintain this momentum, having won all his three matches so far in straight games, to upset third seeded Majid Khan of Pakistan Friday, to progress to the last eight.																								All six Egyptians,including four seeded players, headed by third seed Moustafa Essam, lost their matches, while unseeded Kuwaiti Bader Hussaini put paid to the aspirations of Ashley Flathers of England 9-7, 9-6, 9-7, to complete the seventh upset victory of the day.																								James Willstrop (top seed) and Peter Barker (second), both of England and favourites to win the individual title, won their matches comfortably. Jon Harford, beat Amar Ramzy Swelam 9-6, 9-1, 9-0. 																								The Essam-Julian Illingworth contest was the highlight of the days matches, as the American clawed his way from the brink of defeat to claim the last three games for a deserving 6-9, 5-9, 9-6, 9-0, 9-4 win.

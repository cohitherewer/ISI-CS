				 	 BRETT LEE: Not affected by English fans taunts																								Melbourne: Australian double centurion Justin Langer slammed Englands Barmy Army supporters as a disgrace for their no-ball chanting of Brett Lee in the fourth Boxing Day Test at the MCG here on Friday.																								Lee was wound up by the Barmy Army goading and bowled a fearsome spell that netted the key wicket of opener Marcus Trescothick for 37, late on the second day. Trescothick could not get out of the way of a Lee thunderbolt which seared off his gloves to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist.																								Asked about his reaction to the Barmy Army chants, Langer told a press conference: I thought they were a disgrace. It worked in our favour. Theres no better sight on a cricket field than Brett Lee or any other fast bowler running in and bowling as fast as that, its a magnificent sight.																								If it (chants) did help to fire Brett Lee up then all the better for us. These people standing behind the fence and drinking beer, most of them are 50 kilos overweight and making ridiculous comments, Langer said.																								As far as Im concerned its easy for someone to say that from behind a fence. They pay their money, but theres still got to be some integrity in life. (AGENCIES)

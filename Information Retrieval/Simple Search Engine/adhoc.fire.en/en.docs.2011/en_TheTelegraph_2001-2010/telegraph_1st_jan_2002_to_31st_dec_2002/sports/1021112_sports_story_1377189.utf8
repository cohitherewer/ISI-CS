Ill meet Sanjeev during the final day of the match, Im sure it will be a fruitful discussion, Malhotra said.				 																																																	Both the players were members of the Association that went defunct after its formation in 1989.

Meanwhile, Malhotra said that he may go to court if the secretary of the Indian Cricket Players Association Arun Lal doesnt give an answer to his letter soon where he had asked about the financial details of the former association. He is presently busy with his commentating duties. Ill wait for a few days more before taking any final decision, he added.				 																																																	He also informed that former Indian opener Krishnamachari Srikanth (who was the treasurer of AIC) and Robin Singh (another member) have shown their interest in the rebirth of the association.

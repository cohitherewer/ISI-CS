		 Wednesday, December 04, 2002 				 Mundy, Mukesh battle hots up
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The first pro golf meet in the Steel City of Jamshedpur starts off with the Pro-Am to the Tata Steel Open Wednesday. The build-up has been strong and the needle fight projected is between Mukesh Kumar and Calcuttas Uttam Singh Mundy for the Rs 10 lakh meet proper, to be played over two golf courses at the Beldih and Golmuri Clubs.																								The Mhow-based Mukesh is enjoying peach form, having won six and finished runner-up thrice in his last nine appearances on the Hero Honda Indian Golf Tour. And Mundy won the Surya Nepal Masters last week in Kathmandu and hasnt been lacking in form either, according to information reaching here. 																								Mundy, of course, is considered something of a local boy here, having worked with Tinplate Company for several years.																								The rest of the show also rolls in, with names like Calcuttas Firoz Ali, Ashok Kumar, Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia and Rahul Ganapathy, who recently established the Tour record for the lowest score in a single round (12-under 60 at the Servo Masters). 																								Coming to the fore will also be veterans like Rohtas Singh, winner of over 100 professional titles in a career spanning 25 years, twice Indian Open champion Ali Sher and another Calcuttan, Basad Ali.																								I am aiming for gold. I have set an objective of winning at least ten titles this season and it would be great if I can add this too. Also, I am bit charged up after the slip-up in the third round in Nepal, which took away the title from me, said a confident-looking Mukesh. Mukesh has been virtualy unstoppable since he switched to his new Callaway X-14 set of irons.																								It has been several years since I last played the Golmuri course, but I have experienced Beldih recently. I have a good knowledge of the course, but what is giving me more confidence is that I am playing extremely well at the moment, said Mundy.

																								New Delhi, Sept. 28 (PTI): The Indian tennis teams departure for the Asian Games has been delayed by a day due to the IOAs insistence they undergo dope tests.																								The players, who were to leave on Friday, will now depart late on Saturday night.																								Asked whether SAI had made the results known, an AITA official said, They have not told us the results. But if anybody had tested positive, they would not have cleared them. Though no one invited the players before for tests, when we went to collect the tickets we were told that the players must undergo the tests.																								Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi and Nirupama Vaidyanathan will, however, proceed to Busan without undergoing the tests.

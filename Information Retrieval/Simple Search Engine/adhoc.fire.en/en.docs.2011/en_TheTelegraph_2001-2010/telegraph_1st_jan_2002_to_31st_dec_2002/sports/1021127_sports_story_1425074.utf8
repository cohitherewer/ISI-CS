		 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 Zagallo in hospital
																								Rio de Janeiro: Brazilian legend Mario Zagallo has been hospitalised here after being diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat, his doctor Renato Viella said on Tuesday.																								The 71-year-old Zagallo made a brief return as manager of the Brazilian side for the 3-2 win over South Korea in a friendly match in Seoul last Wednesday, but that was only on an interim basis while a successor to Luiz Felipe Scolaris is sought.																								He was previously treated for heart problems in August when he was in charge of club side Flamengo.																								Zagallo won four World Cups with Brazil, twice as a player in 1958 and 1962 and twice as a coach and assistant coach in 1970 and 1994. (AFP)

		 Tuesday, October 01, 2002 				 Mark says its runs or ruins
																								Sydney: Mark Waugh has conceded he needs to start scoring centuries if he is to hold on to his place in the Australian Test team.																								I think I need runs, the stylish batsman said in Colombo Monday, ahead of the first Test against Pakistan that begins there Thursday. 																								But Im not putting any more pressure on myself than normal, Im just going to go out there and enjoy it and whatever happens, happens.																								Mark said he had felt some pressure over the past couple of years, but will try to avoid negative thoughts before the Pakistan series. 																								Working against Mark in his quest for runs is his poor record in Sri Lanka. He has played six Tests in Sri Lanka for a total of 90 runs at an average of nine. It just hasnt worked out for some reason, Mark said.  (AFP)

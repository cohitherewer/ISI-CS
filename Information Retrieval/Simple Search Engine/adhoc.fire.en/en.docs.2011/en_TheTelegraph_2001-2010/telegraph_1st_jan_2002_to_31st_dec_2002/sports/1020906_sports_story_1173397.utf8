																								Cologne: After forcing Pakistan to bite the dust on Wednesday, India would be looking forward to a similar performance from the forwards in their last match against Korea on Friday to nurture any hope of moving to the finals of the Champions Trophy hockey.																								With seven points from four matches, India are third behind Germany (12 from four) and Holland (10 from four). This is the position after the Germans beat Australia 3-2 and the Dutch beat the Koreans 4-2 on Thursday.																								A win against Korea would put the Indians on 10 points, but that may not be enough to earn them a final berth. The Netherlands are virtually assured a final berth after their win over the Koreans.																								The Dutch, who have 10 points from four matches, need a point against Germany on Friday to prevent India from catching them. 																								Meanwhile, Indian coach Rajinder Singh said the forwards need to come up with yet another stellar performance. (PTI)

		 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 				 Indian Bank stun Dempo 3-1
				 	 PASHA: Double strike 																								Chennai: Syed Sabir Pasha came up with a second half brace to help Indian Bank halt Dempos winning streak with a 3-1 win in their Oil PSU National Football League match at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Monday.																								After a barren first half, Indian Bank shot into the lead through Pasha in the 54th minute. Sri Lankan recruit Kasun Nadika Jayasuriya handed the hosts 2-0 lead at the hour mark.																								Three minutes later, Dempo fought back to reduce the margin through substitute Francis Silveira. Pasha, a former India player, looked in good touch and troubled the Dempo defence with his good sense of positioning and nose for goals. 																								He took the game away from Dempo once and for all, scoring the third goal for Indian Bank in the 81st minute, with a low header. 																								Indian Bank, who upset Bangalores ITI in their opening tie, now have six points from two outings, while the Goans tasted their first defeat in three matches after victories over Vasco SC and Salgaocar. 																								The bankmen, returning to the elite league after a gap of three years, dominated most of the match with better organisation and teamwork. 																								They constantly troubled the rival defence, particularly in the second half. 																								Dempos key striker Andrew Sergey failed to break the shackles after he was closely marked by the bank defence. 																								Both the teams had a few good chances in the first half, in which bank had ball possession for most of the time, but failed to convert them.  (PTI)

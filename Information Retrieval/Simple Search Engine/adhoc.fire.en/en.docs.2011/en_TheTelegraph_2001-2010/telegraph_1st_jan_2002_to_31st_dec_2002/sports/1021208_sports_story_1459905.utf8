																								Manchester, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Manchester United returned to the thick of the English Premier League title race with a 2-0 victory over champions Arsenal at Old Trafford Saturday.																								Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron and Englands Paul Scholes struck in each half of a pulsating encounter as United eased painful memories of the 0-1 home defeat to Arsenal in May that handed their rivals last seasons championship.																								Although Arsene Wengers side enjoyed large spells of possession, Thierry Henry was kept in check by a United side bristling with intent and the Highbury club was left contemplating a potentially ruinous fourth defeat of the campaign. It also ended their run of scoring in 55 consecutive league games.																								Uniteds win was fully deserved by Alex Fergusons side and their third league success on the trot takes them to second spot on 32 points  just three points behind leaders Arsenal. 																								Arsenals exuberance couldnt be subdued for long, and they twice went close.																								Fingertip save																								After 10 minutes, Henry saw his sidefooted effort well saved by Fabien Barthez in front of goal. The move of the match moments later involved a lightning one-two between Robert Pires and Henry before Pires cheekily lobbed Barthez from 20 metres only for the Frenchman to fingertip the ball just wide.																								However, in the 22nd minute, United forced themselves into the lead after French defender Pascal Cygan gave the ball away on the edge of his area.																								Although there was a suggestion of handball from Van Nistelrooy, the Dutch striker quickly released Scholes down the right and the England midfielder crossed low for Veron, who slid the ball home from close range.																								Arsenals Martin Keown, returning for the suspended Sol Campbell, escaped punishment when he appeared to slap Van Nistelrooy on the face.																								Shaaban then suffered a muscle strain while taking a goal kick and was replaced by Stuart Taylor just before half-time.																								The visitors emerged in the second half with great purpose and urgency, although they had to rely on Taylors alertness to deny Giggs from a quick-free kick on 59 minutes.																								But as in the first half, Uniteds second  18 minutes from time -- arrived out of nothing. Van Nistelrooy turned and fed Scholes, who advanced into the area before driving a right-footed shot past Taylor with the aid of a slight deflection.																								Theres a long way to go yet, but were hopeful that if we get a few players back, we should be in good fettle, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, November 18, 2002 				 A chance for Sodhi to come back
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sodhi																								Vadodara: Reetinder Singh Sodhi may make a comeback to the Indian one-day squad for the last two matches (Jodhpur, November 21 and Vijayawada, November 24) of the one-day series to be played against the West Indies.																								The Punjab allrounder is tipped to make the cut when the national selectors meet here Monday to pick the squad after the fifth match of the on-going one-day series.																								Sodhi, who made his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in the 2000-01 series in Cuttack, may replace either Ashish Nehra or J. P. Yadav.																								The selectors arent too impressed with Nehra and the Delhi left-armer is most unlikely to return to the squad  being now replaced by L. Balaji for Mondays match. Only if Balajis performance is unsatisfactory will a chance remain for Nehra. 																								According to The Telegraphs sources, Nehras place in the squad is under serious observation. He has hardly been effective in the one-dayers, noted a source.																								It is not clear what will happen if both Sodhi and Yadav make the squad, since both are regarded to be of a similar kind, at least as far as duty in the shorter version of the game is concerned. The problem in chopping Yadav lies in the fact that the former Madhya Pradesh player has hardly got the chance to prove his worth. If it comes to that, both Sodhi and Yadav will remain in the squad, the source informed.

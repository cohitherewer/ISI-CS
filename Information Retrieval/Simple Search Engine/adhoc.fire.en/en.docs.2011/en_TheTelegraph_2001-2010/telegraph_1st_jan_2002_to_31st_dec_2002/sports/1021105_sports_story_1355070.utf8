		 Tuesday, November 05, 2002 				 Ranji call-up likely for Moyanka Bangla U-17 School tennis
																								l Bengal will select a 14-member team for their Ranji Trophy opener against Rajasthan on Wednesday. Rookie opener Moyanka Chakraborty is likely to be the only new face. While Deep Dasgupta will be the first-choice opener, the other openers slot in the squad lot will see a toss-up between Amitava Chakraborty, Arindam Das and Aurijit Bose. Its likely Amitava will make the cut.																								The No. 6 slot has been a bit of a bother for the team management. Left-hander Shubhradeep Ganguly seems the likely candidate to make the XIV. Paceman Shabbir Ali is still nursing a leg-injury and has been ruled out for the time being. 																								Others almost certain to make the team are Devang Gandhi, Rohan Gavaskar, Subhamoy Das, Sanjib Sanyal, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Utpal Chatterjee, Ranadeb Bose, Sourashish Lahiri and Shibshankar Paul.																								CRICKET: Polly Umrigar Trophy matches (Rajdanga, East Calcutta, Deshabandhu Park from 9:30 am).																								TENNIS: Inter-school meet at SAI.

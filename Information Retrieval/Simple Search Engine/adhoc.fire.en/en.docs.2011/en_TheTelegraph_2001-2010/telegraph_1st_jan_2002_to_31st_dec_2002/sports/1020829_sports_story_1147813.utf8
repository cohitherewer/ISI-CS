The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 100th Test just another game: Sachin
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 TENDULKAR: Focussing on win at The Oval																								Derby: Come September 5 and all the attention will be on Sachin Tendulkar. The Oval Test, after all, will be his 100th. Yet, Sachins own thoughts are on Team India. With the series 1-1, victory there will give India the first (series) win outside the sub-continent in 16 years.																								Im very happy my 100th Test is only days away but, at the same time, I intend treating that match as just another Test... For me, the attention should be on our trying to come out tops at The Oval, Sachin told The Telegraph Wednesday.																								He added: Of course, its going to be a milestone yet, at the end of the day, Ill still be playing cricket... Really, I wouldnt like to put myself under pressure by thinking too much about the 100-Test club...																								[Sachin will be the 26th member, with the other Indians being Kapil Dev (131), Sunil Gavaskar (125) and Dilip Vengsarkar (116). Mohammed Azharuddin got stranded on 99.]																								According to Sachin, who has been rested for the three-dayer here, the focus now ought to be on moving forward from the perfect Test victory at Headingley. We got everything right... Our planning was good and the execution even better... It did make for a thrilling win.																								Talking of his own form, which has seen an upswing after Lords (16 and 12), Sachin pointed out: Scoring or not scoring can be compared to being absolutely healthy one day and not so fine the next morning. Indeed, there will be times when, despite the best efforts, you cant perform at the level you personally want to...																								Asked if he set targets, Sachin replied: I do... Usually, its for a series, at times for a match... It depends... Its nice to have a goal and work towards it.																								After Lords, Sachins scores have been 34 and 92 (Trent Bridge) and, then, that outstanding 193 at Headingley. In the NatWest Trophy, which preceded this Test series, Sachin had two hundreds (105 against England and 113 versus Sri Lanka).																								Before signing off, one couldnt resist asking Sachin whether he gets conscious about records. The maestro answered, smiling: Im certainly aware, but dont get conscious. At least, I dont take guard telling myself I must break this record or that. Doesnt happen that way in cricket.																								Perhaps, not, but Sachin has himself already authored 30 Test and 33 one-day hundreds.

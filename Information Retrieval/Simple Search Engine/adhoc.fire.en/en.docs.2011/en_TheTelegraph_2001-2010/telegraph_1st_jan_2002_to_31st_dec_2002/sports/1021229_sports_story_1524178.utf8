		 Sunday, December 29, 2002 				 NZC wants Wright 
				 	 Wright																								Napier, Dec. 28 (PTI): New Zealand Cricket (NZC) is eyeing the services of Indias coach John Wright for its team once the former stars contract with India ends after the World Cup.																								While Wright himself parried all questions on this subject, NZC chief Martin Snedden said Wright probably would be interested in the job once the term of Denis Aberhart expires in April.																								Snedden said he had not spoken to Wright yet as he thought it was improper to broach this subject at the moment. He is all wrapped up with his team at the moment and there is the extra pressure of being back in New Zealand, so Im leaving him well alone.																								Wrights contract with India expires shortly after the World Cup in February-March and rumours are that he is looking to return to New Zealand. Snedden was unaware of such speculation but hoped that Wright would be interested.																								Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta adds: Wright, in fact, was approached last year itself, to succeed David Trist (Denis Aberharts predecessor), but the former New Zealand captain wasnt tempted. 																								Till I am around with the Indian team, theres absolutely no question of my looking at options, is what Wright had then told The Telegraph. Its unlikely that his stand will change.

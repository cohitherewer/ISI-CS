		 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Sunita Rani reprieve around corner
																								Hyderabad: Sunita Rani will most likely get back her Asian Games medals before the end of this year with the International Olympic Council recommending the dropping of doping charges against her. 																								Sunita, who won the gold in womens 1500m at the Busan Asian Games with a new record apart from a bronze in the 5,000m, was stripped of her medals after her urine test allegedly found traces of banned substance nandrolone in excess of permitted levels.																								Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) secretary Randhir Singh said the Medical Commission of the IOC had upheld the contention of Sunita and the Amateur Athletics Federation of India that the testing procedures at the Seoul laboratory were not foolproof.																								A sub-committee of the commission, which met in Lausanne from December 7 to 9, had found certain discrepancies and procedural lapses in the tests done in Seoul. 																								Consequently the IOC recommended to the OCA and the International Association of Athletics Federations not to pursue the charges any further, Randhir said.																								An official notification from IOC in this regard was yet to reach the OCA office but it was expected soon, he said.																								Randhir said in all probability Sunita will get back her medals before the end of this year. (PTI)

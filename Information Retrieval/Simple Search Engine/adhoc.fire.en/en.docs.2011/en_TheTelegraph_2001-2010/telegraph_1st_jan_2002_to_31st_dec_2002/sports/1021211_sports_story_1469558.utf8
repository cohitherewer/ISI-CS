				 	 Ponting: Encouraging Watson																								Sydney: Australian one-day captain Ricky Ponting has urged Shane Watson to ignore the commotion surrounding Steve Waugh so he can nail the allrounders position in time for the World Cup.																								Coach John Buchanan however said the national selectors might not pick an allrounder at all for the Cup defence in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya leaving Watson and Waugh out of the picture.																								The push for Waugh to be reinstated in the one-day side has placed pressure on Watson heading into Australias opening match of the triangular series against England on Friday.																								Waugh was left out of the preliminary 30-man squad for next February-Marchs World Cup but can still battle his way into the final 15-man squad depending on performance.																								The Test captain lost a big opportunity to press his claim as allrounder as Tuesdays warm-up game between New South Wales and Australia was washed out without a ball being bowled.																								Asked if Watson felt under added pressure because of the public support for the 37-year-old Waugh, Ponting said: I havent spoken to him about it but I wouldnt have thought so. If he starts thinking about things other than his own game then he will start to struggle.																								Weve all been there and done that before, where weve let other little things get to us. I wouldnt think it would be bothering him too much.																								Watsons 15 games for Australia since his debut in March have produced 202 runs at 33.66 and eight wickets at 46.25.																								Hes the sort of guy that if hes not happy with things, hell stay in the nets to the end, working on his throwing, Ponting said. The more cricket he plays at this level the more hell learn and the more hell keep improving so lets just hope he does that through this series.																								Selectors are not going to pick an allrounder just for the sake of it, Buchanan said. At this stage we are short of that quality allrounder and Im not sure it will surface when the final squad is announced. (AFP)

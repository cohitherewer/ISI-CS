		 Tuesday, October 22, 2002 				 Zia blames it on absentees
																								Sharjah: Pakistans cricket chief has told the countrys absent senior players that their attitude was responsible for the teams poor performance in the Test series against Australia, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesman said Monday.																								The chairman told them that being senior players they needed to review their responsibilities and priorities towards the team in the near future, the spokesman said.																								Zia met injured players Inzamam-ul-Haq, Yousuf Youhana, Saeed Anwar and Shoaib Akhtar in Lahore on Monday to discuss their future plans.																								The PCB has decided that the four would play in a one-day practice game shortly to assess their fitness for the forthcoming tour of Zimbabwe and Australia. 																								Wasim Akram was also at the meeting.																								Zia and the selectors discussed the possibility of having separate Test and one-day squads with different captains for the forthcoming tours, the spokesman said.																								It is a proposal which was discussed in detail but nothing is finalised yet, the spokesman added. 																								Pakistan coach Richard Pybus will travel to Pakistan later this week to meet Zia to give his views on this proposal.																								Pybus was scheduled to return to South Africa for a short break on Thursday, but the spokesman said he would be asked to travel to Lahore to meet chief selector Wasim Bari and junior team coach Aaqib Javed.

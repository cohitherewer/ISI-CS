																								New Delhi, Sept. 7 (PTI): Star quarter-miler and Indias brightest athletics medal hope K.M. Beenamol will have the honour of carrying the tricolour at the Pusan Asian Games starting September 29. 																								Announcing this here last night at a function to declare Coca-Cola Indias sponsorship of the Indian contingent, Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi said: At the Commonwealth Games in Manchester we chose rifle shooter Anjali Bhagwat and she came out with flying colours and now watch out for Beenamol. She will lead Indias medal hunt from the front.																								The Indian contingent would be somewhere around 350 and will prove in Pusan that the biggest-ever medal haul at the recent Manchester Commonwealth Games was no flash in the pan, Kalmadi added.																								Athletes, he felt, would be Indias brightest medal hopes at the Pusan Games as the shooters and weightlifters  who bagged most of the medals in Manchester  would face much stiffer competition.

The 32-year-old veteran of 50 Test matches and 143 one-day Internationals has played for Surrey in this seasons championship as a replacement for compatriot and fellow spin bowler Saqlain Mushtaq.

The recently-crowned African champion ran the last three laps alone in Zurich having burned off the rest of the field on his way to improving the time of 7:55.28 he set last year in Brussels.

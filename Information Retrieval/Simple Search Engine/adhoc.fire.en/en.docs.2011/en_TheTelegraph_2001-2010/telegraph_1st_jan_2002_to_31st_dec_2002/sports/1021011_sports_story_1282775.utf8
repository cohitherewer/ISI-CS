		 Friday, October 11, 2002 				 Pak cry for third umpire
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Busan, Oct. 10: The Pakistanis turned out to be poor losers. All their ire, after the 3-4 semi-final defeat against India at Gangseo Hockey Stadium Thursday afternoon, was directed at the umpires.																								There were too many poor decisions, and all of them went against us, said coach Tahir Zaman. We had a goal disallowed. An Indian player hit our goalie, yet no card was shown. Our man clashed with an opponent accidentally and he got the red card.																								Zaman added that it was time to introduce third umpire in hockey. It may seem that I am making an excuse for the defeat but its a very serious point. Let the third umpire check TV replays to see whether a ball hit a players stick en route to the goal. Theres no harm, it will reduce faulty decisions. 																								The Pakistan coach admitted his team didnt perform expectedly. But it wasnt easy playing 15-20 minutes one man short. We recovered to equalise thrice but were in the end outnumbered, Zaman said .

				 	 Inzamam-ul-Haq celebrates his century in Harare Monday. (Reuters)																								Harare: Centuries for Inzamam-ul-Haq and Taufeeq Umar on the third day of the third Test put Pakistan in complete control against Zimbabwe in Harare Monday.																								Inzamams 112 made him only the second Pakistani to reach 6,000 Test runs after Javed Miandad, and it was only the 16th time in Test history that a batsman scored 100 runs in the session before lunch. Pakistan were eventually bowled out for 369 as opener Taufeeq Umar made 111.																								Zimbabwe reached 19 for one in search of an unlikely victory target of 430 when bad light ended play 13 overs early. Dion Ebrahim and Alistair Campbell were both nine not out.																								Pakistan were dismissed for 285 in their first innings, to which Zimbabwe replied with 225. Inzamam bludgeoned 48 runs of his half-century in boundaries in just 53 balls .																								He was out five balls after reaching his 17th Test hundred, having faced 107 balls and hit 20 fours. Pakistan started the day on 14 for one and suffered their only loss of the morning session when Younis Khan edged Henry Olonga to Campbell.																								Inzamam said he had set himself a career target of 10,000 runs. If I play for another four or five years and work hard I hope to reach 10 000. (Reuters)

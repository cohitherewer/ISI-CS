The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, August 26, 2002 				 Sachin can make the bowler feel impotent: David Gower
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Leeds: With 117 appearances and over 8,000 Test runs, David Gower knows more than a thing or two about batting. Indeed, the former England captain was himself the very epitome of grace. Appropriately, then, The Telegraph requested him to talk exclusively about modern day icon Sachin Tendulkar. Gower, now among the most respected of TV commentators anywhere, obliged Sunday morning.																								The following are excerpts																								On his impressions of Sachin when he first toured England, in 1990																								Even then, he was preceded by a reputation... Just a few months before that series, I remember Sachin got 88 in New Zealand (Napier Test)... In any case, Asian cricketers mature so early, its been a feature from the time of Mushtaq Mohammad  though in his case, if I may point out, there must have been some elementary error in dictating (the date of birth)! Actually, seeing someone so young as Sachin (17 then), one of my first thoughts was I hope it will be okay for him.																								On Sachins first Test hundred, that unbeaten 119 at Old Trafford																								That he had talent and temperament was apparent even before that innings... Conditions werent straightforward, yet Sachin got a very fine hundred. If I recall correctly, that helped save the Test for India... That knock gave us an insight as to what would happen in the future. Moreover, very quickly, Sachin earned our respect.																								On whether the general mood in the England dressing room, till Old Trafford, was that the teenaged Sachin could be knocked over 																								When you have hardened pros, as is always so with an England team, then inevitably an effort is made to play on the age gap... However, when somebody so young begins to play in the manner Sachin did, all illusions disappear fast. The temptation to force a bit of psychological pressure will always be there, but if the batsman responds with a hundred, youve got to applaud. We did, at Old Trafford.																								On Sachin the batsman																								The last time India played a series in England (1996), it was during an era of too many one-dayers and, so, the feeling was that Sachin and the others must get back into the Test-mode. That they should look to building innings and not just... Im happy that situation has been rectified... Without specifically speaking about the different phases in Sachins career, let me just dwell on the past month or so... This period, after all, has seen so many on Sachins back, so many questions being asked... Has the magic gone? Has the hunger gone? Yet, thank heavens, Sachin kept his head and replied in the way he should have. Bottomline is character.																								On Sachins performance in the on-going Test series																								Lords was a downer... In Trent Bridge, though, Sachin was determined. He didnt get many in the first innings (34), but authored an outstanding 92 in the second. More than those runs, the manner he got them made that innings special. As for the 193 here, I couldnt find a fault. Yes, Sachin did get that freedom to strike, late on the second day, but youve still got to play those shots.																								On whether Sachin has a weakness																								(Smiles) Quite some years ago, I was reading a pre-series write-up wherein the writer had this to say about Peter Willey: ... Is susceptible to the fast away-going delivery pitched on off... My instant reaction was: But, then, that could have applied to Sir Don Bradman as well... Look, there will always be some delivery somewhere which will test the best in the world... Essentially, what separates the great from the not-so-good is how they handle the remaining deliveries... Sachin does make the odd mistake  and Im glad he does, because we need to be reassured even he is human  but the mistakes are few, are far between. And, what Sachin does between mistakes is awesome. In fact, he makes others jealous. His ability to manipulate, clearly, is extraordinary.																								On the Sachin shots which make him jealous																								Most of his drives through cover... In Trent Bridge, however, there was one stroke I wont forget... I dont recall the bowler, but the ball was pitched short and Sachin went back, on his toes, to smash it for a straight four. It was an unusual shot, executed perfectly.																								On the Sachin versus Brian Lara debate																								Both are great and, at this point in time, why should I pick one over the other? I enjoy watching both.																								On the greatest batsman he played with/against																								Viv Richards... Nobody comes very close... Viv was lethal... As I usually fielded in cover, I wasnt always in the firing line, but did always get to watch Viv from pretty close... As Ive suggested, he could do anything.																								On The Oval match being Sachins 100th Test																								I suspect others will make more of a fuss than Sachin himself. Having said that, the harder part, for Sachin, will be to ignore those other people... Should India win the Headingley Test, as appears likely on the fourth morning, then the real pressure on Sachin (at The Oval) will be to produce yet another innings as the 193.																								On what really separates Sachin from the rest																								His ability to continue judging the merits of every delivery... Invariably, Sachin has the right solution that one fraction of a second earlier. It makes a big difference. Even Rahul Dravid has this knack, though he isnt quite as good a player as Sachin. The ability to make the right judgement apart, Sachins confidence makes his CV even more handsome. He can make the bowler feel utterly impotent.																								Finally, on where Sachin goes from here																								(Smiles again) Depends on him... How many years does Sachin himself want to play? Just how hungry will he be a few years from now? The answer, really, must come from him.

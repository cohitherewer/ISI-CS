The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, October 11, 2002 				 Coach stresses on durability
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 10: The urge to prove the world wrong following her 100m failure, pepped up Saraswati Saha to win the Asian Games 200m gold, the athletes local coach Sunirmal Ghosh said today. 																								I have known this girl for five years. I always have kept faith in her because she is so stubborn and serious to everything, Ghosh said. 																								I also want to see how the government responds to Saraswatis success. But even if it does not give her any gold crown or money, as it did to Jyotirmoyee Sikdar (who won two golds in 1998 Bangkok Games), one thing you can be sure of  well not let Saraswati fade out like Jyotirmoyee, Ghosh remarked.

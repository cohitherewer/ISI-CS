 Bangalore: The three-day match between the West Indians and the Board Presidents XI ended in a draw on Sunday with the tourists using the opportunity to gain vital batting practice ahead of the first Test starting in Mumbai on October 9.																								Ramnaresh Sarwan became the second Caribbean batsman, after Wavell Hinds 147 on Saturday, to hit a century in their innings which remained unfinished at 606 for four. 																								This was because the two captains decided to stop the match after six mandatory overs had been bowled on the third and final day on Sunday.																								Sarwan made a strokeful 140 with 18 fours and a six in nearly seven-and-a-half hours before retiring hurt in the second session. Other batsmen also chipped in as the Windies took a 331-run lead over Board Presidents first innings 275 for eight declared.																								Captain Carl Hooper scored 67 while Ryan Hinds made 74 before retiring. The match was called off soon after wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs completed his fifty.																								For the home team, left-arm spinner Murali Kartik claimed two for 92 while off-spinner Sarandeep Singh and medium-pacer Laxmipathi Balaji took a wicket each. 																								Of the Caribbean batsmen only Shivnarine Chanderpaul missed out on a big score, dismissed by Balaji in the second over of the day after adding just five runs to his overnight 20.																								But Sarwan, who completed his century with a three off Tinu Yohannan, and Hooper added a brisk 85 runs for the fourth wicket.																								Hooper was in a combative mood and picked Amit Mishra, who was on Saturday included in the 14-member Indian squad for the first two Tests, for some special treatment.																								Mishra was hit for two fours by Hooper in his first over and then two successive sixes in his next. Mishras first three overs cost him 34 runs. 																								Sanjay Bangar, who replaced him, was not spared either and was hit for a huge six to bring up Hoopers half-century.																								Hoopers big hitting was brought to an end by Kartik who struck with his very first ball of the day. Hooper attempted a defensive shot but the ball popped up and wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel took a simple catch. 																								The West Indies captains 67 came in 97 minutes and contained seven fours and three sixes. 																								Ryan Hinds also got down to scoring quickly and raced to 53 at the tea when the West Indians were at 549 for four. He retired hurt with the total at 583. The tourists raised their 600 in the 175th over.  (PTI)

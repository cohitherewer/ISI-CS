The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 Trescothick, Irani likely in Oval XI
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Trescothick 																								London: Having gambled somewhat by including Marcus Trescothick and Ronnie Irani in the squad for the decider against India, beginning Thursday, England are likely to go the full distance and include both in the XI at The Oval.																								While Trescothick has just come off a fractured left thumb-induced lay-off, Irani recently underwent arthroscopy on his right knee. Both had a pretty extensive workout Tuesday and, according to well-placed sources, their non-inclusion will be a surprise.																								Robert Key, then, looks set to lose his place. After all, once in the XI, Trescothick will return to one of the opening slots  the other, of course, is held by Michael Vaughan. As for Irani, he will fill the berth vacated by Andrew Flintoff. 																								The Indians, too, had a lengthy session at The Oval itself. And, while there remains much curiosity over how the wicket will behave, captain Sourav Gangulys opinion was straightforward: Looks a good track and, unlike Monday, theres much less moisture...																								As The Oval is Surreys home ground, no one knows conditions better than Englands most capped player  Alec Stewart. Speaking to The Telegraph, he said: The wicket has played true throughout the season. However, it will turn... Only, I cant say from which day.																								Whether the turn is prodigious or not, England have picked only one specialist spinner in Ashley Giles.																								Meanwhile, as already reported in these columns, the Indian XI will see one change in the side which won so handsomely at Headingley  Ajay Ratra will replace the teenaged Parthiv Patel. 																								Ratra, it may be recalled, began the series as the No.1 wicketkeeper but a toe injury on the eve of the second Test (Trent Bridge) saw the big gloves go Patels way. Now, Ratra will be back behind the wickets.																								Presentations for Sachin 																								The decider, by the way, is Sachin Tendulkars 100th Test and two presentations have been lined up. 																								Sourav will make one on behalf of the team, some 45 minutes before the match gets underway, while Cricket Club of India president Raj Singh Dungarpur (who was chief selector when Sachin was first picked, in 1989) will make one on behalf of the Mumbai-located institution.																								The Board of Control for Cricket in India, one understands, will make its presentation during the Test against the West Indies, in Mumbai, next month.

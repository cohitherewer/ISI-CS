The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, November 24, 2002 				 Salgaocar down JCT
																								Margao, Nov. 23 (PTI): Salgaocar registered their first victory of the seventh National Football League with a solitary-goal win against JCT at the Nehru stadium Saturday.																								The all-important goal was scored in the seventh minute by Tomba Singh when he latched on to a back-pass by JCT defender Arvind Kumar with the keeper Arvind Kumar failing to react. Taking the ball in his possession, Tomba placed the ball into the far corner of the net.																								JCT had the first chance to forge ahead but Jaswinder Singhs fierce left-footer was well saved by keeper Juje Siddi.																								Salgaocar, who made three changes from their last match against Dempo which they lost 1-2, played with determination and could have led by three goals within the first 10 minutes had Dennis Cabral and Dudu Omagbemi not messed up.																								Dudu, the joint highest scorer with 10 goals in the Goa league for Sporting Club and taken on lien by Salgaocar, failed to do justice to his reputation missing three scoring chances.																								Sunday Seah, who put the JCT defence under pressure, had a chance in the dying minutes of the first half but his attempt was blocked by Arvind.																								JCT failed to impress in the first half but played well in patches in the second, coming close to equalising twice.																								In the 64th minute, Jo Paul Ancheris free kick deflected off a defender to substitute Kuldip Singh whose scorching drive was saved by a diving Siddi.																								Siddi again rose to the occasion in the dying minutes collecting I.M. Vijayans shot.																								Salgaocar now have four points from three matches, while JCT are still to open their account.																								In Bangalore, local giants HAL and ITI were locked in a goalless tie. Both teams now have one point each from two outings.

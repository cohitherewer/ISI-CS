		 Saturday, November 30, 2002 				 Sourav backs bowlers
				 	 Sourav																								New Delhi: A total in the region of 300 or more was comfortably overhauled in the recent one-day series between India and the West Indies. In next years World Cup, though, that will not be the case, feels Sourav Ganguly. 																								On Indian pitches it is not easy for the bowlers. But in South Africa 260-270 would be a winning total. I am confident of my bowlers defending such a total, the Indian captain said. He shot down suggestions that the dual responsibility for Rahul Dravid meant too much pressure for the makeshift keeper.																								The way he has kept in recent matches, he is no longer a makeshift. In fact Dravid keeping wickets is a solution and not a problem. His batting performance in the last 6-7 months has reached a different level. As far as pressure goes, he is doing a job for the team. Somebody has to take the pressure. (PTI)

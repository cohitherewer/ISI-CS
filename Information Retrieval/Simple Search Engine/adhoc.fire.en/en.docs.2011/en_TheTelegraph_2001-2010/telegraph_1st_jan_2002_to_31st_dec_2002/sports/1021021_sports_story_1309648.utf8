The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, October 21, 2002 				 Sourav arrives
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: If a few heartbeats skipped at the sight of Sourav Ganguly being stretchered off at the Chepauk early Sunday, there was good news later. 																								As the Indian captain landed here this evening, straight from Chennai, he took his own luggage off the conveyor at the Netaji Subhas Chandra International airport and looked in no discomfort.																								The hurry, possibly was for a holy occasion  Lakshmi Puja at home. The pundit and family presumably were waiting for Maharajs arrival. Looking quite refreshed, the Indian captain, however, did not speak to the assembled Media before driving off.

		 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 Sunita Rani sidelined
																								New Delhi: There was a surprise exclusion, so to say, from the 33-athlete-18-official Asian Games squad named by the Indian Olympic Association a few days back, when the Amateur Athletic Federation of India named its list Tuesday.																								The federation deferred the selection of Sunita Rani who had met the qualifying mark in womens 1,500m more than once this season. 																								She (Sunita) did not participate in the National Open meet and the federation has no information about her, AIFF secretary Lalit K. Bhanot told reporters here.																								Other than this there were hardly any changes the team as the federation released a list of 20 men and 22 women including that of flag bearer K. M. Beenamol (400m, 800m, 4x400 relay), Saraswati Saha (100m and 200m) and Anju Bobby George (long jump, triple jump). (PTI)

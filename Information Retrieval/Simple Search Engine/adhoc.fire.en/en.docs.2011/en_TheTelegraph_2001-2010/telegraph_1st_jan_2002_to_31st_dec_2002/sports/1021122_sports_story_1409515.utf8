		 Friday, November 22, 2002 				 Tolly catch Mahindra napping
 							 - National league l 3-2 victory surprises coach Aloke Mukherjee BY A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Mahindra Uniteds Debjit Ghosh does his best to thwart Mohammedan Sporting striker Akeem Abolanle at the Salt Lake Stadium Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami played some good passing football and took advantage of sloppy defending to surprise Mahindra United 3-2 in their National Football League match at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 																								Ashim Biswas put the city outfit in front after 18 minutes, Odartey Lawson neutralised the lead minutes before the break. Tollygunge got their nose in front soon after change of ends courtesy Laltu Das before Akeem Abolanle made it 3-1 with a brilliant goal. Mongba Aby Samson pulled one back for Mahindra in injury time.																								Contrary to coach Aloke Mukherjees match-eve expectations, it was an organised performance by the local side. Yes, my boys played exceptionally well. I must admit the result was beyond my expectation, Aloke said. 																								Kicking off in the 3-5-2 formation with Sandip Das and Srikanta Dutta operating from deep to support the backline, Tollygunge were clearly intent on playing safe. Counter-attack was the only route to test Naseem Akhtar under the Mahindra bar. 																								The Mumbai team had the first chance to score but R.C. Prakashs third-minute volley brought out the best from a diving Amar Deb under the Tollygunge bar. 																								Ashim caught the defence napping in the 19th minute when he met Akeems left-wing cross unchallenged inside the six-yard zone and the ball was defected off R.P. Singh into the net. 																								 Mahindra equalised three minutes from half-time. Sur Kumar got the ball following a corner-kick, swung in an inviting cross towards the goal and Lawson scored with a copybook header. 																								Tollygunge again had a close shave when an Abhisek Yadav header went off target. Laltus opportunism in the 54th minute restored Tollygunges lead. Naseem made a mess of collecting an Amitabha Chanda cross from right and the ball landed in front of Ashim. The Tollygunge striker prodded the ball towards an empty goal, but an alert Debjit Ghosh rushed in desperation to effect a goalline save. 																								It was, however, a momentary reprieve for the visitors as Laltu, who substituted Srikanta Dutta seconds before Lawsons goal, came from behind to push it in. 																								Thirteen minutes later, Tollygunge went two goals clear thanks to Akeems intelligence. Amitabha again initiated the move as his cross from the deep found the Nigerian on the right. Akeem dribbled past Syed Hussain, moved further into open space as Naseem left charge and, on the third touch, stroked a lob accurately over the goalkeepers head. 																								A sense of complacency might have crept into the Tollygunge defence when Samson reduced the margin. Fed by Czech midfielder Peter Strandel, Mahindras Ivory Coast recruit Samson dashed towards goal and scored with a powerful shot. No Tollygunge defender was around to challenge him. 																								Mahindras Czech Republic coach and former World Cupper Carel Stromcek described Tollygunge as an average team and blamed his defenders for the loss. When you make mistakes, the other will benefit. Similarly, some of my players made silly mistakes, allowing Tollygunge to win. 																								Im disappointed with the teams performance. Excepting (Mongba Aby) Samson, nobody impressed me. If you cant win against an average team like Tollygunge, you are bound to face more troubles in future in the league, Stromcek said.

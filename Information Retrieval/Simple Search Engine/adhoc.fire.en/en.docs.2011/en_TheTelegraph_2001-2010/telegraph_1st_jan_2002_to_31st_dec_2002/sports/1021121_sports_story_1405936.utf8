		 Thursday, November 21, 2002  Daniel gets three-month suspension for drug offence 
 [+uc('BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT ')+]				 										Calcutta: Stewards, Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC), after the last race on Wednesday, held an enquiry into a drug related offence and handed a near three-month suspension to trainer Daniel David, according to RCTC sources. The enquiry was held following a report received from the racing laboratory, the Hong Kong Jockey Club, that Moon Quest, a Daniel David runner in the Ex-Servicemens Handicap on October 9, had tested positive of 3-Hydroxylignocaine, a drug prohibited under the rules of racing. It was a class II drug the punishment slapped on the trainer could have run up to an year, said the source. The stewards took a lenient view following Daniels plea that he was innocent, said the source. Daniel was also given sufficient time to hold his own enquiry and permitted to submit the split sample of Moon Quests urine for the confirmatory analysis from an RCTC approved laboratory in France. However, the presence of 3-Hydroxylignocaine having been confirmed by the French lab, the clubs stewards handed their verdict. Daniel was also fined Rs 20,000 for gross careless in his stable management. Daniels training licence will be suspended between November 21 and February 18, 2003  both day inclusive).				 										Stewards also suspended apprentice jockey Vinay Jaiswal, the rider of Flinders in the Liberty Cup on November 14. The apprentices riding was found to be unsatisfactory when he was leading the field in the home stretch also had a good position but he slackened his effort. Jaiswal has been suspended for four race meets.

		 Thursday, December 12, 2002 				 Allowance confusion
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has agreed to the BCCIs demand of sanctioning a daily allowance of $ 50 per head for the Indian players. The NZC was initially paying a sum less than the conventional $ 50 to the visitors but the BCCI has succeeded in persuading the hosts to raise the amount to the desired level.																								Our players did face this problem for the first few days after landing in New Zealand, but now, the issue has been sorted out and they are paying $ 50 to the players on a daily basis, said BCCI secretary S.K. Nair. 																								The BCCI will take care of all additional expenses, if necessary, Nair added.

		 Tuesday, October 22, 2002 				 Foreign coach must for Olympic gold: Aslam 
																								Bhopal: Former Olympian Aslam Sher Khan on Monday said a foreign coach should be appointed for the national hockey team, if India hoped to win a gold medal in the 2004 Athens Olympics.																								Only a foreign coach can help the Indian hockey team overcome certain weaknesses afflicting it at present, Khan, who was the manager of the team for the four-nations tournament at Holland and the Champions Trophy at Germany, earlier this year, said here.																								Having seen the team and its coaches at close quarters, I am now convinced that only a foreign coach can help India win a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics, Khan said.																								He said though the current team has players with a lot of potential, there is a need to have a couple of more players like Dhanraj Pillay.																								Khan also demanded elections for the Bhopal Hockey Association (BHA) within a fortnight and added that Otherwise I will personally lead a delegation of hockey personalities from the city to Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S Gill.																								BHA elections have not been held for the last eight years and it is being run by ad-hoc bodies. (PTI)

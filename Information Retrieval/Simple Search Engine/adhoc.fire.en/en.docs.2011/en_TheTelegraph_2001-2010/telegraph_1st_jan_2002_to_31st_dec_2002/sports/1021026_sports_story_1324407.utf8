The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, October 26, 2002 				 No credit for style, says Serena 
				 	 SERENA: Eyeing calendar Grand Slam in 2003																								Los Angeles: She has won the last three Grand Slam titles and lost only one match since June, yet Serena Williams still feels she and her elder sister Venus are not appreciated enough.																								Yes, they are athletic. Yes, they hit the ball with a power not seen in the womens game before. But Serena wants more recognition that the Williams sisters use their brains on court and can construct a point as well as anyone.																								I dont get the credit, I use more angles than anyone, said Serena, the world number one. A lot of people started using angles because of me. In that sense, were not getting credit. Theyre saying were athletic or run well but dont say: That was a good play to hit behind that girl. 																								Responding to a comment made by her mother Oracene that black people are always just viewed as athletes  theyre strong and tough but cant think, Serena said she thought that her mother was being fair.																								All the commentators say how Venus and I are so athletic, said Serena at a news conference to promote the season-ending WTA Championships in Los Angeles from November 6 to 11.																								They say look at the athleticism of her game. Its never she won because she used finesse. I dont hit every ball hard. Thats what I did when I was losing. When I first broke in the top 100, I stopped that because you cant hit hard like that. 																								Some shots I will hit hard but not every ball. Im not just using my power.																								Tennis Tigers																								Former world number one Lindsay Davenport recently remarked that it was incredible to have two elite athletes from one family at the top of their sport, saying: Can you imagine Tiger Woods walking down the 18th fairway with his brother battling it out for the victory?																								Serena agreed. Thats the way you have to look at it. Were really fighting. Seeing Tiger  I guess his brothers name would be Bear  those two going at it. Its really special and brings a different colour to tennis.																								After being upset by Magdalena Maleeva three weeks ago in a Moscow tournament, Venus, ranked second in the world, said she was getting bored with tennis and might need to spend more time with off-court activities to add spice to her life.																								Venus lost to Serena in the final of the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open this year.																								Its the fall blues, Serena said. Everyones played the Grand Slams, the pressures off but you have to keep proving yourself at the smaller tournaments and its hard to get up for them. Thats been the difference for me this year. Ive been able to get up for them even when I didnt want to. Venus will come back strong.																								Serena has won eight titles this year and pulled out of three European tournaments this month due to fatigue.																								Improved standard																								Serena believes her success this year has changed the way the game is played and the way her rivals prepare and has improved standards across the womens tour.																								Yes, just like Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles did, Serena said. The girls have improved a lot. I see more girls in the gym now. Theyre getting stronger, which is great for womens tennis because you can see tougher matches.																								The bars been raised. Ive faced players I used to have an easy time with but now theyve improved.																								In 2001 and for the first half of this year, a cluster of players were rivals for the number one spot  Venus, Jennifer Capriati, Martina Hingis and Davenport.																								But after her stellar summer, Serena has pulled away.																								I decided I needed to get more serious, Serena said. Venus did that a couple years ago. This year I raised my game. I was tired of losing to players I shouldnt lose to and there were people ranked ahead of me who shouldnt have been. That was the last straw.																								The first player since Hingis in 1997-1998 to win three straight majors, Serena is carrying an aura of near-invincibility. The 20-year-old American is so confident that she believes she can win a calendar-year Grand Slam in 2003. I could, she said. I just have to stay calm and relaxed. (REUTERS)

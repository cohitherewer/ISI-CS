		 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 Give pitches time to settle: Dalmiya 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Teammates help Jawagal Srinath with the roller at the Eden Monday. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Calcutta: BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said Monday it would take time to realise the fruits of the Boards move to lay new strips in ten centres in a move to produce sporting pitches. One should not expect immediate results regarding the (new) pitches. They will take time, may be a year. Were confident about the fruits of our scheme, Dalmiya said. 																								The BCCI formed a pitch committee to relay new tracks, but the move came in for criticism when the touring West Indians caved in within four days in the first two Tests in Mumbai and Chennai, which were played on such virgin strips. 																								Dalmiya, however, hoped the Eden pitch, another virgin one, for the third and final Test, would be dry enough in time to behave sportingly. Lets hope so. But you should not be judgmental on this too soon.																								Meanwhile, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation cleared the water sample, collected from the CAB Sunday. The CMC officials found chlorine and other components in the water satisfactory and cleared it, Dalmiya said after a meeting with mayor Subrata Mukherjee and sports minister Subhas Chakraborty.

		 Monday, December 09, 2002 				 Pollock, Rhodes set up big win
																								Durban: Shaun Pollock produced a stirring performance with bat and ball to lead South Africa to an easy 132-run win over a lacklustre Pakistan in the first one-day International on Sunday.																								South Africa scored 272 for seven and then skittled Pakistan out for 140 in 42.5 overs.																								Pollock batted aggressively at the end of the South Africa innings to score 57 off 51 balls before taking three for 12 from 9.5 overs. Jonty Rhodes had top scored for the hosts with a gritty 98, while Nicky Boje took three wickets to peg back the tourists.																								Pakistan batted without urgency and were never in the hunt for victory. Salim Elahis 31 was the best effort in an innings in which 23 was the highest partnership.																								Wasim Akram, by far the pick of Pakistans bowlers with three for 19, drew first blood in the third over when Herschelle Gibbs was caught behind without scoring. He also removed Graeme Smith and Mark Boucher.																								Six overs later Neil McKenzie mistimed a pull shot off Muhammad Sami and was caught by Yousuf Youhana at square leg for 11. Boje and Jacques Kallis fell to similar strokes, Boje to Muhammad Sami for 20 and Kallis to medium pacer Abdul Razzaq for six. (Reuters)

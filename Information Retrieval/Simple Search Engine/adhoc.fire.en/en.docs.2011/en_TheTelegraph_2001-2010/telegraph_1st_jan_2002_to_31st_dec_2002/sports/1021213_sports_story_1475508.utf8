		 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 Ahn still eyeing a premier spot
				 	 AHN JUNG-hWAN																								Shimizu (Japan): South Korea striker Ahn Jung-hwan still has his sights on a move to England despite being unable to join Premier League club Blackburn Rovers in August because of visa problems.																								The 26-year-old, who joined J-League club Shimizu S-Pulse on a one-year contract in September after helping the co-hosts reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, said Thursday he wanted the chance to play in Europe again.																								I really wanted to play for Blackburn. The Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world, so if I get another opportunity to go of course I would take it, he said.																								However, Ahn  the nearest thing Asian football has to a David Beckham  insisted there would be no turning back on his decision not to return to Italy following his much-publicised row with Serie A club Perugia after the World Cup.																								Spain would be another option because there is a big emphasis on individual skill there, but not Italy. I spent two years in Italy and want to play somewhere else, he said diplomatically.																								Ahn famously scored the golden goal that knocked Italy out of the World Cup, prompting a furious response from Perugia president Luciano Gaucci, who promised that the forward would never set foot in Perugia again.

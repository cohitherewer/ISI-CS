Sydney: One crew member died and three were missing Tuesday after an elite racing yacht capsized in high seas off the coast of south eastern Australia.				 																																	One of two survivors plucked from the ocean by a passing freighter said the entire crew had been trapped under water in the cockpit when the excalibur capsized around 9pm local time (1630 IST) Monday.				 																																	John Rogers said he managed to cut his lifeline and swim free of the vessel and then survive in the water for six hours before being rescued. Everybody was completely underwater in the cockpit of the boat, Rogers said from the tanker.				 																																	I then managed to find a knife and cut my lifeline and found my way out. Rescuers found the body of one man lying face-down in the water near the yacht, 42 nautical miles off Port Stephens, but another man and two women were still missing. 				 																																	Rio de Janeiro: Romario has been fined by his club Fluminense after he punched a teammate in a Brazilian First Division match on Sunday. The incident occurred during Sao Paolos 6-0 drubbing of the 36-year-old strikers team. Upset at what he considered poor defending, captain Romario bore down on the hapless Andrei and out of sight of the referee hit him on the head.				 																																	Unlike the referee, TV networks picked up the blow and have been busy showing it again and again ever since.				 																																	After seeing Romarios hotheaded action for himself Fluminense manager Renato Portaluppi said on Tuesday: Romario is the captain and must give an example to the group.				 																																	Romario has been docked 40 per cent of his reported monthly salary of 51,000 euros. He is also facing a maximum four-match ban. The controversy lifts the lid on a more deep-rooted problem  tension between Romario and his teammates  who are upset at what they regard as the privileges he receives, like a hefty salary in these cash-strapped times. 				 																																	London: The English FA has given Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane an extra two days to respond to disrepute charges he faces over a controversial autobiography.				 																																	Keane must answer two FA charges relating to his account of an incident involving Manchester Citys Alf Inge Haaland. The charges were issued on September 4 and Keane originally had 14 days to respond, a period that expires on Wednesday.				 																																	Further to a request from Roy Keane, we can confirm that the FA has agreed to a 48-hour extension to the deadline, the FA said in a statement on its official website Tuesday. Keane now has until 4.00 pm GMT on Friday to respond. If Keane does not dispute the charges he faces the likelihood of a lengthy ban and/or a suspension.

He is the second manager to be fired this season following the sacking of Tetsuji Hashiratani in June.				 																																	South Korean Chang Woe-ryong will take over as caretaker manager as Sapporo attempt to haul themselves clear of the relegation zone.				 																																	n Cricket, ICC Champions Trophy: England vs Zimbabwe, live from 2.00 pm on SET Max n General: Sportsline, live from 7.30 pm on STAR Sports n Soccer: Uefa Champions League, live from 12.00 midnight (Thursday) on ESPN

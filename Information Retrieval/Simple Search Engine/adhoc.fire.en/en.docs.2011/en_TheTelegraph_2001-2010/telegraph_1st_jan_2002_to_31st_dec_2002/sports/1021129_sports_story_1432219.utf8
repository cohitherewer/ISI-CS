		 Friday, November 29, 2002 				 Leverkusen not to buy new strikers 
																								Berlin: Bayer Leverkusen will not enter the transfer market to solve their goalscoring problems, the clubs commercial manager Reiner Calmund said on Thursday.																								We will definitely not be buying any strikers, Calmund said after Leverkusen lost 1-2 at home to Barcelona on Wednesday in their first Champions League second group phase match.																								Calmund acknowledged that the western German club were suffering a dip in form, while denying they had a lack of firepower up front.																								We as a club dont have an attacking problem, although the strikers themselves are having problems. That needs to be sorted out as soon as possible, Calmund said.																								Leverkusen have scored 19 goals in 14 German league matches this season while conceding 22 and have only won four times. League leaders Bayern Munich have scored 31 times.																								Our strikers are driving me mad. They lose the ball too often, cant defend and dont use their chances. Im getting more grey hairs, he told the SID news agency.

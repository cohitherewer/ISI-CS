		 Thursday, September 26, 2002 				 Im not looking too far ahead: Steve
 FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR				 	 STEVE: Ashes may be the last stop 																								Colombo: Is Steve Waugh planning to call it a day? Has he given up all hope of playing in his fifth World Cup? Are family and other associations gaining more prominence in his personal life after over a decade of international cricket? Will the Ashes be his last hurrah?																								Those were the questions that crossed ones mind as he sat aloof and alone at the breakfast table at the Taj Samudra. No disturbance from autograph hunters, and no one invading his privacy. 																								The Australian Test skipper is here for the Test series versus Pakistan that follows the ICC Champions Trophy, but his mind is already focussed on the Ashes and beyond.																								He may not admit it  unless theres a dramatic change in perspective  but he has resigned himself to the fact that the 2003 World Cup is beyond him. The Ashes might just be his last stop.																								I would say its a possibility. But Ill keep playing as long as I enjoy it and there will be other factors that are going to come in. I wouldnt decide to put an end to it, but play accordingly, decide on playing as best as I can in the next game and then look at the game after, Steve said.																								Im not going to say Im going to end on a certain day because its too far off for me in that regard. Im 37 and not going to continue till Im 47. Youve got to start thinking about it. 																								I never dwell on such things, like I never thought as to when I would start playing for Australia. You play because youre good enough to play. And if those things arent in place then its good enough to stop, he explained.																								But one thing is for certain. He is not going to let the selectors call the shots. 																								Any one would like to decide on his own fate. I would love to go on my own terms. I just want to play good cricket and enjoy it and Im not going to force the decision on me. Im hoping that everything will fall in place in the process, Steve said.																								Does this create any extra pressure? I dont see myself under any pressure. The other day I saw Nasser Hussain talking about it. It may be true for him, Sourav (Ganguly) or any other player, but not me. Its a professional sport and you dont expect a free ride.																								He also focussed nostalgically on his career. I have done well over the past 10 years and had only one off season last year. I dont know too many players who have done so.																								Im not looking too far ahead, concentrate on the Test series versus Pakistan. Its something Ive learnt over the past six to 12 months. Make sure you play well and not look too far ahead.																								A six-week pre-season stint with Kent in the county circuit has made him look fitter and much more focussed. The hunger to succeed remains intact. Nothing has changed for the way we play Test cricket. Wed love to win every Test. But were not going to win every Test as we saw the last time in England. Since we play to win, theres going to be a result until rain interrupts.																								Steve prefers to keep a distance from the other members until the tournament ends. Ill stay a little bit aloof from the side until the Test matches begin. 																								Obviously, were going to meet up and cross each other but I would prefer to keep a little distance until the Tests start. I think thats the fair thing to do since Ricky Ponting is the captain and has done well. Its not right for me to hang in there and jump into their one-day campaign. 																								I have been in this sort of situation for six months. Im here to play Test match cricket along with Mark and Justin Langer and concentrate on that. The Champions Trophy is still on and so I would like to give those guys a bit of breathing space. Itll basically be getting to the nets and doing some hard work for us.																								But wont it difficult for the players to adjust to two different captains within a span of few days? 																								I dont see any problem at all. Weve done it before when I led the one-day side and Mark Taylor was in charge of the Test side. I get along very well with Ricky.																								He did not wish to say much on the controversies dogging Pakistan cricket. The last few days have been some players pull out and some injured. Its hard to keep a track on it. Ive just heard that the manager is not there any more. Theres obviously been some problem and its unfair for me to say anything since Im not aware of whats happening behind the scenes.																								The first Test is obviously going to be important. With most of the seniors not around, there will be some junior guys out there and its going to be even more difficult since we havent seen most of them. 																								Not the ideal situation, but I dont think we need to change too much. We know a few of the Pakistan players and how they play. The conditions will probably be the decisive factor and thats the reason Im here. To get plenty of practice on these wickets and get used to the heat.																								Steve also had a word of encouragement for the Indians. The Indians have shown good bench strength with some young guys coming around. Theres plenty of talent around.																								I thought the series versus England was a superb with some excellent batting, particularly from (Michael) Vaughan and (Marcus) Trescothick and (Rahul) Dravid, Sourav and Sachin (Tendulkar). Bowling-wise, I would have expected something better from both sides. The fourth Test was disappointing. Overall, I thought the standard was pretty good.

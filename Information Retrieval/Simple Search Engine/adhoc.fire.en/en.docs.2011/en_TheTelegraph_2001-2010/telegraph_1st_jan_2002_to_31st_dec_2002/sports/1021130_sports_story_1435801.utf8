																								Nyon: Newcastle United captain Alan Shearer was banned for two matches for violent conduct by Uefa on Friday following his clash with Inter Milans Fabio Cannavaro in this weeks Champions League match.																								Shearer was charged on the basis of video evidence after the two players jostled in the penalty area in Wednesdays second phase group A game, which Inter won 4-1 at St James Park.																								The incident was not seen by French referee Stephane Bre, who had earlier dismissed Shearers strike partner Craig Bellamy for an off-the-ball incident involving Inter defender Marco Materazzi. Shearer has until Monday night to lodge an appeal.																								He was quoted in the Sun on Friday as indicating he would appeal: I feel okay about it and I will defend it if I have to.																								The former England captain will miss Newcastles game against his manager Bobby Robsons old club Barcelona at the Nou Camp on December 10 and the away match against Bayer Leverkusen on February 18.

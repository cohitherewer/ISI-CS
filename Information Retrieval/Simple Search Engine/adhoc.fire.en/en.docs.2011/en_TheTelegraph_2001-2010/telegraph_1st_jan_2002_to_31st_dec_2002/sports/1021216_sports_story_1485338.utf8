		 Monday, December 16, 2002 				 Liverpool go down at Sunderland
				 	 Manchester Uniteds Ryan Giggs is tackled by West Ham Uniteds Christian Dailly at Old Trafford on Saturday. United won 3-0. (Reuters)																								London: A moment of madness from Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Kasey Keller helped an unsettled Arsenal salvage a 1-1 draw in a frenetic north London derby at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Keller, the US international, brought down Thierry Henry inside the area on the stroke of halftime and Robert Pires converted the resulting penalty to cancel out Christian Zieges stunning opener for the home side.																								The point shared restored the English champions outright lead of the Premier League with 36 points from 18 games, one more than second-placed Manchester United.																								In another match, a shell-shocked Liverpool suffered their fifth defeat in six league games, going down 1-2 at struggling Sunderland.																								Gavin McCann gave Sunderland a first half lead and, although his penalty miss on the hour was followed by a Milan Baros equaliser for Liverpool, striker Michael Proctor pounced for the home sides winner five minutes from time. It was Sunderlands first home league win over the Anfield club since 1958.																								Birmingham City leapfrogged Fulham in the table after their 1-0 win at Loftus Road. Although defender Darren Purse was sent off after 70 minutes, the Blues held on to a lead given to them by US striker Jovan Kirovski.																								At White Hart Lane, Spurs were left cursing missed chances as a famous victory went begging. Robbie Keane was culprit-in-chief. The Ireland striker had two efforts cleared off the line by Ashley Cole and two more strikes well saved by an inspired David Seaman.																								Another defeat would have intensified Arsenals mini-crisis but, despite four losses already this term, Wenger is content with his clubs progress. Weve had three tough games in a week and Im happy with the reaction of the players, said Wenger. I am satisfied with a draw today. 																								Ferguson pleased																								A rampant Manchester United recorded a 3-0 win over West Ham United Saturday, while Chelseas hopes of going to the top were dashed by a 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough.																								United, whose title bid is very much under way after wins over Arsenal and Liverpool, dominated throughout at Old Trafford and also welcomed back David Beckham to League duty as a second half substitute after a months injury absence.																								A 3-0 scorelines very good  Im pleased with that, Alex Ferguson said. We had to work for it....and we played some fantastic football at times. Verons goal was fantastic, we got a break with the third goal  the kind of break we werent getting a few weeks ago.  (REUTERS)

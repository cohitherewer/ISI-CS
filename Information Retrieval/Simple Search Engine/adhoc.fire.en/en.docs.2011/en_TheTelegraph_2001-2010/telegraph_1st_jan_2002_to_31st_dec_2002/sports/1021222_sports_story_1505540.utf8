The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, December 22, 2002 				 Right now, its late for a bowling coach: Sourav
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Dec. 21: For a change, the much-maligned bowlers have been reasonably spot-on. Moreover, with Zaheer Khan (specially) continuing to grow in stature, many feel the debate over hiring a bowling coach isnt totally relevant  even though ODIs are our top worry. 																								Influenced by somewhat different reasons, prime mover Sourav Ganguly feels much the same today.																								At this point, I doubt if a bowling coach will serve any purpose. Its got late and, then, the whole exercise will be futile unless the person is available for some length of time. With the World Cup even closer, we dont need one now, Sourav told The Telegraph this afternoon.																								[Incidentally, among the candidates, Fanie de Villiers couldnt commit himself for a specific period, while Terry Alderman sought an unbelievable $ 4,000 for each working day]																								His response came a day after the Boards key functionaries decided the captain, vice-captain Rahul Dravid and coach John Wright should unanimously make a recommendation before any appointment is considered.																								This afternoon, of course, Souravs mind was on what could be another stunning day in Hamilton.																								Unless the elements interfere, the sensational second Test will be over early tomorrow, the scheduled fourth day. Whatever the result, the fraternity will surely need time to recover from todays crash  featuring 22 wickets  at Westpac Park.																								Its another matter that much of the credit ought to be placed at curator Doug Strachens door and not Zaheer or Darryl Tuffey or Jacob Orams.																								Twenty-two wickets in a single day isnt a record, yet its not a seasonal occurrence either. Given the script for much of the day, New Zealand did well not to lose a wicket in their second innings  they would have, had Sanjay Bangar not dropped Lou Vincent  and, that, does give them an edge as they seek to knock off the 136 runs that remain.																								The captain, though, believes the Test is evenly poised.																								Theres little point talking of chances Whatever has to be done, must now be on the field Still, if you ask me, its a fifty-fifty game, Sourav opined, an hour or so after the delayed stumps on Day-III.																								Speaking in a tone which, understandably, didnt exactly convey he was relaxed, he added: Actually, our chances will brighten if we get an early breakthrough The trend, after all, has been that if you pick one, you are almost assured of picking a couple more																								Well have to be patient and keep hitting the right length. With the wicket seaming wildly and the bounce uneven, getting the length right is most important.																								Asked whether he was confident of paying back New Zealand in the same coin, after the Indian first innings folded at 99, Sourav answered: For the reasons stated, yes, but full marks to Zaheer Having said that, its a fact that weve been offered poor wickets.																								Its also a fact that Sourav had a poor run in both Tests  17, 2; 5,5. Among other things, this sequence prevented him from reaching 1,000 runs in 2002.																								Its disappointing but, then, what to do? Next time, when I come close, Ill try not to miss out, the captain, who finished on 945, replied.																								The disappointment will be much less if Stephen Fleming (the Indians lacked commitment in the first innings) is made to eat his words.

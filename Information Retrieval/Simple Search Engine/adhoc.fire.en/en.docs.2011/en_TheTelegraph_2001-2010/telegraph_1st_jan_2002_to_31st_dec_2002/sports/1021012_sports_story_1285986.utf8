		 Saturday, October 12, 2002 				 Saraswati uncertain for relay
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Busan, Oct. 11: The day after the biggest moment of her fledgling career, Saraswati Saha was busy getting herself fit for another medal at the 14th Asian Games.																								 Shortly after bursting off the blocks in the 200m final at the Asiad Main Stadium on Thursday morning, Saraswati felt an old pain  in her lower back. She completed the race in style but was in discomfort even as she spoke about her historic feat minutes later.																								 I want to run the relay on and win another medal, Saraswati said Friday. The good thing is I have another day to get better and be fully fit for that race.																								Susanthika Jayasinghe having pulled out of the relay with a hamstring injury, Indias medal chances have brightened. The MRI has confirmed that Susanthika has a serious problem, which will keep her out for at least four weeks, her coach Devin Pereira said. The star Lanka sprinter had withdrawn from the 200 final shortly before the race.																								 If she runs on Sunday, Saraswati will anchor the 4x100 team, the others being Rachita Mistry, Vinita Tripathy and Anuradha Biswal or Jayalaskhmi.																								In the 4x400 womens relay, also on Sunday, Soma Biswas is expected to team up with K.M. Beenamol, Manjuma and Jincy Philips.

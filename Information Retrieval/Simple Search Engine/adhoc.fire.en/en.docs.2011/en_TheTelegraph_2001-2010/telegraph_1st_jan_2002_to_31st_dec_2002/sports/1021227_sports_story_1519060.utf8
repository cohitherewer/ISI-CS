		 Friday, December 27, 2002 				 Jacques Kallis holds up Pakistan
				 	 Jacques Kallis (104 batting) evades a short ball on the first day of the first Test in Durban Thursday																								Durban: Jacques Kallis scored his 11th century to stabilise the South African innings on a rain-affected opening day of the first Test against Pakistan on Thursday.																								His unbeaten 104 guided the home side to 250 for five after Waqar Younis put them in. Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq claimed his 200th wicket despite a tough day in the field.																								Kallis faced 220 balls, his knock including 11 fours and a six, and featured in partnerships of 122 for the third wicket with opener Gary Kirsten and 55 for the fifth with Neil McKenzie. Kirsten scored 56. Waqar took two for 54.																								Kirsten and Kallis began their partnership after South Africa had slipped to 33 for two in the ninth over. Graeme Smith was out in the sixth over for 16 when he pushed forward to a Mohammed Sami delivery edged it to Kamran Akmal.																								Three overs later, Herschelle Gibbs slashed at a ball from Waqar to Faisal Iqbal at backward point.																								Ive had plenty of starts here and scored 60s and 70s, and its great to get a hundred on one of the bounciest pitches in the country, Kallis said. The ball did something all day and reversed a lot, so you never felt in.																								If we can eke out 400 well be in a good position.																								Just before tea, Saqlain claimed two wickets in two overs to reach 200 wickets.																								Kirsten failed to control a quicker delivery and flighted the ball to Younis Khan before Boeta Dippenaar was caught off the bottom edge.  (REUTERS)

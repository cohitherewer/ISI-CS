		 Monday, December 16, 2002 				 Hussain vows to stay for as long as needed
																								London: Under-fire Nasser Hussain on Sunday dismissed reports that he is ready to quit as England cricket captain and has vowed to continue as long as his country needs him.																								Hussains future has been under question following his sides disastrous Ashes tour of Australia.																								Although he has not dismissed the possibility of being replaced after next years World Cup, Hussain said that he was not ready to go yet.																								Various things  far too many in fact  have been written about my future, said Hussain, writing in the Sunday Telegraph. What I can say is that it would be unprofessional to think beyond this tour and the World Cup at present.																								After the World Cup will be the time to sit down with Duncan Fletcher (England coach) and the rest of the selectors and talk about my future, and then it will be whats best for English cricket and not whats best for Nasser Hussain.																								Ive captained England for longer than I ever dreamed, for almost four years. If it is time to stand down after the World Cup and for someone else to take over as captain, Im fine with that. Or if there are so many younger personnel in the Test side that they need someone of experience to lead the team out against South Africa, Id be fine with that too. 																								Hussain also called for more young players to be broken into the Test team to replace the large number of experienced players missing. (AFP)

				 																																	Milan: Brazilian winger Eriberto, who plays in Italys Serie A with Chievo Verona, has admitted he has played under a false identity and age for the past six years. In an interview with Corriere dello Sport, Eriberto, says he used false documentation to claim he was four years younger than his real age 27.				 																																	Eriberto, real name Luciano Siqueira, is currently in Brazil where he has confessed to the fraud to a tribunal in Sao Paulo. I know I have made a mistake and that weight has been with me and I have been unable to live calmly, Eriberto told the paper. From today it is no longer like that and I feel happy again.				 																																	Corriere says Eriberto, registered as Da Conceicao Silva Eriberto, took up the false name and age in 1996 before joining Brazilian club Palmeiras.At the time he claimed he was 16-years-old when in fact he was 20. Two seasons later he joined Italian club Bologna.				 																																	Eriberto said he chose a false age and identity because he was desperate to become a professional footballer and so agreed to a plan to use a false identity.				 																																	Eriberto said he found it difficult to live with the deceipt and that he wanted his son to take his real family name. 				 																																	Tokyo: Yokohama Stadium International is about to sell off a piece of World Cup history  the field from the Brazil-Germany championship match.				 																																	Beginning on Sunday, 30,000 commemorative patches of grass and soil from the June 30 game field will go on sale at the stadium gift shop, spokesman Yoshihiko Muramoto said. Each piece, measuring roughly 55mm by 40mm and encased in a block of acrylic, will cost $20. Sales will be limited to three per person.				 																																	Seoul: A South Korean golfer has achieved a hole-in-one at the same hole where his mother aced out six years earlier. Kim Joong-min, a 45-year-old businessman, aced the 200-yard, 15th hole at Nambu Country Club south of Seoul and is having thousands of pink golf balls inscribed with hole-in-one in black lettering to commemorate his achievement.				 																																	Im even thinking of sending this to the Guinness Book (of Records), Kim said on Friday. 				 																																	Weve never seen anything like it, said Hyun Deuk-kwon, a club official.				 																																	South Koreans believe that a hole-in-one brings 30 years of luck, but the fortunate golfer is obliged to make a donation to the club where the ace was achieved.				 																																	Kims 70-year-old mother, Choi Sook-hee, aced the 15th on June 22, 1996 and a tree and a stone monument have since marked the spot.				 																																	Taipei: Taiwans Lu Wen-teh fired a seven-under-par 65 to take a one-shot lead after Round II of the Asian PGA Tours Taiwan Masters on Friday.

Overnight leader Aaron Meeks of the US, who opened with a 65, was in second place after carding a 70.				 																																	New Delhi: The BCCI has increased the retirement age of umpires who have officiated in Test matches from 55 to 60 years, while the retirement age for umpires who have supervised only in one-day Internationals has gone up to 58 from 55 years.				 																																	The decision was taken at the Boards working committee meeting in Bangalore on Wednesday after the BCCI Umpires Committee had submitted its proposals.				 																																	The Board also decided that a daily report on umpires officiating in matches conducted by it should be obtained from both captains by the match referee from the forthcoming season.				 																																	In the past, the match referees used to collect only the captains report after the completion of the match.

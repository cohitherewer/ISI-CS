		 Saturday, December 21, 2002 				 Strokeplay title for Manav Das 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: Manav Das survived a battle of nerves and prevailed over Vikram Rana in a sudden death play-off to emerge champion in the stroke-play event of the Goodricke East India amateur golf championship at RCGC Friday. 																								Vikram, who finished the opening round behind Manav and Gagan Verma, staged a remarkable comeback and shot a one-over par, while the overnight leader dropped five shots. 																								Manav and Vikram, thus, were tied at one-over par for 36 holes and the sudden-death play-off followed. 																								On the first hole, both missed the green with their second shots. On the third hole, they put their shots on the green. 																								Thereafter, Vikram made two putt par, but Manav took the fight away from him, by sinking a long 25 foot putt for a birdie.

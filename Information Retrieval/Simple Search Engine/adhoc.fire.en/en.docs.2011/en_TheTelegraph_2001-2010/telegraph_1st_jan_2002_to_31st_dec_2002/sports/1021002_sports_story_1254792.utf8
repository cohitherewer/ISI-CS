		 Wednesday, October 02, 2002 				 Usha to meet old foe
																								Busan: It would be a nostalgic moment for Indias sprint queen P.T.Usha and Lydia Divega of the Philippines when the two great athletes come face to face at the Asian Games after a long gap of 16 years. In Seoul in 1986 Divega beat Usha to win the womens 100m. But Usha took her revenge in the 200m winning the gold ahead of Divega. (PTI)

				 	 SOURAV: No excuse																								Wellington, Dec. 14 (PTI): Dismissing the embarrassing ten-wicket loss in the first Test against New Zealand as just one bad game, India captain Sourav Ganguly said Saturday his team had the potential to bounce back and square the two-match series.																								It was just one bad game. It is now important to get the mindset right and try to bounce back, Sourav said after India lost the Test within three days. We batted below par. We have to put up an improved performance in Hamilton.																								We had fought back by getting them out for 247 and needed 250-300 in the second innings. Theres no point giving an excuse of having played too much cricket. It can be hard touring but we have to get used to it, he said.																								Coach John Wright was also disappointed with his batsmens inept display, saying they lacked application.																								 I am disappointed because this was the pitch where our bowlers could have taken 20 wickets. If we had taken a lead of 150-160, we could have put pressure on New Zealand.																								Wright said discipline was key to batting well in New Zealand but the Indians failed to adjust to the conditions.																								It is important to leave a lot of deliveries outside the off-stump. Mark Richardson just showed how to bat on this wicket, commented Wright as he commended the openers match-winning 89 in the first innings.

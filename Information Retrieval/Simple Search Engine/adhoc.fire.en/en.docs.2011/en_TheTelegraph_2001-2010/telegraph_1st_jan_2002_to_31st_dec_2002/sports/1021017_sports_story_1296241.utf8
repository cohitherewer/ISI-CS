				 																																	Johannesburg: Orthodox left-arm spinner Claude Henderson will replace the injured Paul Adams in the South Africa team to meet Bangladesh in the first Test starting in East London on Friday.				 																																	A United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) media release said left-arm wrist spinner Adams was withdrawn after sustaining a back injury on Sunday while playing for Western Province against Natal in a domestic first class match.				 																																	At that stage Paul thought it was just a spasm, but when he returned to Cape Town and consulted a doctor the diagnosis was that there was some disc movement, said convenor of selectors Omar Henry.				 																																	Henderson, 30, made his Test debut against Australia last season. He has played five Tests and taken 19 wickets at 43.84. He wins a recall because another left-arm spinner Nicky Boje fractured a finger during the Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka in September and the promising Robin Peterson has been deemed too inexperienced to make the step up to Test level.				 																																	New Delhi: Former New Zealand first-class batsman Mark Parker was among the victims of the Bali bomb blasts which claimed 187 lives last week. According to a cricket website, Parker, 27, who played for Otago alongside off-spinner Paul Wiseman, was considered a talented batsman. Son of former New Zealand Test cricketer Murray Parker and nephew of another Test cap John Parker, Mark had also led a New Zealand Under-20 rugby team. He was in Bali on his way back home after playing for an English club in the summer. 				 																																	I have known the Parkers for a long time, and Marks death is sad news indeed, Indian cricket coach John Wright told PTI in Chennai.

The Concacaf confirmed on Tuesday that the victory was the largest ever in official international club competition.				 																																	According to the International Federation of Football History and Statistics, the score eclipses the previous best of 18-0 by Suwon Bluewings of South Korea against Saunders SC of Sri Lanka in last years Asian Cup Winners Cup.				 																																	Alfredo Barrera scored five of Arabe Unidos goals in a 27-minute spell of the second half. Blas Perez and Alfredo Anderson each added a hat-trick for the Panamanian club, located in the port city of Colon at the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal.

The daily, drawing upon sources involved in the case, said in a report Tuesday the retired tennis star will be slapped with two years probation and will pay $ 2.3 million in back taxes, plus penalty on money.

Cash, who won the Wimbledon title in 1987, was the last Australian to win the grasscourt tournament before current No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt clinched the 2002 Wimbledon crown. His induction into the Hall of Fame will be held immediately before the Australian Open mens final on January 26.				 																																	London: Alain Baxter, Britains first Alpine skiing Olympic medallist, has lost an appeal to have his bronze medal from this years Salt Lake Games reinstated. 				 																																	Baxter was stripped of his slalom bronze medal by the IOC in March after failing a drugs test.

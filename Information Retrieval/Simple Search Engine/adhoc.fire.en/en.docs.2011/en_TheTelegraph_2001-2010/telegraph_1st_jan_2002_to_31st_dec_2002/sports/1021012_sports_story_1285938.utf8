The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, October 12, 2002 				 Australia send Pak packing for 59
				 	 Shane Warne (four for 11) in action in Sharjah on Friday																								Sharjah, Oct. 11 (AFP): Shane Warne grabbed four for 11 as Australia shot out Pakistan for their lowest-ever total of 59 on the opening day of the second Test here today.																								The Australians then tightened the noose around their rivals by closing the day at 191 for four, a lead of 132 with six first-innings wickets in hand.																								Left-handed Matthew Hayden returned unconquered on 74 after Australia lost three wickets for three runs, including the Waugh twins off successive balls from Saqlain Mushtaq.																								Justin Langer was unlucky to be run out for 37 when bowler Danish Kaneria missed a return catch off Hayden but deflected the ball onto the stumps with Langer out of his ground.																								After Ricky Ponting was dismissed by Kaneria for 44, Saqlain trapped Mark Waugh leg before for two and then had captain Steve caught at silly point next ball. Damien Martyn prevented the hattrick and was unbeaten on 19 when play ended eight overs early due to bad light.																								Warne, who took 11 wickets in the first Test in Colombo to lead Australias 41-run win, again tormented his rivals with three wickets in 10 balls before lunch.																								Warne now has 465 Test wickets, second only behind world record holder Courtney Walsh of the West Indies, who retired last season with a haul of 519. Pakistans previous lowest total was 62, also against Australia in Perth in 1981.

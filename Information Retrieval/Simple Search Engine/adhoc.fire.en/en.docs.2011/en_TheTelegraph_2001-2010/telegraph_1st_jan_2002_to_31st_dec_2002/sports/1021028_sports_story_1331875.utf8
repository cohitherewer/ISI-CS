				 	 Mornantau Hayward is congratulated by teammates after dismissing Mohammed Al Shahriar at Potchefstroom Sunday. (AFP)																								Potchefstroom: Jacques Kallis took five wickets in 12 balls to cap a superb allround performance as South Africa beat Bangladesh by an innings and 160 runs in the second Test on Sunday.																								Bangladesh were dismissed for just 107 on the third day with Kallis finishing with five for 21 to go with his undefeated 139 in South Africas only innings. The victory gave South Africa a clean sweep of the two-Test series.																								Kallis dismissed the final five Bangladesh batsmen after good work at the start of the innings by Makhaya Ntini and Mornantau Hayward. The Bangladeshis had no answer to the allrounders extra bounce on what had been a lifeless track with each of the five batsmen either caught-behind or at mid-wicket mistiming pull shots.																								The Bangladesh innings was rocked early when Ntini struck twice before lunch. He continued to prosper, Kallis taking a sharp chance at second slip to dismiss Sanwar Hossain.																								Kallis produced an even better effort shortly when Al Sahariar got an edge to a sharp delivery from Hayward. Hayward picked up a second when Tushar Imran miscued a pull to be caught at short square-leg.																								Earlier, Shaun Pollock made an enterprising declaration with South Africa 267 runs ahead on 482 for five. The morning session had provided some long-awaited relief for the Bangladesh bowlers. Seamer Talha Jubair had bowled well without success earlier in the innings but finally earned his reward with the wickets of Gary Kirsten and Ashwell Prince in the days fourth over.																								Kirsten had added only six runs to his overnight score when he attempted to glide a wide delivery down to thirdman and succeeded only in guiding it into the gloves of Khaled Mashud.																								It was the end of a six-hour knock from Kirsten, during which he faced 228 balls and struck 17 fours and a rare six. It also ended a partnership of 234 for the third wicket with Kallis.																								Four deliveries later Prince was back in the pavilion, beaten by a good delivery from Jubair which angled across the left-hander and took the edge.																								Tapash Baisya made the third breakthrough of the morning when he trapped Martin van Jaarsveld plumb in front. (REUTERS)

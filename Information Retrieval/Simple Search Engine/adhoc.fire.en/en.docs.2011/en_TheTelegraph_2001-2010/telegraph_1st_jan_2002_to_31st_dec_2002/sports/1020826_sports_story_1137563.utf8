 (AFP)				 	 Ponting: Speaking from the front																								Brisbane: Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist expect some tough questions to be answered during an intense nine-month examination of Australias Test and ODI sides.																								Australian limited-overs captain Ponting, who will interchange the leadership with Test skipper Steve Waugh, was buoyant about the teams long-term future on the eve of his teams departure for a triangular series against Pakistan and hosts Kenya and next months 12-nation ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka.																								During the next nine months Australia will also play three Tests against Pakistan, host an Ashes series and a triangular one-day series involving England and Sri Lanka before defending their World Cup title in South Africa in February. They will then tour the West Indies.																								Ponting said on Sunday he was not concerned about swapping the leadership role back and forth with Steve, who has been axed from the one-day squad along with brother Mark.																								While Ponting conceded it could be a little disruptive he didnt see it as a major issue.																								It probably will be a little bit disruptive but weve been there and done it all before and its never really been much of a problem. It may be something we may have to sit down and talk about before things get underway.																								But knowing the way Steven is and the way I approach things with cricket and the captaincy, I cant see it being a problem, said the Tasmanian stroke-player.

				 	 WARNE: Hoping to make it to World Cup																								Melbourne: Australias Shane Warne believes he is progressing well in his recovery from a shoulder injury in a bid to play in the World Cup in South Africa in February.																								The leg spinner dislocated his right bowling shoulder when he dived for a ball during a one-day match against England in Melbourne on December 15.																								When I saw Errol Alcott (team physio) on Christmas Eve, he was very happy with my movement and was very happy with my progress a week after an operation, the 33-year-old said in an interview aired on Australia television on Thursday.																								If I keep improving like that then my chances will be good. It all comes down to confidence, added Warne, who was a key figure in Australias 1999 World Cup success.																								Its too early to say that (to give a percentage on his chances). At this stage, all I know is Im committed to the rehab, Im committed to what I have to do in the next four to six weeks and hopefully Ill be on that plane to the World Cup.																								To keep my fitness up, to keep my shoulder work going with Errol and just do whatever I can, and whatever it takes it I will do that and if that means Im not right for the World Cup then so be it. Im just going to give it my best shot. (Reuters)

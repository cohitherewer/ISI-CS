		 Monday, October 28, 2002 				 Romario pulls Fluminense ahead 
																								Rio de Janeiro: Romario won and converted a controversial late penalty to give Fluminense a 3-2 win over Botafogo in the Rio de Janeiro derby at the weekend.																								Romario went tumbling in the penalty area after a challenge from Botafogo goalkeeper Carlos Germano but television replays suggested that no contact had been made.																								The 36-year-old former Brazil striker, who had wasted three excellent chances earlier in the game, calmly converted the 80th-minute kick following furious Botafogo protests to claim his 12th goal of the championship.																								Botafogo led twice, through a Galenao penalty and a Leo Inacio free kick, but defender Cesar and striker Magno Alves hit back each time.																								The win lifted Fluminense to tenth in the table and put them back into the fight for a top-eight finish and a place in the knockout stages. Botafogo are 24th and stuck in the relegation zone.																								Sao Paulo goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni scored from a free kick as the leaders won 3-1 at Portuguesa to all but clinch a quarter final place. 																								Rogerios goal, midway through the first half, was the 29th of his career but his first of the championship. Its been a long time since I scored and Im very happy, said the Brazil international.

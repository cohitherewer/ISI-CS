		 Friday, November 15, 2002 				 Govt to set up probe panel
				 	 SUNITA: Under scanner again																								New Delhi: Even as the athletic federation gave a clean chit to middle-distance runner Sunit Rani after its internal probe, the government Thursday instituted a high-level committee to inquire into the doping scandal.																								It has asked the committee, headed by former sports secretary S. S. Sharma, to submit its report within three months.																								The decision to set up the committee was taken by sports ministry in view of the wide ranging concern over the issue.																								The inquiry committee will also include among others Prof. Y. K. Gupta, department of pharmacology in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, an official press release said here today.																								Sunita was stripped of her gold and bronze medals after she tested positive for banned substance nandrolone during the Busan Asian Games but has vehemently denied having taken any performance-enhancing drugs.																								The committee, constituted almost a month after the doping fiasco broke out, will go into the role of the Amateur Athletic Federation of India (AAFI), Sports Authority of India (SAI), manager of the team and coaches.																								The committee will suggest measures which could have been taken to avoid such a situation, ascribe responsibility wherever possible and recommend measures to prevent recurrence of such instances.																								The constitution of a government committee, barely three days after the middle distance runner was given a clean chit by the AAFI, has given a new twist to the doping controversy. 																								During its process of inquiry, the committee may consult experts in sports medicine or any other related field and subsequently recommend measures for prevention of doping in sports.  (PTI)

		 Saturday, September 21, 2002 				 Inzamam may miss World Cup
																								Colombo: Pakistan batsman Inzamam-ul Haq is to undergo heel surgery in Australia that will sideline him from the game for at least two months.																								I have been told I have to have an operation. The doctor has told me it will take eight weeks (to recover), Inzamam said on Friday. I will leave for Australia on (September) 28th or 29th, said Inzamam, who consulted an Australian specialist in Colombo after the injury ruled him out of the Champions Trophy.																								The operation for the long-term problem means the 32-year-old will miss a three-Test series against Australia that starts in the Sri Lankan capital on October 3 and he could also miss next years World Cup in South Africa.																								He had been told by doctors that his heel might hold up until after the World Cup but Mudassar Nazar, sacked as team coach earlier this week, said surgery could jeopardise his World Cup participation.																								Pakistan sorely missed Inzamams presence during their pool 4 defeat against hosts Sri Lanka, who went on to qualify for the semi-finals. Pakistan play the Netherlands on Saturday.																								Inzamam has been Pakistans most dependable run-getter in the last two seasons and hit 329 against New Zealand in May to register the 10th highest score in Test history.																								The Test series against Australia was shifted out of Pakistan after the visitors refused to travel there because of security concerns. The teams will move on to the Gulf venue of Sharjah to play the last two Tests.  (REUTERS)

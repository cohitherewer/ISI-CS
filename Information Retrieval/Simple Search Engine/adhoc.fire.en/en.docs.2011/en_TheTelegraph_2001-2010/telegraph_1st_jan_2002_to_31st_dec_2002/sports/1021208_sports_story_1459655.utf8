New Delhi: His dream of competing alongside his icon may take some time to come true. 				 																																	But right now Indias new motoracing hero Karun Chandhok is just looking forward to a face-to-face meeting with ace Formula 1 and Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya. I have been invited to see the Williams factory in London on December 13 and spend a day with Montoya, Chandhok, who is here for a promotional tour, said Saturday. Though he was not aware of the exact itinerary of his visit, Chandhok, who aims to take a F1 test in 2004, said the encounter with the former F1 champion would be a good first hand experience as to what the world of formula racing is all about.				 																																	New York: Heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis has been awarded $1.17 million in damages from a lawyer he accused of failing to protect him. A jury of seven women and one man awarded the damages Friday after Lewis accused the lawyer, Milton Chwasky, of letting promoter Panos Eliades take money from his expense account.				 																																	Lewis won an $8 million verdict against Eliades for fraud in February. After the verdict, Lewis blasted the boxing establishment for lining up behind his courtroom adversary. 				 																																	Milan: The Italian soccer league has lifted a one-game ban on AS Romas home field, originally decided following the violent behaviour of some Roman fans. The disciplinary commission Friday instead increased the teams fine from 20,000 Euros to 50,000 euros.				 																																	The decision means that AS Roma will be allowed to play its next home match against Reggina on December 15 at its home ground. The original suspension had been levied after powerful fireworks launched by Roman fans during the Parma-Roma Serie A match on November 24 caused severe hand injuries to a firefighter.

Heskey is reported to be a 12 million target of Londoners Tottenham Hotspur when the transfer window re-opens in January but Frenchman Houllier said the 24-year-old was not for sale. 				 																																	Houllier told BBC Sport Online: This will not happen. There is no chance of Emile being sold and there is no point in anyone asking. You can add more to that figure and he will still not be leaving. Emile is happy to be at Liverpool.				 																																	Melbourne: Grant Hackett upset Olympic sprint champion Pieter van den Hoogenband to win the 200m freestyle final at the Australian leg of the World Cup Saturday with the second fastest time in history.

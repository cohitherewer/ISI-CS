				 																																	Atlanta: The son of Soviet Olympic gymnastics star Olga Korbut was sentenced to almost three and a half years in federal custody for making $20,000 in counterfeit money. 				 																																	Richard Bortkevich, 23, pleaded guilty in September. Your mother paid an awful lot of dues to become an Olympic gold medal winner, US district judge J. Owen Forrester told Bortkevich. If you pay those dues, youll turn out a winner, too.				 																																	Korbut, who now lives in Atlanta, was not in court, but sent a letter supporting her son.				 																																	The native of Belarus admitted using a computer to make the money. A deputy sheriff found fake $100 bills at his familys suburban home in December while attempting to serve eviction papers to Korbuts former husband, Leonid Bortkevich.				 																																	Athens: The Greek athletic federation (Segas) has hit back at claims that some of their athletes have been avoiding making themselves available for doping tests.

Segas issued a statement saying Greek athletes have always and will always abide by the IAAFS regulations on doping.We were surprised to hear that inspectors had come to Greece three times recently, asked athletes to take tests and found very few athletes abiding. This unbelievable charge comes just days after all our athletes passed doping controls without any problems, the Segas statement said on Monday.

I will not let Uli Hoeness insult me in public and I well not let anybody stain my name, said Matthaeus.

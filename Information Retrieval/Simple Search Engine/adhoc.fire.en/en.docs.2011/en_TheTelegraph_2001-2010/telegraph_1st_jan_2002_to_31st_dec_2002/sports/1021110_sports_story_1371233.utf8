		 Sunday, November 10, 2002 				 Kallis puts SA in command 
																								Johannesburg, Nov. 9 (Reuters): Jacques Kallis trademark unbeaten 75 of patience and power helped South Africa take control of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Saturday.																								At stumps South Africa were 378 for seven wickets in their first innings, a lead of 186. 																								Kallis was last dismissed in a Test match in the first innings of the third Test against Australia in Durban on March 15 this year and has since spent 903 minutes at the crease without being dismissed. His 75 came in nearly five hours off 212 balls and included eight boundaries.																								Sri Lankan bowler Ruchira Perera received his third warning for running on the pitch and was forced out of the attack for the rest of the innings. To compound their woes, the Sri Lankans conceded 62 extras, only nine short of the record 71 conceded by the West Indies against Pakistan in 1987-88.

These cars have stock 800cc Maruti engines, with a stripped down chassis and body. They are 320kg kerb weight cars, and a barely three-day practice session was what the only Calcutta entrant had with them. I aim for the Asian circuit from where I can grab sponsors. So far, it has all been family money, said Amittrajit Saturday.

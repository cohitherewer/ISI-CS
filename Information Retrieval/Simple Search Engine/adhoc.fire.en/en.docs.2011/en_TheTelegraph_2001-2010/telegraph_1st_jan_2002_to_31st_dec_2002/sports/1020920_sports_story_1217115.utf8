				 																																	Strasbourg: French first division club Racing Strasbourg have sacked Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose-Luis Chilavert in a row over an alleged contract forgery.				 																																	Jose-Luis Chilavert was sacked today by Racing Club Strasbourg. His dismissal letter was sent today by the club, Strasbourg said on their website on Thursday.				 																																	Club president Patrick Proisy said he had filed a complaint alleging forgery to a Strasbourg court over a contract produced by Chilavert which Proisy claims is false.				 																																	Jacksonville: Bullet Bob Hayes, the former Olympic gold medal sprinter and star Dallas Cowboys receiver who was once known as the fastest man alive, died on Wednesday in his hometown of Jacksonville, a hospital spokeswoman said Thursday. He was 59.				 																																	Hayes, who won two Olympic gold medals at the 1964 Tokyo Games and whose blazing speed reshaped professional footballs passing game, died of complications from his battles with prostate cancer as well as liver and kidney ailments. He won the 100m dash in Tokyo, with a world record time of 10 seconds flat. He also anchored the US 400m relay team to victory.				 																																	Edina (Minnesota): US Open womens champion Juli Inkster Wednesday condemned the Augusta National Golf Club, venue for The Masters mens major tournament, for continuing to deny women membership.				 																																	Two days before the 42-year-old leads the US attempt to win back the Solheim Cup from Europe at Interlachen Country Club, the seven-times major winner said of the Georgia Club: I cant believe were still fighting for this stuff. Its a PGA-sanctioned event and they are not abiding by their own set of rules. They boycott courses for racial reasons, but not for excluding women.				 																																	London: Ian Hutchinson, centre-forward in Chelseas 1970 FA Cup winning side, died on Thursday after a lengthy illness at the age of 54, the English Premier League club said. 				 																																	Hutchinson, a strike partner for Peter Osgood, made his name with a trademark long throw-in and played 144 games for the club from 1968 to his retirement in 1976, scoring 58 goals.

The exact cause of his death can only be known once the post-mortem report comes in, the police said, adding, heart attack could not be ruled out as one of the causes of 19-year-old Antils death. 				 																																	A massive search had been on since Tuesday morning with divers of the Para Commandos, CRPF, Chandigarh Police and Lake Club pitching in. 				 																																	n Cricket: Champions Trophy, Australia vs Kenya live from 2 pm on SET Max n Soccer: Premier League preview from 7.30 pm on ESPN

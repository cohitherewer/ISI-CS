		 Saturday, December 07, 2002 				 Juventus ease to 2-0 win
																								Rome: A penalty by Marcelo Salas and a late goal by Marcelo Zalayeta gave Juventus a 2-0 away win over Reggina in their Italian Cup third round first leg match on Thursday.																								Earlier, Bologna were held to a 1-1 draw by lowly Serie B club Vicenza, while a dour clash between under-strength Piacenza and Chievo Verona sides ended in the same scoreline.																								A deadlocked first half gave way to a more open second half in which Reggina threatened to go ahead when a clever move left Gianluca Savoldi one-on-one with goalkeeper Antonio Chimenti.																								Savoldi shot wide but in the 67th minute the Serie A champions went ahead. Reggina midfielder Giandomenico Mesto clumsily brought down Juventus winger Gianluca Zambrotta in the area, and Salas calmly despatched the resulting penalty.																								Salas substitute, Zalayeta, volleyed home Juventus second goal from close range a minute from the end of normal time. (REUTERS)

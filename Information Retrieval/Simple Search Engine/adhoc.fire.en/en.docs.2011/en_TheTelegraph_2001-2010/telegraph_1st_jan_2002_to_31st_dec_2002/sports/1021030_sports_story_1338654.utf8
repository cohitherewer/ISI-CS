																								Karachi: Pakistan cricket captain Waqar Younis Tuesday welcomed the decision of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to penalise players for defeat and dispense rewards for victory.																								I think it will bear positive results and be a great motivation for the players to thwart a defeat and always go for the win, Waqar said.																								I dont see it as a threat and hope that players will do their best to cash in on these incentives, he hoped.																								Pakistani cricket will improve only with the mutual consent of players and the board and I see full co-operation between them. 																								The PCB will penalise players up to Rs 60,000 ($1,000) if they are not up to the fitness standards required for international cricket, a problem which has plagued the Pakistan team.																								The PCB has also maintained the cash incentives introduced last year. A batsman will get Rs 2.5 lakh for a double century and Rs. 1 lakh for each century. A five-wicket haul will fetch a bowler Rs1 lakh and six or more wickets would earn him Rs 2 lakh.A wicketkeeper will gain one lakh if he gets four or more victims, while a fielder will also get a lakh for four catches or a run-out.

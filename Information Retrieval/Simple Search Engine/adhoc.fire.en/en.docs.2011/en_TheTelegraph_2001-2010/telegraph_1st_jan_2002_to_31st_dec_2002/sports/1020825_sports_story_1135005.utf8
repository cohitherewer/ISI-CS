Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								telegraph chess																								Calcutta, Aug. 24: Overnight leaders Joydeep Dutta and Tanmoy Pattanayak retained their positions at the top on 8.5 points each with a swift draw in mere 16 moves in the 10th and penultimate round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan. 																								Thus, the Fide rating Swiss tournament, organised by Alekhine Chess Club and presented by Horlicks, is all set for a photo finish tomorrow. If both Joydeep and Tanmoy win their games in the final round, the champion will be decided by progressive score of the players. Joydeep, though, has an advantage on this account as he is clearly ahead on progressive score.																								Joydeep meets Baishakhi Das while Tanmoy Pattanayak meets Souvik Chakraborty in the final round.																								Now, three players  Sourav Bose, Baishakhi and Souvik Chakraborty  jointly share the second spot on 8 points. Julien Days Sourav, who was in the sole second spot, squandered a clear winning position against Debayan Majumdar of St. James in a French defence. Sourav, playing white, had an overwhelming position against Debayan but allowed the latter to escape with a draw.																								Souvik of Narmada High School turned the tables on Saurav Chakraborti despite having an inferior position in the opening. 																								Mary Ann Gomes of Frank Correa Academy was held by Anurag Jaiswal of Childrens Seminary in a queen and knight versus queen ending.

				 	 Pedro Collins, who scalped five for 26, in action on Day I of the first Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka Sunday. (AFP) 																								Dhaka: Wavell Hinds and Chris Gayle laid a solid foundation for West Indies on Sunday after Bangladesh succumbed for only 139 on Day I of the first Test.																								Hinds hit 12 boundaries in an unbeaten 73 while Gayle scored 44 in an unbroken opening stand of 118 at the close.																								Fast bowlers Pedro Collins and Vasbert Drakes helped the touring team dismiss Bangladesh for 139 just after tea earlier on the day.																								Collins grabbed five for 26, the second best figures of his Test career after his six for 72 against New Zealand last June.																								The West Indies paceman bowled opener Hannan Sarkar for a duck with an out-swinger and rounded off the innings by bowling Enamul Hoque for six.																								Drakes took four for 61 in his Test debut. West Indies sent five batsmen to the dressing room before lunch.																								Alok Kapali and Khaled Mashud added a valuable 73 in 131 minutes for the sixth wicket before skipper Mashud was bowled by a Drakes yorker. Mashud scored 22 with two fours. (REUTERS)

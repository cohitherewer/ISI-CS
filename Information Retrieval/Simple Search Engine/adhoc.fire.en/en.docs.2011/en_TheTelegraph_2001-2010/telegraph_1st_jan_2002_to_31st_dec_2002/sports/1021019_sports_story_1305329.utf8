		 Saturday, October 19, 2002 				 Sehwag sees another innings win 
																								Chennai: Dashing opening batsman Virender Sehwag was confident Friday that India would once again be able to inflict an innings victory on West Indies within four days if the home team managed a lead of 150 runs.																								Sehwag, who scored a sparkling 61 with eight fours and three sixes, said a lead of 100-150 runs would be enough for victory considering that the pitch was behaving very unpredictably.																								We are in a very strong position. A lead of 100 to 150 runs will suffice for an innings victory and a series win with one Test to spare, Sehwag said after the second days play which saw India placed at 190 for five in reply to West Indies first innings score of 167.																								My judgement is based on the behaviour of the wicket which is offering good bounce and turning too, he said. Our spinners have extracted good turn on this new pitch taking eight of the West Indian first innings wickets.																								So there should not be any problem in bowling them out in the second innings also. The match may even get over within four days.																								Sehwag played a major part in helping India take a 23-run lead on the second day. He dominated the West Indian bowlers before being clean bowled by a beautiful delivery from Pedro Collins.																								I expected the ball, to which I got out, to swing in but it kept straight, he said. 																								Sehwag was very appreciative of the West Indian bowlers who, he said, bowled really well. 																								Mervyn Dillon, in particular, was very impressive. We wanted to see him off. And of course, Pedro Collins also bowled very well in spells, he said.																								Sehwag said the uneven bounce of the newly-laid track at the Chidambaram stadium was making it difficult for the batsmen and that was why a big total, like that in the first Test in Mumbai, did not look plausible.

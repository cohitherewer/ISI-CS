The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Rookie challenge to veterans 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: Big golf event returns to the city on Tuesday when top seven prize winners on the current Indian PGA Tour will set the Tollygunge Club greens on fire on the opening day of the Royal Challenge Grand Prixs Calcutta leg. 																								The four-day meet is poised to be an exciting battle between the experienced and the greenhorns as they will be staking claim at rupees eight lakh on offer as prize money. 																								Mukesh and Digvijay Singh have so far won six of the ten events this season and with Firoz, they are now the top-three prize winners. 																								They will be up against defending champion Rafiq Ali and Rahul Ganapathy, who just broke the PGAI Tour record of the best round in Digboi last week. 																								Twice Indian Open champion Ali Sher; young pretender Rahil Gangjee, and city challengers S.S.P. Chaurasia and Indrajit Bhalotia will also be seen in action on the opening day. 																								Mukesh, who won the Digboi meet hot on the heels of back-to-back triumphs on the Indian Tour, looks in good touch and starts as one of the true candidates for the top honour. 																								Firoz, the Indian Open winner, who always springs a surprise or two in big occasions, is not lagging far behind and is ready to accept Mukesh challenge. 																								If Uttam Singh Mundy, on the back of his triumphant visit from China, can reproduce his form, he will also be another one to emerge a favourite. 																								Players with the best total performances in these events will earn spots in select APGA events next year.																								Incidentally, the Tuesday-Friday meet will be followed by a pro-event the following day, in which former West Indian opening batsman Gordon Greenidge and Indian tennis ace Leander Paes will take part.

		 Thursday, October 03, 2002 				 Japanese sets world mark as China continue to rule
				 	 Japans Kosuke Kitajima exults after setting a world record in the 200m breaststroke final in Busan Wednesday. (Reuters)																								Busan: Japanese swimmer Kosuke Kitajima broke the world record in the mens 200-metre breaststroke, taking one of the few gold medals not won by China at the Asian Games today.																								In rowing, where no challenger came closer than four seconds, China swept all six of the days races. Then its shooters took seven of eight possible golds and set world records in mens and womens team 10-metre air rifle competition.																								Those 13 early golds plus Zhou Yans triumph in womens 58-kilogram division weightlifting gave China a total of 36 for the four-day-old Games, well ahead of Japans 13 and South Koreas 10.																								Even before they had a chance to compete, three Malaysian sepak takraw players were ordered home for testing positive for morphine, the nations delegation chief, Khalid Yunus, said.																								The action was based on tests administered earlier in Kuala Lumpur. There have been no positive doping tests reported so far at the Games.																								Kitajima, back from an elbow injury that kept him out of the 200 in last months Pan Pacific championships, set a fast early pace and finished in 2 minutes, 09.97 seconds.																								That beat the oldest record in mens swimming, the 2:10.16 set by American Mike Barrowman at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. It put Kitajima 3.63 seconds ahead of teammate Daisuke Kimura, the silver medallist.																								Kitajima, bronze medallist at 200 metres in last years world championships, won the 100-m breaststroke here Monday. 																								Ive been working towards this for a long time and I dont feel as though Ive even reached my limit, Kitajima said. I think I can swim even faster.																								Japan gained another gold from its world champion synchronised swimming pair, Miya Tachibana and Miho Takeda. Tachibana had won the solo gold Tuesday.																								South Korea won three of the days four judo golds, ending Japans run of four consecutive mens victories. Another gold came from Kim Yong-Mis photo finish victory over Indonesias Uyun Muzizah in the womens 96.8-km cycling road race.																								North Korea had three golds. It won the only shooting event not won by China  in womens team trap shooting  and took a judo gold too.																								In rowing, Japans Hitoshi Hase fared best against the Chinese, finishing four seconds behind Zhu Zhifu in the mens lightweight single sculls. Zhu led by only half a second at the halfway point but pulled away over the last 500 m of the 2,000-m race.																								It was the 51st victory in 53 Asian Games rowing races for China, who won all 11 rowing golds in the 1998 Games.																								Cui Yonghui won the mens singles sculls and Chinas men also won the fours with coxswain both decided by 12 seconds.																								In womens races, Chinas Fu Fengjun won by 18 seconds in the lightweight single sculls, the fours without coxswain won by 21 seconds and Zhang Xiuyun had a 23-second margin in the single sculls. (AP)

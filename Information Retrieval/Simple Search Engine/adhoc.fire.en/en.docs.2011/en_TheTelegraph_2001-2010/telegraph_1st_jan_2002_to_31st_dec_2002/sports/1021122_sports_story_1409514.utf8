Priya Saha won the nursery girls title. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Calcutta: Sourav Chakraborty of East Calcutta and Anindita Chakraborty of South Eastern Railway won the mens and womens titles, respectively, in the National Insurance 68th state table tennis championships on Thursday. While Sourav outclassed Ranabir Das of East Calcutta 11-9, 11-8, 9-11, 9-11, 11-4, 11-6, Anindita steamrolled Sushmita Roy of South Calcutta 11-5, 11-4, 11-6, 10-12, 11-7.																								The womens final was a one-sided affair with veteran Anindita taking charge from the word go. Sushmita hardly got the time to react as the 1996 champion ran through the first three games.																								But Sushmita showed some resilience winning the fourth game. Just when it seemed that she was making a comeback, Anindita put an end to such thoughts.																								Attack was the buzzword in the mens final. Left-hander Sourav was the aggressor and Ranabir was doing the catching-up job. After Sourav wriggled out the first two games out of tight situations, Ranabir rallied back to claim the next two. But the left-hander was too powerful for Ranabir in the last two games, winning them quite easily.

		 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 Pollock aiming to ease into last four
																								Colombo: South Africa captain Shaun Pollock wants his players to ensure a smooth passage into the Champions Trophy semi-finals with an easy victory over Kenya.																								A win would lift South Africa into a last-four meeting with India or England, who clash on Sunday. All-rounder Nicky Boje will miss the game to recover from a hairline fracture .																								Also doubtful are Jonty Rhodes, yet to fully recover from a hand injury suffered in Morocco last month, and Allan Donald, who may be rested.																								Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini, batsman Justin Ontong and Dale Benkenstein will come in if the trio do not play.																								Teams																								South Africa (likely): Shaun Pollock (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis, Boeta Dippenaar, Mark Boucher, Dale Benkenstein, Lance Klusener, Justin Ontong, Alan Dawson, Makhaya Ntini.																								Kenya (from): Steve Tikolo (captain), Kennedy Otieno, Ravindu Shah, Brijal Patel, Maurice Odumbe, Thomas Odoyo, David Obuya, Collins Obuya, Tony Suji, Martin Suji, Joseph Angara, Jimmy Kamande, Hitesh Modi.

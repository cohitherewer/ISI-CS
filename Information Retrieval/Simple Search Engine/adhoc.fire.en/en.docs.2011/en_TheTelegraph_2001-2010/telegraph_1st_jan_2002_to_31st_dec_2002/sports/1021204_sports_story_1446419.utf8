		 Wednesday, December 04, 2002 				 Kenya ask for cash to play host
																								Nairobi: The organising committee of the two World Cup matches to be held in Kenya has said it would be forced to seek financial aid from the South African organising Committee or the ICC, to meet the expenses of hosting New Zealand and Sri Lanka.																								Kenya Organising Committee chairman Sharad Ghai said Kenya could not afford to raise the $75,000 required to provide security and transport for the teams. 																								Kenya is not entitled to any profits from the World Cup, as it is shared between the 10 Test-playing countries and has, therefore, asked the South African cricket board to meet the costs, Ghai said.																								He claimed the decision by the South African board to make Kenya meet all costs of staging the matches had taken the Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) and the local organising committee by surprise.																								We were not informed about these financial obligations when we met the South African Organising Committees executive director Ali Bacher in Nairobi early this year. It only came to light when a delegation from South Africa came to Nairobi at the end of November, Ghai said.																								 Meanwhile, South African experts are to visit Kenya early next month to discuss the security measures. (AFP)

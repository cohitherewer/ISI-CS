				 																																	London: Spains Carlos Moya has been named inaugural ATP European Player of The Year, the governing body of mens tennis said on Friday.				 																																	The Spaniard, who finished the year ranked fifth in the ATP Champions Race winning four events in 2002, will receive a Waterford Crystal engraved trophy at his first ATP event in Europe in 2003.				 																																	The award, voted for by European ATP tournament directors, is based on diverse criteria including the final ATP Champions Race position of the player, attitude towards media and sponsors, co-operation and support of the European events. 				 																																	Paris: Nicolas Anelka has been handed a two-match ban by the French soccer federation after the Manchester City striker snubbed a call-up for an international friendly match against Yugoslavia last month.				 																																	However the sanction is largely symbolic as the English FA and Manchester City had already turned down the request for a ban sent by the French soccer ruling body (FFF) in November. The ban would come into force, though, should Anelka return to play in French football.				 																																	Valencia: Valencia midfielder Pablo Aimar has said he is ready to return to action after shaking off a thigh injury that has seen him sidelined since mid-November.				 																																	I feel good, am back in full training with the team and am now available for selection, Aimar said after training on Thursday. 				 																																	But although I am very keen to get back into action it is up to the coach to decide when I am ready to play.				 																																	Tokyo: Former Brazil striker Edmundo is poised to leave Tokyo Verdy after failing to agree terms for next season, officials of the J-League club said on Friday. He will leave the club at the end of his current deal on January 1 after negotiations for a new contract broke down.				 																																	Melbourne: Two-times Grand Slam champion Rod Laver was inducted into the Australian sports Hall of Fame on Thursday. Laver joins a list of Australian sporting legends including Don Bradman, Dawn Fraser and cyclist Hubert Opperman.				 																																	He won four Wimbledon singles titles and in 1969 became the first player to win the Grand Slam (all four majors) twice.				 																																	Newcastle: Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer has expressed his sadness at a number of English league clubs becoming part-time. He spoke out on Thursday after Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon told BBC radio there were too many full-time clubs in English football.				 																																	n FOOTBALL: Premier League 2002-03, Manchester United vs Arsenal Live on ESPN from 5.30 pm n CRICKET: India vs Max Blacks presented by Sachin Tendulkar on STAR Sports at 6.55 pm n RALLYING: MRF India Rally Cup 2002 on Star Sports from 7.55 pm n Real Madrids Brazilian ace Ronaldo trains in Madrid Friday, ahead of his teams Spanish League match versus

				 	 Makhaya Ntini celebrates a wicket in Durban Friday. (AFP)																								Durban: Fast bowlers Mornantau Hayward and Makhaya Ntini picked up three Pakistan wickets apiece to strengthen South Africas grip after the second day of the first Test on Friday.																								Hayward took three for 29 and Ntini three for 45 as Pakistan crashed to 120 for eight, before bad light ended play, in reply to the home sides first innings of 368.																								Openers Taufeeq Umar and Salim Elahi both scored 39, but Inzamam-ul-Haqs 18 and Yousuf Youhanas 12 were Pakistans only other double figure scores.																								Umar and Elahi batted cautiously to bring up 77 for the first wicket when Taufeeq (39) steered a Hayward delivery to Graeme Smith at third slip.																								Elahi had a life on 27, with the total 52 without loss, when his top edge off fast bowler Jacques Kallis was dropped by Nicky Boje at first slip.																								But Pakistan, having reached a solid 81 for one at tea, then lost seven wickets for only 39 runs in the final session as South Africa took control.																								South Africa, who resumed on 250 for five, lost their sixth wicket in the fourth over of the day when Kallis left an inswinger from Mohammad Sami and was bowled for 105.																								Kallis had batted for more than five hours, faced 236 balls and hit 11 fours and two sixes.																								Captain Shaun Pollock scored 21 before he attempted to hook a delivery from Waqar Younis and was caught down the leg-side by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal.																								Mark Boucher and Boje consolidated with an eighth-wicket stand that reached 58 before Boucher fell to a looping catch by Faisal Iqbal at short-leg off the bowling of Saqlain Mushtaq.																								Bouchers 55, scored off 108 balls and including eight fours, took him past 2,000 runs in Test matches.																								Saqlain claimed his fourth wicket when Makhaya Ntini, on nought, lofted a drive towards the long-on boundary and was well held by Taufeeq.																								The innings ended when Hayward, who had scored 10, had his middle stump uprooted by Sami. Saqlain finished with four for 119. (Reuters)

		 Monday, November 25, 2002 				 Aussies storm to 2-0 lead 
				 	 Glenn McGrath takes a stunner to dismiss Michael Vaughan at the Adelaide Oval Sunday. (Reuters)																								Adelaide: Australia crushed England by an innings and 51 runs on Sunday to win the second Ashes Test and take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.																								Needing 210 to force the home team to bat a second time, England collapsed to 159 all out at tea on the fourth day here at the Adelaide Oval.																								Alec Stewart made a defiant 57 to become only the fourth Englishman to cross 8,000 Test runs. Glenn McGrath took a spectacular outfield catch to remove first-innings centurion Michael Vaughan and trigger another familiar batting collapse.																								McGrath mopped up the tail to finish with four for 41 and leg-spinner Shane Warne captured three wickets as England lost their last six batsmen for just 45 runs after three rain delays offered the hope that bad weather might save them.																								Australia also won the first Test in Brisbane and now need one more victory to claim a record eighth successive Ashes series. The third Test in Perth starts on Friday.																								Light rain delayed the resumption of play after lunch and there were another two short stoppages in the next two hours which forced the players off the field for a total of 47 minutes.																								Resuming at 36 for three, England could not have made a worse start when Robert Key fell for one in the third over of the day, pulling a short-pitched delivery from paceman Andy Bichel straight to Darren Lehmann at mid-wicket.																								Stewart and Vaughan steadied the innings with a 74-run partnership before Vaughan was brilliantly caught on the boundary by McGrath. The Yorkshire opener was on 41 when he swept Warne to deep backward square where McGrath dived full-length to take the catch after sprinting 20m.																								Stewart signalled his intentions to attack from the outset when he flicked the first ball he faced from Bichel off his pads to the boundary. The 39-year-old belted another five fours to race to his 41st Test half-century, off just 67 balls in 81 minutes.																								Stewart passed another significant personal milestone when he reached 52. He became only the fourth Englishman to score 8,000 Test runs, joining Graham Gooch (8,900), David Gower (8,231) and Geoff Boycott (8,114).																								He eventually fell for 57, trapped leg-before by Warne, after allrounder Craig White was dismissed by McGrath for five the ball before. McGrath clean bowled Matthew Hoggard for one and Warne got rid of Steve Harmison for a duck with a ball that straightened and hit him on the pads as England lost four wickets for four runs. Australias hopes of a quick kill were thwarted by the third rain delay, then a bold last-wicket stand between Richard Dawson and Andy Caddick.																								The last pair put on 25 in 28 minutes before Dawson edged McGrath to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist for 19. Australia named an unchanged squad for the Perth Test.																								Caddick doubtful 																								Caddick has joined Englands growing injury list and may be in doubt for the third Test.																								He has been suffering back spasms and was unable to bowl after tea in the Adelaide Test on Saturday. England are reviewing the crisis and may have to consider replacements. (REUTERS)

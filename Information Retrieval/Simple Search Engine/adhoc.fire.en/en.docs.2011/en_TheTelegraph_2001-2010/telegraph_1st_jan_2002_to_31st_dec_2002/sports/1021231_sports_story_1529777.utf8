The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, December 31, 2002 				 For now, Mongia is NZ -bound
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India has decided to immediately fly Dinesh Mongia to New Zealand.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, this decision was taken after Mondays selection committee meeting in the city, where Mongia made the World Cup XV.																								Mongia, of course, didnt make the XVI for the on-going seven-match ODI series. He would have, with a bit of luck, but captain Sourav Ganguly asked for an extra bowler and, so, rookie Rakesh Patel got the call.																								The selectors (with Brijesh Patel in the chair), one understands, felt it would be absurd if Mongia prepared for the quadrennial showpiece sitting in India, while V.V.S.Laxman continued to get opportunities in New Zealand. As was tipped in these columns, the slot currently held by Laxman has gone to Mongia (in the World Cup). 																								As of now, Mongia should be available for selection from the fourth ODI, in Queenstown on January 4. Laxman, however, will stay as Mongias status is that of an additional player.																								India are trailing 0-2.

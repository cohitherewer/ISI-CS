The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, December 15, 2002 				 Ban report is motivated: IFA
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 14: The IFA Saturday informed its governing body that it is yet to hear anything from the AIFF regarding the one-year bar on India from hosting international tournaments.																								The report of a ban is absolutely false and motivated. The IFA hasnt committed any wrong. So theres no question of any penalty, joint secretary Ranjit Gupta told the body.																								Since the commission headed by former chief justice Ranganath Mishra is yet to finish its work, the sanctions cannot be imposed. The AIFF hasnt received any communication in this regard from the AFC.																								Gupta informed that he deposed before the commission  set up to probe the controversial IFA Shield final between East Bengal and Palmeiras in 2001  on November 26. The IFA also decided to ask Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra to clarify if he had made any derogatory remarks against the body.

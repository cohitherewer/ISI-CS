																								London: The Football Association is confident Sven-Goran Eriksson will not quit as England coach, the governing body of the English game said on Monday.																								But they confirmed that Eriksson was still involved in talks on Monday with Premier League representatives on the FA executive board following upheaval at the FA.																								Erikssons future has been called into question by British media following the resignation last month of former chief executive and close ally Adam Crozier.																								But after announcing the appointments of David Davies and Nic Coward as Croziers joint successors in acting capacities, the FA said they had met with Eriksson to iron out any difficulties.																								We fully expect Sven to stay in his post, Paul Barber, director of marketing and communications, said outside the FAs Soho Square headquarters in London.																								He has done an excellent job so far and theres absolutely no reason to suspect that he wont (continue).The FA Premier League representatives are now reassuring Sven that they have his full support and he has theirs.

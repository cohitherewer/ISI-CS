																								Colombo: The West Indies cricket team has asked for police guards to be withdrawn following a row over women guests in hotel rooms of players during the ongoing Champions Trophy, officials said Tuesday.																								Police, however, refused to pull out their men assigned to guard the West Indians, insisting the safety of the team was their responsibility unless the International Cricket Council (ICC) called for a withdrawal.																								Our brief is to provide security to the team as well as to enforce the access control guidelines set out by the ICC as part of efforts to crack down on match fixing, a senior police officer said.																								The West Indies team told police that since they were knocked out of the tournament there was no need to have security for them. Carl Hoopers men are scheduled to stay in Colombo till October 1 when they leave for India on a seven- week tour.																								The ICC sought police protection for all teams taking part not so much to protect players, but as a safeguard against match-fixing.																								The West Indies team manager Rickey Skerritt Monday accused police bodyguards of high-handed and authoritative behaviour after a move to crack down on women entering hotel rooms of players.																								Police said in a letter to the ICC that three women were found in the rooms of Skerritt and his computer operator, Garfield Smith, in violation of the ICC access control rules. 																								Defiant Skerritt said visitors to his suite were persons of impeccable character and of a standing in society and that such persons will continue to be welcome to visit his suite.																								Our client, since his arrival in Sri Lanka, has repeatedly complained to the ICCs security officials about the behaviour and attitude of certain security personnel, assigned to the team hotel, who have been high handed, authoritative and officious in acting well beyond their scope of duty, Skerritts law firm said.																								Our client has also had to admonish certain media personnel who were attempting to vilify certain members of the West Indian team and invade their privacy, the firm said in a letter to a local newspaper which published a report Tuesday on the police complaint against Skerritt to the ICC.																								The insinuation that three prostitutes were found in the rooms of our client and his colleague, Garfield Smith is false, mischievous and malicious.																								The police said a probe was underway to check the womens criminal record. (AFP)

		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Fleming optimistic 
																								Colombo: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming believes his side can still be competitive in next years World Cup despite the massive defeat to Australia in the Champions Trophy.																								The 164-run thrashing by Australia on Sunday was their worst defeat in 85 one-day games against them. 																								But Fleming does not think it will have much significance when it comes to his sides chances in next Februarys tournament in southern Africa. Dont start talking about worst performances, he said. We were outclassed in a one-day match, but things can swing quite dramatically and things can go away from you in the field.																								We created chances but didnt turn them over but it doesnt mean we are a bad side. It was just a bad performance. 																								In terms of where we are going and the World Cup we have got work to do but this result doesnt set us back that far. (REUTERS)

		 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 Its Sasikiran vs Kasparov 
																								Bled (Slovenia): India will meet mighty Russia in the third round of the Chess Olympiad. 																								The organisers have released third-round pairings following an incorrect calculation of scores, but India would have met Russia even otherwise.																								The website listing the pairings shows India are on 7.5 points, while actually they have seven  the same as the Russians. 																								The officials had committed another error earlier, which had wrongly put India against Colombia in the second round. It didnt matter, since India won comprehensively.																								GM Krishnan Sasikiran will face Garri Kasparov with white pieces on the top board. After his recent victory over Viswanathan Anand in the World Cup, Sasikiran is expected to go all out against Kasparov.																								P. Harikrishna will meet Alexander Morozevich, whom he had beaten in the World Cup. Surya Sekhar Ganguly has a tough customer in Peter Svidler while Abhijit Kunte faces Sergei Rublevski.  (PTI)

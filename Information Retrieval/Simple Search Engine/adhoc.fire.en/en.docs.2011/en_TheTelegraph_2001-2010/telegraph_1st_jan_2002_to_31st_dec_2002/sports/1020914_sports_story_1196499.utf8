																								London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says he has no plans to rest Patrick Vieira, despite his captains plea for a break from football.																								Patrick played in Cyprus (for France) on Saturday night, and after the game against Manchester City on Tuesday night he was very tired, Wenger told Arsenals official website.																								I looked at the statistics for Tuesdays game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He pushed himself very hard and that explains why he was so tired. But I have no plans to rest him.  added Wenger. (REUTERS)

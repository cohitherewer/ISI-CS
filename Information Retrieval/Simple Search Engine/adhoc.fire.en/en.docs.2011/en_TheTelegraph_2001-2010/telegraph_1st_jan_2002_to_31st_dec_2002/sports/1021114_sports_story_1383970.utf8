		 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 England will be more nervous now: Warne
				 	 SHANE WARNE: More hits at English pride																								Perth: Champion leg-spinner Shane Warne has chipped away at the England tourists, predicting they will be even more nervous in next weeks second Ashes Test in Adelaide.																								England captain Nasser Hussain admitted his players were nervous on the opening day of the first Test match at Brisbanes Gabba ground where they were humiliated by 384 runs.																								Warne joined Australian captain Steve Waugh and paceman Glenn McGrath by attempting to further undermine the tourists confidence by firing yet another verbal salvo. England are yet to win in five tour outings in Australia this summer and will have to produce a massive turnaround to avoid slumping to their eighth consecutive Ashes series loss.																								They will be more nervous in the next one after going 1-0 down and going to Adelaide, Warne said here Wednesday. Id like to think they will be even more nervous.																								The second Ashes Test begins November 21 at the Adelaide Oval.																								The England team minus Hussain, who is in Perth to be with his pregnant wife Karen, will look to turn around their dismal tour in a three-day match against Australia A in Hobart starting Friday. But Warne said he didnt believe a full-time sports psychologist would necessarily ease the tourists woes.																								Some guys get something out of it, a lot of guys dont need it, to use it depends on how you are mentally and what you want to achieve out of it, he said. I think there is a role for those people depending on the individual. It is up to the individual I dont think they should be put in your face and told to use them.																								Warne said a back problem he had endured since before the first Test in Brisbane was improving. The back is ok, it was a little bit stiff going into the first Test but (Australian physiotherapist) Errol Alcott did some really good work and as the Test went it just got better and better, he said.																								Trescothick has a good laugh 																								Acting captain Marcus Trescothick led the England cricket team through its first workout on Wednesday, a session Trescothick described as a good laugh and a chance to let off some steam.																								In preparation for the three-day game against Australia A, which starts at Hobarts Bellerive Oval on Friday, the English spent about two hours at the ground in the morning.																								There was no net practice and most of the players were content with some unchallenging work in the field.																								Trescothick, wholl lead the team in Hobart as captain Nasser Hussain prepares to fly to Perth for the birth of his second child, was happy.																								Today was a good day, he said. We had a good laugh and a run-around and let off a bit of steam.																								The Somerset opener thought the team needed the relaxation after spending about six hours getting to Hobart from Brisbane on Tuesday.																								People have to understand that were away for a long time, he said. Time off is as valuable as being in the nets because you can get so stale. Bad practice is no use at all. We have to have time off.																								Trescothick said morale was good despite the teams 384- run loss to Australia in the first Ashes Test at Brisbane.																								We just need a bit of luck, to play well and get the guys in form, he said.																								Trescothick, who has captained England in a New Zealand tour match and a one-day International, said Hussain hadnt given him any advice. (AFP)

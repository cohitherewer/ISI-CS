The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, September 01, 2002 				 Dont see me only as a good-luck charm: Bangar
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Bangar: Ive never lacked self-belief																								London, Aug. 31: With India winning five of the six Tests (the other being drawn) Sanjay Bangar has played in, he is being seen as the teams mascot. Yet, the totally unassuming Bangar himself wouldnt like to be remembered as simply being lucky.																								Well, yes, people have been talking about it but where Im concerned, I would like to contribute on a consistent basis. At the end of the day, people should remember me for what I actually do on the field, not see me only as being lucky for the team, Bangar told The Telegraph this evening.																								[The Indians, who arrived from Derby in the afternoon, had a day off  as has become customary on days of travel. In fact, there will be a break tomorrow as well.]																								Bangar, 29, made his debut (against England) at Mohali last December. India, of course, won that Test by ten wickets. Then, he was part of the winning XI in Nagpur and Delhi (both versus Zimbabwe). In the West Indies, Bangar was fielded in the first two Tests  Georgetown (drawn) and Queens Park Oval (37-run victory). And, on this trip, at Headingley (innings-and-46-run-win).																								A hamstring injury at Mohali itself had ruled Bangar out of the remainder of that series, but his comeback in Nagpur was incredible: A fantastic unbeaten 100, an innings which overshadowed even Sachin Tendulkars 176. He didnt have much of a contribution in Delhi and, in Georgetown, scored a duck. Bangar didnt do much better at the Queens Park Oval  nine and 16 (as opener).																								I wouldnt say I was under excessive pressure at Headingley, but I did realise that failure could mean the end of my career... I was, therefore, more determined not to get out to a bad shot... Being dismissed by a good ball was acceptable... Bangar remarked, reflecting on the excellent 68 on the first morning when the Duke was doing so much.																								With Virender Sehwag leaving early, the onus was on Bangar and No. 3 Rahul Dravid to try and wrest the initiative. They did, with a 170-run partnership, which laid the foundations for what became Indias biggest overseas victory.																								I knew the ball would do a bit but, frankly, I didnt expect it to do so much... It wasnt easy... At the same time, I had a role and was bent on not letting the team down. It helped that Dravid was at the other end, Bangar added.																								In Englands second innings, Bangar also collected the scalps of Mark Butcher and John Crawley, executing well the double role assigned by captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright. Actually, I must thank Sourav, especially, for always encouraging me... For constantly reminding me to not get affected by failures, he said.																								But, surely, the failures must have played on his nerves? Look, it definitely doesnt feel good if you fail. Yet, given the way I am, Ive never lacked self-belief. I havent ever thought Im not good enough for the highest level, Bangar replied.																								Bangar began the England tour with a duck, against West Indies A (Arundel). He did, however, have fine innings in two other first-class games: An unbeaten 52 (plus a match haul of seven wickets) versus Hampshire on a poor track in Southampton and the 74 (as opener) against Essex in Chelmsford. The latter knock facilitated his Test comeback.																								Though he batted in the middle-order in four of the six Tests, Bangar himself is most comfortable opening. Ive been doing so at the first-class level from 1996... I dont know why this middle-order thing keeps coming up... Still, bottomline is that I want to play... Am I a batsman who bowls or a pucca allrounder? For now, let me just play and not say anything...																								Bangar, who was joined by wife Kashmira and son Aryan before Headingley, will be having the rest of the family, too, at The Oval. My father (Bapusaheb), brother (Santosh) and sister (Sunita) are coming... Hopefully, their presence will bring more luck, he signed off, smiling.																								Incidentally, Bangar lost his mother (Sindhu), a source of much strength, to cancer.

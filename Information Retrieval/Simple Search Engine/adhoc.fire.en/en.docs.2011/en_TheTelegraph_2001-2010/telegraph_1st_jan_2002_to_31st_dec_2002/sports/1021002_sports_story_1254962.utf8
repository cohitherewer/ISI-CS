				 	 Ronaldinho: Losing temper 																								Paris: Paris St Germain coach Luis Fernandez has urged Ronaldinho to calm down after recent bursts of temper from his Brazilian play- maker.																								Ronaldinho, who has struggled to reach his best level with PSG after winning the World Cup with Brazil, was involved in an ugly brawl after a French first division game against Bastia last month.																								Sports daily lEquipe reported Tuesday that Fernandez and Ronaldinho had a serious discussion about discipline in training this week.																								I have no problems with Ronnie (Ronaldinho). He has the potential to become the best player in the world in two or three years, Fernandez said.																								Im protecting him. Im like his big brother. I would be a fool to do without a player like him, he said.																								Ronaldinho again lost his temper after a 1-1 draw against Montpellier last week.																								I talked to him because I would like him not to lose his temper so easily on the pitch.																								I know its not easy for a player like him. But he should calm down. He must learn to behave himself.																								Look at Zidane, Beckham or Figo. They never say anything. When he loses his temper, its not good for him and its bad for the team too, Fernandez said.																								Fernandez had similar problems with French striker Nicolas Anelka last season. Anelka finally left for Liverpool before joining Manchester City this season. (REUTERS)

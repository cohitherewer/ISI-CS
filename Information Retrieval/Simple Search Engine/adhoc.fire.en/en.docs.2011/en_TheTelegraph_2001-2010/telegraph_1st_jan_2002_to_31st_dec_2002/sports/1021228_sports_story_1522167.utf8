		 Saturday, December 28, 2002 				 Tillekeratne back in squad
				 	 Tillekeratne: Additional keeper																								Colombo: Sri Lankan cricket selectors have included veteran left-hander Hashan Tillekeratne in the 15-man squad for the World Cup.																								Tillekeratne, 36, has played only two one-day Internationals since the 1999 World Cup in England.																								After Sri Lankas disastrous performance in 1999, Tillekeratne and senior mates Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva were seen as being over the hill according to the new blood policy of the then selectors.																								Although Ranatunga, who led Sri Lanka to the 1996 World Cup win, never figured in a one-day International thereafter, Tillekeratne and De Silva were subsequently recalled.																								Tillekeratne has been added as the additional wicketkeeper as the selectors have resisted the pressure to induct Romesh Kaluwitharana.																								The squad has nine specialist batsmen, the solitary spinner being Muttiah Muralidharan  who needs three more wickets to reach the double of 300 ODI wickets and 400 Test wickets, a feat only achieved by Wasim Akram.																								THE squad																								Sanath Jayasuriya (capt.), Maravan Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Aravinda de Silva, Russel Arnold, Jehan Mubarak, Avishka Gunawardene, Hashan Tillekeratne, Muttiah Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas, Dilhara Fernando, Pulasthi Gunaratne, Prabath Nissanka and Charitha Buddhika Fernando.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, September 30, 2002  Easy victory for Smart Ruler 
 BY STAR RACER 				 										Calcutta: The Razeen-Regal Star son Smart Ruler kept his date with the Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes on Sunday The hot-favourite from Daniel Davids yard had an easy measure of Royal City, the pace-setter from the stable. Jockey B. Prakash, who partnered the winner, also helped Daniel with a fine treble. Prakashs performance was, however, very courageous in the light of his shoulder injury caused by a nasty fall from Midas Touch in the curtain-raiser. Jumping out of the gates awkwardly, Midas Touch unbalanced Prakash thus unseating him. Jockey Cristopher Alford, too, scored a treble for Singh brothers  Vijay and Bharath.

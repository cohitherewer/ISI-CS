Siliguri bid for Mehta																								With the performance graph of Siliguri table tennis players going down in the past few years, the authorities of the district association are trying their best to organise a revival. One major step towards that end is importing a coach. They have seven-time former national champion Kamlesh Mehta in mind.																								There has already been a proposal to bring Kamlesh at our executive committee meeting. A proposal will soon be made to the Table Tennis Federation of India, Samiran Sen, manager of the Siliguri team said.																								He added that the North Korean coach at the SAI Centre for Excellence, Kim Chang Ho, worked with the Siliguri boys for about 15 days last year. But we want Kamlesh for a longer span of time so that he can work with our boys in the different clubs.																								Meanwhile, former national champion Mantu Ghosh, a member of the Siliguri contingent, had to back out at the last moment from the state meet. She didnt initially enter the state meet as she had to play a tournament in Assam for her office team. After that got cancelled, she was keen to represent her state.

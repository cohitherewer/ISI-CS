The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 Quitting far from my mind: Sourav
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta: Three months short of completing three years as India captain, Sourav Gangulys this (New Zealand tour) may be my last chance to win a series abroad comment, in Wellington Wednesday, has caused a flutter.																								However, as it turns out, that isnt exactly what the captain stated while interacting with the Media there.																								I was asked about being one short of Mohammed Azharuddins record of 14 Test wins and, from what I remember, I talked about the current series being a golden chance or something to that effect.																								If there was any reference to last, it must have been in the context of the on-going tour being our last  featuring Tests, that is  for quite some time, Sourav told The Telegraph, when contacted at the team hotel Thursday.																								In fact, Sourav added: If the impression is that Im on the verge of quitting, thats nonsense. Obviously, at this moment, my focus is wholly on the current series and, soon, all the attention will be on the (February 8-beginning) World Cup.																								Clearly, the captain hasnt been amused by a misrepresentation of what he really said. Worse, Day-I of the Test series, at blustery Basin Reserve, hardly gave him anything to cheer.																								With New Delhi unlikely to clear the Indian teams visit to Pakistan (for a full series), in April-May, the next set of Tests overseas will be in Australia  2003-2004. Actually, in exactly a year from now.																								That, by any yardstick, is quite some time away. 																								Yet, if Souravs form holds good and  more important  he continues to be hungry to lead, theres no reason why he shouldnt have at least one more opportunity at trying to win an away-series.																								Incidentally, while the Indians will have played as many as 16 Tests before this year ends, 2003 may see a maximum of six only: Three versus New Zealand at home; three in Australia.																								Indias first engagement after the World Cup, by the way, is expected to be the much-delayed Asia Cup in Bangladesh.																								Conditional probables 																								Meanwhile, the Board of Control for Cricket in India will pick the 30 World Cup probables on December 18. 																								Their inclusion in the final 15, though, will depend on the satisfactory ending of disputes surrounding the contracts (Player Terms).																								The squad for the seven ODIs in New Zealand, too, will be picked that day. Both the probables and the NZ-15 will be selected in Calcutta.																								While Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar wont make the shorter list, it will be a surprise if he doesnt make the 30. An equally strong contender, from these parts, is quick Ranadeb Bose.

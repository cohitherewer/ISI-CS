 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 21: The CAB is planning a tie-up with the SAI, Eastern Centre in the forthcoming season for upgradation of practice facilities. The infrastructure at the SAI is quite fabulous and we want to utilise that for our boys at all the levels (U-15, U-17, U-19 and senior), especially during the off-season, a senior CAB official said.																								The gymnasium, the swimming pool and other modern equipments at the centre will be a big help for the cricketers. We often cannot use the Eden Gardens for long periods and the boys have to be confined to indoors at the Pankaj Gupta stadium, the official added. The players have often complained that they suffer from cramps due to lengthy sessions at the indoor stadium. 																								It was, however, learnt that utilising the residential facilities is not in the immediate agenda of the association. 																								Bengal U-17 force lead																								The Bengal under-17 boys took a first innings lead of 223 runs against Orissa on the second day of the Vijay Merchant Trophy at Cuttack Saturday, according to information received here. 																								Brief Scores:Orissa 140 and 5/0. Bengal 363 (Debabrata Das 129, Prinan Dutta 92).

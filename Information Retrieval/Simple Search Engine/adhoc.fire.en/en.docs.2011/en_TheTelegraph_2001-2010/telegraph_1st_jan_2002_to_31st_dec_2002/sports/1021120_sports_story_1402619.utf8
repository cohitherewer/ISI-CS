		 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 10-wkt win for Pak
 							 - Waqars four for 78 smashes Zimbabwe				 	 Pakistan captain Waqar Younis with the trophy after his team won the second Test in Bulawayo Tuesday, beating Zimbabwe 2-0 in the Test series. (Reuters) 																								Bulawayo: Pakistan captain Waqar Younis finished with four wickets to inspire his team to a 10-wicket victory over Zimbabwe on Day IV of the second Test on Tuesday.																								The Pakistan fast bowler took four for 78 in Zimbabwes second innings of 281 after the home side had resumed on 171 for five. Pakistan scored the 57 they needed in 8.3 overs to win with a session and a day to spare.																								Waqar struck before a run had been added on Tuesday, dismissing Zimbabwes most dangerous batsman Andy Flower leg before for 13.																								Flowers replacement Andy Blignaut launched an immediate assault on the bowling, striking three fours and two sixes.																								Blignaut had reached 30 when he hooked Waqar high towards the square-leg boundary where Younis Khan spilled a running catch.																								He erased the deficit with a pulled four off Saqlain Mushtaq in the 12th over of the day, but then took two large steps down the pitch attempting to drive the next delivery down the ground and was easily stumped by wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal.																								Blignauts whirlwind 41 came off 32 balls, and his dismissal ended a seventh-wicket stand of 55 with Tatenda Taibu.																								Mluleki Nkala scored 14 before he was caught behind attempting to sweep Saqlain and Zimbabwe slumped to 265 for nine when Ray Price was bowled for 12 by fast bowler Mohammad Sami.																								The visitors had a scare half an hour before lunch when Saqlain appeared to twist his right ankle while fielding on the third-man boundary. He resumed bowling after receiving medical treatment.																								The extra work																								We had a small problem with Shoaibs knee, so we were short of bowlers and needed someone to bowl for an hour to an hour and a half, said Waqar. I bowled a longer spell than usual and it really did me good. I got my rhythm right and that should help me in the one-dayers.																								We have come through a very bad patch, and its good to see the boys playing well and winning 2-0. The bowling and the batting were brilliant but we need to work on our fielding, especially with the one-dayers coming up.  (REUTERS)

				 																																	Perth: The 2005 mens Champions Trophy hockey meet will be held in Chennai in either November or December the International Hockey Federation (FIH) announced Tuesday. Germany and Spain will host the next mens and womens hockey World Cup tournaments. The mens event from September 5-17, 2006, will be held in a new national hockey stadium being built at Monchengladbach, Germany. The womens competition will be held in Madrid immediately before or after the mens event. The next mens junior World Cup will be held in The Netherlands in August 2005.				 																																	London: Real Madrid midfielder Steve McManamans chances of an international recall are remote, according to Englands assistant coach Tord Grip. As far as McManaman is concerned, he has never played a really good game for England, the Swede was quoted as saying in a Tuesday paper.				 																																	The 30-year-old former Liverpool player has 37 international caps but has been largely forgotten under coach Sven Goran Eriksson. His last appearance was as a substitute in Englands final World Cup qualifier against Greece last October. He is not being considered for selection at the moment, and with what is happening I dont see him being in any of the upcoming squads, added Grip.				 																																	On Saturday McManaman underlined his desire to play for England again, saying it was a huge disappointment to be overlooked by Eriksson for the World Cup earlier this year. Grip, however, suggests there is little chance of a recall.				 																																	Sydney: Australasian golf officials said on Tuesday they plan to introduce new rules to prevent a repeat of the controversial tied finish at last weekends Australian PGA. Peter Lonard and Jarrod Moseley were declared joint winners of the tournament after officials decided not to continue with a sudden-death play-off as darkness began to fall on the Coolum course. Tour chairman Wayne Grady said the current rules had prevented tournament organisers from returning to finish the play-off on Monday morning.				 																																	Buenos Aires: An Independiente supporter was shot dead by a fan of rival club Boca Juniors hours after his team had clinched the Argentine championship title. Apparently, there was an argument about the football matches which ended with the death of the Independiente supporter, a police spokesman said.				 																																	Miguel Angel Franco, aged 42, was named as the victim in the incident which happened 30 km from Buenos Aires.				 																																	Newcastle: Newcastle United said on Monday they would not be appealing against the two-match European ban handed to Alan Shearer last week by Uefa. The former England striker was punished for violent conduct after elbowing Inter Milans Fabio Cannavaro in last weeks Champions League match at St James Park.				 																																	Referee Stephane Bre, who had earlier dismissed Shearers strike partner Craig Bellamy, did not see the clash but Shearer was punished on the basis of video evidence.

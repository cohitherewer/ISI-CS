		 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 Lawson blast blows away Bangladesh
 							 - Windies win by innings and 310 runs as hosts nosedive from 80 for three to 87 all out				 	 Vasbert Drakes, who took the first three Bangladeshi wickets in their second innings, in action at Dhakas Bangabandhu Stadium on Tuesday. Drakes finished with figures of three for 19. (AFP)																								Dhaka: West Indies pacer Jermaine Lawson took an extraordinary six wickets in 15 deliveries without conceding a run as Bangladesh crashed to an innings and 310-run defeat in the first Test Tuesday.																								The 20-year-old, playing his third Test, destroyed the home side as they crashed to a record low of 87 all out, the last seven wickets tumbling for seven runs in the final session of the third day.																								Right-armer Lawson had bowled four overs for three runs before the fireworks began after Bangladesh  dismissed for 139 in the first innings  had reached a respectable 80 for three in the second innings.																								After Habibul Bashar fell to Pedro Collins for a top score of 22, Lawson, who made his debut against India in Chennai in October, ran through the rest of the batting.																								Lawson took three wickets in four balls in the 28th over  all three batsmen falling leg-before including skipper Khaled Mashud first ball to leave Naimur Rahman to survive the hat-trick ball  then added a fourth in the 30th.																								He wrapped up the innings in the 32nd over with two more victims in three balls, Tapash Baisya playing on for a four-ball duck and Talha Jubair yorked by his second delivery.																								Lawsons final figures were a barely believable 6.5-4-3-6. Six batsmen, including the last three, failed to score. His performance brought back memories of Curtly Ambroses spell of seven wickets for a single run off 32 balls on way to figures of seven for 25 against Australia in 1993.																								Tuesdays result was the seventh biggest win by an innings in Test history, and Bangladeshs heaviest.																								Bangladeshs previous lowest Test score was 90, against Sri Lanka in Colombo last year. Bangladesh have now lost 15 of their 16 Test matches.  (REUTERS)

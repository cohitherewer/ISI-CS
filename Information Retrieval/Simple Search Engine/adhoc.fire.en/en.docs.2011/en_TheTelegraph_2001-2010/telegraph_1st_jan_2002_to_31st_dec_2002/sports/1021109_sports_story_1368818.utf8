				 	 Shaun Pollock (centre), Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis celebrate the dismissal of Mahela Jayawardene on Day I in Johannesburg on Friday. (AFP)																								Johannesburg: Allrounder Jacques Kallis took three wickets in quick succession as South Africa moved into a dominant position on day one of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Friday.																								After winning the toss on a lively pitch, Sri Lanka were dismissed for 192. South Africa were 51 without loss at close, with Gary Kirsten, who became the first South African to pass 6,000 Test runs, on 21 and Graeme Smith 15.																								Kallis tore the heart out of the Sri Lankan middle order with three wickets in just six balls. He produced a superb outswinger to Mahela Jayawardene, which took the edge through to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. Jayawardene made 39 in a partnership of 51 for the fourth wicket with captain Sanath Jayasuriya.																								Jayasuriya (32) followed in the next over from Kallis, fending a bouncer to Smith at third slip, and debutant Hasantha Fernando lasted just three balls before he top-edged a pull and was caught by Kirsten at short leg.																								Tea was taken after the fall of Chaminda Vaas in the following over.																								Shaun Pollock ended the defiance of Dilhara Fernando when he bowled him for seven but then saw his next delivery pulled for six by new batsman Muttiah Muralidharan.																								The off-spinner smashed the next ball from Hall for four before holing out to fine leg. The innings ended when Hashan Tillekeratne was run out attempting a second run. (Reuters)

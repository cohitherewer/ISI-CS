The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 08, 2002 				 Gordon sees tight series
																								New Delhi: Lauding the performance of the West Indies in the first one-dayer in Jamsedpur, former opener Gordon Greenidge said more such closely-fought encounters await the teams in the remaining matches.																								The team played exceptionally well and the victory was not by chance, Greenidge said Thursday. But India could very well come back winning the next match.																								He said after suffering humiliating losses in the Tests at Mumbai and Chennai, West Indies played remarkable cricket in the final Test in Calcutta.																								Greenidge felt the absence of a potent fast-bowler, poor batting and shoddy fielding let the tourists down.  (PTI)

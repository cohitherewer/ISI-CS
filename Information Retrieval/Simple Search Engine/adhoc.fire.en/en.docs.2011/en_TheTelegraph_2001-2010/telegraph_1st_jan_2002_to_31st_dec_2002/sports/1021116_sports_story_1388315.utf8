Paris Saint Germain won 1-0. (AFP)																								London: Two-time Uefa Cup winner Parma was dumped from the competition Thursday, losing 1-4 to lightly regarded Polish club Wisla Krakow. 																								The Poles made a sensational comeback to beat the highly fancied Italians in extra time to advance to the third round with a 5-3 aggregate win. Krakow had lost the first leg 1-2 in Italy on October 31 and was trailing 0-1 at home after Adriano scored for Parma in the fifth minute.																								But in a remarkable comeback, Kamil Kosowski scored in the 71st minute and Maciej Zurawski added Krakows second nine minutes later to level the aggregate score. The match then went into extra time  with Zurawski scoring again after four minutes. Daniel Dubicki added Krakows fourth goal in the 104th minute to upset the form book.																								Meanwhile, in Athens, Panathinaikos took advantage of a stadium almost devoid of Turkish fans to beat Fenerbahce 4-1 and advance to the third round. After the 1-1 first leg draw in Istanbul was marred by fan violence fuelled by historical and regional rivalries, the return leg was strictly patrolled.																								Hundreds of police patrolled the stadium and only 150 Turks were allowed to watch as Panathinaikos advanced on a 5-2 aggregate. 																								In another match with a historical rivalry, Celtic won the return leg of the battle of Britain, with Chris Sutton and Henrik Larsson scoring to give the Scottish champions a 2-0 win over Englands Blackburn for a 3-0 aggregate win.																								Also advancing Thursday were Lazio, Leeds, Schalke, Celta Vigo, Anderlecht, Boavista, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Betis, Fulham, Slavia Prague, Paok Thessaloniki, Vitesse Arnhem and FC Porto.																								But 2001 finalist Alaves of Spain was eliminated by Besiktas, an Ilhan Mansiz goal giving the Turkish side a 1-0 win and a 2-1 aggregate score.																								In another win for Turkey, Denizlispor ousted Sparta Prague, who reached the second round of the Champions League last season. Denizlispor advanced 2-1 on aggregate after a 2-0 win.																								The draw for the third round is scheduled for Friday in Geneva, and will involve teams that finished third in their group after the first round of the Champions League, including Liverpool, French clubs Auxerre, Lyon and Lens and AEK Athens.																								Violence flared in Bulgaria where a newspaper photographer was injured by a home made bomb thrown from the stands during Levski Sofias match against Sturm Graz of Austria. The match ended 1-0 to Levski, but went to penalties after a drawn aggregate score. Sturm advanced after winning the shootout 8-7. 																								But in Athens, the strong security presence more than 2,500 police and anti-riot teams encircled the Apostolos Nikolaidis stadium  and closed roads prevented any violence.																								Nikos Lymberopoulos gave Panathinaikos the lead in the 24th minute and Yiannis Goumas made it 2-0 in the 31st. Sanli Tuncay narrowed the difference for the visitors five minutes later, but Jan Michaelsen increased to 3-1 in the 38th and Krysztof Warzycha closed the scoring in the 90th.																								Leeds striker Alan Smith scored four goals as the Premier League club beat Israels Hapoel Tel-Aviv 4-1 in the neutral venue of Florence, Italy. The 22-year-old England striker scored in the 29th, 54th, 62nd and 82nd minutes against Hapoel, a surprise Uefa Cup quarter finalist last season. Leeds advanced on a 5-1 aggregate. Hapoel scored in the second minute from a Yossi Abuksis free kick, but he was sent off in the 79th minute for a second yellow card.																								Fulham beat Dinamo Zagreb 2-1 with goals from Steed Malbranque and Luis Boa Morte to win 5-1 on aggregate.																								But division one club Ipswich was eliminated by Czech club Slovan Liberec 4-2 on penalties. Liberec won 1-0 Thursday from a Baffour Gyan goal to level the aggregate score.																								In Germany, Schalke drew 0-0 with Legia Warsaw in Gelsenkirchen but progressed 3-2 on aggregate. Before the match, Schalke officials suspended German international midfielder Joerg Boehme on disciplinary grounds. Schalke coach Frank Neubarth said Boehme had behaved unprofessionally and in a manner damaging to the team, but did not give any details.  (AP)

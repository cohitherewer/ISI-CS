				 	 Zia: Shocked by margin of loss																								Islamabad: Heads rolled in the Pakistan cricket establishment Sunday with PCB chief Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia and another top official quitting a day after the national team suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Australia in Sharjah.																								Shocked by the margin of defeat where Pakistan was shot out for 59 and 53, Zia said: I could not handle the politics of the game. Enough is enough. I have done everything to lift the spirit of the game.																								An equally dejected board director Chisty Mujahid, who submitted his resignation along with Zia to President Pervez Musharraf, also the patron of the board, said: We never thought they will perform like that.																								Meanwhile, in Sharjah senior players including captain Waqar Younis, Rashid Latif and Shoaib Akhtar held meetings in the team hotel after the resignation of the two officials. Coach Richard Pybus urged Zia to reconsider his decision saying that it would be disturbing for the team.																								It is disappointing to hear that Gen. Zia has resigned. It would be disturbing for the team. But I just hope that there is some reconsideration in that, the coach said. 																								Pakistan were on Sunday heavily criticised by local papers who described their performance as a disgrace and an ignominious rout.																								n Former Pak greats stand by youngsters, on Page 18 (PTI)

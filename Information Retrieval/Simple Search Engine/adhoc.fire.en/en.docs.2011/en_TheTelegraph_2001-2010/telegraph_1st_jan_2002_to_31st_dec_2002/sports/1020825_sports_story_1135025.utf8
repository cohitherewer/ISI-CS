A few minutes later, Andrew Smith rounded off a smart move.																								Then Jamie Dwyer, whose first shot missed, pounded in for the lead from the resultant rebound.																								In the 66th minute, another defence lapse led to the third goal and the second for Smith whose move with Mike McCann saw Devesh Chauhan beaten.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 India firm on full-fledged review 
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCIs) stand on the controversial Player Terms hasnt been diluted one bit.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has specifically been told that the review must be full-fledged and not cosmetic.																								This was conveyed by BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya during his meeting with ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed, in New Delhi Wednesday.																								PTI adds from New Delhi: Desperate to resolve the contract issue ahead of the World Cup, the ICC said Wednesday it had a better understanding of the problems faced by Indian cricketers and will make all efforts to find a mutually acceptable solution.																								Speed admitted that it was not an easy task to find a solution to the issue but the games governing body had started the process. Its not an easy issue but we now have a better understanding of the problems faced by Indian players. The process has started but there is no quick solution, Speed said.																								Whats apparent is that the Indian players are the most affected. We came to know who are the players involved. We need to discuss many things before we can find a solution, Speed added.																								The contract issue involves a controversial clause in the Player Terms form for ICC meets barring cricketers from endorsing products which are in conflict of interest with the official sponsors of the event, for a period of 30 days on either side of the tournament.																								Describing the meeting as an administrative discussion, Dalmiya said the BCCIs viewpoints were put forward and the ICC was made aware of the problems faced by Indian cricketers. 																								We had a long discussion. He (Speed) gave the ICCs viewpoint. I will now take up the matter at the boards working committee meeting, Dalmiya added. 																								Speed, who also met the ICC sponsors during his two-day stay in the city, said his trip was fruitful and helped him take the solution-finding process forward.																								There was a need to have a discussion on various aspects. It is a fairly long process but we are moving forward, Speed said.

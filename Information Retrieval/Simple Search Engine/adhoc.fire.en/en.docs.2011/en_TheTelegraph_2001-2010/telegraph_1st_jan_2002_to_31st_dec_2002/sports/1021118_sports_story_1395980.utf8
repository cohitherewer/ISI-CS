 							 - Muralidharan goes past Kapils 434				 	 Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara unsuccessfully appeals against Herschelle Gibbs, who made 92, on Day III of the second Test in Centurion on Sunday. (Reuters) 																								Centurion: Captain Shaun Pollock and deputy Mark Boucher shared a century stand to move South Africa into a strong position on Day III of the second Test against Sri Lanka on Sunday.																								At close, the hosts were 421 for nine in their first innings, a lead of 98, with Pollock batting on 78 with Makhaya Ntini on three.																								Pollock and Boucher kept pace with each other throughout, passing 50 off consecutive deliveries in the final session. Their partnership was worth 132 runs, a South African record for the seventh wicket against Sri Lanka, when Boucher popped a return catch to Chamila Gamage.																								The South African vice-captain made 63 in three hours, facing 138 balls and hitting six fours.																								Muttiah Muralidharan then claimed two wickets, Andrew Hall leg before for a duck and Steve Elworthy caught at silly point for five. 																								Elworthys wicket took Muralidharan beyond Kapil Dev, into third place on the all time list of Test wicket-takers, with 435.																								Pollock hooked the penultimate delivery of the day bowled by Dilhara Fernando for six over fine leg after spending just over three and a half hours at the crease, facing 139 balls and hitting the six as well as ten fours.																								Boucher and Pollock provided the consolidation that was required after South Africa lost two wickets shortly after lunch. Ashwell Prince made 20 before gloving a Chaminda Vaas bouncer to wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara. Neil McKenzie (28) was then leg before to Gamage. South Africa had lost both Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis in the first hour of play. (Reuters)

 (AFP)																								Macau: World Cup champions Australia kept their bid for an unprecedented sixth Champions Trophy on track on Wednesday as they exacted sweet revenge on Commonwealth Games conquerors England.																								England, who beat the Hockeyroos in the semi-finals in Manchester, found a fired up Aussie team and the burning afternoon sun too hot to handle as they crumbled 0-2 at Macau Stadium.																								Im very happy with the performance. It was a very hard game in the conditions and to come out of two 4 oclock starts with two wins is very satisfying, said coach David Bell.																								However, he denied the Australians were bent on revenge. Nah. Whats there to revenge. They beat us four weeks ago. We get on with life and take each game as it comes.																								The other two matches of the day ended in draws, with The Netherlands-New Zealand finishing 2-2 and China holding Argentina 1-1.																								A revitalised Aussie team, which had looked out of sorts at the start of the elite six-nation meet, swept aside a hopelessly outgunned England to notch their second successive win, just three days after crashing to a shock 0-1 loss to China.																								They put Englands defence under pressure from the start.																								Nikki Hudson thought she had opened the scoring when she cut across two defenders on the right and unleashed a shot past Roberts, only to be adjudged by umpire to have been just outside the circle when she let fly.

		 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 Carlos believes he is the best
																								Madrid: Roberto Carlos believes his success this year for both Real Madrid and Brazil makes him a strong candidate for one of the top awards in the game.																								The attacking full-back was in eye-catching form for Real last term, helping the Spanish club to their ninth European Cup win.																								He followed that by starring in Brazils triumphant World Cup campaign in South Korea and Japan and he now believes the Fifa Player of the Year award or the Golden Ball for best player in Europe would round off the year nicely.																								Im the only player in the world that won everything in 48 days, Roberto Carlos said in an interview with Spanish sports daily AS published Tuesday.																								If they dont want to give me an award then fine, but my titles are there for all to see. My rivals all had one bad competition. Its been my year.																								Luis Figo, a teammate of Roberto Carlos at Real Madrid, is the current holder of the Fifa player of the Year award, while Liverpools England international Michael Owen won the France Football Golden Ball prize.

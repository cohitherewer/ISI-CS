The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, October 31, 2002 				 England narrowly miss victory
																								Perth: Englands Ashes campaign took a step forward on Wednesday as the tourists outplayed Western Australia only to fall five runs short of victory.																								Young pace bowler Simon Jones took five wickets before Englands batsmen, chasing 135 to win from 20 overs, closed the final day on 130 for five in the drawn encounter.																								Opener Robert Key smashed an unbeaten 59 but England, having reached 80 for two, lost momentum when Mark Butcher and John Crawley were dismissed by spinner Brad Hogg with consecutive balls.																								England began with ordinary performances in their first two tour games against second-string state sides in Perth.																								Western Australia, 114 behind on the first innings, resumed on 16 for one and had looked comfortable as they reached 122 for two at lunch.																								However, despite a 141-run stand for the third wicket between Justin Langer (68) and Chris Rogers (86), the home side then collapsed to 248 all out.																								They lost their last eight wickets for 84 runs with opening bowler Jones taking five for 78 from 19 overs at Perths WACA ground, which traditionally suits quick bowlers. (Reuters)

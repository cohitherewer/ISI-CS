		 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 Somas mark bettered by J. J. Shobha
																								Hyderabad: It was a memorable day for Arun DSouza of Andhra Pradesh as he broke a 17-year-old meet record in 3000m steeplechase in the National Games Tuesday.																								J.J. Shobha also created a new Games record in heptathlon by bettering the mark set by Soma Biswas of Bengal.																								DSouza, who finished in eight minutes and 54.07 seconds, erased the old mark set by Pradeep Kumar Dogra of Delhi who had clocked 8:58.1 in the 1985 Games in Delhi.																								In the home stretch, DSouza powered forward in strong strides and crossed the line with a big lead. R. Suresh of Services came a distant second at 9:12.71 and teammate Ranjan Kumar Jha clocked 9:16.29 for the bronze.																								Asian Games medal winner J.J. Shobha, who was the favourite to win the energy-sapping event, more than lived up to her billing.																								Her total of 5,888 points bettered the old mark of 5,445 points set by Soma Biswas in the last edition of the meet. Soma holds the national record of 6185 set in the inter-state meet held in Chennai in 2000.																								Keralas P. Bindu (4707) and Rose Mary Anthony (4530) claimed the silver and bronze, respectively.																								Uppal shines																								In tennis, Davis Cupper Vishal Uppal guided Delhi to the mens gold, while teenage sensation Sania Mirza powered hosts Andhra Pradesh to the crown in the womens section.																								While Andhra carved out a fluent 2-0 win over Karnataka, Delhi withstood a stiff challenge from Tamil Nadu before winning 2-1.																								In the mens final, Vinod Sridhar gave Tamil Nadu the lead beating Shivang Mishra 7-5, 6-2 before Uppal overcame Vijay Kannan 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). He then teamed up with Ashutosh Singh to beat Vijay and Kamala Kannan 6-4, 6-2. (PTI)

																								London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will not expand the use of television technology for umpires at next years World Cup, crickets world governing body said in a statement on Friday.																								The ICC announced its decision after examining the report of a technology trial conducted during Septembers Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka.																								ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said, Although the trial taught us a lot... too many questions remain unanswered for it to be used at other events at this time. 																								The World Cup is crickets pre-eminent tournament. It is of a standing size and complexity far greater that the Champions Trophy and it is not a tournament to trial unproven playing conditions.																								The ICC confirmed that use of technology by umpires at the World Cup would be limited to line decisions for run outs, stumpings, hit-wicket and boundaries.																								In a change to the existing playing conditions, technology would not be used to determine if a catch had been taken cleanly, unless the vision of both on-field umpires was obscured. (REUTERS)

		 Monday, December 30, 2002 				 Injured Shoaib sets dance floor on fire
				 	 Shoaib: Caught in the act																								London: Even as Pakistan faced defeat at the hands of South Africa, their ace pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar was busy bending it, not on the cricket field but on the dance floor of a luxury hotel in Durban.																								Akhtar, known as the Rawalpindi Express for his tearaway bowling, was reportedly unfit for the first Test against South Africa and supposedly back in Pakistan receiving medical treatment.																								However, according to a report in The Observer here on Sunday, Akhtar looked out from the pages of a Durban newspaper on Friday, standing beside Indian film star Amitabh Bachchan, who was in Durban to present a concert.																								According to the report, Pakistan team manager Brig (retd.) Khwaja Mohammed Nasir fumed: I want nothing to do with Shoaib Akhtar. Cricket has made him a rich man, and he can do as he pleases.																								Which is exactly what Akhtar seems to be doing, swanning about Durban with movie stars and maintaining a conspicuous presence in the citys nightclubs, the report said.																								He knows how to get down, and his knees looked just fine to me, a female admirer who shared the dance floor with the bowler said.																								The real source of Shoaibs pain may be a brewing feud in the Pakistan camp between captain Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram, who is said to have his heart set on leading the team at next years World Cup.

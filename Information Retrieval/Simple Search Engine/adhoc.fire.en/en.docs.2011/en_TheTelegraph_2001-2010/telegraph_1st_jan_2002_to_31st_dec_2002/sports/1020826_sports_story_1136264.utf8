				 																																	Taipei: Taiwans Tsai Chi-huang cruised to his third title on home soil on Sunday, firing a closing 69 to win the Taiwan Masters by five shots. The 33-year-old, two strokes clear of the field overnight, produced a blemish-free card in the final round to finish at 14-under-par 274.				 																																	Birdies at the sixth, ninth and 16th holes lifted him to his first victory on the Asian PGA Tour, earning him a winners cheque for S$71,000. He had previously won the 1997 Taiwan Open and the 1998 Taiwan PGA Championship.				 																																	Compatriot Lu Wen-teh, who won the title in 1994 and 1996, returned a 72 to finish second on 279. A further shot back in a tie for third were brothers Hsieh Yu-shu and Hsieh Chin-sheng, along with fellow Taiwanese Hong Chia-yuh and first-round leader Aaron Meeks of the US.				 																																	St Petersburg (Florida): Spanish tennis player Lourdes Dominguez Lino has been suspended by the WTA Tour after testing positive for metabolites of cocaine, the Tours website announced on Saturday. The 21-year-old, who failed the test at the WTA Tour tournament in Acapulco on March 1, has been suspended for three months with immediate effect and must forfeit all her ranking points and prize money from the Acapulco event.				 																																	Lino, who won the French Open girls title in 1999, is currently ranked 158th in the world but will fall outside the top 300 as a result of the ban.				 																																	Chandigarh: International hockey umpire Satinder Sharma, who officiated at the World Cup in Kuala Lumpur earlier this year, will be doing duty in the 24th mens Champions Trophy meet in Cologne from August 31 to September eight.				 																																	Sharma has, in recent times, had the honour of officiating in prestigious tournaments including the mens junior World Cup in Hobart. For Sharma, who will be leaving for Germany on Tuesday, to officiate at the Olympics remains his dream assignment.				 																																	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh carded a two-under 70 on Sunday, to climb up 16 places to joint 43rd on Day III of the Permian Basin Open being played in Midland, Texas. His tournament tally stands at four-under 212.				 																																	According to information received here, Mark Hensey and Brent Winston are in joint lead with a score of 15-under 201. Omar Urentsi and Tag Ridings are third, two strokes behind at 203. Tyler Williamson, winner of last weeks Wichita Open, is joint 54th after returning a one-over 73 on Sunday.				 																																	Durban: Swashbuckling South African opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs will co-author a book that will trace his tumultuous life and career. Confirming that he had signed a deal with a local cricket writer Colin Bryden and publishers New Africa Books, Gibbs said on Sunday that the book would be about his life as a coloured person and his integration into the previously white- dominated cricket world in the country.				 																																	Im really excited about putting the book together, said Gibbs. 				 																																	London: A British MP has written to Greater Manchester Police demanding they investigate Roy Keanes tackle on Alf Inge Haaland. 				 																																	Sundays Observer reported that Colchester MP Bob Russell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for sport, has taken the action to force the police to investigate the incident, which took place in a Manchester United match against Manchester City in April 2001.				 																																	In a newspaper serialisation of his autobiography, Keane admitted to deliberately targetting Haaland in revenge for perceived earlier slights. The admission prompted Russell to write that Keanes violent tackle was premeditated and was, therefore, a deliberate assault.				 																																	The letter adds: Acts of assault, whether in the workplace or at entrances to nightclubs, should not be viewed differently simply because one occurred during a football match while another was at a drinking venue. I am inviting the chief constable... to view my letter as a formal report of a crime.				 																																	n Cricket, India vs England: Third Test, Day V, live from 3.00 pm on ESPN n General: Sportline, live from 7.30 pm on STAR Sports n Tennis: US Open, live from 8.00pm and 4.30 am (Tuesday), on STAR Sports n Soccer, English Premier League: Highlights from 12 midnight on ESPN

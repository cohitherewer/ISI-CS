																								Rome: Italian football was plunged into a new bout of soul-searching on Monday after violence on and off the pitch marred several weekend games in Series A and B.																								Most commentators were united in ascribing the trouble to the culture of blame that sets clubs against each other, and everyone against the referee.																								The president of the Italian Footballers Association (AIC), Sergio Campana, even suggested banning soccer for six-months to take stock of the situation.																								If this is football, maybe it would be worth stopping it, at least for six months, to reflect on what is happening and what should be done to avoid it, he said in a statement on AICs official website.																								In the weekends worst incident, a Serie B match between Cagliari and Messina on Sunday had to be suspended after Messinas goalkeeper, Emanuele Manitta, was beaten unconscious by a fan.																								This episode is the latest in a long series of acts of aggression towards footballers, said Campana. Most happen in the minor  and therefore less well-known  professional leagues. They reveal the grave lapses in security on the part of clubs and the consequent serious risks to footballers.																								But the attack on Manitta was only the tip of the iceberg.																								On Saturday night, verbal abuse nearly turned physical as AS Roma and Inter Milan players squared up to each other at the end of a bad-tempered 2-2 draw at Romes Olympic Stadium. Afterwards, Roma coach Fabio Capello angrily blamed the referee for the fact his side didnt win and threatened to quit Italian football. (Reuters)

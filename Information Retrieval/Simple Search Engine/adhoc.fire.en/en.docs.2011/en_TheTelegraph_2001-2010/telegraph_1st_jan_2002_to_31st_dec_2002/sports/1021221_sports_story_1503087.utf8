 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: Digvijay Singh produced a late charge and shot a six-under 66 to catch up Mukesh Kumar on the leaderboard after the third days action in the Dutch-Bangla Bank Open in Dhaka on Friday. 																								According to information received here, Mukesh and Digvijay were 10-under 206 after 56 holes. The duo, thus, opened up a three-stroke lead over Zai Kipgen, who finished the day at seven-under 209. Ashok Kumar was at 211.																								 Ashok Kumar was fourth at five-under 211. Digvijay seems to be acquiring a reputation for mounting late charges in the Hero Honda Indian Golf Tour. He made a birdie on the second before two more on the fifth and ninth.																								The Meerut-based player, winner of two titles this season and No. 2 in Order of Merit, faced trouble after landing in the bunker on the left, but he came out to about two feet from the pin and made a birdie. 																								The 30-year-old made two more birdies on the fifth and seventh. However, the Meerut pro hit a bad tee shot on the par-4 ninth and ended up with a bogey to be three-under for the front nine.																								On the back nine, Digvijay made three more birdies  on the 10th, 14th and 16th with the first one being his best where he sank a severe right-to-left putt. 																								I cant complain after such a round but I could have played better. I am not thinking of the title as yet. I just want to go out and give my best, said Digvijay. 																								Mukesh, leading by a stroke overnight, said: It is still too early to talk about my fortunes. It can be anybodys game.																								Randhawa starts well																								Meanwhile, in the $ 833,000 Okinawa open in Japan, Asian PGA Tour champion Jyoti Randhawa shot a three-under 69 to be placed joint tenth after the rain-delayed first round, adds a Staff Reporter, according to reports reaching Calcutta. At the par-72 southern links golf course the tournament was reduced to a 54-hole affair after the first day was almost washed out by heavy rains.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, October 02, 2002 				 Dalmiya on ICC committee to review Player Terms
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 merriman																								Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has, finally, moved towards reviewing the controversial Player Terms. This exercise, of course, is aimed at ensuring a problem-free World Cup next February-March.																								Towards that end, the board of the IDI  business arm of the ICC, which met in Colombo Tuesday  has appointed a high-profile committee to do the needful.																								Among its members is Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya, whose plain talking during the day probably ruffled feathers.																								Its a fact Ive stayed away from committees after completing my term as ICC president (in 2000), but quite a few of my co-directors felt I should keep the larger interest in mind In the circumstances, it became difficult for me to say no, explained Dalmiya, when contacted at the Hilton late Tuesday. 																								Others on the committee are: ICC president Malcolm Gray, president-elect Ehsan Mani, chief executive Malcolm Speed and Australian Cricket Board chief Bob Merriman.																								That a review would be undertaken, after the Champions Trophy, was promised during the August 31 emergent board meeting in Dubai.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, Zimbabwes Justice Ahmed Ebrahim (a Match Referee on the ICCs Emerging Panel) is likely to join the quintet with voting powers. If that isnt worked out, Justice Ebrahim will be designated special invitee.																								Going by the committees composition, the Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica) has been totally marginalised. Fica, then, has suffered two blows in less than 24 hours  first being denied a seat on the ICCs influential cricket committee  management. 																								Significantly, the members will have access to the closely-guarded master agreement between the IDI and the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), which holds marketing rights for all ICC events till the 2007 World Cup.																								The committee, as of now, should complete its work by mid-November. However, it wont be disbanded if that unofficial deadline isnt met. 																								Part of the committees brief, one learns, is to interact with the cricketers and GCC. If required, the Dalmiyas may also directly negotiate with sponsors.																								To facilitate its functioning, the ICC will be asking the boards of all ten Test-playing nations to list specific problems with the terms and to make available details of individual pre-existing contracts which clash with the World Cups sponsors.																								The boards are expected to intimate the ICC by end October. Incidentally, the committees decision will be binding on the IDI/ICC.																								Meanwhile, the Sahara issue remained unresolved in Colombo  in other words, the organisation could stick to its stand of pulling out as the Indian teams sponsor.

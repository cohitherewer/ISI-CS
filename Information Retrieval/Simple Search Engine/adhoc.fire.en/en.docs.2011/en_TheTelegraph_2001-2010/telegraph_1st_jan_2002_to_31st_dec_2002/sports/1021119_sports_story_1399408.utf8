				 	 HARIKRISHNA: Fails to take lead																								Heraklion (Greece): Indias Krutika Nadiq pulled off a spectacular win against formidable Yang Shen of China in the fourth round to take the lead in the girls under-14 section of the World Youth Chess championship here on Monday.																								On a good day for the Indian players when as many as 17 out of 28 registered victories, Parimarjan Negi maintained his winning run in the under-10 boys category comprehensively beating Ivekovic Zvonmir of Croatia. In the same category, Y. Sandeep also emerged victorious brushing aside the challenge of Polish Zbijniew Strzemiecki with white pieces.																								Grandmaster P. Harikrishnas hopes of becoming the sole leader in the under-18 boys section suffered a setback when he failed to beat the lower-ranked opponent Lopez Silva of Chile in a fourth round match.																								Playing a safe game from the beginning, Lopez gave little chance to his famed opponent and managed a draw after the Indian made a technical skirmish of Sicilian Sveshnikov with black pieces. The day, however, belonged to Pune-based Krutika who put up a brilliant performance to beat last years under-12 champion Shen. Playing white, Krutika employed a dangerous pawn sacrifice variation in the initial phase of a Ruy Lopez defence. Shen had little clue about on-board happenings as the Indian slowly regained her pawn and maintained a superior position right till the end.																								Unable to hold on, the Chinese girl finally succumbed to the enormous pressure around her king and entered a lost king and pawn endgame where the Indian made no mistake to pocket full points. Asian junior champion Tania Sachdev also put in a good show to beat Maria de Plazaola of Argentina in the under-16 (girls) category. Seeded 11th, Tania on 3.5 points moved to sole lead with this win.																								In the under-10 girls, Asian champion P. Lakshmi Sahiti defeated Wing-Yan Yuen of France with black pieces and took her tally to 3.5 points. M. Manogna of India drew her second straight game to finish the round with 3 points. Former world under-12 champion Deep Sengupta came back into reckoning with a hard-fought victory against Mezhlumyan Yahram of Armenia with black pieces in the boys under-14 category.																								K Nikhilesh Kumar is leading this category amongst Indians with 3.5 points while Deep moved to three with the victory. (PTI)

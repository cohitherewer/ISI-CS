		 Wednesday, October 02, 2002 				 Points to be shared for disrupted ties: Gray
																								Colombo: Teams at next years World Cup will share points if their matches cannot be played because of security reasons, ICC president Malcolm Gray said Tuesday. If any of the matches are disrupted in the World Cup or cant be played because of safety reasons the points will be shared, he said after an ICC executive board meeting.																								The World Cup will be played in South Africa in February and March next year but six matches are scheduled in politically volatile Zimbabwe as well as two in Kenya. Gray said any dispute between teams over sharing points would be adjudicated by an ICC commissioner. The ICC has also decided there will be no reserve day during the preliminary stages. He added that an ICC delegation would travel to Zimbabwe next month to study the security situation there before a decision was taken on whether it could stage its World Cup matches.																								There are some perceived and some real problems regarding World Cup matches being played in Zimbabwe, Gray said.																								The ICC will be guided by a report to be submitted by the team, which will comprise its chief executive, the chief executives of the six countries due to play in Zimbabwe, players representatives, the ICCs commercial partner and its insurance company.																								Namibia, England, India, Australia, The Netherlands and Pakistan are scheduled to play in Zimbabwe. (Reuters)

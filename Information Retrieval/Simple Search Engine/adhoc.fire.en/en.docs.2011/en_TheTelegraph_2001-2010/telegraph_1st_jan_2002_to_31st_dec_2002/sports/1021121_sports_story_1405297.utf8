		 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 James Kirtley to fill in for Gough
																								London: Fast bowler James Kirtley was called into the England squad on Wednesday for the triangular one-day series with Australia and Sri Lanka starting next month.																								With Darren Gough now unable to play in the VB Series, James has been selected for our one-day squad, chairman of selectors David Graveney said in a statement. 																								James played in the NatWest Series last summer and I am sure he will play a full part in the upcoming series in Australia.																								The 27-year-old Sussex paceman also replaced the injured Gough, who was ruled out of the Ashes Tour last week because of long-term knee problems, at the ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka in September.																								He has played seven one-day Internationals, taking six wickets at 50.83. He has not played a Test.																								Kirtley will join one-day specialists Ian Blackwell, Paul Collingwood, Ronnie Irani, Nick Knight, Owais Shah and Jeremy Snape as the additions for the series.																								Yorkshires Craig White, who was named as a one-day player, has since joined up with the Test squad to cover for injuries.																								The remainder of the 16-man squad will be made up of Test players, who will be selected closer to the start of the series on December 13.  (REUTERS)

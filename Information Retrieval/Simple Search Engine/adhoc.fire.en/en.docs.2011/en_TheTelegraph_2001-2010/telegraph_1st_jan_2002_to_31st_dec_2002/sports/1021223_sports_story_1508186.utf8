Lehmann smashed 12 fours and a six to top-score with 119 as Australia amassed a record 305 for five from 50 overs. Their total was their highest against any team at the WACA.																								The Sri Lankans, yet to win a game in the tournament after twice losing to England, then crumbled to 163 all out in 43 overs as the Australians won their third successive match and returned to the top of the competition standings.																								Lehmann, promoted to open the batting in place of the injured Adam Gilchrist, scored his third one-day International century but his first on home soil.																								He was well supported by Matthew Hayden (64) and Michael Bevan, who made an unbeaten 40 in just 41 balls. (Reuters)

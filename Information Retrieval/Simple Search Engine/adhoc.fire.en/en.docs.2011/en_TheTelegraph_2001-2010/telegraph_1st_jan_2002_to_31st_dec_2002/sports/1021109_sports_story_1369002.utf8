																								Manchester: Manchester United on Friday announced legal action against Italian side Lazio for non-payment of the transfer fee for Dutch defender Jaap Stam.																								Lazio owner Sergio Cragnottis food company Cirio, which has a controlling stake in the Rome club, was declared on Friday to have defaulted in repaying a 150 million euro (about $150 million) loan. Trading in Lazio shares was suspended.																								Manchester United said they are still owed 12 million for Stams transfer at the beginning of last season. Discussions have been ongoing to reach agreement for a rescheduling of the payment of this debt, and compensation for the delay, but these have still not reached a conclusion, the English club said in a statement.

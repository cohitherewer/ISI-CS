The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, October 12, 2002 				 Bronze in taekwondo
																								Busan, Oct. 11 (PTI): Surendra Bhandari won Indias first medal in taekwondo in the 14th Asian Games by clinching a bronze in the flyweight (58 kg) category Friday.																								The 17-year-olds achievement is all the more creditable because the government had not cleared the taekwondo team. Bhandari won three rounds before losing to Behzad Khodadad of Iran in the semi-finals.																								The Uttar Pradesh youngster was sharp with the kicks but made a bad start to the semi-final bout and conceded three points in the first round.																								Gopichand in quarters																								There was good news in badminton as well as Pullela Gopichand moved into the quarter finals with a 17-15, 15-6 win over Boonsak Ponsana of Thailand. He will meet second seed Seung Mo Shon of South Korea Saturday for a place in the semis.																								In contrast, the show was dismal in equestrian team show jumping and womens hockey. The equestrian team comprising Sudhir Ahlawat, Sandeep Dewan, Jaspal Massih and Sajjan Kumar was placed ninth after the first round.																								Last in womens hockey																								The womens hockey team lost 0-2 to Japan to finish fourth in the four-team field. It was a disappointing show by the Indian women, who won the Commonwealth Games gold in Manchester earlier this year.																								China beat South Korea 2-1 to win gold.

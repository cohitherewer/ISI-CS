Tennis squad under fire																								Meanwhile, the Bengal tennis squad in the National Games faces disciplinary action with the team bosses threatening to show-cause them for leaving the Games village without intimation.																								The players had moved to a city hotel on December 14, only a day after their arrival, expressing dissatisfaction with the arrangements in the village.																								They never cared to inform us about their decision nor have they cared to keep in touch with us after shifting elsewhere, Bengal deputy chef-de-mission Dilip Pal said.																								Maintaining that the tennis contingent should have taken permission from chef-de-mission Dilip Bhattacharjee before deciding to move out, Pal said neither he nor Bhattacharjee had any idea about their current whereabouts.																								However, Bengal tennis coach Sayandeb Chakraborty denied that his charges had left without informing anyone.																								We left a chit for the chef-de-mission informing him of our decision, he said.																								Pal said we will be held responsible if anything untoward happens to them. We are not going to tolerate such acts of gross indiscipline... We will definitely issue a show-cause notice to them.																								He said the matter has already been taken up with the Bengal Lawn Tennis Association chief B.K. Saha.																								Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu tennis team has also moved to a city hotel as they were not satisfied with facilities in the village. But they had sought prior permission from the chef-de-mission, a source in the Tamil Nadu camp said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, November 04, 2002 				 Malhotra seeks Lal explanation
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Ashok Malhotra just cant accept the unceremonious closure of the Association of Indian Cricketers (AIC) which was formed in 1989.																								He admits he has woken up late, which coincided with the recent launch of the Indian Cricket Players Association (ICPA), but perhaps feels its better late than never.																								The former India batsman said Sunday that he has written a letter to the then AIC secretary Arun Lal, seeking details of things like the list of members, minutes of meetings and expenditures.																								Lal, also the ICPA secretary, has been asked to reply within 15 days.																								I am not questioning his (Lal) fairness. My point is why has the body been declared defunct without consulting the members. There were 300 of us and no one knows why a sum to the tune of Rs 10 lakh, which we generated, is lying idle in the bank, said Malhotra.																								Lal refused to comment on Malhotras argument, but added he is yet to receive any letter. And why should I comment on what Ashok Malhotra says, quipped the former opener.																								Malhotra, also a former national selector, didnt rule out reviving the old body, but added that other members of the AIC will be consulted if the ICPA offers them to join the new association.																								Malhotra said though he had written to Lal in individual capacity, as a member of the 1989 body, he is in touch with people who think likewise. Cant say the names. They will be disclosed when necessary.																								His letter to Lal ends stating that we shall have to take necessary recourses if the reply is not received in 15 days. But Malhotra refused to elaborate. Youll see that if it becomes necessary.																								Quite a clash between two former cricketers known to be close to each other till a few years back.

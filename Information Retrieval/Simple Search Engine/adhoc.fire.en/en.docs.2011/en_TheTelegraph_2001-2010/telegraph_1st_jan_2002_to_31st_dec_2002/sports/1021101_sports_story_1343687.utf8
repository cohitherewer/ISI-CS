The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 01, 2002 				 With experience, I have learnt the bad days exceed the good ones: Carl Hooper
 							 - Please dont crucify somebody after one failure...equally dont hail somebody as the next Bradman after one innings BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Its been a difficult tour for the West Indies and, being the captain, its been tough on Carl Hooper. Failing to lead from the front hasnt made it any easier. The final Test, though, is alive and the one-day series is yet to begin. Opportunities, then, for Hooper  who recently spoke to The Telegraph  to get the act right.																								The following are excerpts																								On what actually made him quit cricket just before the 1999 World Cup																								Ninety per cent of the decision was influenced by family matters Our son (Carl Junior) had just been born and he wasnt keeping well There was a bit of cricket-related pressure as well, not that I couldnt have overcome that.																								On talk that not getting the captaincy had begun to bother him																								Absolutely untrue. I never thought of the captaincy (After a pause) Now that Ive been captain, I can understand why the likes of Jimmy Adams and Brian Lara got affected.																								On what made him return to big-time cricket																								I hadnt quit either because I had a major injury or was playing poorly So Some people did have plenty of harsh things to say but, at the end of the day, I was in the drivers seat and all decisions were mine alone I would have been perfectly happy doing my bit for Guyana only, after coming back from Adelaide Being a West Indian, my heart and soul can only be in the West Indies, isnt it? 																								On whether, at any time, teammates too had requested him to take back his retirement																								Surprisingly, no Much as one may have buddies, once its over, its over Obviously, cricket is important to me. At the same time, it isnt the No. 1 priority. The family has always been important, as also God. In fact, God first.																								On whether he missed the limelight during the two years he was away from international cricket																								Im not that type While I do love the game, I hate everything else that goes with it Only, one has to accept everything as being part of the game. The ideal situation, really, would be to return to the family after the days play.																								On whether the lack of proper grounding, as coach Roger Harper put it, is the principal reason for the West Indies continuing below-par performances																								That and the pressure of expectations As things are, most of the boys get to learn the game only when they make the West Indies side I hate to say this, but it will take us quite some years to get back to where we were, say, in the Eighties. 																								On whether comparisons with Clive Lloyds team, for instance, makes it more difficult for the present lot																								The difference is much the same as between chalk and cheese! Yes, its unfair 																								On 15 years (break included) of international cricket																								 (Laughs) Nothing comes easy though, when I got a hundred in only my second Test (Eden, 1987-88), I did think nothing was easier than cricket at the highest level With experience, Ive learnt the bad days exceed the good ones and that when the good days come about, one should look at 150 instead of just a 40-50.																								On whether, given a chance, he would change anything																								Not that I have regrets, but I would definitely love to take on-board some of the things much earlier Of course, this is not to suggest one is ever too old to learn.																								On criticism about the attitude of some West Indians																								Look, you shouldnt be harsh Moreover, most are very young and, so, bound to make mistakes. Please dont crucify somebody after one failure. Equally, dont hail somebody as the next Bradman after one innings.																								On whether a decline in the quality of wickets has, generally, contributed to a decline in the quality of cricketers																								Perhaps, yes Some tracks are just not conducive to good cricket You will still have a Sachin Tendulkar, but 																								On learning from the captains he played under																								First and foremost that the maroon cap is all about pride and passion Viv (Richards), for example, embodied both One learnt other things too. (After a pause) Actually, the captains I played under had such fine teams																								On his own experience as captain																								Well, as Ive said, I never thought I would captain the West Indies  for that matter, never thought I would captain Guyana Indeed, captaincy wasnt a big area of focus for me Ive been learning, its been a period of trial-and-error Ive been telling the boys we must be competitive and must be so over all five days of a Test. The next stage is going beyond just being competitive.																								On what has he learnt as captain																								Not to expect an overnight turnaround, that I should set small targets Also, that irrespective of how you play, you will still only be judged by the result  not the effort. Thats the bottomline. 																								On who makes a good captain																								Captaincy goes well beyond the playing field You cant, for instance, switch off being captain at stumps The players may or may not wish to discuss purely personal problems but, as captain, youve got to have an open door. For the players to remain focussed, they must be comfortable off the field. A captain has a role there.																								On whether he is as cool in the dressing room as he is on the field																								(Smiles) Every individual is prone to moments of anger. Yet, what needs to be remembered is that cricket is a sport only and meant to be enjoyed. 																								On whether he agrees that a captain is only as good as his team																								Totally Give the most astute captain a poor side and even he wont be able to do anything.																								On whether he admires a contemporary captain																								Nasser Hussain He has turned a placid bunch into a team which wants to be competitive. 																								On whether even he has to do a Frank Worrell or a Lloyd and encourage players to shed that insular feeling																								Its different today Not just cricket, but the world itself has changedEven the computer is such a distraction. Nowadays, players dont mind spending hours on the lap-top, as opposed to going over to a teammate and discussing the game Looking back, I didnt require much time to find my feet as the team had so many seniors who knew exactly what it took to succeed. I learnt much by interacting with them. Speaking generally, its unfair to expect youngsters to straightaway make an impact. But, yes, its important to have a high work-ethic and be disciplined.																								On whether he is conscious of being seen as an ambassador for the sport, not just West Indies cricket																								No, no One does want to be seen in a positive manner, but whats most important is my relationship with God and my family.																								On his inspiration																								Viv and Lloyd Then, the late Ayrton Senna Outside sport, its my (second) wife Constance.																								Finally, on the future																								At this moment, Im looking to playing till the World Cup.

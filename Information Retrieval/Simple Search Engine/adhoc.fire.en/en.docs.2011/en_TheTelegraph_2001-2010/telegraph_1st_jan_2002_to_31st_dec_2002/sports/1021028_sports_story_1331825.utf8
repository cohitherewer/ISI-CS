The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, October 28, 2002 				 Vengsarkar sceptical about ICPA 
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Dilip Vengsarkar at a city hotel Sunday. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Calcutta, Oct 27: Dilip Vengsarkar was a rookie when Indias first players body was formed in the mid-Seventies. More than a decade later, he was captain when the move to start the Association of Indian Cricketers (AIC) took firm shape.																								Both bodies, as it turned out, went defunct all too soon. Predictably, then, Vengsarkar is a trifle sceptical about the newest venture: Indian Cricket Players Association, set to be launched here Tuesday with Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi as president.																								[While Pataudi is unlikely to be present at the launch, he will be around during Thursdays fund-raiser.]																								Going by experience, I know its not easy to run such bodies From what I remember, both were forgotten once the issues, which prompted their formation, were sorted out, Vengsarkar told The Telegraph Sunday afternoon.																								Incidentally, Vengsarkar was vice-president in the Kapil Dev-headed AIC.																								In the city to spot talent at the regional U-15 tournament, he added: Frankly, the to-be-formed association shouldnt be dependent on the stars only and, to survive, must be professionally managed.																								Moreover, in Vengsarkars opinion, the body should look to having all first-class cricketers as members. 																								Otherwise, it will fade away should the present-day stars lose interest Indeed, I quite agree with the Board that it must be fully representative, he observed.																								While Bishen Singh Bedi and Sunil Gavaskar took the lead in the mid-Seventies, the AIC came into being after the Board booked a clutch of top players for unauthorised appearances in North America after the 1989 tour of the West Indies.																								The latest move, of course, gained momentum during the recent Player Terms row  bang in the middle of the Test series in England. 																								I hope that controversy isnt the only reason why the players have got involved Also, at no time should the association be confrontationist. Im not privy to how the Board will formally respond, but the players should be looking to complement it (the Board), Vengsarkar pointed out.																								The present lot has been speaking much the same language and, so, there shouldnt be any jhamela. For the record, Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya has this to say: The issue will first have to be discussed at the working committee-level																								Beneficiaries 																								Meanwhile, part of the proceeds from the fund-raiser by the newest body will go to the New Delhi-headquartered Child Relief and You (CRY). The other beneficiary is expected to be The Telegraph Education Foundation.																								Significantly, CRY is Sourav Gangulys choice. Wife Dona, who is associated with the organisation, apparently helped the captain take that decision.

				 																																	London: Surrey were crowned English county champions on Saturday as title rivals Warwickshire and Kent failed to make inroads into their lead at the top of the table.				 																																	Surrey, who were not in action, claimed their third title in four years when Warwickshire were unable to secure maximum batting points in their draw with Lancashire and Kent failed to beat Somerset.				 																																	With two games still to play, Adam Hollioakes side have an unassailable lead thanks to eight victories from 14 matches this summer. Hollioake, who missed the first half of the season after the death of his brother and teammate Ben in a car crash earlier in the year, was full of praise for his squad.				 																																	I feel honoured to know them, they are a special bunch, said Hollioake. 				 																																	Kaunas (Lithuania): Some 100 German football hooligans attacked the president of their countrys football federation Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder on Saturday following their side 2-0 win here in a Euro 2004 qualifier. The fans threw bricks and beer glasses in the direction of the 69-year-old Mayer-Vorfelder, shouting football-mafia dfb and Vorfelder out. 				 																																	Mayer-Vorfelder was furious that some fans had interrupted the Lithuanian national anthem before the game by singing Deutchland Uber Alles. Fans from both countries had briefly clashed the previous day following a match between their respective under-21 sides.				 																																	Middlesbrough: Thirty-six years after they achieved one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history by beating Italy 1-0, members of the North Korean soccer team will return next month to watch a documentary marking the event. The 80-minute documentary is titled The Game of Their Lives and will be screened at the Sheffield international documentary film festival as well as in Middlesbrough, London, Liverpool and Shanghai.				 																																	Matchwinner Pak Do Ik will be among those making the trip and, although the venue, Ayresome Park, no longer exists, they will be guests of honour at Middlesbroughs new Riverside stadium when the team plays Leeds United in a Premier League game. They have also been invited to Englands European championship qualifying game against Macedonia at Southamptons St Marys ground on October 16.				 																																	Seoul: Spains Sergio Garcia sealed a comfortable victory in the Asian Tours Korean Open on Sunday. Garcia fired a five-under-par round of 67 at the Seoul Hanyang Country Club to finish on a tournament record 23-under-par total of 265, three strokes clear of the field. 				 																																	It was the Garcias third victory of the season following the US PGA Tours Mercedes Championship and the Spanish Open.				 																																	Koreas Kang Wook-soon shot a final-round 69 to finish second, while Chio Gwang-soo, Park Nam-sin and Kim Jong-duk tied for third.				 																																	Milan: Ronaldos trainer, who helped the Brazilian superstar recover from a torn knee tendon and return to competitive play, told an Italian daily that Real Madrid got a completely fit player from Inter Milan. 				 																																	Media reports have said that if Ronaldo suffers another serious injury to his right knee, then Real might suspend its transfer payment to Inter. 				 																																	However, the clubs have not confirmed any such clause. 				 																																	His knee is healthy ... Its up to Real Madrid to preserve it, Nilton Petrone told the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera.				 																																	Petrone confirmed that the Spanish club, which signed Ronaldo last week, had effectively dismissed him as personal trainer of the Brazilian world champion.				 																																	Petrone was Ronaldos personal trainer during the two years that he was sidelined with a knee injury.				 																																	n Cricket, India vs England: Final Test, Day V, live from 3.00 pm on ESPN n Cricket: Super selector, launch show from 1.00 pm on STAR Sports n Soccer: Football Asia from 6.30pm on STAR Sports n Golf: Canadian Open, from 8pm on STAR Sports

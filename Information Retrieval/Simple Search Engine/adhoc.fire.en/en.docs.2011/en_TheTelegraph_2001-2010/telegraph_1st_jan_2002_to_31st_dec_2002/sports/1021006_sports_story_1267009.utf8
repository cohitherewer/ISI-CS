 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 5: The BCCI has appealed to the Sahara India group to return as sponsors of the Indian cricket team. 																								BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya wrote a letter to the group requesting it to reconsider its decision in the best interests of the sport.																								It is not a question of money or getting an alternative sponsor, but it is a question of patronage and support that Sahara has offered to cricket over the years that prompted BCCI to appeal, Dalmiya said.

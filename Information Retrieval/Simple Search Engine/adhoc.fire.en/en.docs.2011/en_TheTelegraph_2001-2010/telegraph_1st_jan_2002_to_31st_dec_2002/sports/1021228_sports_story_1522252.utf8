																								London: Former Australian international goalkeeper Mark Bosnich was Friday suspended from football worldwide after the English FA confirmed he had tested positive for cocaine.																								In a statement posted on the FAs website, the governing body said Bosnich had been charged with taking a banned drug and bringing the game into disrepute.																								The FA would not normally make any public statements at this stage of a case of this type, the statement said.																								However, in view of numerous media reports over the past few weeks, the situation required clarification.																								The charges respectively relate to bringing the game into disrepute and to breaching the FAs doping regulations by testing positive for a prohibited substance, namely cocaine. 																								Bosnich will be suspended from all football activities until the charges have been heard. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Nayeem misses working in city
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Former national football coach Syed Nayeemuddin is currently coaching Andhra Pradesh ahead of the National Games in December. 																								The Dronacharya, known for his glittering success with the Calcutta clubs, told The Telegraph: I have taken charge of the state team for the last couple of months. Though I miss working in Calcutta, its always an honour to work for your own state. Nayeem, who is currently in the city, said that he has asked the IFA to organise a few practice matches for the Andhra Pradesh team against the Bengal team for the National Games. 																								The coach praised the facilities in Andhra Pradesh. But the problem with the players is that it becomes really tough to get them released from their official duties to play for their state. 																								Nayeem also informed that AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had offered him the post of the head of the AIFFs youth development programme. Im keen about that project, as and when it starts, he added.

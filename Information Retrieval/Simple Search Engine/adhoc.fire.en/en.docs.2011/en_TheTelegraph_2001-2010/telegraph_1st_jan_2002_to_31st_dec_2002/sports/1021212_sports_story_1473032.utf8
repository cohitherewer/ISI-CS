																								New Delhi: The Indian campaign at the GAIL Asian Junior Tennis Championship continued largely on the efforts of the girls as six of them  including Sania Mirza, Isha Lakhani and Ankita Bhambri moved into the quarter finals at the DLTA courts on Wednesday.																								The news from the boys section was not encouraging though with only Amanjot Singh and Somdev Dev Verman keeping alive Indias hopes.																								Ankita overcame So Jung-kim of Korea. After losing the first set, she changed tactics in the second and went on to win 0-6, 6-1, 6-4. Isha had an easy 6-0, 6-2 victory over compatriot Sandhya Nagaraj, a wild card entrant.																								Sania once again struggled with her serves, lost two of them in the second set, but still won 7-5, 6-3 to Yi Chen of Chinese Taipei. 																								Six Indian men fell in the second round matches on Wednesday. Amanjot won a creditable 6-0, 6-1 victory over Kenichiro Nakahara of Japan who at 154 is about 140 places above him. 																								Dev Verman defeated Divij Sharan 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Tushar Liberhan lost 1-6, 6-0, 5-7 to Weerapat Doakmaiklee of Thailand. Karan Rastogi and Saurabh Kohli also met the same fate.  (PTI)

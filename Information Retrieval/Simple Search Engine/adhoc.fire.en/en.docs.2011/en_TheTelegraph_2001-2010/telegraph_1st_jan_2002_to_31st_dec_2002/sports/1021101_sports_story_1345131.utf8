																								Mumbai: After cricket and football, its now hockeys turn. 																								In a bid to improve the standard of Indian hockey, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) has decided to hire the services of a foreign coach on a temporary basis.																								IHF president K.P.S. Gill told reporters here on Wednesday that the federation has shortlisted a couple of European coaches to do the job but declined to name them.																								We have shortlisted two European coaches but I cannot reveal their names as nothing has been finalised, he said. 																								He, however, made it clear that the move was not intended at removing the Indian coach from the post and the foreign coach would be appointed for a temporary period. The foreign coach would supplement his Indian counterpart and not replace him.																								To meet the cost involved in hiring a foreign coach, Gill said the federation was trying to get a grant from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). 																								Hiring a foreign coach is an expensive process and we have had talks with Federation Internationale de Hockey (FIH) regarding this issue and are trying to get a grant from the solidarity fund of the IOC. Lets hope something works out soon, Gill added.  (PTI)

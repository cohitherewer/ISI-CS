				 																																	Sydney: Former Australia cricket captain and current national selector Allan Border said Sunday his planned 31-day charity walk, starting Tuesday, was an act of madness.				 																																	On Tuesday, he leaves Sydney Cricket Ground for a 1,000km walk to Brisbanes Gabba ground with his wife Jane and former Australia cricketer Dean Jones.				 																																	The trio, who will be joined by Australian sporting celebrities along the journey and will be supporting childrens charities, plan to arrive in Brisbane on November 7  the opening day of the five-Test Ashes series against England.				 																																	I think we all know its going to be very tough but I suppose its for the right reasons so that will get you through, Border said. Border said he had been inspired by the charity walks of his friend and former England captain Ian Botham.				 																																	London: Arsenal striker Thierry Henry has dedicated the remainder of his career to the English Premier League champions because of the loyalty shown to him by manager Arsene Wenger.				 																																	In an interview published in The Sunday Times, Henry said Wenger had shown faith in him when he had been omitted from the French national team. Arsene believed in me, he said. 				 																																	I cannot forget that. That is why I want to do it at this club and nowhere else. This is why I want to dedicate my whole career to Arsenal.				 																																	St. Andrews: Ernie Els pulled out of the Dunhill Links Championships fourth and final round Sunday due to the imminent birth of his second child.				 																																	The British Open champion flew back to his Wentworth home in England earlier in the day to join his wife Liezl.				 																																	Liezl had already gone into labour, tournament officials said Sunday. Els, who was five under for the tournament after opening rounds of 72, 67 and 72, promised Wednesday that he would withdraw from the event if his second child was born within the following five days. 				 																																	The world number three, who finished second to Scotlands Paul Lawrie in last years event, said families came first and it was pretty important for him to be at the birth. I want to be there for the birth, obviously, but I know shell hang on.				 																																	 n Cricket: Pakistan vs Australia 1st Test, Day 5, live from 9.55 am on STAR Sports n Cricket talk show: Best of Harsha Online from 10.30 pm on STAR Sports n Legends of cricket: From 8.30 pm on ESPN n Soccer: Spanish football league from 7 am on STAR Sports

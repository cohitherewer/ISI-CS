(Reuters)																								London: Brazil crashed to a 0-1 home defeat to Paraguay Wednesday in their first match after winning the World Cup and the last under coach Luiz Felipe Scolari.																								Paraguay striker Nelson Cuevas stole the limelight from Brazils Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho to score the only goal in the 28th minute. He slipped past midfielder Gilberto Silva and fired a low shot in off the post from 25 metres.																								Ronaldo, caught up in a protracted soap opera over his future with Inter Milan, looked slow and lethargic in his first game since scoring both goals in the World Cup final against Germany 52 days ago.																								He was taken off after only 33 minutes and looked exhausted.																								Despite missing regulars Jose Luis Chilavert, Carlos Gamarra, Roque Santa Cruz and Francisco Arce  who has retired from international football  Paraguay played their usual brand of uncomplicated and effective game under caretaker coach Anibal Ruiz.																								In Europe, the first big international soccer night of the season following the World Cup heralded a new era with the start of the qualifying campaign for Euro 2004 just over two weeks away.																								Slovenia produced the outstanding away performance to beat Italy 1-0 in Trieste in a match stopped several times because of crowd trouble among the visiting supporters. Sebastjan Cimirotic scored an excellent solo goal after 32 minutes to clinch the victory.																								Germans force draw																								Germany took an injury-ravaged team to Bulgaria and forced a 2-2 draw after twice falling behind.																								Dimitar Berbatov (21) and Krassimir Balakov (50, penalty) scored for Bulgaria, but Germany, with Oliver Kahn among those missing, hit back through Michael Ballack (23, penalty) and debutant Arne Friedrich (57), a second half substitute.																								Turkey overpowered Georgia 3-0 as coach Senol Gunes finally dropped Hakan Sukur from his starting line-up. Ireland, who came home unbeaten from the World Cup after only losing to Spain on penalties in the second round, continued their good form with a 3-0 win over Finland in Helsinki.																								France, deposed as world champions after failing to score a goal or win a game in the finals, did score against Tunisia  but failed to win again, being held to a 1-1 draw.																								Mickael Silvestre headed France ahead after 18 minutes in Rades, Tunisia, but the home side equalised through Ali Zitouni 20 minutes later to spoil new French coach Jacques Santinis hopes of starting off with a win.																								With Puskas watching																								Spain, playing their first match under Ineki Saez, drew 1-1 with Hungary at the newly renovated Ferenc Puskas Stadium in Budapest, formerly known as the Nepstadion.																								The old maestro, now 75, who played for both countries in his glittering career, was the guest of honour and saw Raul Tamudo score for the visitors and Vasile Miriuta reply for the home side.																								In a match charged with political significance, Yugoslavia beat Bosnia 2-0 in Sarajevo, the first time they had met on the territory of the old federation since the war of 1992-95. They had earlier met twice in the Millennium Cup in Indian in January 2001.																								Fans hurl smoke bombs																								Italy hosted troublesome visitors as the Slovenian fans halted the match twice in the first half by throwing smoke bombs on the field. There was another stoppage in the second half when a visiting fan ran across the pitch.																								There was also a bizarre incident at the end of the first half when Slovenia midfielder Milenko Acimovic was shown a red card just two minutes after coming on as substitute, but was allowed to play on after the referee changed his mind.																								The official had awarded a second yellow card in what appeared to be a case of mistaken identity and allowed the player to return after an intervention from the assistant referee.																								The match was Italys first since their controversial exit from the World Cup with a second-round defeat to co-hosts South Korea. But rather than help push that traumatic defeat into the history books, Wednesdays unconvincing performance left fans unhappy.																								Coach Giovanni Trapattoni was without Francesco Totti and Christian Vieri but must have been disappointed with the way his side failed to cope with the Slovenes in the first half. copy;  Copyrights 2002.

				 	 mahesh: 7th Grand Slam title																								New York: Mahesh Bhupathi added another Grand Slam crown to his growing list when he and Belarussian Max Mirnyi conquered Czech duo Jiri Novak and Radek Stepanek 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in the mens doubles final at Flushing Meadow Friday.																								This is Bhupathis seventh Grand Slam title  four in mens competition and three in mixed doubles. In mens doubles, its a major breakthrough for the Bangalorean as all his previous three triumphs (1999 French Open, 1999 Wimbledon and 2001 French Open) were with Leander Paes.																								While Paes has struggled with his form since the split with Bhupathi in March, the latter has continued to do well.																								What is even more creditable for Bhupathi and Mirnyi is the fact that they had to play three matches in a span of 24 hours. The third seeds won their quarter final and semi-final Thursday.																								The duo defeated defending champions, Zimbabwes Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett, 7-6, 5-7, 7-6 in the quarter finals before ousting American twins Bob and Mike Bryan 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in the semi-finals later Thursday.

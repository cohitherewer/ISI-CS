The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, October 28, 2002 				 England top-order set for reunion 
																								Perth: Big left-hander Marcus Trescothick on Sunday expressed confidence that he and Michael Vaughan will quickly re-establish their prolific liaison at the top of the England order when Vaughan returns from injury.																								We wont find any problems getting back together, Trescothick, from Somerset, said as England prepared for a three-day match against Western Australia starting at the WACA ground from Monday.																								Its not a major worry that we cannot bat together at the moment, he said. Once he comes back, it just wont be a problem. We get a rapport going in terms of running between the wickets, and you talk together when you are having a partnership. You settle in and feel quite at home with someone you know.																								Vaughan, still recovering from right knee surgery at the end of the English season, has not played in the tourists first two games and is also expected to miss this three-dayer. This has left Trescothick to face the new ball with Robert Key  a teaming likely to be used again in the new clash.																								Vaughan is hoping to be ready for the following game, another three-day encounter, against Queensland in Brisbane from Saturday.																								England will rely heavily on the Trescothick-Vaughan combination to provide them with strong starts against the powerful Australian attack.																								The English pair had outstanding success on home soil last summer, averaging starts of 86.4 runs the seven times they padded up together in three Tests against Sri Lanka and one against India after Trescothick returned from injury. 																								Off Sri Lankan bowling, they hit 17, 168, 92, 66 and 50 (unbroken stand), while in the fourth Test versus India they helped themselves to 98 and 114 (unbroken). (AFP)

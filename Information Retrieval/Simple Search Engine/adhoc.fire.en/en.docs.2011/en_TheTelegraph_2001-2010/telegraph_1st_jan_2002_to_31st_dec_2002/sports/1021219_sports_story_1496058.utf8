The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 Deep, Rohan make the cut 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Deep Dasgupta																								Calcutta: Bengal skipper Rohan Gavaskar, wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta and young Mumbai seamer Avishkar Salvi have been named among the 30 probables for the World Cup announced Wednesday.																								Announcing the list of probables, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary S.K. Nair added that Sourav Ganguly has been retained skipper till the World Cup.																								The surprise inclusions in the 30 are veteran Karnataka seamer Venkatesh Prasad and Mumbai leg-spinner Sairaj Bahutule.																								Of the players named, 14 have already been picked for the one-dayers to be played in New Zealand.																								From those with the Test squad currently in New Zealand, the players not named in the list of probables are Shiv Sundar Das and Ajay Ratra.																								Bengal off-spinner Sourashish Lahiris name was discussed prominently, but the fact that Sarandeep Singh of Punjab returned figures of 10-0-31-0 when the West Indies posted a mammoth 315 in the last ODI in Vijayawada tilted the balance in his favour.																								Bengal medium-pacer Ranadeb Boses name also came up but he lost out as Salvis matchwinning efforts in the Ranji Trophy came in handy.																								About naming the final XI before the ICC deadline of December 31, the BCCI secretary said: We are trying to name the squad before the deadline. We are confident that we will succeed in our effort, said the BCCI secretary.																								This question came up because the contracts imbroglio is still to be solved. If the squad of 15 is picked before the deadline, the selection meeting will take place in Mumbai a couple of days before December 31.																								THE PROBABLES																								Batsmen: Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, V.V.S. Laxman, Dinesh Mongia, Gautam Gambhir, Rohan Gavaskar.																								Medium-pacers: Zaheer Khan, Jawagal Srinath, Tinu Yohannan, Ashish Nehra, L. Balaji, Irfan Pathan, Avishkar Salvi, Venkatesh Prasad.																								Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Sarandeep Singh, Murali Kartik, Sairaj Bahutule.																								Allrounders: Sanjay Bangar, Ajit Agarkar, Rakesh Patel, J.P. Yadav, Reetinder Singh Sodhi.																								Specialist wicketkeepers: Deep Dasgupta, Parthiv Patel.																								n Selectors conclave picture on Page 24

 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 26: India captain Sourav Ganguly feels that the achievement of Soma Biswas and Saraswati Saha in the Busan Asian Games is a great inspiration for all Indians. Saraswati won the 200m sprint gold while Soma clinched gold in 4x400m relay and a silver in heptathlon.																								Talking on the occasion of Khelar Samman 2002, where Sourav gave away prizes to both the gold medal winners on Saturday, he said: Its a tremendous feat, given the amount of adversities they had to go through. 																								Moreover, they are into a sport which doesnt get that much attention. So, their performance becomes doubly important, he added. 																								The captain further added he had been following the Indian athletes performance with keen interest. Its been a great year for Indian sport in general, I hope the trend will continue.																								Meanwhile, Sourav reiterated that scoring a Test century at the Eden is a dream still unfulfilled. 																								It will be great to realise that dream this time, he said. When asked about the newly-laid Eden pitch, he said: Its always been good and I expect it to behave the same way.																								He also maintained that the relaying of pitches in the ten centres across India will pay dividends in the future.

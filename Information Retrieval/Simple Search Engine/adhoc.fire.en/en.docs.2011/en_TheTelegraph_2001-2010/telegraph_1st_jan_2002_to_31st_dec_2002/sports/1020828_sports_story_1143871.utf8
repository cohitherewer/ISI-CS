Rohit won the individual gold medal on the fourth board even as Indias young chess players faltered at the final post to finish fourth in the World Youth Chess Olympiad that concluded on Tuesday.																								China A, who had assured themselves of the title on Monday itself with a round to spare, were formally crowned the best youth team after an emphatic 3-1 victory over England in the final round.

Ukraine blanked Malaysia B 4-0 in the last round to win the silver medal with 27 points.

Helped by an excellent 3.5-0.5 final round win over Iran, Indonesia won the bronze, pipping the Indians (26 points) by just half a point. 																								The silver-lining for the Indians was Rohits gold on the fourth board. He was the best performer on this board along with Natalia Zdebskaja of Ukraine scoring 6.5 points from eight games.

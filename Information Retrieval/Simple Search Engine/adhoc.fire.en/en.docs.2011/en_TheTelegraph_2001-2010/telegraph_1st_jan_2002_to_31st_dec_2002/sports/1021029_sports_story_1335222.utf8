		 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 England enjoy rare good day
				 	 Caddick: Four scalps																								Perth: Englands cricketers enjoyed the best day so far of their troubled Ashes tour when they seized control of their three-day match against Western Australia on Monday. Paceman Andy Caddick captured four wickets as Englands bowlers finally found their line and length to dismiss the home side for a modest total of 213.																								Englands batsmen then responded with a cavalier approach to their first innings, with openers Marcus Trescothick and Robert Key smashing 54 runs off the first nine overs in an unbroken stand.																								Trescothick, shrugging off concerns about his injured shoulder, made an unbeaten 21 while Key was 33 not out with England finishing the rain-shortened first day just 159 behind with two days to go and the promise of sunshine.																								Englands day began well when they were told that Australian batsman Mark Waugh, who has tormented them for the past decade, had retired from international cricket after being dropped from the first Test, starting in Brisbane next week.																								Things got better for the English, yet to win a match on tour, when Nasser Hussain won a rare toss and sent the home side in on a wicket full of life. Caddick, Englands best player so far on tour, captured four wickets, including the prize scalp of Australian Test opener Justin Langer for 13. He finished with four for 49 as the home side collapsed to 213 all out.																								Ashley Giles picked up three wickets with his left arm spin while pacemen Stephen Harmison and Simon Jones shared the other three in an encouraging display by all the bowlers. Englands batsmen were just as impressive as they racked up 54 runs in just 38 minutes. Key hit five boundaries and Trescothick two. (REUTERS)

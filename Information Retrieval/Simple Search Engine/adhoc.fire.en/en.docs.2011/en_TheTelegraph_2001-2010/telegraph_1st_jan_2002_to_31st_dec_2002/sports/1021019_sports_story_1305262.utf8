		 Saturday, October 19, 2002 				 Shoaib ruled out of final Test
				 	 Shoaib: Blow for Pak																								Sharjah: Ahead of the third and final Test against Pakistan, starting Saturday, Australian captain Steve Waugh found motivation in the recent terror attack in Bali and the support of an Australian Navy warship crew. 																								On the contrary, the loss of Shoaib Akhtar to injury dealt the hosts morale yet another blow. The injury-dogged Pakistanis, playing a home series here due to security fears in their own country, lost the Rawalpindi Express to a back injury. 																								Shoaib has a minor back problem and is flying back to Pakistan tonight,manager Brig Khwaja Mohammed Nasir said Friday. Since we have a long tour of Zimbabwe and South Africa ahead, we decided to rest him from the third Test.																								Pakistan had already lost all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, who fractured his left wrist while negotiating a delivery from Brett Lee in the second Test.																								The Test is crucial for Steve and twin brother Mark, who have been under increasing media pressure lately due to their poor form with the bat. In the two Tests so far, Mark has scores of 55, 0 and 2. Steves score reads 31, 0 and 0. (AFP)

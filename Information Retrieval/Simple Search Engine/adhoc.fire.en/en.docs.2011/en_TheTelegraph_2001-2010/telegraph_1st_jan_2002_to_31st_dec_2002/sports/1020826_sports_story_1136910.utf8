		 Monday, August 26, 2002 				 Joydeep emerges triumphant
 BY A CORRESPONDENT				 	 Joydeep: Justifying top billing																								Calcutta: Joydeep Dutta of Kumar Ashutosh Institution clinched the XV The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship Sunday at Alekhine Chess Club by drawing his last-round game against Baishaki Das of Jamshedpur. 																								Joydeep, in fact, was tied with Tanmoy Pattanayak of Mitra Institution (main) on 9 points, but won the coveted title on better progressive scores. For his efforts Joydeep will receive The Telegraph Trophy and a cash prize of Rs 10,000.																								Needing only a draw for the title, Joydeep, achieved the same but not without last minute hiccups. Playing with the white pieces against Baishaki, Joydeep, at one time was in danger of losing his game as well as the title, but then, dame luck smiled on him as Baishaki blundered and drew. 																								Last round jitters affected Tanmoy, another title aspirant, as he took the safe way out by agreeing to a quick draw in a few moves against Souvik Chakraborty of Narmada High School. 																								With the draw, Tanmoy sealed his second place and a cash prize of Rs 7000.																								Baishaki Das of R.K.M. Lady Indira Singh High School, Jamshedpur, had to be content with the third spot, on 8.5 points as she squandered an excellent game against Joydeep, only to draw after a prolonged effort by both players to squeeze out a win.																								Souvik Chakraborty of Narmada High School was declared fourth while Samput Maalick of Holy Home took the fifth spot.

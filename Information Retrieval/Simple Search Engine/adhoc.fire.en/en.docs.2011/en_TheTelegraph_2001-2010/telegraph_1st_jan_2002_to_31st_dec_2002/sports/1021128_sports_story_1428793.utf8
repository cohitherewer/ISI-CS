		 Thursday, November 28, 2002 				 Iranian sets record in clean and jerk 
																								Warsaw: Hossein Reza Zadeh of Iran set a world record by lifting 263 kilograms in the clean and jerk, helping him win the gold medal in the mens over 105-kilogram division at the World Weightlifting Championships.																								Reza Zadeh bettered the 1998 IWF clean and jerk world standard of 262.5 kilograms by half a kilogram. On Tuesday, he snatched 210 kilograms and won the gold with a total of 472.5 kilograms, equalling his own Sydney Olympics record.																								I was prepared to beat the world record, Reza Zadeh said. I lifted more than 262.5 kilograms during workouts. I wanted to beat the world record last month at the Asian Games but failed. If Allah permits, I will be the first man in the world to lift a total of 500 kilograms, Reza Zadeh said.																								The silver medal went to Bulgarias Damian Damianov, who snatched 205 kilograms and lifted 245 in the clean and jerk for a total of 450 kilograms.																								Damianov used only two attempts in each category. The competition did not call for three attempts and Reza Zadeh was beyond my reach anyway, he said. I did not make the third attempt in snatch to save forces for clean and jerk.Third went to Artiom Udakhin of Ukraine with a snatch of 200 kilograms, a clean and jerk of 240 and a total of 440. (AP)

				 	 Wang Mingjuan of China lifts 115.5 kg in the clean and jerk, setting a new world record in womens 48kg category in Warsaw Tuesday. (AFP)																								Warsaw: Chinas Wang Mingjuan set three weightlifting world records in the womens 48 kg category at the world championships.																								The 17-year-old Wang set world records with a lift of 92.5 kg in snatch, 115.5 kg in clean and jerk with a total of 207.5 kg to win gold medal Tuesday.																								Wang beat her own snatch record of 90 kg which she set at the junior world championships in Havirov (Czech Republic) in June. She beat compatriot Li Zhous clean and jerk record of 115 kg, set in June 2002 in Izmir (Turkey). In the total, Wang bettered her own record of 200 kg from Havirov.																								The silver went to Turkeys Nurcan Taylan, who lifted 87.5 kg in snatch and 105 in clean and jerk for a total of 192.5. She called for 91 kg in snatch and 112.5 in clean and jerk but failed.																								Izabela Dragneva of Bulgaria got third with a snatch of 82.5, a clean and jerk of 100 and a total of 182.5.																								I am especially pleased with the medal because I had a two-year break, Dragneva said. I can promise that this is not my last world championships.																								Taiwans Chen Han-Tung, bronze-medallist of the 2001 world championships in Antalya (Turkey) was fourth. She lifted 77.5 in the snatch but failed in all her clean and jerk attempts.																								Later in the day, Chinas Wu Meijin won the gold in a close competition in mens 56 kg by snatching 127.5 and lifting 160 in the clean and jerk to achieve a total of 287.5.																								Turkeys Halil Mutlu, world record-holder in the 56 kg weight class, was missing because of injury.																								I came to Warsaw to fight against Mutlu. He is my goal, pity he suffered an injury, Wu said. If he were here the competition would have been much more exciting. I obtained the best result I could afford under the conditions. I can only dream of 300 kg in total.																								Taiwans Yang Chin-Yi won the silver, lifting 125 in snatch, 152.5 in clean and jerk and 277.5 total. Lighter body weight allowed him to win over Romanias Adrian Jigau, who had identical results. (AP)

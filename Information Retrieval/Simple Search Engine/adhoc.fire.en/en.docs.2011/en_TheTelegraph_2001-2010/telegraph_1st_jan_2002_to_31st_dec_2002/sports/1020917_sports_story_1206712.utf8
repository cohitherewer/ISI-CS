				 																																	New Delhi: India will send just two players to participate in the individual events of the Pusan Asian Games table tennis competition though a five-member squad had been cleared. The names will be announced later. According to Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) secretary M.C. Chowhan, the decision to drop the full team was taken after the non-availability of Chetan Baboor diminished medal hopes. Baboor pulled out citing personal reasons. S. Raman was also not available following an injury sustained during the Manchester Commonwealth Games.				 																																	Tokyo: South Korean World Cup star Ahn Jung-hwan will join Japanese club Shmizu S-Pulse on a one-year transfer, the J-league team announced Monday. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. The agreement comes after the popular 26-year-old midfielder was released from Perugia. An earlier attempt to transfer him to English side Blackburn Rovers fell through last month. 				 																																	Tbilisi: Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze said on Monday he was certain his countrys Euro 2004 qualifier against Russia would go ahead without any problems despite tension between the two former Soviet states.				 																																	The match will be played in a normal, calm atmosphere, Shevardnadze told a news conference. 				 																																	Russian fears about the October 12 match were groundless, he said, as Georgia had considerable experience in staging such events.				 																																	Russian football authorities said last week they were considering calling off the match because of a row over Chechen guerillas hiding in a Georgian gorge.				 																																	Rio de Janeiro: Veteran striker Romario slapped a teammate in the face as Fluminense crashed to a 0-6 defeat away to Sao Paulo in the Brazilian championship on Sunday. The incident happened when Romario argued with Andrei after the defender had made a mistake on another miserable day for Fluminense, who sank to their second heavy defeat in four games under new coach Renato Portaluppi.				 																																	Romario, whose often brilliant career has been littered with disciplinary problems, said Andrei prevented the situation from getting any worse after the first-half incident.				 																																	I lost my cool and did that thing, said Romario.We had an argument and thats how I reacted. Fortunately, Andrei calmed things down and everything stopped there.				 																																	But Brazils 1994 World Cup hero, who was controversially left out of this years squad by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, refused to apologise. Im not one to say sorry, he said.Ive spoken to him and we are trying to sort things out.				 																																	New Delhi: India overcame China 3-2 to move into the final of the Asian mens junior volleyball championship in Teheran on Monday. India will face the winners of the semi-final between Iran and South Korea.				 																																	Berlin: Germanys caretaker Davis Cup captain Patrick Kuehnen could be offered the job on a permanent basis, German tennis federation chief Georg von Waldenfels said on Monday. Kuehnen, 36, was appointed on a caretaker basis for a World Group qualifiying round match against Venezuela later this month after Michael Stich stepped down last week.				 																																	n Cricket, Champions Trophy: West Indies vs Kenya live on SET Max from 9.30 am n Soccer: Premier League highlights from 10.30 am on ESPN n Soccer: Champions League, live from 12 midnight on ESPN

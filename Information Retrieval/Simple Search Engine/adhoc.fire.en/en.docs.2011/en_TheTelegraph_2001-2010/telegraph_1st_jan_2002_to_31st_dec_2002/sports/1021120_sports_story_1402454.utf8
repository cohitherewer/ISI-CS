 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Trainers Singh brothers  Vijay and Bharath  and Daniel David, too, are expected to be the main players in Wednesdays race-card. If Daniels Nationalistic looks good to cash in on his superior upcountry form and lift the Galstaun Cup, the Eastern Air Command Cup seems to be at the mercy of Vijays Callisto a runaway winner during the monsoon season. In other events, Bharaths Adducer and Vijays Actuate are at tidy mark to win their respective events.

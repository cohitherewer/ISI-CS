The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Day I washed out
				 	 Sourav Ganguly hangs out at Westpac Park, Hamilton Thursday. (AP/PTI)																								Hamilton: Play on the first day of the second Test between New Zealand and India was abandoned without a ball being bowled at the Westpac Park on Thursday.																								Heavy rain in the days leading up to the game meant the ground was saturated, and the mopping-up operation was scuppered when light drizzle fell at 1445 local time.																								Umpires Asoka de Silva of Sri Lanka and Daryl Harper of Australia decided to call of the days play after making an inspection of the ground in the afternoon.																								The umpires also bore in mind the impending threat of thunderstorm which did arrive soon after the game was abandoned. The thunderstorms have even cast a shadow on the scheduled start of play Friday.																								But forecasts have indicated an improvement in weather conditions over the next few days.																								There was no toss and no team announcements were made.																								An hour each would be added to the next four days play in order to compensate for the time lost and a total of 105 overs would be scheduled instead of the usual 90. The Test will also have a revised follow-on margin of 150 runs instead of the usual.																								New Zealand won the first Test of the two-match series in Wellington by 10 wickets.

				 	 Steve Waugh																								Adelaide: Australia captain Steve Waugh believes a radical new system where players can be recalled to the wicket could solve the controversy over dismissals by the video umpire.																								Waugh said on Sunday that he would prefer a return to the old days when batsmen simply accepted the word of the fielder on whether a catch had been taken or not rather than refer the matter to a third umpire.																								In the same breath, however, he added that the batsmen should have the chance to be recalled if the television replay showed the player was not out. (REUTERS)

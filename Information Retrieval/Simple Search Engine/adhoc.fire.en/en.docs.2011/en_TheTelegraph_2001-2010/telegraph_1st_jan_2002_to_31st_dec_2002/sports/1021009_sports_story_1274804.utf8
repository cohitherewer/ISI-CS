The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, October 09, 2002 				 I enjoy captaining and playing overseas more
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 SOURAV: Promises reward for performances																								Mumbai: With four meetings scheduled for the afternoon-evening, Sourav Ganguly had his hands full Tuesday, on the eve of yet another series. The Indian captain, however, did manage time for a hurried interview with The Telegraph at his Taj suite.																								The following are excerpts																								On whether, as captain, he approaches a home series differently																								Not in any appreciable way, though being at home is very different... Personally, however, I enjoy captaining and playing overseas a lot more. For instance, there arent too many people around and one actually gets some free time. Also, overseas, there are fewer demands to fulfil and the pressure is surely less.																								On the West Indies as an opposition																								As was seen during the last series, in the West Indies, they perform in a disciplined manner and Im the last person to underestimate them, certainly not after the way they bowled at home. 																								On the lessons learnt from that last series, which should come in handy this time																								Weve got to stay disciplined and, just as important, shouldnt relax. 																								On losing the last series (1-2) despite taking the lead, in Port-of-Spain																								Remains a huge disappointment, a big regret... Our balance sheet for the year would have been so much better had we won that series.																								On a purely personal disappointment  not getting a hundred in the West Indies																								Yeah, I did say it will remain a regret but, at the same time, come Wednesday and a fresh opportunity will be there.																								On starting this series as favourites																								(Interrupting) I dont give much credence to one team being favourites and the other labelled as the underdog. To talk of this series, what will count is how we perform over 15 days of Test cricket. That, not any label, will decide the outcome. Therefore, Im not paying any attention to what is being talked about. Yet, its a fact we have been playing good cricket.																								On whether, as captain, he sees a difference between the present team and the one which played in the West Indies																								Yes, of course... Veeru (Virender Sehwag) wasnt there for the Tests... Then, having proved his worth in England, we can now use Sanjay Bangar as an opener and fifth bowler. Also, at home, we will be in a position to regularly use both Anil Kumble and Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh).																								On Brian Laras absence																								Look, cricket is a team sport... Still, when a quality performer isnt around, he is missed by everybody  paying public included  not just his team.																								On his own level of confidence, after tidy scores both in the West Indies and England																								Being among the runs is always nice... Touch wood, things shouldnt change... The last Test here (against Australia) saw my form dip for some months... Hopefully, nothing of that kind will happen during this series. Talking generally, its difficult to understand why the Wankhede wicket had to be relaid... Indeed, in the past, it has always had something to offer... Would always be a fine Test wicket...																								On criticism over Parthiv Patels selection (at the expense of Ajay Ratra)																								If you ask me, purely as a wicketkeeper, theres little to choose between the two. All Ill say is that Parthiv is younger and a better batsman. Having got yet another opportunity, at such a young age, he should now make the most. At this level, its essential that performance reflects the ability. 																								On the possibility of Jawagal Srinaths request-induced comeback demoralising the younger new-ball bowlers																								Oh, no... Let it be on record that good performances wont go unrewarded  anybody who bowls well will be in contention. As for Srinath, we need his experience (64 Tests) and, in any case, lets see how he comes through in this series. 																								On captaining with such passion																								(Laughs again) My approach is driven by pride... The pride of playing for India. My teammates, too, are passionate. Moreover, what has helped is that its been easy working with them... All of us have a common goal.																								On counterpart Carl Hooper																								A fine person and a good batsman. Carl is not ordinary, otherwise, he wouldnt have lasted 100 Tests. 																								Finally, on Bobby Simpson picking India as one of the three favourites for the 2003 World Cup																								Bobbys greatly respected and anything he says carries weight... (After a pause) Really, its nice to know our recent performances are getting recognised. At the same time, weve got to remain consistent between now and next February.

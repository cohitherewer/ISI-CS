The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 National diving mark by Rashmi
																								Thrissur: The 56th national aquatic championships began here Tuesday, on a rousing note with 24-year-old Rashmi Das of CRPF setting a national record in the womens high board diving event.																								Rashmi, a CRPF sub-inspector based in Delhi, accumulated 379.25 points in the event to eclipse the previous record of 339.25 points set by Suparna Pal of Railways two years back in Calcutta.																								Suparna had to be satisfied with the silver medal, totalling 366.50 points while her teammate Mamoni Mondal secured the bronze with 359.75 points.																								I am happy and excited. I wanted to do better and was not aiming for any record, said Rashmi after setting the record.																								Rashmi, who hails from Orissa, thus avenged her defeat to Suparna in the last nationals at Calcutta where she had finished runner-up to the Railways star.																								There were no upset in the heats held in the 50m butterfly, 400m freestyle in the men and womens sections, 100m backstroke for men and 100m breaststroke for women.

																								Kingston: Former West Indies fast bowler Franklyn Rose has pleaded guilty to assaulting a female Canadian tourist outside a north coast resort town restaurant and will be sentenced next week, police said on Friday.																								Rose, who appeared in court on Thursday, played 19 Tests for the West Indies and was released on Jamaican $50,000 ($1,010) bail until his sentencing scheduled for next Thursday.																								Rose and Laurie Provencher of Bow River, Ontario, had an argument at Jimmy Buffetts Margaritaville bar and grill in Ocho Rios on Wednesday, police said. The argument spilled out into the parking lot where Rose allegedly slapped Provencher, police said.																								Police arrested Rose later in the day. Provencher was still on the Caribbean island vacationing, they said.																								Rose has not been selected for the West Indies since the tour of England in 2000. He was left off the squad for a subsequent tour of Australia after team management said it had problems with his attitude.																								Rose first played for the West Indies against India at Sabina Park in 1997. He took 53 wickets in his 19 Tests, returning seven for 84 against South Africa in 1999. (AP)

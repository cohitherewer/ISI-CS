The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, September 09, 2002 				 National Motocross Round I cancelled
 XBY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The inaugural round of the National Motocross Championship, scheduled for Secunderabad Sunday afternoon, was cancelled at the last moment. Shyam Kothari, president of Sportstrek, the organisers of the event, said that this was because the Army decided that it was not right that their ground (the Gymkhana) be used for such activity without sanction from New Delhi.																								According to information reaching here, Kothari said:  We had got the necessary permission from the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) on August 29, to prepare the track from September 2 and started working on the track and even had our qualifying session to schedule Saturday. 																								Then, late last evening, an Army official approached us at the ground and asked us for the permission from the Army. The Gymkhana ground belongs to the Army and is on lease to the SAAP. This morning a brigadier from the Army met us and told us please stop all activities as they cannot allow any event without the permission of the Defence Ministry in New Delhi.																								Since the necessary time to get such permission now is next to impossible, we have cancelled the first round of the National Motocross Championship. 																								This round of the Federation of Motor Sport Clubs of Indias (FMSCI) championship was being sponsored by MRF, and could have served as a start to truce talks between the Motorsport Association of India and the FMSCI. As of now the FMSCI holds the international licence for two-wheeler championships (from the FIM), while the MAI holds the four-wheeler licence (from FIA).																								The championship had come to the twin-city after eight years and all competitors had arrived.

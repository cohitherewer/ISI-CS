 							 - world cup selection				 	 MONGIA: Relieved 																								Chandigarh: Dinesh Mongia Monday said he was relieved at being selected for the Indian squad for the World Cup even though he was expecting the decision.																								I was hopeful, but now that it has been confirmed, I feel really elated, said the stylish left-hander who was Monday picked for the Indian 15 ahead of the more experienced V. V. S. Laxman. 																								I was expecting it, but was a little nervous, Mongia said.																								The Chandigarh player said his joy was doubled after learning that both his friends from the state  Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh were also there, as expected.																								For Yuvrajs father Yograj, the news of his sons selection was on expected lines. His selection was expected. The news has given me real joy. I am confident that the young squad will give its 100 per cent to lift the Cup, said Singh Sr who has been a cricketer himself. 																								The mood at Turbanator Harbhajans house in Jalandhar was no different, even though his selection was almost certain. He (bhajji) had called us only a short while back, but then his selection was not officially confirmed. However, I knew he will be in the team, so, no surprises. But the news of his formal selection has given the whole family a great joy on New Years Eve. I wish and pray that the team will perform well in the cup, Harbhajans sister Sandeep Kaur said.																								Harbhajans mother Avtar Kaur said she never doubts the capabilities of her son. Like every mother I am proud and happy that he has brought laurels for his country, to Punjab and to his family.  (PTI)

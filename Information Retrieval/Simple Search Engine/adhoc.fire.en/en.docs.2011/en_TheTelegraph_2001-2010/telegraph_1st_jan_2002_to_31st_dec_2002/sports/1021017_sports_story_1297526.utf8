		 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Italy conquerors back in England after 36 years
																								Southampton: Members of the North Korean side who famously knocked Italy out of the 1966 World Cup returned to an English football stadium for the first time in 36 years on Wednesday.																								Seven players and their coach are making the two-week trip, which has been approved by the North Korean government, following a British documentary entitled The Game of their Livevs.																								Pak Doo-ik, now 65, who scored the goal that toppled the mighty Italians, said: Its a nice chance to remember the past. Im really pleased to be back in England. It reminds of me when I was young in 1966.																								Being next to a football pitch now, it makes me wish I could play football here again.

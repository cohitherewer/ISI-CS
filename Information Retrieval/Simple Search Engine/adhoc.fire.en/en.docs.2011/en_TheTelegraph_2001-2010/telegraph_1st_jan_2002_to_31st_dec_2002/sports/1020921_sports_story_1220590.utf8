The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, September 21, 2002 				 Pak, Dutch play for the record
 							 - champions trophy																								Colombo: Pakistan will play the Netherlands in their last league match in the ICC Champions Trophy on Saturday in an inconsequential game at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground.																								Both teams have been knocked out of the tournament by Sri Lanka, which will clash with Australia in the semi-final on September 27.																								Pakistans coach Mudassar Nazar was sacked after the defeat to Sri Lanka in the tournament opener on September 12, but Waqar Younis was retained captain.Star batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq has been ruled out of further cricket for some time due to a heel injury, while the teams fortunes have dipped sharply in recent days. 																								The Pakistanis, who play the first of three Tests against Australia here from October 3, have been staying here with very little cricketing activity. 																								The team was also dragged into a strange controversy after the International Cricket Councils Anti-Corruption Unit called for videotapes of the Sri Lanka-Pakistan match to review a number of incidents. 																								Although there was nothing to suggest that Pakistan team was under investigation, there was speculation that the ACU was probing some match-fixing allegation.																								For inexperienced Holland, the match will be another step in their learning curve. Captain Roland Lefebvre said after the first match that his team should be given credit for restricting Sri Lanka to a total under 300.																								The teams																								Pakistan (from): Waqar Younis (captain), Saeed Anwar, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Yousuf Youhana, Younis Khan, Misb-ul Haq, Rashid Latif, Abdul Razzak, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Shoaib Akhtar, Azhar Mahmood and Mohammed Sami.																								Holland: Roland Lefebvre (captain), Daan van Bunge, Bas Zuiderent, Tim de Leede, Reinout Scholte, Luuk van Troost, Jacob-jan Esmeijer, Adeel Raja, Edgar Schiferli, Victor Grandia, Nick Statham, Henk-jan Mol and Feiko Kloppenburg. 																								Umpires: Dave Orchard and Rudi Koertzen. 3rd umpire: Daryl Harper. (PTI)

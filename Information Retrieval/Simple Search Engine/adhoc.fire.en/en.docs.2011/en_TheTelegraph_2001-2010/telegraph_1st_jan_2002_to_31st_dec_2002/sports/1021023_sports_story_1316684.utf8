 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dipendu: Joint top scorer with seven goals																								Imphal: Bengal, Manipur and Maharashtra entered the quarter finals of the LG Santosh Trophy on Tuesday, topping their respective clusters after the league round. 																								On Day VI of the competition, Bengal blanked Jammu and Kashmir 5-0 and Manipur walloped Pondicherry 9-0. Maharashtra managed to join them, shaking off Meghalaya 3-2. Pre-tournament favourites Bengal did not have to sweat much to demolish J amp;K at the Mapal Kangjeibung ground. 																								Bengals skipper for the day, Dipendu Biswas  who slammed four goals against Rajasthan in the opening match at the same venue  struck thrice against J amp;K. 																								Incidentally, Dipendu and Manipurs Bijen Singh now top the list of goalscorers with seven goals each.																								Captain Debjit Ghosh, who left for Delhi to attend the players status committee meeting, was replaced by Phalguni Datta. Surya Bikash Chakrabarty and Anupam Sarkar rounded off the tally. 																								Bengals onslaught began right from the kick-off. After missing three chances Dipendu drew first blood in the 4th minute through a superb header off Surya Bikash. 																								Stung J amp;K made desperate attempts to equalize, but Bengal forged ahead again in the 25th minute through a combination of Mehtab Hossain and Dipendu. Off a long clearance Dipendu was confronted by only one, but he dodged the challenge and coolly netted in to take Bengal into the lemon break on a 2-0 cushion.																								In the second half, a complacent-looking Bengal missed several golden opportunities. Despite some excellent keeping by Sonu Kumar, he was replaced by the J amp;K coach, Hilal Rasool after Dipendus third goal. 																								Minnows J amp;K were not given any chance to make an attempt from close range, hence they made only long shots and individual efforts were seen plenty.

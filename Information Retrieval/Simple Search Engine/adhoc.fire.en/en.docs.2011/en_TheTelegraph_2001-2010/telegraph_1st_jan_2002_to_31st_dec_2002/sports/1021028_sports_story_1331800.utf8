The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, October 28, 2002 				 Hooper looks to restore pride
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Outplayed in the first two Tests, the West Indies contingent arrived in the city Sunday evening for the final match against India starting at the Eden Gardens Wednesday.																								The visitors put up a brave front, saying they are still upbeat. Captain Carl Hooper said: Its really been a disappointing tour, but we would like to restore some pride at the Eden.																								A tired looking Hooper added they are expecting a positive result. In spite of the string of losses, we are looking forward. Maybe, this will be the point from which we start our comeback.																								Hooper scored his first Test century at the Eden during his first tour of India in 1987-88, but that doesnt make him nostalgic. No, I have no special feelings to be back here, he stated. I have heard that the wicket here has some bounce in it.																								Team manager Ricky Skerritt informed left-arm pacer Pedro Collins is nursing a back injury. He has a problem and a decision on him will be taken Monday.																								The manager declined to comment on the composition of the team.

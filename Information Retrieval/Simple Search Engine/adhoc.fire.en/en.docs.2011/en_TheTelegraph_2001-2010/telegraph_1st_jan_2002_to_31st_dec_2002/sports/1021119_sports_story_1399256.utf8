The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Wary Bagan meet Vasco today
																								Margao: The start to this years National Football League campaign may not be a very happy one for defending champions Mohun Bagan. 																								When they take on Vasco Sports Club at the Nehru Stadium Tuesday, the Calcutta giants will be missing stars like defender Yakubu Mohammed and striker Jose Ramirez Barreto both ruled out through injury.																								Striker Bhaichung Bhutia, suffering from a muscle pull, is likely to come in late in the match, and this definitely looks like a pretty desperate bid by Subrata Bhattacharya, though the coach maintains that the young team will be able to deliver the goods.																								This Mohun Bagan is different from the one that won the title last year, what with seven players having migrated to other clubs.																								All this will be to Vascos advantage. They, too have had a bad start, having lost 0-1 to another Goa club Dempo in the opener.																								The Goans will be making three changes in Tuesdays starting line-up from their last match against Dempo, bringing in Abhay Kumar, Santa Singh and Sanjay Parte in place of Nitin Pradhan, Jules Alberto Dias and Satish Minz.

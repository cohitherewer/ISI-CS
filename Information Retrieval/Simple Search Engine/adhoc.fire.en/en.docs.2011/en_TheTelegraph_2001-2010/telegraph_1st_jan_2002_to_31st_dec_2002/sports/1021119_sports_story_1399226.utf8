		 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Sri Lanka regain lead on Day IV
				 	 POLLOCK: Stranded on 99																								Centurion: Kumar Sangakkara fell 11 runs short of a century as Sri Lanka began to build a lead over South Africa on day four of the second Test at Centurion on Monday.																								When bad light and a looming thunderstorm stopped play 28 overs early, Sri Lanka were 180 for three in their second innings, a lead of 55, with Mahela Jayawardene 40 batting and Hashan Tillekeratne yet to score.																								South Africa were earlier dismissed for 448 in their first innings, with captain Shaun Pollock left stranded just a run short of his third Test century.																								Meanwhile, an incident between Jayawardene and Pollock was resolved without disciplinary action. The pair clashed on the field after Jayawardene hooked Pollock for a boundary which wiped out South Africas first innings lead of 125. 																								As Jayawardene ran down the pitch after playing his shot, Pollock grasped him by the shoulders and made a comment. Jayawardene reacted angrily and pulled himself away, pointing at the South African captain and turning to umpire Daryl Harper. 																								Two balls later, Jayawardene was nearly run out when he took what should have been an easy single. He jogged down the pitch and appeared to be exchanging more words with Pollock while keeper Mark Boucher raced to square leg, picked up the ball and threw at the stumps at the bowlers end. However, he missed with Jayawardene short of his ground. 																								Later, Match Referee Gundappa Viswanath said it had been sorted out between the umpire and the players and there would be no formal report. (Agencies)

		 Thursday, November 14, 2002  Star Chieftan may stop Immaculate 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: It looks like a toss up between Star Chieftan and Immaculate in the 1,200m Hyderabad Race Club Cup, Thursdays main event. With Amyn Merchant deciding to partner Immaculate, the Daniel David-trainee is going to be the ring favourite. But the presence of Star Chieftan  Daniels new possession from the south  who is placed only 2-1/2 kg above Immaculate, may make Merchants task difficult. The Placerville-Queen Ann four-year-old not only enjoys age advantage over the six-year-old gelding he also boasts of his decent summer and winter seasons form against top-class opposition. His drawback on the day could be his jockey, Asghar. Yet, given a free run the superior class of Star Chieftan may help him score over Immaculate.				 										1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 AIFF has till Jan. 7 to submit report
																								New Delhi: A day after slapping a one-year ban on India hosting any international tournament, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has asked the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to file the full report on a violence-marred match by early next month after it lodged a protest against the decision, reports PTI.																								The AFC has asked the AIFF to submit the report before January 7 to the executive committee and the appeal committee after the AIFF contended that the decision had been taken without having heard the full facts.																								Therefore, in true sense, till the disposal of the matter by the appeal committee, no action is contemplated against India, AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who returned here from the AFCs executive committee in Kuala Lumpur, said Friday. 																								He said the AIFF had set up a three-member inquiry committee to probe the controversial IFA Shield match between East Bengal and Palmeiras club of Brazil held in Calcutta last year and it had only recently received the Indian Football Associations observations on the match.																								The inquiry committee headed by former Chief Justice Ranganath Mishra, was yet to give its findings based on the statute of Fifa, AFC and AIFF and the rules of the competition committee.																								Since the AFCs disciplinary committee was not posted with the latest progress of this committee, they took the decision to fine AIFF with $ 5,000 and a ban on conducting international match in 2003, Das Munshi said.																								A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: The IFA says it cant be held responsible for the AFC ban on India hosting international tournaments for a year. Officials claimed the search for a foreign team in the IFA Shield to be held in January will continue, since the state body is yet to hear anything officially (though the AIFF president has clarified that the AFC order, as of now, is on hold). 																								We did everything we were told to and submitted reports in time. Why should we be responsible for what happened just because it concerns the IFA Shield final, said association joint-secretary K.D. Paul Thursday.																								The official added a governing body meeting has been called on Saturday after which the IFA will announce its role, or the lack of it, in the controversy.

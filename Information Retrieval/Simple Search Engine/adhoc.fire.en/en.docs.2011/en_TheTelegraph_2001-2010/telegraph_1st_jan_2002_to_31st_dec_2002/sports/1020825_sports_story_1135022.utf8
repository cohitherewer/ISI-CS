		 Sunday, August 25, 2002 				 Rais coach suspended
																								Bangalore, Aug. 24 (PTI): The Sports Authority of India (SAI) on Saturday suspended the coach of weightlifter Satheesha Rai, who was stripped of his three medals for failing a dope test in the Commonwealth Games in Manchester, a SAI official said. 																								SAI decided to suspend Manilal after a preliminary enquiry, the official said, but declined to give details. The official also declined to say whether any notice had been served on Manilal or further enquiries would be held.																								Following Rais disqualification, which was confirmed by the Commonwealth Games Federation on Thursday, India slipped to the fourth position behind Canada with a haul of 30 gold medals.																								 Rai was the second Indian lifter to fail the dope test after Krishnan Madasamy had tested positive for the banned nandrolone during the Games.

 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct.9: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has asked the national players for a blueprint of the association they wish to form. 																								Apparently, this was conveyed to the Big Four (Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble) by president Jagmohan Dalmiya when he met them for a second time, late Tuesday.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, the BCCI is keen that the body be representative and, towards that end, may more than suggest that the office-bearers be elected, not nominated.																								The players, one understands, may forward something to the BCCI before the second Test, in Chennai from October 17.

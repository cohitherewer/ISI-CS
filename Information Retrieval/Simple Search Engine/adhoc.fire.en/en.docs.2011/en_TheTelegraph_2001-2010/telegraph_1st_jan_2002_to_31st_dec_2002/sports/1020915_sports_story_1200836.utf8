The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, September 15, 2002 				 Pranab set to be Easts nominee
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 jjjjjjjjjjj																								Calcutta, Sept. 14: Two decades ago, Pranab Roy emulated his father and earned the first of his two Test caps.																								Come Thursday-Friday and Pranab will emulate the late Pankajda once more  this time, by becoming Easts nominee on the Boards five-member senior selection committee.																								Pranab has the blessings of Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya and, as a source of The Telegraph put it, his appointment is a formality.																								East, of course, will have a new nominee as Ashok Malhotras term gets over during the September 19-20 AGM in the city. Madanlals innings, too, ends this coming week.																								While the appointments are made annually, the selectors can (at a stretch) have a maximum of four years. 																								Incidentally, both Madanlal and Malhotra have been selectors during a most eventful phase  from removing Mohammed Azharuddin as captain (1999) to the match-fixing controversy (2000) to the latest Player Terms row.																								Though its not clear exactly who will succeed Madanlal, the frontrunner appears to be Kirti Azad, a BJP member of the Lok Sabha and one of the 1983 World Cup heroes. Another name doing the rounds is Chetan Sharmas.																								Where Malhotra and Madanlals colleagues are concerned, chairman Chandu Borde (West) can be reappointed for one year, while Sanjay Jagdale (Central) and Shivlal Yadav (South) technically have two and three years to go, respectively.																								However, whether all three will eventually continue is something the zonal bosses will decide. In any case, nothing stops the Kiran Mores from being ambitious.																								Post for Mahanta																								Meanwhile, former Assam chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta is set to be the next vice-president from East.

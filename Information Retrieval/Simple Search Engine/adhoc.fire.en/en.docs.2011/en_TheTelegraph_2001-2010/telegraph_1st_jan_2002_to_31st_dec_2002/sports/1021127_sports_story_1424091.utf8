				 	 aravinda: Lanka youngsters give as good as they get																								Durban: Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup hero Aravinda de Silva, feels his countrys new breed of cricketers have the right approach to the game with a no-nonsense attitude to players who sledge at them.																								Underlining that the game would become a bit boring without sledging, De Silva referred to the recent wrangles between some of the Sri Lankan youngsters and South African captain Shaun Pollock during the second Test.																								It is not something we really did in the past. But its become a part of cricket now and I think it probably makes the game more interesting. I think it would become a little bit boring without it.																								But there should be maturity about it and it should never get out of hand, he said.																								De Silva arrived in Johannesburg for the five one-day matches against South Africa starting on Wednesday at the Wanderers.																								We have a new bunch who play the game differently to what we used to. 																								They are not scared to give as good as they get. They are not over-aggressive but compared to the sides of the past, they are much less prepared to sit back and take it without giving something back.																								That is a good thing, as long as it is left on the field and the players can get on well with each other afterwards, he told a Johannesburg-based daily.																								De Silva, who is hopeful of playing in another World Cup, said Lanka would be a different outfit in one-dayers and was confident that Sri Lanka would win the series.  (PTI)

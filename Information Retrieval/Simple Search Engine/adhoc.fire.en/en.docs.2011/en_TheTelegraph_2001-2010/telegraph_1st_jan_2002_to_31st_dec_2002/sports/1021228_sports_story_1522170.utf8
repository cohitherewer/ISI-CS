				 	 campbell: Form problem																								London: Former captain Alistair Campbell has been left out of Zimbabwes 15-man World Cup squad, the Zimbabwe Cricket Unions website reported on Friday.																								Campbell, who led the side to the Super Six stage at the 1999 World Cup in England, has made over 5,000 runs in 187 one-day Internationals but has struggled for form this year.																								Dion Ebrahim and Mark Vermeulen are likely to open the batting, with Andy and Grant Flower, Craig Wishart and Guy Whittall occupying the other specialist batting positions.																								Heath Streak captains the side, supported in the seam bowling department by Henry Olonga, Travis Friend, Douglas Hondo and Andy Blignaut.																								Zimbabwe will play champions Australia, England, Pakistan, India, Namibia and the Netherlands on home soil in World Cup pool A.

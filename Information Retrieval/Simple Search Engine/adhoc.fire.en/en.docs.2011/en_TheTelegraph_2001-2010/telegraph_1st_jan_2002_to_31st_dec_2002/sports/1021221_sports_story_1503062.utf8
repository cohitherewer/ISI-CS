		 Saturday, December 21, 2002 				 Third spot for Surya Sekhar
				 	 surya: A share of the metal																								Panaji: Grandmaster Levon Aronian of Armenia won the World Juniors chess championship with a brilliant victory over GM Dimitry Jakovenko of Russia in the 13th and final round here Friday. 																								Indias latest GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly finished third, beating Miton Kamil of Poland. He shares the place with Russias Artyom Timofeev.																								The silver went to GM Luke McShane of England who beat GM Ferenc Berkes of Hungary in a game of fluctuating fortunes. Gangulys medal-winning performance comes after Viswanathan Anand won the gold at Baggio, Philippines in 1987.																								Aronian (10 points) was a man with a mission in the final round as he outplayed Jakovenko for his third successive victory in the last three rounds of the championship.																								Ganguly, who bagged nine points, was happy but at the same time repented the fiasco in the game against Berkes in the 11th round. The bronze medal is good, but I was playing for the championship all along. I was a little tired in the initial rounds but I picked up midway. Had I won that game, I would have led and it could have been a different story, he said.																								Aronian got an opening advantage as Jakovenko played some lacklustre chess. The Armenian went for a direct attack against king with a rook lift in the middle game and Jakovenko did not get to recover.																								Ganguly displayed top form against the Sicilian Accelerated Sveshnikov and easily digested a sacrificed pawn by Kamil in the opening. Working his way in the opposition territory, Ganguly invaded with his rook and registered a smooth victory.																								Harikrishna made amends for his penultimate round loss and scored a hard fought victory over David Smerdon of Australia with black pieces and finished joint fifth. 																								Meanwhile, WGM Zhao Xue of China won the World Juniors Girls chess championship beating Dronavalli Harika in the 13th and final round at the Cidade de Goa on Friday.																								Xue tied for first place with top seed GM Koneru Humpy (10.5) but her tie-break was better than Humpys as she had played higher average rating players .																								Humpy won the last round game over Sophie Millet of France for silver. Russias Nadezhda Kosintseva took bronze. (PTI)

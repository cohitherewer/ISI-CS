																								Colombo: Sri Lankas captain Sanath Jayasuriya may recover from a serious arm injury to lead the host team in the Champions Trophy tournament later this month, the state-run Daily News reported on Thursday.																								Team physiotherapist Alex Kountouri said Jayasuriya showed no discomfort during Wednesdays nets when he threw some balls at the Sri Lankan captain.																								He seemed to be OK, but the real test will come next Tuesday when he will be thrown into the deep end and asked to perform all his skills like batting, bowling and fielding, Kountouri was quoted as saying.																								Sanath has made good progress and I am really happy the way he has improved.  (AP)

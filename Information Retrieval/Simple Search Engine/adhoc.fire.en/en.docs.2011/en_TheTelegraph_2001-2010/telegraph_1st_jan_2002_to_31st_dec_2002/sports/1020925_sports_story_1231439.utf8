		 Wednesday, September 25, 2002 				 Romario handed one-game ban
																								Rio De Janeiro: Brazilian veteran Romario has been given a one-match ban for slapping a teammate in the face during a match.																								The 36-year-old, who lost his temper with Fluminense team mate Andrei after the central defender made a mistake during the 6-0 defeat by Sao Paulo 10 days ago, will miss a clash with Atletico Paranaense.																								The ban was imposed at a disciplinary tribunal Monday for his conduct, club officials said.																								Romario, who was left out of Brazils squad for the 2002 World Cup, joined Fluminense at the end of July from local rivals Vasco da Gama, where he had spent the previous three years.																								He has scored only one goal in his last eight games and Fluminense have dropped to 20th in the 26-team championship. (REUTERS)

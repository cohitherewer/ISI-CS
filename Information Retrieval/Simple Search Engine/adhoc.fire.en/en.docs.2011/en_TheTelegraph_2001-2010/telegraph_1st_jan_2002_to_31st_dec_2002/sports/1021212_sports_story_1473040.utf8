The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 12, 2002  Vijay, Richard share spoils 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Matching their December 4 score, trainers Vijay Singh and Richard Alford picked up a brace of winners apiece at the RCTC raceground on Wednesday. For Vijay it was a trophy double to keep his scoreboard ticking but the veteran trainer Alford pulled off a massive gamble to the discomfiture of bookrmakers when Arian justified his backing from 8s down to 2s in the betting ring. Darth Vader, a 6-1 shot in the curtain-raiser, the Cradle Of The Deep Handicap, had opened Richards days account.				 										 Vijay started off with a narrow miss following his baby colt Modestos short-head failure to Javed Khans Toe Poke in the Little Lady Plate. However, the crafty trainers Artisia landed the days feature, the Bengal Area Cup, in the hands of apprentice Malcom Maseyk before jockey Cristopher Alford atop Arrival simply cruised home with the Mas dAntibes Cup.

		 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 Lleyton Hewitt to play less next year
				 	 Hewitt: Cut down needed to prolong career																								Adelaide: World No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt says he will reduce the number of tournaments he plays next year to protect himself from burnout.																								The 21-year-old Australian said on Wednesday that he needed to cut down on his playing schedule if he wanted to prolong his career.																								Next year Ill probably try to concentrate a little bit more on Grand Slams and Davis Cup, Hewitt said. 																								I think Ill probably have a longer career because of that, if I make some smart scheduling moves within the next couple of years.																								Hewitt, the youngest man ever to finish the year ranked No. 1 in the world, recently threatened to quit the sport because of a dispute with the ATP, the governing body for mens professional tennis.																								But he said his decision to cut down on his programme had nothing to do with his row with the ATP and would ultimately help him stay involved in the sport for longer.																								Ive got to sit down and think about whats right for me, he said.																								Hewitt, preparing for this weekends Davis Cup World Group qualifier against India, said his decision could cost him his ranking but his main ambition now was to win the Australian and French Opens, the two Grand Slams that eluded him.																								He was bundled out in the first round of this years Australian Open after contracting chicken pox during the build-up to the tournament and wants to take things easier next year.																								As the biggest drawcard in Australian tennis, he is likely to face strong pressure to compete in as many lead-up events as possible but said he would have to choose carefully.																								Ive got to make tough decisions to find out whats the best situation for me going into the Australian Open in Melbourne, he said. (REUTERS)

																								Mumbai: Describing Indias just concluded series versus England as the best overseas tour in the last six years, skipper Sourav Ganguly was confident of his teams success in the ICC Champions Trophy in Colombo.																								We have been winning one-day series and I cant think why we cannot do well in the Champions Trophy, Sourav said after the team arrived here in the early hours Wednesday.																								We will worry about it when we reach Colombo. As of now, the players need rest.																								We have been travelling for the last 24 hours and I would not like to say anything more about the Champions Trophy now.																								Reviewing the performance in England, the skipper said: We played pretty well on this tour. We won the NatWest triangular series handsomely and then came back well, after losing the first Test, to square the series. I think this was the best performance by us outside India in the last six years.																								Ramprasad manager 																								The Karnataka State Cricket Association president K.M. Ramprasad has been appointed as manager of the Indian team in the Champions Trophy. 																								The BCCI executive secretary Sharad Diwadkar said that Ramprasad, who is also the BCCI vice-president, would join the 14-member team tonight.																								India leave for Colombo from Mumbai via Chennai and play their first match against zimbabwe on Saturday. (PTI)

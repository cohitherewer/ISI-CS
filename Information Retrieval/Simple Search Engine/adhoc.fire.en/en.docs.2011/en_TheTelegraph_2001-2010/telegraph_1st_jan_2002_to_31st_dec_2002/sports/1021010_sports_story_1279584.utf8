The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 A third eye on dressing rooms
 							 - ICC Anti-Corruption Unit brings even colts under umbrella of education FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Mumbai, Oct. 9: An off-the-field first was authored at the Wankhede Wednesday, Day I of the opening Test versus the West Indies, when electronic monitoring of access to the players dressing rooms came into operation in India.																								This access-control in security parlance, has come about at the ICC Anti-Corruption Units (ACU) initiative and will henceforth be a feature at all ICC-approved matches. Here, for instance, three CCTV cameras have been installed and Mumbai Police-vetted technicians, among others, are constantly viewing movements on a jumbo monitor.																								[Incidentally, in an unrelated exercise, the local police have put in place hidden cameras, at different points, for effective crowd control.]																								Its a start, following up what was in operation during the Champions Trophy. Of course, we arent invading the players privacy. Idea is just to keep track of who enters and leaves what is a very exclusive area, Niranjan Singh Virk, the ICCs Security Manager for India and Sri Lanka, told The Telegraph.																								Virk, chief investigator during the CBI probe into the Indian players involvement in match-fixing, added that such measures are going hand-in-hand with the process of educating the players. Apparently, Virk took the lead in informally interacting with quite a few Indian players during the Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka.																								As part of the educating exercise, the ICC has prepared a four-page pamphlet, titled Bounce Corruption Out of Cricket, which has even been pasted outside the dressing rooms at the Wankhede. Besides, Virk has advised the Mumbai Cricket Association to have it nailed/pasted around the stadium.																								Interestingly, the four-pager has been printed in English and Hindi. One assumes a Sinhalese version must have done the rounds during the Champions Trophy.																								Apart from a series of sections  The Temptation, The Trap, The Noose Tightens, The Damage and What Happens Next  the pamphlet has quotes from icons Steve Waugh and Sachin Tendulkar as also South African captain Shaun Pollock. The latters quote, by the way, has been printed above a Hansie Cronje picture.																								The players have responded most positively, obviously realising that extra precautions wont do any harm, Virk remarked, adding that while arrangements in the official hotel (Taj) have definitely been co-ordinated, it wouldnt be proper to go into details.																								Significantly, Virk informed the ACU isnt only focussing on the national players. Ive interacted with a couple of state teams and, in the future, will also be meeting members of the U-19 and U-17 sides... Basically, they should know how to respond to certain situations and, equally, be aware of the dangers of interacting with unscrupulous people...																								Well, Virk is certainly passionate about his job.																								TOP GUNS ON MATCH-FIXING																								Steve Waugh: I think its great, in a way, that it (match-fixing) has come out and been exposed because, otherwise, it would have been like cancer eating away at the game.																								Sachin Tendulkar: Its a very simple thing: Concentrate on cricket and the rest will follow. Dont choose the wrong avenues.																								Shaun Pollock: There were some really great cricketers and to see their careers tarnished by whats taken place is very sad.

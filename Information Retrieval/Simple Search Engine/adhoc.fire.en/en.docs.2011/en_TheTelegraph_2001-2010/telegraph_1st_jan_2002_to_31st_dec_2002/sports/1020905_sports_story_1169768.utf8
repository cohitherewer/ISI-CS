		 Thursday, September 05, 2002 				 A new experience for Hingis
																								New York: Martina Hingis normally arrives at a Grand Slam expecting to leave with another trophy. This year, however, the former world No. 1 was unsure if she would walk away from the US Open with even a single match win. 																								But this has not been a normal year for the imperious Swiss, who limped into the seasons final Grand Slam on a surgically repaired ankle and made a quiet fourth-round exit on Tuesday, falling 4-6, 2-6 to sixth seed Monica Seles  a player she had beaten 15 times in 19 career meetings.																								Its different going into a tournament where you just look forward to every single match, said the 1997 US Open champion. Youre not used to going into tournaments like that. I thought maybe I had a chance of making it at least to the quarter finals, then play Venus (Williams), if we both got there. 																								I definitely wasnt as far along as I thought I would be coming into these tournaments. I felt pretty good starting to play but obviously it will take time to recover 100 per cent physically. Thats the biggest problem at this point.

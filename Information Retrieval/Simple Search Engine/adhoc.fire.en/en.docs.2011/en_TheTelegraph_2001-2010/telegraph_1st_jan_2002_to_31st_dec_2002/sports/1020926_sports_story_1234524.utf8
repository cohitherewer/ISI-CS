 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The Bengal under-19 womens soccer team left for Diphu, Assam Wednesday, to play in the second national under-19 championship with the hope of at least reaching the semi-finals. 																								The Bengal girls, who lost to ultimate champions Orissa in the semi-finals last year, are likely to again come up against the same state in the first of their quarter final league ties (they start from this stage) Sunday. Orissa are expected to emerge winners in Group D. 																								Bengal are likely to take on Bihar (winners of Group C) October 1, before meeting last years runners-up Manipur October 3.																								Midfielder Nausaba Alam will lead the team which comprises 20 players. Coach Anita Sarkar said though it was a brief 18-day camp that she could take the players through. 																								And despite the fact that six-seven players from last years squad are not there (being over-aged), I expect to give a good account of ourselves. Of course, the first match will be a tight one, and we need to settle down quickly to be able to give off our best and make the semis at least.																								The final is slated for Octo-ber 8.																								THE SQUAD																								Goalkeepers: Krishna Das, Piyali Sapui, Jhuma Das. Defenders: Trehana Khatun, Barna Roy, Purnima Majhi, Leena Das, Pratima Mondal, Seema Saha. Midfielders: Nausaba Alam, Soma Mukherjee, Tumpa Mondal, Maya Biswas. Forwards: Paramita Sit, Ashia Khatun, Chumki Panja, Gitali Naha, Srabanti Chatterjee. 																								Coach: Anita Sarkar. Asst. Coach: Minati Roy. Manager: Kajal Rakshit.

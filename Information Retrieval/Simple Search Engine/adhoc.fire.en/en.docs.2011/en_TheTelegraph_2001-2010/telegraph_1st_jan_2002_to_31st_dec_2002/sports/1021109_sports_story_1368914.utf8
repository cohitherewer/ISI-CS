				 	 BECKHAM																								London: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson says he cannot understand how his star player David Beckham copes with a life led in the constant glare of the media.																								The fame associated with being England captain and the husband of former Spice Girl Victoria Adams has put intense pressure on Beckham, culminating in the recent plot to kidnap his wife and children.																								Ferguson is wary over the amount of time Beckham has to spend in the public limelight, although he insists he has no worries over the midfielders commitment to United.																								He has a lifestyle he enjoys and I do not know how he does it, Ferguson said in the Sun on Friday. I dont know how he can live that life because of the attention he gets all the time.																								Television has projected football players into a superstar status which is not really justified.																								And Ferguson said Beckham had encouraged the attention. 																								David enjoys it. He realises he has a star status and a lot of it is by his own design, Ferguson said. He has cultivated it himself. He likes to dress in a certain way, changes his hairstyle and is not aware how that is portrayed by a lot of people. I say that to him time and again.																								One thing I am content about is that when David is here he is a footballer, trains well and always tries.																								He is blessed with great stamina, always tries and you have to admire that. He is also down to earth and has terrific manners.																								Four Romanians and a Kosovo Albanian suspected of plotting to kidnap Victoria and possibly the Beckhams two sons were remanded in custody on Monday as the investigation into the alleged abduction continued.																								The four are charged with theft but were to undergo further questioning. They are due to appear in court again next Monday. (AFP)

																								Chennai: Four Indians  Siddarth Suchde, Saurav Ghosal, Gaurav Nandrajog and Sahil Vora  comprising the first string national squash team, have made it to the second round of the 12th world junior squash (boys) championship which got underway here Tuesday. 																								This is the first time in the history of Indian squash that players have progressed to the second round in the world junior. India, who have been participating in the event since 1992, have fielded 11 players, including a seven-member second string team for the current championship. 																								Supreet Singh, who was just pipped to the first string team by Vora and Yashvardhan Singh, also won their first round ties. Supreet of Mumbai displayed great fighting qualities to overcome Ali Alramezi of Kuwait. 																								Ghosal and Yashvardhan got walkovers from their Kuwaiti rivals, the latter not being able to turn up due to late arrival of their flights. 																								Suchde, who is the top seeded Indian, Nandrajog and Vora did not face much opposition in their three-game wins. 																								The Supreet-Ali Alramezi match saw the Indian win the first game 9-5. Alramezi rallied to claim the next two (9-7 and 9-5) after trailing 0-4 in both. Supreet had to wriggle out of tight situations before eventually tilting the balance in his favour. (PTI)

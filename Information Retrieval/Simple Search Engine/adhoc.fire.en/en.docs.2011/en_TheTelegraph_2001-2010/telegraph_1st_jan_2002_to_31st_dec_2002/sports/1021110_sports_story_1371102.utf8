																								Los Angeles, Nov. 9 (Reuters): Venus Williams tamed fellow-American Monica Seles 7-5, 6-4 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the WTA Championship and keep the $3 million year-end extravaganza on course for another all-Williams final.																								Venus and sister Serena have clashed to decide three of the years four Grand Slams, the latter getting the better of her big sister each time to lift the Wimbledon, French and US Open titles.																								Venus will now take on Kim Clijsters for a place in Mondays final, the Belgian advancing with a 6-2, 6-1 win over compatriot Justine Henin earlier in the day.																								The victory was Venus ninth in 10 meetings with Seles, three of those coming this year. Seles, who saved seven match points in a first-round comeback win over Lindsay Davenport, took the initiative in both sets by securing the early break.																								But each time, Venus, behind her thunderous serve and 11 aces, answered back.

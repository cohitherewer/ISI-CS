				 																																	Kabul: Former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali arrived in Afghanistan on Sunday on a visit to highlight reconstruction in the devastated country in his role as a United Nations peace ambassador.				 																																	Ali flew into Kabuls international airport before embarking on a brief programme which is to include a meeting with president Hamid Karzai.				 																																	UN spokesman Manoele Almeida da Silva said Ali, a long-time humanitarian campaigner, would visit a girls school and a womens bakery during the three-day trip to highlight the countrys needs. Ali, who held the world heavyweight title between 1964 and 1967 and again in 1974, once enjoyed enormous popularity in Afghanistan, particularly following his conversion to Islam at the height of his fame.				 																																	Sydney: Discarded Test batsman Mark Waugh escaped with a warning after pleading guilty to a charge of dissent in an Australian inter-state match on Sunday, his first offence of that nature in 18 years of first-class cricket.				 																																	Mark, who was once fined by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) for accepting money from an illegal Indian bookmaker, escaped a more serious penalty after the umpire who reported him, Darrell Hair, spoke in his defence.				 																																	Hair placed Mark on report after the 37-year-old player was given out caught behind for a duck while batting for New South Wales against South Australia. Mark unhappy at the decision, stood his ground with his hand on his hip then exchanged words with Hair as he left the field.				 																																	London: Lazio defender Jaap Stam is keen to return to the English Premier League with a move to Manchester City, British newspapers reported on Sunday.				 																																	The Dutch international, who joined Italian club Lazio from Manchester United for 16 million ($25.27 million) 14 months ago, was quoted as saying he was interested in joining City. I know there is interest in me in Italy from Inter, AC Milan and Juventus, he said. But the biggest interest is in England, particularly Manchester City, and that is a move that would really appeal to me.				 																																	Sydney: Petria Thomas, Australias best female swimmer, has shelved plans to retire from the sport, saying she wants to continue through to the 2004 Athens Olympics.				 																																	Thomas had hinted she would hang up her goggles after winning five gold medals at this years Commonwealth Games in Manchester.				 																																	But the triple world champion said she was feeling refreshed after a short break and is now determined to go on to Greece in the hope of winning the one major title that has eluded her.

				 	 Abhinav Bindra prior to his departure for Busan in New Delhi Monday. (AFP)																								New Delhi: The Indian shooters and weightlifters, who returned with a rich haul of gold from the Manchester Commonwealth Games, feel they have to perform several notches better at the Busan Asian Games to win a medal of any hue.																								We need to score higher than what we did in Manchester, said ace marksman Abhinav Bindra Monday. He added the shooters have to excel in both individual and team events to win laurels for the country.																								We are quite capable of winning medals as we have prepared hard. But the competition would be tough and we have to do a lot better than what happened in Manchester, said Bindra.																								Officials felt China, South Korea and Japan will dominate the shooting events. It would be very difficult for our team to win medals. The success of the team would largely depend on Jaspal Rana, Bindra and Anjali Bhagwat, said a member of the team.																								The weightlifters, who struck it rich in Manchester just like the shooters, think repeating that performance will very difficult. If fate favours us, we can win a few medals, said Kunjurani Devi.																								Kunjurani added that though the lifters have prepared hard, it would be a completely different test for them at Busan. The veteran said women lifters will face tough challenge from China and Thailand, who are likely to dominate the arena in South Korea.																								The shooters formed the first batch of athletes leaving for Busan. The mens and womens hockey teams, the judo contingent and weightlifters will leaving along with Deputy Chef De Mission C.P. Singh Deo Tuesday.																								The billiards, snooker, squash, table tennis, boxing, wrestling and golf teams will board the flight on Friday with the body building and kabaddi squads leaving on Sunday.

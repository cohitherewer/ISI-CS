The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, December 17, 2002  Crafty trainers took centrestage 
 BY STAR RACER Richard Javed The poor fields in last  Wednesdays race-card, once again, produced exciting results,  thanks largely to some solid gambles pulled off by the  crafty trainers like Vijay Singh, Javed Khan and Richard  Alford. 				 										It was Vijay who showed the way with a quick entry of Artisia, in the 1,600m Bengal Area Cup, after her narrow defeat, a week earlier, against class IV rivals. 				 										A substantial reduction in weight against a mixed opposition topped by class III, helped the filly produce a transformed performance as she led from the start to present apprentice Malcom Maseyk with a decisive victory. This, despite the fact that Artisia had gone wide at the final turn thus drifting out of a straight course. The four-year-old was a tempting wagering at 5-2.				 										Only half-an-hour earlier, the trainer had missed out what would have been a fine brace of wins by a two-year-old baby horse Modesto. Carrying a winners penalty of 3-1/2 kg, the Metal Precieux-Mea Culpa colt fought out a brave battle against a heavily wagered Toe Poke, from Javed Khans yard, to lose by the shortest of margins. Mark Reuben partnering the Sizzling Melody-Cute Babe youngster adopted the best strategy, that was to establish a comfortable lead within the first two furlongs of the race and hang on to it.				 										Richards was the gamble of the season in the Kalied Handicap. Backed from 8s down to 2s Arian re-produced his last winters morning track form that had made headlines on a couple of occasions. Nevertheless, the Forest Fair-Delicate Doll three-year-old was kept behind Greenlander by jockey Tamang until top of the straight before the horse shot in to a comfortable lead that came handy in the dying stages when challenged by Gul, another Javed-trainee.				 										Making his debut on the local track, Vijays Arrival in the Mas dAntibes Cup was equally impressive in his victory and the Cobra King-Chloes Delight three-year-old may strike again.				 										Earlier on December 4, Network downed a mighty Nationalist in the 2,000 Guineas. One only wished the Bangalore 2,000 Guineas was run before the Calcutta version of it was held. It is because Network, in the Bangalore Summer Million had handed a decisive three parts of a length beating to Name And Fame, albeit at 5-kg weight advantage. With Bangalore Guineas verdict, last Sunday, going in favour of Name And Fame, not only the class of the Vijay Singh-trained three-year-old by Twist And Turn out of Net Net Net was established, the horse also indicated that he was still maintaining his bright form.				 										Vijays other ward, Calorescence, too, lifted the Bangalore Turf Club Cup with authority. It was, however, the running of the third placed Way To The Star that left raised eyebrows because of a half-hearted handling of the horse by jockey Kishore Kumar.

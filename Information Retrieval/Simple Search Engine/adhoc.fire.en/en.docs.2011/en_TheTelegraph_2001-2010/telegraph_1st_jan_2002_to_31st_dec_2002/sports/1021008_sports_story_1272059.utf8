The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, October 08, 2002 				 CCI honour for skipper Sourav
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sourav Ganguly at practice in Mumbai Monday																								Mumbai: A year ago, Raj Singh Dungarpur was screaming for Sourav Gangulys head. Yet, Monday afternoon, the Cricket Club of India (CCI)  an institution headed by him  awarded the Indian captain honorary life membership.																								Vice-captain Rahul Dravid and coach John Wright were also honoured similarly, at a classy function graced by a clutch of former captains: Polly Umrigar, G.S. Ramchand, Nari Contractor, Chandu Borde, Ajit Wadekar and Bobby Simpson.																								A communication gap over the timing meant that Sourav arrived over an hour after the scheduled noon start, but the fact he rushed from the Taj  in a taxi, at that  the moment he got the reminder prevented his being featured in an unnecessary controversy.																								The invitation didnt specify the time and, so, I assumed it would be after our late afternoon workout, Sourav told The Telegraph.																								Earlier, while receiving the membership (No. 0500136), the captain promised to avail of the CCIs excellent facilities whenever he is in Mumbai.																								Sourav also recalled that his first appearance in any tournament here, as a teenager, was as a member of the CCI team.																								For his part, Raj Singh acknowledged he had been very critical of Sourav, but added somewhat affectionately: He has improved beyond recognition. Not only is he now an outstanding batsman, but an outstanding captain too...																								Wright, for whom the CCI has become a second home, picked the occasion as being one of the most special moments, while an emotional Dravid spoke of being made to feel proud and blessed.																								Incidentally, Wright received his membership from Simpson  somebody he regards as his guru.																								Raj Singh (a former Board president) took the initiative, in getting the three leading lights honoured, after Indias commendable showing in England. While India won the triangular NatWest Series, the Tests ended 1-1.

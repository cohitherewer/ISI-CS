		 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 Hayden cleared for third Test
				 	 HAYDEN: Underwent two minor operations																								Perth: Australia opener Matthew Hayden has been cleared to play in the third Ashes Test against England starting on Friday despite undergoing surgery for haemorrhoids.																								The in-form left-hander was ordered to remain in Adelaide while the rest of team flew to Perth to prepare for the Test.																								Australian physiotherapist Errol Alcott told reporters Hayden had been told to stay behind for another day because he was still in some discomfort but would arrive on Wednesday ready to train and play.																								Its uncomfortable but its not disabling. Its not in our minds that he is not going to play here, Alcott said.																								Alcott said Hayden had undergone two minor operations to alleviate the problem and could need mild pain killers to take the field on Friday.																								Hayden, currently ranked as the worlds best batsman, was Man of the Match in the first Test after making 197 and 103, becoming just the fourth Australian to score twin centuries in an Ashes match.																								The 31-year-old Queenslander made 46 in the first innings in Adelaide for a series average of 115 but did not field and was not required to bat again as Australia wrapped up victory by an innings and 51 runs inside four days.																								Australia lead the five-match series 2-0 and only need to draw one of the remaining three games to retain the Ashes.																								Meanwhile, Australias least experienced cricketer Darren Lehmann said Australia clearly held a psychological edge over England.																								Were obviously right on top of them, the way they batted in that second innings in Adelaide, he said. (Reuters)

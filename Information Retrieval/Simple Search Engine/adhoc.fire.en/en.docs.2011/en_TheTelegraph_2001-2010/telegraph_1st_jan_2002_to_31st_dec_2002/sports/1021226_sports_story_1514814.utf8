																								Colombo: Sri Lankas cricket administration have rejected a demand for higher salaries from the national team ahead of the World Cup, officials said here on Wednesday.																								Players sought higher wages to compensate for possible losses due to limits on product endorsements during the World Cup in line with the International Cricket Council (ICC) regulations, officials said.																								ICC restrictions will prevent players from advertising products that conflict with those of the official tournament sponsors, even if they have existing deals. National players argue that they stand to lose sizeable income as a result of the ICC stipulation and should therefore be compensated for such losses.																								A similar demand was made before the Champions Trophy in September, and the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) had agreed to an 18 per cent increase, the state run Daily News said.																								The paper said the players were not in a good position to negotiate because of their recent dismal performance in cricket.  (PTI)

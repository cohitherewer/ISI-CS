Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								EAST BENGAL 0 CHURCHILL 0																								Calcutta: Churchill Brothers halted East Bengals winning run in the Oil PSU National Football League at Salt Lake Stadium Thursday. The barren tie kept the city team on top of the table nonetheless as it took their tally to 13 points after five games. Churchill moved to four after five.																								East Bengals performance was similar to what had been in earlier matches  bright in patches and listless otherwise  but unlike those days, the goal eluded them. They did come genuinely close on a couple of occasions, but the question mark over their prowess in the attacking third remains, as does the doubt over their ability to increase men in the rival zones sensitive area.																								Churchill, runners-up last season and struggling this time, looked as if they would be pleased to snatch a point and their approach wasnt any different. They appeared all too aware of the fact that caution is the name of the game in vital away matches such as these, and defended with almost everything for a better part of the match.																								East Bengal started well with Alvito DCunha failing to shoot in time in the third minute after being set up by Gilmar de Silva Goncalves, but the flair seen in the opening minutes faded as the match progressed.																								Mike Okoro missed the chance of the day and S. Venkatesh failed to pack enough power in his header from close, but considering the kind of ball possession East Bengal enjoyed, just two proper openings in 90 minutes was a little too few.																								With Churchill getting most men behind the ball every time East Bengal crossed the half-line, frustration crept into the red-and-gold camp and Douglas de Silva earned a yellow card which rules him out of Sundays key match against Salgaocar. Even skipper Anit Ghosh, who left the turf with a knee injury in the 25th minute, looks doubtful for that game.																								The match lit up for a while just before half-time when Gilmer got the ball near the centre circle inside his own half. The Brazilian released Okoro down the right with an exquisite left-footer which curled in just enough to help the Nigerian meet the ball in a perfect position and all he had to was to run in unchallenged for about ten steps and beat the keeper. Instead, he hit the ball into an advancing Edward Ansah.																								Gilmer was at it again when he sent in a measured cross from the left in the 77th minute, which found Venkatesh inside the six-yard box, but the India internationals feeble attempt was parried by the keeper and even the rebound wasnt dealt with properly. Gilmer had earlier released Douglas inside the box, but the Brazilians compatriot pounded a wild right-footer wide of the mark.																								Gilmer was very much the man who looked capable of making things happen, but he might not be the answer in East Bengals search for a striker. With a classy left-footer and pleasant ability to distribute, Gilmer looks as if he is better used from a little deep so that he can create chances for others.																								With Churchill rarely showing the urge to put East Bengal under pressure, the home defenders had a rather cool day and in doing so, maintained the teams remarkable record of not conceding a goal in five games. East Bengal, in fact, is the only outfit in the 12-team league to have maintained a clean slate so far.

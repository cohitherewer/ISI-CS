Dasgupta, Shukla, Lahiri and Panda work for Metro Railway and it is unlikely they will be released for Deodhar. Zaman, who works for North East Frontier Railway, may get the nod .																								According to sources, Ranadeb Bose, Sanjay Raul, Zakaria Zuffri and Rashmi Ranjan Parida have already been chosen as stand-byes.																								Requests with the Metro Railway authorities have fallen on deaf ears. CAB joint secretary. East Zone convener Bablu Koley was livid. Railways is a constituent of the BCCI and it is unfair on them to draw up a fixture that clashes with Deodhar Trophy. In this way, the leading players will be deprived of participating in one of the premier tournaments of the country, Koley said.

		 Monday, November 25, 2002 				 Meet records poor entry
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT																								Ludhiana: The main competition of the 44th winter national bridge championship started with only 128 teams at the Sutlej Club on Sunday. 																								The organisers were expecting a record entry this year and the current figure was, therefore, a huge letdown. Punjab chief minister Capt. Amrinder Singh inaugurated the meet the previous day. Sunday morning saw the beginning of Ruia Trophy, where the teams were divided into two groups of 64 each. 																								Top positions (after Round V) 																								Section A: Sunil Machhar IV (104 VP), Asggar Paints (102 VP), Nagbagan (Bengal) (99 VP), Indian Railways B (96 VP), Arijit Guhas IV (94 VP). Section B: C. V. Raos IV (106 VP), Alok Dagas IV (104 VP), Jeroo Mangos IV (96 VP), Aswini Mehtas IV (95 VP), Arcelor Mumbai (93 VP).

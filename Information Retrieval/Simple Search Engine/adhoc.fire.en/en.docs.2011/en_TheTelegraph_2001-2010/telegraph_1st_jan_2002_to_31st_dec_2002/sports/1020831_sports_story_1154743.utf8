		 Saturday, August 31, 2002 				 Scottish offer for Dravid
				 	 Dravid																								New Delhi: Scotland are looking to rope in Indian vice-captain Rahul Dravid in 2003 summer when they play in the Norwich Union one-day league tournament in England. Scotland have been admitted into the English League for a three-year period on a trial basis, and they are hoping the inclusion of Dravid could boost their performance on debut. 																								We had preliminary discussion and Rahul gave some very encouraging signs, Gwynne Jones, the chief executive of Scottish Cricket Limited, was quoted as saying on BBC online. 																								Scotland originally approached Sachin Tendulkar, who turned down the proposal, before contacting Dravid during the third Test at Headingley. 																								Blackwell for Flintoff																								England called up Somerset allrounder Ian Blackwell Friday to their ICC Champions Trophy squad as replacement for injured Andrew Flintoff. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, September 10, 2002  Wednesday meet put off 
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 										Calcutta: The stewards, Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) have decided to cancel the race-meeting scheduled for Wednesday. according to an RCTC notification. The race-fixture has fallen through owing to paucity of acceptors.				 										The cancellation hardly came as a surprise in view of the dwindling horse-strength at the Hastings stables. The present horse count is little over 200.				 										The RCTC official circles, nevertheless, tried in earnest to see the fixture through. We even modified events to encourage trainers to come forward with acceptors but nobody except RCTC appeared to be interested in saving the meeting, said Rajan Mehrotra, general manager racing. 				 										Horseowners insist on having more number of meetings. But in recent years, the second fixture in a week effects entries in the subsequent meeting. You have to have at least 300 horses to conduct a monsoon season. We are well short of that strength, said another RCTC official. The next city race meeting is on September 18.				 										Mondays track trials				 										Outer sand track				 										800m: Accrete (Shanker) in 57s; (400m) 29s. Moved well.				 										Sand track				 										800m: Tsavo (Engineer) in 1-2; (400m) 30s. Don Vittorio (Shanker) and Dancing Rhythm (G. Singh) in 55s; (400m) 27s. They were level and both were easy. 600m Mahikas Pet (Tamang) in 41s; (400m) 26s. Fit.

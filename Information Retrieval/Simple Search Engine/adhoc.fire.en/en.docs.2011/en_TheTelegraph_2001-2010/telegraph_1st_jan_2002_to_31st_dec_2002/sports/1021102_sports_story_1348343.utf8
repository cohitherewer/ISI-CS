		 Saturday, November 02, 2002  Rutherford pays penalty for heavy whipping of Satin 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Apprentice Rutherford Alford belted Royal Satin to a narrow victory over The Archer in the Delhi Race Club Cup on Friday. In the bargain, it being his third excessive whipping offence, the jockey was stood down for two race meetings. A repetition of offence may see not only the apprentice but his retainer also being suspended for rest of the season. His family sources said: Its better Rutherford rides for his father in Dubai rather than being haunted by a season long suspension coming his way.RESULTS				 										1.

		 Monday, September 23, 2002 				 Tiger secures sixth title of year
																								Thomastown (Ireland): Tiger Woods held off a superb closing round of 10-under-par 62 from South Africas Retief Goosen to win the WGC-American Express Championship by a shot on Sunday despite bogeying the last.																								The world No. 1 who began the day five strokes clear of the field, carded a last-day 66 to secure his sixth title of the year. 																								Woods, who dropped his only shot of the tournament at the 72nd hole when he missed a putt for par from 10 feet, also collected five birdies and an eagle-three at the 562-yard 10th to finish at 25-under 263.																								It was the 30th time in 33 tournaments he had triumphed after leading  or being tied for the lead  going into the final day and it was his sixth victory in a World Golf Championship (WGC) event. But he was run close by world No. 5 Goosen, who eagled the par-five 17th to close to within a stroke of the lead before parring the last to equal the course record set earlier in the day by Sergio Garcia.

		 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 Kaluwitharana, Zoysa recalled
																								Colombo: Sri Lanka have recalled wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana and fast bowler Nuwan Zoysa for the tri-series to be played in Australia.																								The duo was named in the squad Tuesday for what is going to be Sri Lankas final chance to check ammunitions before the World Cup. Kaluwitharanas recall came as a surprise. The 33-year-olds international career appeared all but over, as he was not selected in the 30-strong list of World Cup probables.																								He and left-armer Zoysa were left out of the one-day series in South Africa  where the World Cup is going to be played in February-March  after sub-par performances in England earlier in the year.																								Meanwhile, Sri Lankan board officials said veteran Aravinda de Silva will miss the first three games. For personal reasons he has been excused, chief selector Guy de Alwis said. De Silva will be replaced by Thilan Samaraweera.

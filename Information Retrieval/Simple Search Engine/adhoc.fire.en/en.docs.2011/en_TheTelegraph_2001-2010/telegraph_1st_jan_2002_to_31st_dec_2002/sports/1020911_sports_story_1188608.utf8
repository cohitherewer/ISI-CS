																								Gough London: England gambled on Graham Thorpe and Darren Gough, picking them in the Ashes squad on Tuesday.																								They will set off for Australia in October for the five-Test tour as part of a 16-man squad which will include six pacemen including allrounder Andrew Flintoff.																								Left-handed batsman Thorpe, badly affected by the acrimonious break-up of his marriage, took a total break from cricket at the end of July. He has not played since and has also retired from the one-day Internationals.																								Head of selectors David Graveney told a news conference: We looked at the risk before selecting him. Hes had a difficult time but we think he will respond with commitment.																								Strike bowler Gough has not played a Test for more than a year following a recurrent knee injury. Gough will have to prove his fitness before the tour. 																								Alex Tudor  who will go to Australia with an academy squad for developing players  as well as Dominic Cork and Craig White, who all featured in the English summer, missed out.

																								Hyderabad: With his senior counterparts hogging the limelight with their heroics against the West Indies, a milestone by a 17-year-old cricket prodigy went largely unnoticed.																								Ambati Tirupati Rayudu became the youngest Indian to score a double century in the Ranji Trophy when he scored a brilliant 210 in Hyderabads first innings against Andhra in a match here last week.																								Rayudu, also the hero of the India under-19s recent tour of England, struck 26 fours and four sixes in his 232-ball knock.																								And he did not stop at that. He carried his form into the second innings scoring an unbeaten 159  another record of sorts.																								Former Test stalwart Gundappa Viswanath and Mumbais Amol Muzumdar had scored double tons in the Ranji Trophy, but both were in the early 20s then.																								 However, the achievement means little for the class XI student as his target is to make it to the national grade.																								As of now, Rayudu is happy playing good cricket which he says is the aim of his life. (PTI)

		 Sunday, September 01, 2002 				 Injury-hit England may pick bigger squad 
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Trescothick: Return being toyed with																								London, Aug.31: Troubled by injuries and still not fully sure about the fitness of some cricketers, the England selectors may announce a bigger squad for next weeks series-decider at The Oval, from Thursday. Usually, 12/13 players are named.																								Given the doubts and misgivings, David Graveney and Co. could pick as many as 15... It will be unusual but, given the circumstances, probably quite the right thing, is how a source put it, during a chat with The Telegraph this evening.																								Incidentally, though Dominic Cork didnt play for Derbyshire against India because of a hairline fracture to one of his fingers, he has made himself available for selection.																								Englands top worry, of course, is getting a suitable replacement for Andrew Flintoff. Ronnie Irani is being talked about, but he is just coming off a two-week lay-off, necessitated by arthroscopy on his right knee. So, if he is chosen, his selection could be conditional.																								Then, theres some debate over whether to recall top gun Marcus Trescothick. Its significant, perhaps, that he is playing todays C amp;H Trophy final, after being on the sidelines for as many as six weeks owing to an injury while fielding.																								While some feel Trescothicks presence alone will straightaway lift Englands morale, which took a severe beating at Headingley, others are of the opinion he shouldnt be shortlisted without a couple of first class games for his County (Somerset).																								Eventually, Trescothicks class may tilt scales in favour of an immediate recall.																								Meanwhile, with The Oval (Surreys home ground) known to favour spinners  Saqlain Mushtaq, for one, has again been having a ball  the selectors could call up off-spinner Richard Dawson to give Nasser Hussain the option of playing a second spinner besides Ashley Giles.																								Dawson, who turns out for Yorkshire, toured India last winter.

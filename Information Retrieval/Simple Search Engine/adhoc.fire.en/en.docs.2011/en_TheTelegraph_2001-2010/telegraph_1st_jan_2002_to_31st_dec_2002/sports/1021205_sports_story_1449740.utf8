The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 05, 2002  Vijay, Richard share limelight 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Expected to return soon, and for a longer stint, to Dubai where he has two winners to his credit, trainer Richard Alford is making the best of two world. At the RCTC races on Wednesday, the crafty saddler notched up a brilliant double to the pleasure of his faithful owners who had stood beside the veteran trainer in his rough and smooth days. Richards Lawyers Love was given a judicious ride by apprentice Malcom Maseyk to win the Astounding Handicap, while Imran Chisty on Buffalo Park bravely fought a hard battle to upstage Flamebird and Actable in the Our Owen Handicap.				 										Richard was not alone to rule the afternoon that was matched, in terms of his days score by trainer Vijay Singh. The champion schoolers baby Andropov claimed the star event, the Goodfellas Cup, by five long lengths, despite running green in the final stages of the race. Vijays other winner was Assailer who triumphed over his better-fancied stable-mate Amicable.

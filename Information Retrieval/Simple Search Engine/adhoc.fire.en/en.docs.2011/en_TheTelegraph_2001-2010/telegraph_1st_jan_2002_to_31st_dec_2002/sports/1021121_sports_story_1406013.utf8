		 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Injury-ravaged England face formidable task
				 	 England captain Nasser Hussain on the eve of the second Ashes Test in Adelaide Wednesday. (AFP)																								Adelaide: Australia may have given up hope of ever being allowed to keep the Ashes trophy but their players remain determined to win yet another series.																								The second Ashes Test, starting in Adelaide Thursday, is shaping up as possibly one of the biggest mismatches in the long history of crickets greatest rivalry.																								While the Australians are still riding high on the crest of a wave that swept them to a 384-run victory in the series-opener in Brisbane, England are in dissaray after a horrific run of injuries and poor form.																								If losing fast bowlers Darren Gough and Simon Jones before the completion of the first Test was not bad enough, the events of the past few days have only added to the crisis.																								Allrounder Andrew Flintoff was ruled out of the second Test with a recurring groin problem, batsman John Crawley is almost certain to be out with a hip injury he sustained in the match with Australia A and spinner Ashley Giles broke his wrist practising his batting Tuesday.																								Even without the injuries, Englands chances of winning were considered slim. They have not won a single match on tour so far and collapsed to 79 all out in the second innings of the first Test  their worst Test total Down Under in almost 100 years.																								Despite the mounting problems stacked again his side, England coach Duncan Fletcher has maintained a philosophical approach.																								Thats probably why they call it Test cricket, you have to be tested, he said Wednesday.																								You just keep going at it, thats one of the strengths of this side. Weve taken a few knocks and the guys just keep coming back, which is important. You can see from the way guys warm up and practise that theres good morale still within the side.																								Captain Nasser Hussain did his bit to lift spirits, urging his injury-hit team to remain positive.																								The crickets not been great here, its as simple as that, Hussain said. There have been a lot of injuries and we havent done the basics right but we have to turn things around pretty soon starting with this week in Adelaide.																								One thing you will get from the England team is that they are honest and we know were playing a very good Australian side, but its about time we put things right and that will not come from getting down or depressed.																								Aussies upbeat																								The mood in the home camp could not be any different. 																								The Adelaide Oval wicket is a favourite of the Australian players because it is perfect for batting for the first three days, then turns on the final two, assisting leg-spinner Shane Warne.																								Not surprisingly, Australian captain Steve Waugh said his team was brimming with confidence going into the match.																								I think weve played pretty good cricket recently. For us its all about maintaining our standards and playing the style of cricket we want to play, Waugh said.																								We want to play aggressively and positively and put the opposition under pressure and hopefully disorientate them sometimes by the way we play the game, at the pace we play.																								As the only survivor from the last Ashes series Australia lost 16 years ago, Waugh also reminded his players about the dangers of complacency or underestimating England after his teams huge victory in the first test.																								Its only one game, I think people are getting a bit carried away, there are four Test matches to go, said Waugh.																								A lot can happen, a lot can change. And thats why sport is such a good thing because people can turn things around.																								Theyve got the ability to do that, theyve got good players, theyve got passion in playing for that country, so theres no reason England cant turn it around. Weve got to be wary that they can do that. At the same time we want to make sure we play good cricket, enjoy ourselves and express ourselves on the field.																								Gillespie given time																								Australia have delayed naming the XI to allow Jason Gillespie as long as possible to prove his fitness. Waugh said he still expected Gillespie to play but the selectors wanted to make sure he was 100 per cent.																								They are being a bit more cautious but my gut feeling is that hell play, Waugh said.																								Gillespie has been troubled in the past month by a calf strain that continues to bother him. The lanky paceman was sent home from Australias recent Test series against Pakistan after straining his calf muscle and he aggravated the problem in the first Ashes Test.																								If Gillespie is chosen, Andy Bichel and Brett Lee will be left to fight out the last fast bowlers spot. Bichel, who was preferred in the first Test, took two wickets in the first innings and did not bowl in the second.																								Lee was dropped for the first time in his career but has taken 21 wickets in two first-class matches since to push his claims for an immediate recall.																								England paying price																								England have paid the price for gambling on unfit players, Waugh said Wednesday.																								Waugh said Englands selection policy of choosing unfit players to tour was in contrast to Australias approach of only playing fit players .																								They picked some guys who werent fit, so in some way theyve made their own bed, Waugh said on the eve of the second Ashes Test at Adelaide Oval.																								Its unfortunate that a guy (Giles) breaks his wrist at training, thats one of those things, but if you pick guys who arent fit at the start of the tour then you are taking a gamble.																								Players have to be very close to 100 per cent fit otherwise they dont play, guys have been pulled out of matches with minor niggles to make sure they are right long-term, Waugh said.																								There has been a change in policy, where in the past it was up to the player whether he wanted to play, but now Errol has a lot more say in whats going on.																								Errol knows everyone pretty well, hes been around the side for 18 years, he knows what you can do and what your limits are, so generally its a more commonsense approach.																								Englands chairman of selectors David Graveney has defended the teams medical staff amid uproar over the tourists injury crisis.																								Graveney has also been the target of the critics for selecting Gough and Flintoff when both were struggling to be fit for the tour.																								Graveney denied it was poor selection policy and blamed it on bad luck. We selected our squad on the medical advice given, he said.																								I think theres been some unnecessary criticism levelled at our medical teams, as its not an exact science. We have had a fair crop of injuries and players withdrawing for various reasons over the past couple of years.																								Maybe thats a reflection of the number of matches we have asked them to play.

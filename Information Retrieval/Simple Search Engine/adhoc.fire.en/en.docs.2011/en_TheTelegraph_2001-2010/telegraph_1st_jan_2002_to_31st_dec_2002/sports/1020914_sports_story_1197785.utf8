																								New Delhi: Vishal Uppal will replace Mahesh Bhupathi as the fifth member of the Indian Davis Cup team for next weekends tie against Australia. Bhupathi pulled out of the World Group play-off citing a shoulder injury.																								Uppal was included after consultation with non-playing captain Ramesh Krishnan and senior member Leander Paes, All India Tennis Association secretary Anil Khanna said in a statement here Friday.																								Krishnan wanted Bhupathi to travel to the venue (Adelaide) and make a final decision there. But the doubles expert said he needed some rest to prepare for the Pusan Asian Games.																								Paes, Rohan Bopanna, Sunil Kumar Sipaeya and Harsh Mankad are the other members of the squad that takes the mighty Australia from September 20 to 22.																								Bhupathi said he was confident that youngsters Bopanna and Sunil would do well in Davis Cup. Both are very good players. They have the potential to get into the top 200 next year, he said.																								About his former partner Leander Paes poor form since the two split in March, Bhupathi said: It is only a dip in form, everyone goes through these ups and downs. He (Paes) is a good player, and will definitely come back. (PTI)

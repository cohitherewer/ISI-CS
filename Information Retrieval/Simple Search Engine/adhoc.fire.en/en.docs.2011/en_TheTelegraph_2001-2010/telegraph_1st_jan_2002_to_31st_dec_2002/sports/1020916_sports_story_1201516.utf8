		 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Montgomery to skip Madrid meet
																								Raleigh (North Carolina): Newly crowned 100 m world record holder Tim Montgomery will not compete in next weekends IAAF World Cup in Madrid as originally scheduled, his coach said Saturday.																								Hes not going to run in Madrid, said Graham via telephone from Paris after Montgomery broke fellow American Maurice Greenes world record of 9.79 seconds with a 9.78-second clocking in the IAAF Grand Prix final. After running 9.78 you need at least two weeks off. So hes shutting it down.																								Earlier, Greene, citing fatigue, also said he would not compete in the Madrid event organised by the IAAF. 																								But triple Olympic champion Marion Jones, who is coached by Graham and trains with Montgomery, will defend her 100m title in the World Cup event scheduled for Friday and Saturday. 																								Montgomery might never have broken the world record had he not fractured his arm while playing American football at high school.																								The 27-year-old decided at that point track and field was the right path for him and given his slightly-built frame he evidently made the right choice to resume his childhood dream of becoming the fastest man in the world.																								On Saturday he exploded off the blocks in an astonishing reaction time which was just thousandths of a second inside the legal limit.																								The soft-spoken American, a stark contrast to the fast-talking Greene, admitted afterwards that he had been motivated by seeing his girlfriend Marion Jones  who also gave up a promising career in another sport, basketball  win her race earlier. I thought: Marions done her bit now Im going to go one better, he said.																								While the duo have yet to walk up the aisle together they looked a perfect couple as they stood on the podium to receive their trophies for winning the Grand Prix overall titles and Jones admitted they shared many similarities. 																								Tim is so dedicated and likes to stay up for hours after a meeting going through a race, analysing it because like me he is a total technician, she said. 																								That is typical of Montgomery, father of a three-year-old child, as apart from his racing he likes to take time over things as befits his favourite hobby, fishing, where patience is very much a virtue.																								 It has been my dream since I was a child. Since I started running in 1994 I always thought I could bring myself down to 9.79 but 9.78 Wow!																								My original vest number was 89 but I scribbled out the 8 and replaced it with a 7 as that was the record (9.79), he said.																								However, Hicham el Guerrouj, the man who was deprived of the 100,000 Grand Prix series prize  and on his birthday  justifiably wanted to know when their paths crossed at the press conferences as to how had he spoiled his birthday in such fashion. 																								I think I should be allowed the first question! El Guerrouj joked. How come the wind was perfect and your reaction time perfect to ruin my birthday?																								Montgomery just smiled in the knowledge that it was just a perfect day for Tiny Tim. (AGENCIES)

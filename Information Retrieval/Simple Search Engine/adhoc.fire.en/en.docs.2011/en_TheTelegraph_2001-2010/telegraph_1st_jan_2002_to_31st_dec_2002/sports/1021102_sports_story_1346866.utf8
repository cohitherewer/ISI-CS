		 Saturday, November 02, 2002 				 Yadavs 6 wkts put Rlys on top 
																								New Delhi: Allrounder J.P. Yadav took six for 39 after scoring 104 to give Railways a 50-run lead on Day IV of their Irani Trophy match against Rest of India on Friday. Off-spinner Kulamani Parida then polished off the tail as Rest ended on 292.																								With a 50-run first innings lead after making 316, Railways now require 243 runs for an outright victory with one full day in hand.																								Though overnight batsman Wasim Jaffer scored a defiant century before being caught by Amit Pagnis for 116 off pacer Harvinder Singh, the middle order simply caved in before a disciplined Railways attack.

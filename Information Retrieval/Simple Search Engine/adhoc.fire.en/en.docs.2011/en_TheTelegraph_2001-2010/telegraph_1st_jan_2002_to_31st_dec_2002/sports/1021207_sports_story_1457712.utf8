 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Ashok Kumar stayed on course for his maiden professional title Friday when he shot a two-under 68 in the second round of the inaugural Rs 10-lakh Tata Steel Open being played over the Beldih and Golmuri Club courses in Jamshedpur.																								Ashok, who is attached to the DLF Golf and Country Club in Delhi, shot a two-under 68 at the par-70 Golmuri Club to open up a three-stroke lead over the second placed Zai Kipgen (Delhi) and Mukesh Kumar, according to information received here. 																								Jamshedpurs brightest amateur, Amit Khaitan was among the four tied for fourth place at one-under 141. The others were Indrajit Bhalotia, Rahil Gangjee (both Calcutta) and Amritinder Singh of Chandigarh.																								The mid-way cut was applied at 10-over 152 and 51 pros made it to the money-making rounds.																								Ashok Kumar was a picture of consistency for the second day running. As the rest of the field struggled with the small greens, the 21-year-old resorted to intelligent tactics. I didnt get carried away by the fact that the Golmuri is a small course. I didnt use driver in most of the holes and all I wanted to do was keep myself short of the green as chipping up to the hole is much more easier on both the courses, said Ashok after the round.

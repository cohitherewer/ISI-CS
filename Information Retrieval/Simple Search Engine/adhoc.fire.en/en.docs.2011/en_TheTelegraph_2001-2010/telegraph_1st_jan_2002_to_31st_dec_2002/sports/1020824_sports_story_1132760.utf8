		 Saturday, August 24, 2002 				 Sampras serves a warning 
				 	 SAMPRAS: Believes he still has what it takes																								New York, Aug. 23 (Reuters): The mens tennis circus decamps at Flushing Meadows for the final Grand Slam of the year next week, and a host of big names will slug it out for the most open major in years. 																								Pete Sampras preparation for the Open, a title he has won four times and where he has been runner-up for the last two years, has hardly been encouraging, but he still believes he has what it takes to add to his record 13 Grand Slam titles.																								You have to remember who I am and where Im playing next week, he said. The US Open is where you shine, and that is where I hope to shine. My goal is to win another major and, hopefully, destiny will be on my side.																								Defending champion Lleyton Hewitt heads the field but with eight different winners in the last nine Grand Slam events, there is no clear favourite in New York.																								Hewitts form since winning Wimbledon last month has been patchy with a first round defeat in Toronto, a finals appearance in Cincinnati and a third round loss in Indianapolis.																								The Australian is eager to open his defence, however. 																								I think its obviously going to be a bit of a buzz for me, going back to a place that has changed my life in a lot of ways, he said. I really look forward to getting back there. The US Open holds a very special place for me, being the first place I really performed well in a Grand Slam.																								The player who ousted Hewitt from Indianapolis and went on to win the title, Greg Rusedski, certainly will not be underestimating the dynamic baseliner.																								I think its so hard to do what hes accomplished, said the Briton. Hes the youngest player to be number one, hes won two major championships already, hes got a game where he has to work from the first ball to the last. He beats you with one extra step and one extra shot.  copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

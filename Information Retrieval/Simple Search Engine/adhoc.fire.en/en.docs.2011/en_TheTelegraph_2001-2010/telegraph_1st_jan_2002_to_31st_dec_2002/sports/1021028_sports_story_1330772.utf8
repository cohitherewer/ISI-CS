 BY PATRICK BARCLAY 				 	 owen: Biggest impact on a World Cup																								Every now and again a boy wonder comes along and hits you straight between the eyes, as if to state: Im here to stay. The first sight of Diego Maradona is something I shall never forget: at a sun-drenched Hampden Park in 1979, some 60,000 Scots took to jeering their teams every touch of the ball, so anxious were they that it should spend as much time as possible in the enthralling company of the young Argentine. Mind you, I can also remember, sharp and clear as the November night on which I saw it, the first senior appearance of Phil Hawker.																								Unlike Maradona or Wayne Rooney, Hawker was a defender. But in 1980, when still a few weeks short of his 18th birthday, he made such an elegant job of subduing Martin ONeill of Nottingham Forest that Jim Smith, Birminghams manager at the time, was moved to describe his left-backs debut as the best I have ever seen at any level. Emboldened by this high-quality endorsement of my own suspicion, I wrote an article hailing Hawker as a prospective English answer to Franz Beckenbauer. To the credit of my colleagues, they never mentioned it again as Hawker, having played just 33 more League matches for Birmingham, moved down a couple of divisions to find his level at Walsall.																								By and large, though, true class is easily identifiable in the raw state. Jimmy Greaves was a scintillating 17-year-old for Chelsea; George Best the same age when Manchester United fans realised they had something special on their glowing hands (ditto Ryan Giggs) and Michael Owen, at 18, made the most dramatic impact on a World Cup of any teenager since Pele in 1958. Rooney comes with all the basic equipment  when you have pace, power, play with your head up and can stroke goals past Arsenal from 20 yards, you are entitled to believe you have a chance  but no guarantee.																								To me, he looks a bit chubby: a point I was able to put to one of footballs most impressive slimmers last week. The only thing that would worry me, said Ron Atkinson, is the amount of publicity hes getting. Yes, hes a stocky lad, but this low centre of gravity can be helpful and Rooney does remind me of Kenny Dalglish. The way he tried to chip David Seaman, for instance  I thought that was even better than his goal.																								Atkinsons predecessor as Manchester United manager, the venerable Dave Sexton, listed the traps in store for Rooney and, while some of them sounded more like prizes  girls, drink, money, fame, choice of friends  the truth is that Englands latest fantasy is by no means certain to survive, despite the nurture Evertons intelligent manager, David Moyes, is sworn to provide. Its a personal thing, said Sexton. They either come through or they dont. David Beckham has  in spades. Michael Owen too.																								The most tragic underachievement was not that of Best, or Paul Gascoigne, or even Doncasters Alick Jeffrey, who at 17 had played for England at every level below senior but suffered fractures of his right leg, then left leg and, in a car crash, his skull. It concerned Duncan Edwards, who perished in the Munich air crash. A cornerstone of United at 16 and England at 18, he died at 21, already a giant, with apparently limitless capacity: having made himself two-footed, Edwards had represented his country at centre-half, centre-forward and in a variety of midfield roles.																								Edwards, while big, was all muscle at Rooneys age. Not that Rooneys shape bothered Sexton unduly. Maradona was stocky, he pointed out, and so was Ferenc Puskas. I remember, before the Hungarians won 6-3 at Wembley, theyd been loosening up outside and Jimmy Andrews, a West Ham player at the time, came in laughing and said One of thems a little fat bloke  its going to be a walkover for England.																								Times change, of course, and so it seems with the required standard of dedication. That is a matter for Rooney, his family and his club. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

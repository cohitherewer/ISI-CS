The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, October 17, 2002 				 Border sneers at Pak, Pybus
				 	 Border: In mockery mood																								Sydney: Former Australia captain Allan Border said on Wednesday that Pakistan would struggle to beat most Sydney club sides and their coach Richard Pybus should keep his mouth shut.																								Pakistan were all out for 59 and 53 in last weeks second Test against Australia in Sharjah, losing the match by an innings and 198 runs to fall 0-2 down in the three-match series.																								Border, a current national selector, reacted strongly to comments made by Pybus and reported in The Australian on Tuesday, that Australia were battling internal tension over the pressure on Steve and Mark Waugh to hold their places in the team at age 37.																								Richard should just concentrate on what hes supposed to be doing with the Pakistani team, Border was quoted as saying in the Daily Telegraph Wednesday.																								Lets see if they can score 60 next time they bat. Most second grade sides could do better than his national side. If I was him, Id be keeping my mouth shut. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, August 31, 2002 				 Ratra likely to replace Parthiv
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Derby: Young Parthiv Patel is much more mobile now than he was earlier this week, after being struck on the right knee by a Ajit Agarkar delivery (last day of the Headingley Test), but even complete recovery before next Thursdays Test at The Oval may not guarantee him a place in the XI.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, Patels rather tardy keeping at Headingley hasnt been well received by the team management. Moreover, Ajay Ratras fine unbeaten 101 against Derbyshire hasnt done his cause any harm. It shouldnt, then, surprise if Ratra reclaims his place in the final Test.																								Of course, its Ratra who began the Test series as No.1 keeper and the big gloves were his at Lords (first Test). On the eve of the second Test (Trent Bridge), however, Ratra received two blows at nets and could barely walk on the morning of the match. So, ten minutes before the toss, 17-year-old Patel was told he would have to step in.																								Patel, as it turned out, became the youngest keeper ever and the guts he showed on that last afternoon at Trent Bridge  remaining not out on 19 (82 minutes, 60 deliveries)  earned much acclaim all over. Patel, though, wasnt sharp enough at Headingley.																								With The Oval being the decider, we need to play the best keeper... Somebody who has already taken some pressure... It wouldnt, then, be odd if Ratra got back the job, is how a well-placed source put it Friday morning.																								Twenty-year-old Ratra, it may be recalled, replaced Deep Dasgupta after the first Test in the West Indies and emerged the youngest keeper to hit a Test hundred during the fourth match, in Antigua. Ratra got an unbeaten 115.																								With good reasons, the team management isnt thinking of effecting any other change. The selection worries are all Englands.																								Srinaths visit 																								Meanwhile, Jawagal Srinath, who is turning out for Leicestershire, dropped in at the Derbyshire CCC ground Friday afternoon. However, if some expected a one-to-one with captain Sourav Ganguly, where the latter would probably again have asked Srinath to make himself available for Tests, that didnt come about.																								Sourav, in fact, wasnt at the ground  having taken manager Ranga Reddys permission, the captain left for Harrow (on a private visit) pretty early in the day.

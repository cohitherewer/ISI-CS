The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 26, 2002 				 Shiv Sundar asked to stay back 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 SHIV SUNDAR DAS																								Calcutta: Shiv Sundar Das, scheduled to leave New Zealand for India on Thursday along with three others, has been asked to stay back for the one-day series.																								The decision was taken in the wake of the series of injuries that has struck the Indian camp just before the start of the ODIs, informed BCCI secretary S.K. Nair on Wednesday.																								The first match of the series will be played in Auckland on Thursday.																								It had been decided earlier that Das would return to India after the two-Test series along with Tinu Yohannan, Murali Kartik and Ajay Ratra.																								Sachin Tendulkar, Harb hajan Singh, Sanjay Bangar a nd Mohammed Kaif are the players injured and BCCI presi dent Jagmohan Dalmiya added that all are expected to recover before the second match to be played in Napier on Sunday.																								Nair added that Rakesh Patels departure for New Zealand has been delayed due to sudden changes in the travel plans and the Baroda allrounder would be leaving only Wednesday night.																								This virtually rules out Patels chances of playing in the first match and compounds Indias problems on the eve of their final ODI series before the World Cup.

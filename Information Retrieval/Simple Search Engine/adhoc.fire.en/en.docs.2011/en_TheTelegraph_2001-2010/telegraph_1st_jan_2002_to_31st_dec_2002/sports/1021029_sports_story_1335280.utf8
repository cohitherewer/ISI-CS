		 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 Kerala athletes cry foul
																								Thiruvananthapuram: Top athletes from Kerala, who won medals in the Busan Asian Games, on Monday alleged that certain Amateur Athletic Federation of India officials from north India were biased against sportspersons from the state.																								Medal winners, including K.M. Beenamol, Bobby Aloysius and Anju Bobby George, said at the Press Club here that Indian athletes were not receiving sufficient training to face their counterparts from other countries.																								Yes, it is true that we are getting adequate training in Indian conditions. But when it comes to international standards, we are far behind, Beenamol said.																								High jump silver-medallist Aloysius said, The attitude of certain officials from north India hampered the prospects of sportspersons from the state.																								Take the case of Manjima, supposed to be in 4x400 relay. She was dropped at the last minute to accommodate another person from Bengal. Aloysius has failed to qualify at the last moment on many occasions. (PTI)

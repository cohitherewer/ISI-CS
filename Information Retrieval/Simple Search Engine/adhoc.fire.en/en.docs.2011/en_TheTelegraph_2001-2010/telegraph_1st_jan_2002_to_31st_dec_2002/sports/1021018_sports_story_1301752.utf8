		 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 Sunita not yet stripped of medals: IOA
				 	 Bahadur Singh and Shakti Singh after their arrival in New Delhi Wednesday 																								New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association on Thursday contested reports about drug-tainted runner Sunita Rani being stripped of her medals and claimed that results of the B-sample were still awaited.																								The Chef-de-Mission of the Indian contingent in Busan, Jagdish Tytler, said that there was no question of Sunita being stripped of her medals since the result of her B sample was still awaited. 																								The person who was quoted in the reports was some lab official and he has no authority to speak to the media. The result of B sample is yet to come, he said at a function, organised to felicitate the medal winners of the Asian Games.																								Sunita, who won a gold medal in the 1500m with a new Asian Games record timing and a bronze medal in 5000m, had tested positive for the banned substance nandrolone. However, the IOA said that it had not received any communication from the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) yet on the issue.																								If the B-sample also tests positive, Sunita will not only stripped of her two medals but may also be suspended for a two- year period. 																								Sports minister Vikram Verma, who was also present at the felicitation function, seemed to be on the defensive. We have to collect information, finalise a report and then decide on the course of action, he said.																								The function itself turned out to be an ill-timed one with Sunita, conspicuously absent, being the topic of discussion despite the Indian contingent putting up one of its best performance in Asian Games in recent times, capturing 11 gold, 12 silver and 13 bronze medals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 29, 2002 				 Mukesh ahead, Mundy a close second
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: There is no stopping Mukesh Kumar. The Mhow-based player continued his brilliant run of form on the Hero Honda Indian Golf Tour when he shot a bogey-free six-under 66 on the second day of the Rs 9.5-lakh Surya Nepal Masters at the par-72 Gokarna Forest Golf Resort course in Kathmandu on Thursday.																								According to information received here, Mukesh, eyeing his seventh title in last eight appearances this season, was the sole leader at the halfway stage, aggregating 11-under 133. However, Mukesh will have his task cut out as the 1997 champion Uttam Singh Mundy was snapping at his heels at nine-under 135. Mundy, who is yet to win a title this year, shot a five-under 67. 																								Firoz Ali and his brother, Rafiq, continued to stay together, tied for third place at six-under 138.																								Deepak Acharya, tied for the ninth place, was the best-placed Nepali pro at one-under 143. Deepak Thapa Magar was in 18th place at two-over 146, along with Tashi Ghale, the leader in amateur section. 																								In all, 50 pros made the cut and will be joined by four amateurs on the final two days. The cut was applied at 16-over 160. Nine Nepali pros made it to the money-making rounds.																								The days action was delayed by 90 minutes because of fog. But this hardly disturbed Mukesh concentration. Starting from the first tee, he birdied the par-5 third and the fourth. Like yesterday, he birdied the seventh, eighth and ninth and made the turn at five-under. On the back nine, Mukesh missed a six-footer birdie putt on the 12th and his solitary birdie came on the 15th hole.																								I have been playing extremely well and have set my sights on winning at least ten titles on the Tour this season, said Mukesh. 																								Mundy made just one bogey as against one eagle and four birdies in his round of five-under 67. Starting from the 10th tee, the city pro made a birdie on the 11th and an eagle on the 12th. His only bogey came from the right rough on the 14th hole, where he missed his up-and-down. 																								It will be difficult displacing Mukesh considering the way he has been playing. But I have not been playing too badly either and am going to fight it out till the last shot, said the Eveready-sponsored Mundy after the round.

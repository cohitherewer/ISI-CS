The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 29, 2002  Refresher may lift Hoysala Cup 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore: Of the eight 40 and above rated runners vying for the 1,600m Hoysala Cup, on Friday, the one who is sure to carry the public purse is the recent Pune winner Sky Raider. But his sluggish trial movement make his credentials suspect. Therefore, taking their morning trials as a yardstick, the two most likely to be involved at the finish are Arrakis and Refresher. 				 										Both have met on more that one occasion during the Bangalore summer and the one who always finished ahead was the B. K. Arshad-ward Refresher. Consequently, the Be Fresh-Satinetta gelding, to be partnered by A. Imran Khan gets the nod to strike it rich.				 										SELECTIONS				 										1.30 pm: Poem 1. Francophone 2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, October 24, 2002 				 Veron determined to overcome Cup woes
																								Buenos Aires: Argentina midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron wants to continue playing for his country in spite of his World Cup disappointments and hopes to be picked for next months friendly in Japan.																								Football always gives you a chance to make amends, the Manchester United player said in an interview with an Argentine radio station on Tuesday. Im hoping for it, Im working for it and I hope it can happen soon.																								I still want to play for Argentina because my World Cup was not what I had expected.																								But Veron said he had not had any contact with the Argentine national team since their shock first round elimination at the World Cup in South Korea and Japan. I havent spoken to anyone, said Veron, whose own World Cup performances also fell way below expectations. Nobody has called me either, to be honest I dont know anything about a possible call-up.																								An Argentine Football Association spokesman said the squad for the November 20 match would probably be named early next month.																								The AFA has surprisingly renewed the contract of coach Marcelo Bielsa, saying they preferred to judge his work over the previous four years rather than on the three matches at the World Cup. Veron, who had Achilles tendon in the weeks leading up to the World Cup, said he was not fully fit for the tournament.																								I regret having played even though I was not in ideal condition, he said. At these moments, one becomes a little selfish and I wanted to be there because of my desire to play, my desire to play for my country and for myself.  (REUTERS)

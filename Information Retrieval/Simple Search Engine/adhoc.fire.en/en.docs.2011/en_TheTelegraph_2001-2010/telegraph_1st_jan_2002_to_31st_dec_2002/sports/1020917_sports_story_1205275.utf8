		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Greene vows to recapture the world 
																								 Yokohama: World and Olympic champion Maurice Greene has vowed to regain the world 100 metres record next season.																								American Tim Montgomery set a world best of 9.78 seconds in the Grand Prix final in Paris on Saturday, eclipsing Greenes three-year-old mark by 0.01 seconds.																								The time Ive got in my head is 9.76. My coach thinks I can run 9.6-something. Well have to see, Greene said after finishing fifth in the 100 metres at the Yokohama Super Track and Field meeting on Monday. 																								I knew when I broke the record it wouldnt last forever, but it belongs to me. It will come home.																								Greene arrived in Japan from Paris late on Sunday after pulling out of the Grand Prix final. The American complained of jet-lag after clocking a pedestrian time of 10.56 in drizzly conditions.																								Bernard Williams, who finished third behind Greene at the world championships in Edmonton last year, crossed the line first in 10.21 with Nobuharu Asahara of Japan runner-up in 10.28.																								Im tired. I just got here last night and I didnt sleep. My body feels asleep still. But I just wanted to finish the season healthy and I did that, said Greene. The objective now is to be ready to defend my world championship title next year.																								Williams, meanwhile, admitted he was just glad to have finished ahead of Greene after an indifferent season himself.																								I just wanted to get Maurice and grab some attention. I wish I could have run better up to now but it means Im more hungry for next year, said Williams, who arrived on the same flight as Greene from Paris  and flew economy class. It took me getting my butt kicked (this season) to know I have to get serious.																								Greene, though, was up-beat after a difficult year in which he failed to reproduce the dominant form that saw him win Olympic gold in 2000 and gold at the world championships.																								Just because the world record has gone doesnt mean anything. I was going to have to pick it up next season because of the world championships, he said. The world record is something I want back. I know theyre not just going to give it to me but I know what Im capable of doing, so Ill get it back. (REUTERS)

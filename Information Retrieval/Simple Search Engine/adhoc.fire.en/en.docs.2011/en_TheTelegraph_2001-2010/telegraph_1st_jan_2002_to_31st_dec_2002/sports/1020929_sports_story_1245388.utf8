 							 - Super Division l Draw leaves Bagan out BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mohun Bagans George Ekeh fights for the ball with Mohammedan Sportings Habeeb Adekunle at the Salt Lake Stadium Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Calcutta, Sept. 28: Mohammedan Sporting completed the comeback trail by ensuring a place at the CFL Super League play-off final as they held defending champions Mohun Bagan to a goalless draw at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 																								With the draw, Mohammedan Sporting ended on 28 points, two short of leaders East Bengal. Mohun Bagan had to be content with 26. It was a gutsy defensive display by the Mohammedan Sporting team as their opponents pressed right from the beginning. Though, the ground was unsuitable for good soccer following the afternoon shower, Bagan took a firm grip on the match. The wily Bausdeb Mondal and Jose Ramirez Barreto initiated the attacks and often stretched the game to the wings. But a goal remained elusive. 																								The black-white defenders Reaj-ul-Mustafa and Hussain Mustafi fought with their backs to the wall and held the Bagan attackers at bay. Their custodian Prasanta Dora also was brilliant under bar. 																								Mohun Bagan can rue having been denied a penalty when Barreto was pulled back by a Mohammedan Sporting defender inside the box.																								In the 74th minute, after Bagan left-back Lolendra Singh gifted a ball to Rahim Nabi, the right-half cut in and took a lob which struck the cross-piece and went out. Mohammedan Sporting were denied again when Arjan Alis shot off an Amjad Ansari pass struck the cross-piece.																								Mohun Bagans best chance came in the eighth minute when Lolendra set up a ball from the left, but an unmarked Barreto headed out from close distance.

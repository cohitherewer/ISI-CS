The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, August 25, 2002 				 You win more games in the dressing room than in the middle: Duncan Fletcher
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Leeds, Aug. 24: The other day, somebody described Duncan Fletcher as the Ivan Lendl of cricket. Well, yes, the England coach just doesnt smile. But, this former Zimbabwe captain sure knows his job.																								Fletcher generally avoids one-to-ones with the Media, but did make an exception for The Telegraph on the eve of the on-going Headingley Test. Incidentally, a request for the interview was made as far back as the Lords Test.																								Following are excerpts																								On having taken over (in the latter half of 1999) at a time Englands stock was so low																								There were many considerations and I had to weigh a lot of things but, basically, it was a challenge... In any case, you dont turn down opportunities to coach a national team. More than anything else, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.																								On the balance sheet, three years on																								Weve made some progress in Test cricket and have taken huge strides in the one-day game... Of course, there have been problems with injuries and players not wishing to tour the sub-continent during winter... Taking that into account, weve been doing reasonably well..																								On what has effected this turnaround																								Weve put in place certain structures... The man management is better and weve been consistent  to the extent we could be  with the players. It gives them confidence. Weve also worked on the team spirit and everybody feels comfortable in the dressing room.																								On whether the credit should be shared equally between Nasser Hussain and him																								Cant say that... Moreover, credit must go to others as well... The seniors... In fact, every individual who has worked with a goal in mind: To move up the ladder.																								On Hussain the captain																								Nasser has been first class... We appreciate each others approach and its great to have a captain who wishes to be one step ahead of the opposition. Nasser reads the game very well and his field placements are excellent... Honestly, Ive rarely come across cricketers who understand the game at such depth.																								On whether he is worried the partnership with Hussain could end after the World Cup, next March																								In life, there always will be things you cant have any control over... I wish Nasser doesnt quit, but... At the moment, though, all Im thinking about is winning this series.																								On whether captains and coaches have a shelf life																								Dont know? Look at (Sir Alex) Ferguson... I think it depends on the individual. For whatever reason, some may have a shelf life of two years, for others that could be ten... Bottomline is withstanding the pressure at this level.																								On whether, as reported, he is himself keen to continue beyond September 2003 (when his contract ends)																								Ive been misquoted... I may have given it some thought privately, but Im yet to make a public statement. With time, Ill definitely be thinking more about my own future. However, Ill first discuss matters with the ECB, not the Media.																								On a coachs top function																								Depends on what the coach wants to do... Personally, I wish to be the one man in control... I like handling people off the field and, obviously, its important to identify areas where a player may need improvement. For instance, Ive laid much emphasis on playing spin. Cricket has many aspects and, really, its up to the coach to determine the role he actually wishes to play.																								On whether, as coach, he has tried to alter somebodys natural approach																								If a change has to be made, the coach must know when to do so... The skill of a coach lies there... Indeed, the timing counts... If I could add, you may have a player whose technique is perfect, but if the opposition has sorted him out, then the coach may have to innovate. As Ive said, timing is the key... Doing things at the right time.																								On helping players become stronger in the mind																								Again, timing matters... A coach just cant rush and say things... One must realise the team comprises individuals and the needs of one may not be similar to the guy in the next room... Ive always believed you win more games in the dressing room than out in the middle. If the players are comfortable, they are bound to be mentally relaxed. Obviously, that will be reflected in their performance. Weve got a culture whereby every player wants the rest to succeed too.																								On whether, with all the technology, coaching has become easier																								Definitely, though at times, technology gets over-stated. But I do accept that, at this level, small things can make a huge difference. However, theres a flip-side to this technology: You get exposed.																								On whether the Bob Woolmer-Hansie Cronje experiment with the one-way radio (1999 World Cup) could eventually come to stay																								It will, I think. The game can change with each ball, especially in the one-dayers. So, the gameplan may need to be quickly altered... Will the captains authority get diluted? I look at it differently  whats best, should be done. If radio contact is going to make it better, why resist? Like it or not, technology will have a role in cricket.																								On largely doing away with specialist coaches in his back-up team																								Again, its a matter of timing. I mean, whats the point of a specialist batting coach on the eve of a Test? What difference can he make in one or two days? On the contrary, there will be big problems if the gentleman tries to change somebodys technique two days before a match. Right now, I know I understand my players well.																								On whether he has himself been influenced by any coach																								Nobody. I do things my way and try and stay ahead of the rest. I have general control over the players, keep chatting with them, keep analysing their game... I never rush things.																								On whether he finds time to unwind																								(Laughs, for a change) I dont... When I was with the computer industry, back in Zimbabwe, I could always lock my desk in office and take a vacation. Now, I cant do that... Theres no free moment, theres always something which needs to be addressed... There will always be those calls from players saying they are injured and unavailable... Its a high-pressure job.																								Finally, on whether he still has emotional ties with Zimbabwe																								You cant ever forget where youve come from... Even now, I have great memories of my school (St Edward)... It has produced the Nick Prices and Graeme Hicks... The Dave Houghtons as well... My feelings about Zimbabwe wont change.

				 																																	London: Paula Radcliffe, who last month ran the worlds fastest womens marathon, was presented an MBE  Member of the British Empire  by Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday for her service to Britain and world athletics.				 																																	Radcliffe ran a time of 2::17:18 seconds on October 14 to win the Chicago Marathon. Her time was 89 seconds faster than the previous quickest time by a woman.				 																																	Radcliffe also won the London Marathon seven months ago in only her first try. She also won the world cross-country championships and took gold medals in 10,000m at the Commonwealth Games and 5,000m at the European Championships.				 																																	London: Former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich will consider working with the LTA to boost British tennis but has ruled out a role with his home German federation.				 																																	Stich quit as German Davis Cup coach in September after his plan to ask Boris Becker to come out of retirement to play doubles against Venezuela was met by withdrawal threats from Tommy Haas and Rainer Schuettler.				 																																	Stich has no immediate plans to take up another job but said in a conference call that he would like to put something back into the sport, leaving the door open for a British approach. Stich is in London to play in the 2002 Honda Challenge later this year, a stop on the Seniors Tour.				 																																	Peterborough (England): Theres apparently only room in England for one Posh. English second-division soccer club Peterborough United, known since its inception 68 years ago as Posh or The Posh, has been opposed by Spice Girl Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) in its attempt to register the nickname.				 																																	Victoria, wife of David Beckham, says she has been known by the nickname Posh or Posh Spice since the Spice Girls launched their first CD in 1996. Geoff Davey, chief executive of the club, said he was absolutely stunned when he received a letter from Beckham opposing the trademark application.				 																																	Milan: The owner and president of Serie A club Chievo has denied a newspaper report that his club is up for sale. The daily Gazzetta dello Sport reported on Tuesday that Chievo president Luca Campedelli was willing to listen to offers for the Verona club which has risen from the amateur ranks to the top flight.				 																																	But a Chievo spokesman said that the report was based on a misunderstanding. The president was asked about a hypothetical situation where an offer was made which clearly surpassed his own budget, the spokesman told Reuters. The president has stated clearly today (Tuesday), however, that the club is not for sale.				 																																	Madrid: A leg of cured ham almost got Spanish goalkeeper Ricardo kicked out of his first training session at Manchester United, the player revealed on Tuesday. When I got here I took some ham to the ground, they wouldnt let me slice it, Ricardo told Spanish daily El Mundo. They almost threw me out. They said I couldnt eat it because it was too fatty.				 																																	Ricardo joined the English club from Valladolid in a 1.5 million ($2.35 million) deal earlier this year.				 																																	n Cricket,Ashes Series, First Test, Day I from 5.27 am on STAR Sports n Sachin Tendulkar Programming, Sachin on World Cup stars, from 8.30 pm on ESPN				 																																	n Soccer, English Premier League, from 12.30 pm on STAR Sports n Soccer, Spanish League from 7.30 pm on ESPN

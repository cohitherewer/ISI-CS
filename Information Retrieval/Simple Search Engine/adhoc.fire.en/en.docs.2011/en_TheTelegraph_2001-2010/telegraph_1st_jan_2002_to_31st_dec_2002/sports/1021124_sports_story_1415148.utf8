The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, November 24, 2002 				 I admire Souravs one-day game: Gayle
 							 - I have been working very hard and, so, deserve the success that has come my way FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Chris Gayle in Vijayawada Saturday. (Reuters)																								Vijayawada, Nov. 23: Only six others have managed three hundreds in a one-day series/tournament and, so, this alone says much about Chris Gayles dominance in the ongoing ODIs. Actually, his tally of 450 from six matches is already the highest-ever against India.																								[Indeed, talking one-on-one, captain Carl Hooper lauded his opener thus: Chris has made the most of opportunities and, now, I only hope he will continue this good work right through the World Cup... Cricket essentially is a confidence-game and, though Chris isnt a veteran, hes learnt that reasonably quickly.]																								Gayle, who has completed three years in the big league, spoke to select newspapers (including The Telegraph) this afternoon. While he is flamboyant on the field, off it he is reticent  to put it mildly, that is.																								Following are excerpts (some questions, by the way, were asked exclusively):																								On the West Indies getting their act right in the one-dayers																								Well, we grew in confidence in the Calcutta Test itself, when we got 497 in our only innings... From then on, it was a question of continuing the nice work.																								On his phenomenal run in the one-dayers																								Again, that I myself got 88 in Calcutta helped my confidence grow... At the same time, Ive been working very hard and, so, deserve the success that has come my way. However, I accept the wickets have been excellent.																								On constantly having to switch from Tests to ODIs and vice-versa																								(Grins) Im not complaining because, as a pro, youve got to adjust. Clearly, in this age and time, youve got to adapt and do so quickly... Theres no change in technique, its just that I adjust to the demands of the situation. In any case, I have no control over the scheduling of international cricket.																								On his one-day approach																								Idea is to pick the bowlers and hit them off length... One has to belt the ball in the first 15 overs and, then, consolidate. I know that if I can last the 50 overs, I will get a hundred. In fact, I aim for a hundred in every one-dayer.																								On his understanding with Wavell Hinds																								Hes a very fine batsman... That both of us play for Jamaica, back home, has only helped reach a good understanding.																								On the Indian bowlers																								Jawagal Srinath certainly uses his head and brings his experience into play... Harbhajan Singh, too, is a very fine bowler... Then, in the one-dayers, (Murali) Kartik has done well.																								On often being called upon to bowl																								Im in a team sport and, thereby, do whatever is asked of me.																								On his idol																								Brian Lara... Of course, purely in the one-dayers, I admire Sourav Ganguly. His body-language, shot-selection... Hes very positive and thats reflected in the 8,000-plus runs he has got.																								On being compared to Clive Lloyd																								(Grins again) Im not complaining!																								On the lessons learnt from the about-to-end India tour																								That one must stay focussed, that one must keep concentrating... One must not be overwhelmed or overawed by the crowds and the ambience... Overall, its been a great experience.																								On his most satisfying innings																								Though we lost, it will still be that 140 in Ahmedabad.																								Finally, on his thoughts on the up-coming World Cup, which will be his first																								Im excited and, at this point in time, Im looking forward to doing well in Bangladesh. Runs there, too, will lift my confidence even more.

		 Tuesday, October 15, 2002 				 Afridi for injured Razzaq
																								Sharjah, Oct. 14 (Reuters): Allrounder Shahid Afridi has been added to the Pakistan squad for the third Test against Australia, starting in Sharjah from Saturday.																								He will replace Abdul Razzaq who has been ruled out for six weeks after fracturing his left wrist during the second Test in which Pakistan were bowled out for their lowest scores of 59 and 53 inside two days.																								Initially, Yousuf Youhana was expected to beef up the team but he was ruled out as he failed to recover from a shoulder injury sustained during a triangular tournament in Tangiers, in August.																								Afridi, who has scored 780 runs in 14 Tests with two centuries and four half centuries besides taking 21 wickets, arrives on Tuesday to join the side.																								Shahid has been included as reinforcement after Razzaq was ruled out, Pakistan coach Richard Pybus said on Monday.																								The team needed an experienced all-rounder and considering the conditions in Sharjah, it was a sensible thing to ask for Shahid as his inclusion would give the team another spin option, Pybus said. Shahids inclusion will strengthen the team as he is an aggressive competitor.																								On Youhana, Pybus said: We were informed that he still has not fully recovered from the shoulder injury. We didnt press for his inclusion because we want to make sure that he is fit for the long term. 																								Considering the long South African tour ahead, it would be appropriate to consider him for that tour. It makes more sense, Pybus said. Australia lead the three-Test series 2-0.

																								Busan: Hong Kong have been forced to replace a member of their womens table tennis team at the Asian Games after the player was ruled ineligible because she had previously represented China.																								The OCA confirmed Monday that Zhang-Rui had been kicked out because she had already played for China in international competitions. Hong Kong said Zhang, ranked 34th in the world, has been replaced by Wong-Ching, who is ranked 58th.																								Wei-ji Zhong, chairman of the OCAs sports committee, said Zhang was expelled after a special committe of six members, including himself, voted five to one against her participation.																								Hong Kong argued that Zhang should be allowed to compete because she had only played for a Chinese province. (Reuters)

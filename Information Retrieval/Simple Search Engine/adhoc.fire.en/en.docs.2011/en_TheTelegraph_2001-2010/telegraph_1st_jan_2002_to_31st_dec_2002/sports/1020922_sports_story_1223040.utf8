The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 Lankan outlook impresses Bhutia 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bhutia																								Calcutta, Sept. 21: Bhaichung Bhutia may not have been too impressed by the soccer strength of Saunders SC when he went to play for Mohun Bagan in the AFC Champions League first round away leg, but their organised manner surely took his fancy.																								Look, Saunders may not have the big funds like Mohun Bagan, it might not be a club as renowned as this either, but I saw what they have managed with the little they have. How well dressed they are, how good their practice equipment look, he said. These things matter. These are the small things, I believe that can boost soccer in this country. These are attitude things																								It was an observation in discipline, in outlook. It was also an observation that Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya made when he noticed how well maintained the main stadium turf in Colombo is. It is very good, he said. 																								Saunders doesnt even boast the level of talent available to Bagan or in most parts of this country, said Bhaichung, but they take care of whatever they have, make best use of it.																								Speaking of his combination with Jose Ramirez Barreto, Bhaichung said it was not satisfactory. We need more practice together. Barreto echoed the same: I might go down a bit tomorrow, but I hope I have more time to practise with Bhaichung.

																								Doha: Olympic legend Haile Gebreselassie of Ethopia broke the 10km road race world record and won the $ 1 m prize in Doha Wednesday.																								Gebreselassie, double Olympic 10,000m champion, clocked 27:02 in his comeback after a calf injury sustained during the London Marathon in April, to break Kenyan Sammy Kipketers world best of 27:11.																								The first kilometre was a little bit fast and I was a little nervous, but everything turned out so well, its really fantastic, said Gebrselassie.																								In the womens race, fellow Ethiopian Derartu Tulu, the world and Olympic 10,000m champion, won in 32:23. (AFP)

		 Monday, October 21, 2002 				 Bangla stare at defeat despite Shahriar fight
																								East London: Al Shahriar made a career-best 71 to bolster Bangladeshs second innings on Sunday but South Africa were still in overall command at close on Day III of the first Test.																								With Bangladesh needing to score 359 to avoid an innings defeat as they followed on, opener Al Shahriar helped them reach a respectable 209 for five at the end of the day. Captain Khaled Mashud was unbeaten on 32 and Alok Kapali not out on nine.																								South Africa had declared their first innings on 529 for four before paceman Makhaya Ntini claimed figures of five for 19 as Bangladesh collapsed to 170 all out. Bangladesh then lost the first wicket of their second innings before lunch.																								Al Shahriar and Habibul Bashar (21) added 66 runs for the second wicket. (Reuters)

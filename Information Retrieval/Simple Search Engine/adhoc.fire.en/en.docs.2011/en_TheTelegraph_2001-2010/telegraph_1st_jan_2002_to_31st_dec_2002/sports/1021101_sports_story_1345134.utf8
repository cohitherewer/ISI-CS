The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 01, 2002  Allaying may bag Day I honour 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Live horseracing returns to the city from Friday after a gap of nearly three weeks. The opening-day card may look more like an extension of the monsoon season, but things are bound to improve when the horse-strength touch 350 mark at the Hastings quarters.				 										There are two trophy events in the six-event card with the 1,400m Delhi Race Club Cup promising an exciting finish. The winner may emerge from among top order of The Archer, Royal Satin and Allaying.				 										The Archer is a class by himself but the Rodrigues-trainee is set to concede lot of weight to each of his two promising rivals. Royal Satin, too, boasts of superior South India class but the Richard Alford-trainee may need this outing. Allaying, on the other hand, is on the up and also heading for her fourth straight win. The Bharath Singh-trainee may cash in on her form and win in the hands of Cristopher Alford.

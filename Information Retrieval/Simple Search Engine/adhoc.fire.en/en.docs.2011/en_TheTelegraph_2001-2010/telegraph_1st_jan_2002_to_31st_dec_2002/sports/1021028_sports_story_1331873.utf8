 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 										Calcutta: The winter edition of the Calcutta horseracing season is set to kick off from Friday. The 27-day season may see in excess of 365 horses testing their hooves during the five-month season, informed the state government nominated steward S. K. Bose, acting as chief in the absence of general Shankar Roychowdhury, senior steward, RCTC, presently abroad. 				 										The horse-strength has shot up significantly following a poor monsoon season that was concluded three weeks ago with about 200 horses.

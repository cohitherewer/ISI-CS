		 Tuesday, December 31, 2002 				 Depleted Indian Bank take on Tolly
																								Chennai: Indian Bank will look to improve their home performance when they take on Tollygunge Agragami in their eighth match of the OIL PSU seventh National Football League at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium Tuesday. 																								The Chennai outfit will be without the services of their two Sri Lankan recruits Kasun Nadika Jayasuriya and Imran Mohammed, serving suspension. 																								Tollygunge, on the other hand, are on a high after their victory over Mohun Bagan in their previous match and should be looking to increase their tally of seven. 																								All eyes will be on Ashim Biswas, who put up a sterling show against Bagan. Though nursing a foot-injury, he will be the man to look out for.																								We have to play better and should not be complacent. Tollygunge is a strong team and they will be tough to beat, said V. P. Satyan, the Indian Bank coach. The bankmen are currently on eight points from seven games.																								The coach, however, feels Jayasuriyas absence will be felt.  (PTI)

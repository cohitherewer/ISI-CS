				 																																	Buenos Aires: Argentine goal machine Gabriel Batistuta confirmed his international retirement after he failed to make Marcelo Bielsas squad for an upcoming friendly against Japan.				 																																	The 33-year-old forward, whose goals for Fiorentina and current team Roma in Italys Serie A have made him one of the most feared strikers in recent times, said however he had his own reasons for the decision.				 																																	Ive made the decision because of my age, and because of the time needed for other important competitions. Everything I could have ever contributed to the national team, I have already given. 				 																																	Hyderabad: Indias Sania Mirza thrashed Kim Kilsadonk of The Netherlands 6-3, 6-1 to enter the semi-finals of the ITF womens circuit tournament being played at Manila.

It would be the third time that the two would be meeting each other after having won one match each.				 																																	Berlin: France defender Bixente Lizarazu faces a fine from his club Bayern Munich following a fight with teammate Niko Kovac in training on Thursday. Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who talked to both players, said after the session that he had decided to fine Lizarazu.				 																																	He lost control of himself and there will be a fine for that, Hitzfeld said. The training session had already been marred by a number of fouls when Lizarazu and Croatia midfielder Kovac started fighting.				 																																	Training had to be interrupted when assistant coach Michael Henke was unable to separate them. The atmosphere at Bayern has been tense since the clubs embarrassing elimination from the first phase of the Champions League last week, but Hitzfeld played down the incident.				 																																	 quot;It proves that the team is alive, quot; he said. 				 																																	London: The English Football Association (FA) charged Arsenals striker Dennis Bergkamp with violent conduct on Friday following his clash with Blackburn Rovers Nils-Eric Johansson in a match at Highbury last month.

The Dutchman has 14 days in which to respond to the charge.

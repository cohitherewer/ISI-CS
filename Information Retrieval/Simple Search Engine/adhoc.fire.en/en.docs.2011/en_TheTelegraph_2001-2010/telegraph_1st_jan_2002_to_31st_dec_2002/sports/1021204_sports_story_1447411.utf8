The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, December 04, 2002  Vijay holds aces in trophy events 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Although a treble is well within his reach, trainer Vijay Singh is almost assured of a brace of winners in Wednesdays six-event card. If Vijays baby Andropov has done everything asked for in his morning try outs to make a winning debut in the Goodfellas Cup, his other trainee Artisia may win by a default in the absence of any potential rival in the field. A comfortable winner of a 1,400m race, the Serious Spender filly failed to impress when she won a sorter sprint. Back to her favourite trip, Artisia is unlikely to miss the 1,600m Supernova Cup. With little luck Vijay may lead-in three winners in a row as Actable in the Our Owen Handicap is enjoying a sizeable pull at the weights from his potential challenger Buffalo Park who despite his heavy impost of 61-kg may turn out to be a serious threat.Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, December 07, 2002 				 Bengal rout Assam
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT				 	 Devang: Superb knock 																								Agartala: Devang Gandhis superb unbeaten 164 helped Bengal start their campaign in the East Zone one-dayers on a winning note Friday. 																								Electing to bat, Bengal amassed 294 for six in 49 overs at the MBB College Stadium. Assam were bundled out for 126 in 35.4 overs. Ranadeb Bose, who returned figures of four for 52, was the most successful bowler in the 168-run victory. Utpal Chatterjee picked up three wickets (9-7-10-3).																								Heavy dew delayed the scheduled 8.30 am start in the morning and the match was reduced to 49-over-a side. The Assam medium pacers led by Mark Ingty and Javed Zaman tried to make full use of the conditions. The opening pair of Nikhil Haldipur and Aurijit Basu failed to survive the test, the former falling in the third over of the innings.																								Nikhil survived nine agonising minutes and seven balls before being bowled by Zaman for four. Aurijit played 37 balls for his 20 as he seemed to grow in confidence in the company of Devang. Devang batted with authority during his 199-minute stay at the wicket. His 140-ball innings included 19 fours and five sixes.																								The fall of Aurijit brought Deep Dasgupta to the crease and the two stepped up the scoring rate. The pair added 83 for the third wicket before Deep was stumped by Zakaria Zuffri while stepping out to Sukhwinder Singh. He made 34 off 44 deliveries with three fours and a six.																								Runs flowed as Rohan Gavaskar joined Devang. The Bengal skipper made 31 off 44 balls with two sixes. It was, however, Devang who tore the rival attack into shreds. This was his second century of the season after the ton against Rajasthan in the Ranji Trophy. The wicket was a little damp in the morning. But later, it offered some turn, said Devang.																								Asked if he had set any target for himself, he said: Nothing as such. I am taking it match by match. The Assam batsmen were never able to live up to the challenge of having to score at six runs an over. 																								Orissa whip Tripura																								Meanwhile, Orissa Friday whipped Tripura by 217 runs in their one-day match here, adds PTI from Agartala. 																								Prabhanjan Mallik and Sanjay Raul were the main props for Orissa as their team hit up 291 for five in their 50 overs. Prabhanjan fell one short of his century, while Raul got 81. B.B.C.C. Mohanty had started the innings off with 51 and the total proved too good for a hapless Tripura.

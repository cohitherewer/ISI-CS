		 Monday, December 16, 2002 				 Indias official complaint to NZC
																								Wellington: The Indian team management has made an official complaint to New Zealand Cricket (NZC) about the absence of a doctor at Basin Reserve during the third and final day of the first Test here.																								Opener Sanjay Bangar suffered a painful blow on his right ring finger by a Shane Bond delivery while batting in the second innings. The blow was so painful that he had to leave the ground with an assistant to seek medical opinion. There was no doctor at the ground and we took it rather seriously because injuries of grievous nature could occur on a cricket field, said team manager N. R. Choudhary.																								A doctor did turn up but it was late in the day and we dont want such a situation to happen again on the tour, said Choudhary.  (PTI)

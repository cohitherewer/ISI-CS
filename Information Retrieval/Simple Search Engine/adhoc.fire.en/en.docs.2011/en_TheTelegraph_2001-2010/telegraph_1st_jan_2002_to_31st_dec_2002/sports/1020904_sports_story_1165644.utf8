 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Indias new racing talent Karun Chandhok has been doing pretty well at the British F3 championship. According to information received here, Chandhok was third in practice with a timing of 63.8 seconds  just 0.3 seconds slower than first-placed Robert Dahlgren. 																								Though he came fifth in qualifying, he looks good for a podium finish. 																								Qualifiers were over the Snettorton circuit in Norfolk, England, Saturday.																								The 18-year-old JK Tyre-sponsored driver ran a string of 13 lap races in his scholarship class car, the fastest being 62.793 seconds, which was the best in that class. 																								However, that was after he had dropped down in the race through a mistake in pushing to hard too soon, before the tyres had gained adequate temperature. He retired with two laps to go.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, September 06, 2002 				 I try not to look back: Wright
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 WRIGHT: I see myself as facilitator only																								London: John Wright isnt the sort to keep issuing statements. Nor is he the kind to readily pose even for group photographs. Yet, this former New Zealand captain  who spoke to The Telegraph on the eve of The Oval Test  has been making a significant contribution as Indias first coach from overseas.																								Following are excerpts																								On the mood leading up to The Oval Test																								Having just scripted our most comprehensive win (at Headingley), during my 22 months as coach, couldnt be better... Its important, though, for our feet to remain on the ground... I hope the wicket here will turn and that it will do so pretty early in the game.																								On his 22 months as India coach																								(After a pause) Frankly, its best for others to judge... If we arent going forward then, obviously, Im not doing my job... Personally, I try not to look back... But, yes, we are on the right track  especially, where fitness is concerned. It cant, for example, be a coincidence that Zaheer Khan is getting fitter with each game. Adrian (le Roux) and Andrew (Leipus) are doing a terrific job.																								On the top lesson learnt																								Firstly, that the selection of the squad should be right and, then, the XI must be perfectly balanced. Indeed, for a while, we got the latter right when Deep Dasgupta was around. Then, at Headingley, we got it right with Sanjay Bangar. To speak of the one-dayers, weve been getting it right with Rahul Dravid doing the wicketkeepers job. Selection is a critical area.																								On Indias performance in the first three Tests																								Post Lords, Im very happy with the way weve batted... That, too, in conditions where the ball did so much  both at Trent Bridge and Headingley. Then, the availability of both spinners has made a difference... Zaheer, of course, has been good and, in patches, Ajit Agarkar.																								On constantly talking of passion and commitment																								(Grins) Well, you can always get better with everything... Self-discipline, too, is important and, really, its a jigsaw where things fall into place. If I may add, the harder you work the luckier you get. Moreover, I keep telling players theyve got to scrap it out in tight situations... Do a Nasser Hussain (as at Headingley)... Theres nothing better than doing well for your country and nobody should try and cut corners. Success is great, gives that nice feeling... However, nobody should forget what brought them to that stage.																								On his approach as coach																								Im clear about having certain standards and discipline within the team... Im also clear that players who dont wish to work hard have no business playing for the country... Also, I like every player to appreciate that he isnt bigger than the team. And, yes, honesty is a key quality for me... As coach, I try and make even routine workouts enjoyable. In any case, as Ive said in the past, I see myself as facilitator only. I dont like telling players how to do something, rather, I like telling them what needs to be done. My belief is that no coach should ever get in the way of a players natural ability.																								On whether his experience at Kent has actually been helpful																								Look, the basics and the philosophy remain the same... Even in Kent, I encouraged players who really desired to be there. The players, after all, are most important and the coachs role is small.																								On encouraging players to talk to a Sunil Gavaskar																								I do... And, why not? Its nice for former players to also be involved with the present Team India.																								On whether its helped that the present team has many youngsters																								Perhaps, yes... My own opinion is that the future lies with youngsters. At the same time, the blend must be right... Experienced players complementing the talented, but inexperienced ones. It does help to have role models in the dressing room.																								On handling defeats and wins with equanimity																								Thats how it should be... Thats why, earlier in our conversation, I spoke about keeping our feet on the ground... Success shouldnt make players lose their perspective. Indeed, at times, success can be harder to handle than failure... Even if youve done well, you can improve. Similarly, if you havent, make the most of the next opportunity. You cant win if you dont deserve to. Bottomline is that the analysis must be honest.																								On what makes this team tick																								(Grins again) Self-belief... The flashy stuff is fine, but its getting through the difficult periods thats important  more than anything else, self-belief counts most here. Its self-belief, for instance, which carried Bangar and Rahul through the most difficult phase of the Headingley Test.																								On whether he has interacted with any cricketer as young as 17-year-old Parthiv Patel																								A few, yes, when some very young lads joined the Kent staff... Outside cricket, however, I did work with young boys during the year-and-half I taught maths and science at a secondary school back in New Zealand... Patel is quite a natural, has soft hands and will surely go a long way. Already, hes aware of whats expected of him at this level.																								Finally, on staying away from the limelight																								Thats because the coach isnt the most important person. Im happy just playing my role and I dont see this assignment strictly as a job. In my own way, Im very much there emotionally.

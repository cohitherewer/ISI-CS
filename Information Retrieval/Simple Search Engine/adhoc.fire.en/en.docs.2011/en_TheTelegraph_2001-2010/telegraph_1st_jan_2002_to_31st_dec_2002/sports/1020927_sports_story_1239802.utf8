		 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Tussle over unified Korea flag-bearers 
																								Busan: North and South Korea will march as one in a symbolic gesture of unity at the Asian Games opening ceremony on Sunday  but who will carry their joint flag could cause a headache for organisers.																								The two Koreas will be represented by a unity flag, a blue picture of the Korean peninsula on a white background, at the Busan Stadium.																								But the issue of which country will provide the flag-carrying athlete is shrouded in mystery  and Olympic Council of Asia president Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah added a new twist to the debate here on Thursday.																								Asked at a press conference whether athletes from two countries could carry a single flag, Al-Sabah ruled it out.																								No, we cant have two athletes walking under one flag, Al-Sabah said. We have a tradition of one athlete carrying the flag, the Kuwaiti official said, without referring to the two Koreas directly.																								At the Sydney Olympics, when the two Koreas walked side-by-side into Stadium Australia at the opening ceremony, a member of each countrys delegation headed the mixed procession. 																								South Korean womens basketball player Chung Eun-Soon and North Korean judo coach Pak Jang-Chol had entered the stadium with their hands in a symbol of unity.																								Despite his apparent reluctance to let two Koreans hold the flag Al-Sabah expressed his delight at the prospect of the bitter historical rivals walking together at the opening ceremony.																								This is a great symbol. Sport is the engine of friendship, said Al-Sabah. 																								The two Koreas are technically still at war as the Korean War never formally ended and only a ceasefire was agreed upon.																								The isolationist North has only just started taking part in international sports events. (AFP)

																								Busan: A North Korean weightlifter scored the first world record of this years Asian Games on Tuesday, while host South Korea shattered Thailands proud dominance of the obscure ancient sport of sepak takraw.																								The second day of events at the two-week Games also saw Chinas swimmers marking their National Day by winning all five finals.

North Koreas Olympic silver medallist Ri Song-hui broke a world record in the womens 53 kg weightlifting snatch, lifting 102.5 kg to win the gold medal.																								For the first world record to fall in the Busan Games, the 23-year-old Ri beat the previous mark of 100 kg set by Chinas Yang Xia at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.																								In the mens 56 kg division, Chinas Wu Meijin took the gold with a total weight of 292.5 kg. Chinese Taipei (Taiwan) took the silver and bronze.

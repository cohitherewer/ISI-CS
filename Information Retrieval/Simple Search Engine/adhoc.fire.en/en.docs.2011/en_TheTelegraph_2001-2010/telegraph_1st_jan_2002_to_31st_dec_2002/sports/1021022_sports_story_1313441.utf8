		 Tuesday, October 22, 2002 				 Munich World Cup stadium foundation laid
																								Munich: The foundation stone of a spectacular new Munich stadium to be used as a venue for the 2006 soccer World Cup in Germany was laid on Monday. The arena, which will seat 66,000 and should be completed in April 2005, will also become the home of Munichs two first division clubs, Bayern and TSV 1860.																								Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer and his TSV 1860 counterpart Karl-Heinz Wildmoser attended Mondays ceremony in the northern Munich district of Froettmaning, where the new stadium will be erected.																								We have waited for this moment for a long time, said Beckenbauer, who had pressed for a new stadium not only as Bayern boss but also as chairman of the organising committee of the 2006 World Cup.																								Munich should host the opening game of the 2006 tournament as well as a semi-final and three more games. The final will be played in Berlins Olympic Stadium, undergoing a major facelift.																								The new, all-soccer Munich stadium, the cost of which was put at 280 million euros, will replace the ageing multi-purpose Olympic Stadium that was built for the 1972 Summer Games. (REUTERS)

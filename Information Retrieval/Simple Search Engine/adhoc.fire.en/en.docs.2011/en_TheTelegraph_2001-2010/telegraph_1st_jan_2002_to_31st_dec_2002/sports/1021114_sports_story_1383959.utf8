		 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 Joginder remembered
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Whenever anyone, concerned about Joginders expanding girth said Gindi, kam khao!, he would never lose his temper and just smile, said Gurbux Singh of his teammate and ex-Olympian hockey player Joginder Singh, who passed away recently.																								The one common refrain that came through as speakers remembered Joginder at a condolence meeting organised by the Bengal Hockey Association on Wednesday was his greatness as a human being. Even on field, he was a true gentleman and would never lose his cool despite the gravest of provocations.																								The other former Olympian present, Leslie Claudius, who also captained Joginder said he was one of the finest right-wingers in the history of the game. He remembered his departed comrade as a fine chap, loved and respected.																								Recounting his on-field prowess, Gurbux, BHA secretary said, Joginder gave millions of hockey lovers the pleasure of seeing the art of hockey. He said though Joginder was not slim or fast, he would outwit the strongest of defence lines with sheer artistry.

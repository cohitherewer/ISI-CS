The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, October 13, 2002 				 Pakistan sink to new low
 							 - Warne chief wrecker in two-day win				 	 Warne: Four for 13																								Sharjah, Oct. 12 (PTI): In an astonishing desert ambush, Australia on Saturday inflicted a humiliating innings and 198-run defeat on Pakistan in less than two days of the second Test, blowing them away for 53 runs in the second innings.																								The 59 made by Pakistan in their first innings Friday was their lowest-ever in Test cricket but they sunk to a new low after being bundled out for 53 this afternoon by Australias deadly spin and pace attack at a venue which the Pakistanis have long regarded as among their favourite grounds.																								Shane Warne was Pakistans chief destroyer with eight wickets in the match, following up his first innings four for 11 with another four-wicket haul, giving away 13 runs  an amazing eight for 24 for the match.																								Earlier, batting resolutely in temperatures of 50 degree celcius and above, Australia made 310 in their first innings built largely around a gritty 119 by opener Matthew Hayden. This gave them a lead of 251 which proved way beyond the capabilities of the Pakistan team. who had batted with a lot of determination before losing the first Test in Colombo last week.																								It is only the second time in the history of the game that a Test has been decided within the first two days. 																								Australia thus won the three-match series 2-0 with the last match due to be played next week.																								Just three Pakistan batsmen could cross double-figures. Imran Nazir made 16 and Misbah-ul Haq 12 in the second innings after Abdul Razzaq scored 21 in the first innings. Razzaq retired hurt for four in the second innings.																								With the result a foregone conclusion, Pakistans late-order batsmen, including captain Waqar Younis looked hardly interested and did not even make an attempt to take the team beyond 59 runs. 																								Instead, they tried ambitious hits and perished in the process, Waqar falling leg before wicket to Warne to signal an ignominous end to Pakistans second innings in less than 25 overs.																								 Meanwhile, Razzaq will be sidelined for at least six weeks after fracturing his wrist.

																								New Delhi: Cricket bible Wisden has rated batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar as the second greatest Test batsman ever, behind the legendary Sir Don Bradman.																								However, the little genius was a few notches ahead of several cricketing idols including Brian Lara of West Indies, Mark Waugh of Australia and Saeed Anwar of Pakistan in the shorter version of the game, where he got a close second place behind the indomitable West Indian Viv Richards.																								The list by Wisden naming the top batsmen and bowlers in both versions of the game was made after analysing the performance of every player, and career length and importance of each performance to the outcome of an innings or match.																								Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralidharan and Pakistani Wasim Akram bagged the top spot in the bowling list for Tests and one-dayers respectively.

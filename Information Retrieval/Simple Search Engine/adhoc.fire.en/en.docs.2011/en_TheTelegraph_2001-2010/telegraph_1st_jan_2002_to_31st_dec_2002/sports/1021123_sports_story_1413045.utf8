		 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 Randhawa slips to 13th, makes cut
 							 - Arjun Singh at sixth spot																								Tao Yuan (Taiwan): A triple bogey failed to derail Jyoti Randhawas campaign at the Asian Open, as the gritty Indian hung on and battled back to card a three-over 75 on the second day of the golf championship Friday.																								Randhawas card was enough to keep him among the top 15 midway through the $ 1.5 million event, which is jointly sanctioned by the Asian and European PGA Tours.																								However, before overnight leader Randhawa struggled to find his way back after the triple on par-five 14th, which was his fifth hole of the day, Arjun Singh carded a steady two-under 70 to climb to tied sixth place at six-under 138.																								Randhawa with rounds of 65 and 75 is now tied for 13th place.																								The field is led by Maarten Lafeber of Holland, who opened a four-stroke lead after two rounds. Lafeber breezed to his second straight six-under-par 66 in blustery conditions at Ta Shee Golf and Country Club and his 12-under 132 total gave him an edge over the field.																								The cut came at one-over 145 and among the Indians making it were Arjun Atwal and Vijay Kumar, both of whom had totals of 145. Atwal shot a 73 to go with his first round 72. Vijay had rounds of 71 and 74 on the two days. 																								Missing the cut were Amandeep Johl, who had a total of three-over 147 (77 and 70) and Vivek Bhandari, who totalled five-over 149 (73 and 76).																								Lafeber, the 28-year-old Dutchman was comfortably ahead of Irelands Padraig Harrington and South African Trevor Immelman, who share second place on eight under.																								I have been up there a bit in the last couple of months but what can you do because you cant force it, said Lafeber, who has been the second round leader at three of his last five tournaments but is still seeking his first European tour win.																								Padraig is up there as is Trevor, so it will be really tough but I just need to keep working harder and Im confident that one week will become my week.																								Harrington meanwhile, spent all afternoon on the Ta Shee practice putting green after suffering concentration lapses during his round in the morning. (AGENCIES)

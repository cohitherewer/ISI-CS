The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, September 19, 2002  Saturday acceptances today 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Entries and handicaps for Saturdays city race-meet are out but the nagging doubts about race acceptances continue to bother those who patronise live racing only. Two of the city racing fixtures  on September 11 and September 18  had to be cancelled owing to paucity of acceptors. The Turf Club officials blame horse trainers for the cancellation while some of the senior trainers think it is the other way round. 				 										The turf club has learnt to bank heavily upon two big trainers. If these trainers fail to enter horses for some reason or the other, race events normally fall through; said a senior trainer who did not want to be identified. 				 										Trainer John Stephens was more logical about the whole thing. He said:  We have very few horses in the city. Therefore we keep on rotating them. As a result of overracing, horses tend to go lame and need to put on sick list. Moreover the monsoon track also tends to turn hard in the absence of rains therefore, horses become more prone to injury.				 										 Trainer Daniel David who owns the largest string said: Trainer are there to win races. Even though the horse-strength is low in RCTC, we are always trying to provide support to the turf club. But we also need to streamline our stock in view of the long season. Moreover, we are also much in need of stake money which goes abegging as the race meetings keep falling through. We know and also understand our responsibilities.

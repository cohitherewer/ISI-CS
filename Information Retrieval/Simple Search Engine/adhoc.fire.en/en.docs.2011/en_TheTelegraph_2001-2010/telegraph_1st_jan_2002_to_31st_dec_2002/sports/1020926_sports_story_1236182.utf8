The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, September 26, 2002 				 SA to post a Dazzler stamp
																								Johannesburg: Dazzler, the quaint little cricket-playing zebra mascot of the cricket World Cup 2003, was immortalised here when the South African post office released the first two postage stamps in a series bearing its colourful image.																								The two stamps, showing Dazzler batting and bowling, will go on sale at 600 post offices countrywide from Wednesday. The stamps were unveiled Tuesday by the CEO of the South African post office, Maanda Manyatshe, who handed them over to Ali Bacher, World Cup executive director. 																								Two more Dazzler stamps will be released on November 1 to mark the 100 days to go to the start of the World Cup, and a further two will go public when the 50 days to go milestone is reached on December 21. Among the Dazzler poses on the postage stamps is one showing it playing a reverse sweep shot of the kind that Jonty Rhodes among others has used to such good effect. (PTI)

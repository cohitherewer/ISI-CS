The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Rayudu slams 134
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: Ambati Tirupati Rayudus exclusion from the list of 30-member World Cup probables may have raised a lot of eyebrows. But the young talent served another notice to the national selectors about his stupendous form in domestic cricket, as he put Hyderabad in command against visiting Bengal on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy clash on Thursday. 																								According to information received here, Rayudu hit 134 and put up a third-wicket partnership of 158 runs with Daniel Manohar as Hyderabad posted 296 for four at close. They, thus, put paid to Bengal after the visitors early success. 																								Sanjib Sanyal took two for 39 while Utpal claimed the prize wicket of Rayudu in a show which may leave a few furrows in captain Rohan Gavaskars forehead after the days play. 																								Bengal won the toss and put Hyderabad in. Sanjib gave the visitors an early breakthrough when he uprooted opener G. Arvind Kumars stumps. The Bengal medium pacer also proved too hot for A. Nandakishores defence, leaving the hosts struggling at 43 for two. 																								It was Rayudu all the way thereafter, as he mesmerised the Gymkhana Grounds with some powerful hits. While Rayudu, the youngest to have scored a double century and a hundred in the same Ranji match, went for big shots, Manohar was pretty content with playing a second fiddle to the younger partner.Manohar was run out after a patient 64 off the 163 balls during his 244 minute stay at the wicket. His knock was studded with eight hits to the fence.																								Rayudu, on the other hand, showed no mercy to the bowlers and hit 16 fours and five sixes in his 165-ball 217-minute stay at crease. He was finally trapped leg before by veretan Utpal Chatterjee. 																								Vinay Kumar (39) and N. Arjun Yadav (23) put up an unbroken 43-run stand when stumps were drawn.

		 Friday, December 27, 2002  Imperial Legend set to score 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore: Imperial Legend, an impressive winner in his last start, looks good to make it an encore when he meets five rivals for the 1,600m Ardent Knight Cup here on Friday,. Maintaining excellent form, the Placerville-Imperial Satsuma son, hailing from Lokanath Gowdas yard, may face some resistance from Arrakis and Hope And Faith. But apprentice Suraj Narredu, who is enjoying a good season, may not find it hard to kick Imperial home.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2.30 pm: Air Marshal 1.

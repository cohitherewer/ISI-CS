The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, December 28, 2002 				 AIFF intervention may be sought
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi: With 16-time champions Mohun Bagans participation still uncertain, the organisers of the Durand Cup are in a quandary about releasing groupings for the second stage. The secretary of the Durand tournament society, Lt Col Bhupender Singh, is still hoping the problem will be sorted out  latest by Saturday  and the Calcutta giants will make it to the draw.																								The Durand Cup organisers may also request AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco to intervene. However, with both Mohun Bagan and the IFA hardening their stance, a solution is unlikely.																								The 12 teams in the second stage will be divided into four groups with Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, holders Mahindra United and 1999 winners Salgaocar having been slotted as seeded teams.																								Meanwhile, both local teams got eliminated Friday. Indian Navy ousted New Delhi Heroes 1-0, striker V.K. Mishra scoring the winner in the 20th minute with a stiff grounder which went in off the post.																								Bordoloi Trophy champions Assam Regimental Centre (ARC), Shillong, scored two brilliant first-half goals to overcome local champions Allwyn Hindustan 2-0. Striker Thangluanmuana scored with a crisp volley in the 32nd minute while midfielder Gordon found the mark in stoppage time with an angular right-footer which dipped in at the far corner of the net.

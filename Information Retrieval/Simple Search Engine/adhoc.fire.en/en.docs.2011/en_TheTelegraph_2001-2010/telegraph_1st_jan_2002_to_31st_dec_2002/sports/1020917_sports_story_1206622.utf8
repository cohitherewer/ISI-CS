The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Sambaran new Bengal coach
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sambaran: Its pay-back time for me																								Calcutta: Former Bengal captain Sambaran Banerjee will be the new state coach for the forthcoming season. W.V. Raman, who was in charge last season, has made himself unavailable. 																								Almost immediately after the official appointment Monday, Banerjee said that he would ask for a full-time physio. As far as my knowledge goes, Dr Vece Paes will not be available. I will ask the CAB authorities to provide me with a physio, he told The Telegraph.																								He, however, sounded a little worried about the bowling attack of the team. There are some finer points that Ill need to work on soon, he said.																								Banerjee, who led Bengal to their Ranji Trophy triumph in 1989-90, informed that he will meet the boys at practice Tuesday and will join them a day later. What Im today is all because of my attachment to Bengal cricket. Its pay-back time for me, he added. 																								However, he said that people should not expect instant success. Im not saying that well end at the top or be relegated. This is a talented bunch and well do our best.																								He also feels that he will be able to give a better idea about the team once he gets to the nets with them. I need to know every one of them thoroughly, from Utpal Chatterjee to Shubhradeep Ganguly, he said.																								We open on November 9 and Ill have to work on a war-footing. 																								When asked whether the new format of Ranji Trophy will be a bit difficult for the Bengal team, the newly-appointed coach said, Itll be a challenge for me. And I prefer to do it the hard way.																								He also added that he will seek the services of Sourav Ganguly whenever hes available. 																								The presence of the Indian captain will be a tremendous motivation for the boys, and I want to utilise that, he signed off.

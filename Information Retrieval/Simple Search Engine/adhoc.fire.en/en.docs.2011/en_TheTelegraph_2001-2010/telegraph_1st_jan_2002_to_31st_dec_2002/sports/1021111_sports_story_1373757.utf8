		 Monday, November 11, 2002 				 Gough out of World Cup too
																								Brisbane: Fast bowler Darren Gough will miss the rest of the Ashes tour and next years World Cup after receiving advice on his knee injury from a specialist in Adelaide.																								Gough, 32, who has not played a Test since Australias Ashes tour of England last year, will fly home Sunday and has been ruled out of cricket for three months.																								The Yorkshire paceman will see another specialist immediately upon his return to England and will have the injury re-assessed in three months, it was learnt from a statement released Sunday.																								Gough had bowled in the nets at the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide this week but reported swelling on the knee on Friday. Im going to go home and work hard on continually strengthening my knee, Gough said.																								Obviously this is another setback and its going to be a huge disappointment to miss the Ashes and the World Cup, but I want to explore all the medical options that are open to me before I make any decisions about my future career.																								Alex Tudor, who was called up to the tour party from the England Cricket Board National Academy in Adelaide earlier this week, will replace Gough in the Test squad. (REUTERS)

		 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Indians set to rule roost in kabaddi 
																								Busan: The Indian kabaddi squad will definitely return richer from the Asian Games in Busan as the discipline has been the stronghold of the country since its inception in the 1990 Beijing Games.																								It is a rare occurrence in Indian sports that a particular discipline has won a record breaking three-in-row gold haul. The Indian kabaddi team has been ruling the roost and had won the first two Games title rather easily.																								However, it had to put in all its resources against teams like Bangladesh and Pakistan to maintain a clean slate, winning all of its six matches for the title in Bangkok in 1998.																								A little hiccup though is the difference in rules in domestic matches and in the Games.  (PTI)

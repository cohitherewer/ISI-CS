Youhana reached his 100 with a six off the last ball of the innings as Pakistan made 323 for five before restricting Zimbabwe to 275 for seven to win by 48 runs and claim the five-match series.																								Youhana, who faced 68 balls and hit eight fours and two sixes, scored 141 not out and 76 not out in the first two matches in Bulawayo at the weekend, and has a series aggregate of 317 runs without dismissal.																								The visitors won the first two matches by seven runs and by 104 runs.																								Youhana was ably assisted on Wednesday by opener Salim Elahi, who scored his second consecutive ton  a career-best 108  as Pakistan amassed another imposing total after making 302 for four and 344 for five in Bulawayo.																								Elahi, who scored 53 and 107 at the weekend, faced 119 balls and hit 10 fours.																								Taufeeq Umar and Elahi provided Pakistan with a solid opening stand of 154, which came to a close in the 30th over when Umar pulled a delivery from Grant Flower to deep square leg for Mark Vermeulen to take a spectacular diving catch.																								The left-handed opener scored his 68 off 91 balls with five fours.																								Youhana treated the hapless Zimbabwe attack with disdain and completed his century by pulling the last ball of the innings  a gentle full toss from Brent  high into the stands beyond the mid wicket boundary.

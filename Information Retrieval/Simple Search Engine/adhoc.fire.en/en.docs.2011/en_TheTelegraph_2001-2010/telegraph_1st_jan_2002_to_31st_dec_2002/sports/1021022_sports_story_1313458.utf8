																								East London: South Africa won the first Test against Bangladesh by an innings and 107 runs after 50 minutes of play on the fourth day at Buffalo Park on Monday. 																								David Terbrugge ensured an early finish when he dismissed both Bangladeshi overnight batsmen in the first two overs of the day. He went on to take career-best figures of five for 46. 																								Bangladesh captain Khaled Mashud and Alok Kapali had defied the South African bowlers for the last 88 minutes of play on Sunday when Bangladesh reached 209 for five, the first time they had topped 200 in 13 Test innings. 																								But Kapali was out to the fifth ball of the morning adjudged leg before for 10. The new ball, due after two overs, was taken immediately. With his sixth delivery with the new ball Terbrugge had Mashud caught plumb in front for a gritty 33, made off 156 balls.																								Mohammad Rafique hit a quick 19 before he swung across line and was bowled by Terbrugge, for his first five-wicket haul.  (AFP)

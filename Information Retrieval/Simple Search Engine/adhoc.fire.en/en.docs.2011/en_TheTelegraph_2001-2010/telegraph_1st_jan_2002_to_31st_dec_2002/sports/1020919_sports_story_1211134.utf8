		 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 Lara spends night in hospital
																								Colombo: West Indies batsman Brian Lara stayed overnight in a Colombo hospital after being admitted with suspected hepatitis during his teams Champions Trophy match against Kenya on Tuesday.																								He is still undergoing tests. We should have further details from the doctors later today, the Caribbean team manager Ricky Skerritt said on Wednesday.																								Skeritt said the batsman could spend at least another day in the hospital before the diagnosis was made. The stylish left-hander was in distress after scoring a match-winning 111 during his sides 29-run win over Kenya and was taken to hospital midway through the game.																								If diagnosed with hepatitis, the player could be ruled out of a Test tour of India starting early next month. 																								West Indies look likely to make a premature exit after their two-wicket defeat in their opening pool three game against South Africa on Friday. (REUTERS)

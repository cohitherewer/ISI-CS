		 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Sunita Rani declared fit, in squad 
																								New Delhi: Ace middle distance runner Sunita Rani has been included in the athletic squad for the Pusan Asian Games after she was declared fit.																								The AAFI decided to include the top Railways athlete in the team after her case was discussed in detail with the coaches in Patiala where the Pusan-bound athletes are undergoing a camp. 																								She has joined the national athletic coaching camp and her matter has been discussed with the coaches. She has been found fully fit to perform at the games, AAFI secretary Lalit Bhanot said.																								The federation had announced a 42-member squad on September 10 but had deferred the selection of Sunita on grounds of fitness though she met the qualifying mark in womens 1500m more than once this season.																								The decision to defer her selection was taken after the athlete did not participate in the National Open athletic meet in New Delhi and the AAFI said they had no information about her.																								 Bhanot said the fitness trials of the Pusan-bound athletes, earlier scheduled for September 25 in Patiala, has been postponed by a day. (PTI)

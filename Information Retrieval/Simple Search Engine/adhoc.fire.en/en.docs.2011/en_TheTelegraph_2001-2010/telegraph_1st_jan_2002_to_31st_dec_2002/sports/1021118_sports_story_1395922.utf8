The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, November 18, 2002 				 Ferguson not to quit now
																								London: Alex Ferguson has said he will carry on as Manchester United manager indefinitely as long as he thinks he is fit for the job  and he will make wholesale changes to the squad if necessary at the end of this season.																								It would be inconceivable for me to retire having not won anything (more). It wont happen, said Ferguson, who last season shelved retirement plans by deciding to stay on for another three years.																								Ferguson, whose side failed to win a trophy last season for the first time since 1998, added: At the moment I would say, yes, I could go on for another three years.																								He said it all hinged on his health but he was determined to return United to their winning ways before quitting and if that meant breaking up a side that has enjoyed a decade of success then he would.																								Ferguson gave Argentine Juan Sebastian Veron, his record signing from Lazio last year, as an example. His European form has been great so there is always the question: Is he a European player or a Premiership player? But the one thing he has is quality, Ferguson said. (Reuters)

Ashok, who was the No. 1 amateur in the country before turning pro in February, shot a three-under 69 in trying situations to grab a one-stroke lead over Firoz Ali and amateur Amit Khaitan, who shot two-under 70 each, according to information reaching here. Mukesh Kumar (Mhow), Amritinder Singh (Chandigarh), Zai Kipgen and Pappan (both Delhi) were tied for the third place at one-under 71. All the players teed off at the par-72 Beldih course.

Ashok Kumar came out trumps, especially on his second nine. Playing at the par-72 Beldih course, Ashok got off to a bad start with a bogey on the long and difficult par-3 opening hole.

 							 - Hayden (146), Gillespie (5/22) set up 224-run win (REUTERS)				 	 Matthew Hayden sweeps during his blistering 128-ball knock against Pakistan in Nairobi Friday. (AFP)																								Nairobi: Matthew Hayden scored faster than a run a ball to lash 146 and Jason Gillespie took five for 22 as Australia crushed Pakistan by 224 runs in the second match of the Kenya tri-series on Friday.																								Pakistan won the toss but little else all day as Australia amassed 332 for five, Haydens innings coming off 128 balls to set his side up for the fourth biggest winning run margin in one-day International history.																								Strike bowler Gillespie then took wickets with his second and fourth balls, opener Imran Nazir caught for a single by wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist and Shahid Afridi for a duck, to send Pakistan slumping to 13 for four by the seventh over.																								None of the top four made more than five as Pakistan were dismissed for 108 in 36 overs.																								They were not helped by hundreds of Asians of Indian extraction heckling them.																								Glenn McGrath continued the procession as Abdul Razzaq returned to the pavilion for five, clean bowled, and Saeed Anwar followed for three off 13 balls after being trapped leg before.																								Gillespie returned with the last three wickets of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar, the final man falling to the last ball of his tenth and final over.																								All-rounder Azhar Mahmood top-scored with 32.																								Earlier, the 31-year-old left-handed Hayden cemented his new opening role with a devastating display of hitting in an innings including six sixes and 12 fours.																								Captain Ricky Ponting scored 50 off 57 balls, which included five fours and two sixes, in putting on 128 with Hayden for the second wicket.

		 Tuesday, October 08, 2002 				 India snap up kabaddi gold
 FROM AMITAVA DAS GUPTA				 	 India defenders trap a Pakistani attacker during their kabaddi match in Busan on Monday. India won 37-7. (AFP)																								Busan: The Asian Games kabaddi gold is Indias as a matter of right. They have been winning it since the sports introduction in the Beijing edition in 1990. 																								There was no let-up of that domination on Monday afternoon but this one tasted slightly sweeter as it was achieved at Pakistans expense.																								There was a large turnout at the brand new Tongmyong University Stadium where a synthetic surface has been laid for the kabaddi competition. Local fans and students, waving Indian and Pakistani flags made it an atmosphere worth going miles to experience.																								Unfortunately, their wish of a hard-fought duel didnt materialise. The Indians were far too superior, technically and tactically. They had three lonas  three-pointers for getting all seven opponents out  en route to a 37-7 triumph.																								We were under no pressure as we knew we had a better team, said Arjuna Awardee B.C. Ramesh, one of four who were on the gold-winning Bangkok Games team too. The Pakistanis have improved, so have the Japanese and Bangladeshis. But we are still way ahead.																								Three months of practice on synthetic courts in Bangalore and Gandhinagar had prepared them for the competition here. The Pakistanis, on the other hand, saw a synthetic turf for the first time on arrival here.																								Unfortunately, the two most striking moments of the match came off scuffles. Indias Sanjiv Kumar was left with a bloody and swollen nose after clashing with Badshah Gul. Sanjiv couldnt take any further part in the game and had to be taken for a precautionary X-ray.																								The other incident was more serious with Ramesh Kumar and Muhammad Latif almost on the verge of trading blows after the Indian had been provoked despite withdrawing from a raid unscathed. It needed a prompt intervention by Pakistan coach Muhammad Sarwar to defuse the tension.																								India added a bronze to their tally courtesy Palwinder Singh Cheema. He got the medal in the 120 kg category.																								Geet Sethi moved into the final of the billiards singles beating Myanmars Oo Kyaw U 2-1. He had earlier overcome Thai Udon Khaimuk and Pakistani Hussain Khalil.																								Jaspal Rana disappointed again at the Masan shooting range. He shot 581 in the 25mcentrefire pistol to finish fifth.																								Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, the top seeds, moved into the last eight conceding one game to Pakistani pair Rashid Malik and Aqeel Khan. This was their first match together since May when they won the Mallorca Open ATP title.																								The other Indians had equally straightforward victories  Sunil Kumar and Rohan Bopanna in the mens singles, Nirupama Vaidyanathan and Sania Mirza in the womens singles and Bhupathi-Manisha Malhotra in the mixed doubles.																								Bhutia arrival Wednesday																								Meanwhile, the entire football squad barring manager Santo Mitra and four players (Bijen Singh, S. Venkatesh, Monitombi Singh and Tomba Singh) left for Seoul on Monday. Theyll reach Delhi on Tuesday night. Bhaichung Bhutia and the other Calcutta players will take the morning flight the next day.

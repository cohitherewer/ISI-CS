																								Harare: Younis Khan starred with bat and ball as Pakistan completed a 5-0 whitewash over Zimbabwe in the final one-day International on Sunday.																								Pakistan, who totalled 300 for seven, won by 70 runs after dismissing Zimbabwe for 230 in 45.3 overs. Younis scored 90, took four catches, set up two run outs and took one for 24 with his occasional off spin.																								But on a bad note for Pakistan, fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has been banned for one match and fined half his match fee after being found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute during the match. 																								Match referee Clive Lloyd summoned Shoaib to a hearing after two separate incidents during the match, in which he gestured at the crowd and threw a plastic water bottle into the stands.																								The bottle did not hit any spectators, but struck a wall.																								That is bringing the game into disrepute, and he was on a severe reprimand before for scratching the ball, Lloyd said. He will lose his match fee, and he has been banned for one one-day International.																								Shoaib had been reprimanded earlier by Lloyd for ball tampering after the first Test in Harare last month. Pakistan team manager KM Nasir declined to comment on the suspension.																								The visitors slipped to 39 for three in the 10th over with Kamran Akmal, Misbah-ul-Haq and Faisal Iqbal all dismissed cheaply.																								Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana turned the tide with a fourth wicket stand of 51 that was ended in the 23rd over when Inzamam hammered a return catch to leg spinner Brian Murphy to be dismissed for 27.																								Yousuf and Younis then gathered runs with deceptive ease in their fifth wicket stand of 129. 																								Yousuf faced 93 balls and hit nine fours and a six before he was run out for 88 in the 40th over. It was his first dismissal in four innings in the series, in which he scored 405 runs.																								Younis went in the 46th over when he slapped a full toss from medium pacer Douglas Hondo to Andy Flower at mid wicket. His runs came off 75 balls and included nine fours and a six.																								A brisk second wicket stand of 103 between Dion Ebrahim and Andy Flower kept Zimbabwe in the hunt, but the home sides innings was destroyed as eight wickets tumbled for 66 runs in the space of 18 overs.																								Ebrahim was run out by Younis for 36 in the 23rd over, followed by Andy top edging a sweep shot off spinner Saqlain Mushtaq to Wasim Akram at backward square leg. Flower scored his 72 off 67 balls. 																								Grant Flowers 28 was Zimbabwes only other double figure score until Olonga slogged 31, off 20 balls with three fours and two sixes, and Hondo made 15 not out in a spirited last wicket stand of 47 off 32 balls.

				 																																	Paris: Zinedine Zidane has played down talk of a crisis at Real Madrid, despite the European champions recent run of poor results.				 																																	There is no crisis. We are just going through a patch that is a bit delicate but there is nothing to worry about, the France playmaker was quoted as saying by the French sports daily LEquipe on Tuesday.				 																																	Real lost 0-2 at Racing Santander in Spanish first division 10 days ago, drew 2-2 at home to AEK Athens in the Champions League last Tuesday and were then held 1-1 at home by Villarreal in the Spanish League on Saturday.				 																																	Real have not won outside the Bernabeu in the Spanish league since beating Sevilla in March. We have to do something about that. Maybe, we should change our away shirt because the black one we are wearing has not brought us very good results so far, he said.				 																																	Im not superstitious but Im beginning to think that it could be different with our traditional white jersey.				 																																	St Johns: The Bangladesh Cricket Board has switched the venues for the two Tests between their national side and West Indies next month, the WICB said on Monday. Dhakas Bangabandhu Stadium will now host the first Test from December 8 to 12 and Chittagongs MA Aziz Stadium will stage the second and final Test from December 16 to 20. Chittagong was due to host the first Test and Dhaka the second. The change became necessary to accommodate Victory Day celebrations in Dhaka on December 16, said Michael Hall, chief cricket operations officer of the WICB.				 																																	London: The English Football Association (FA) has asked to see the video of a clash between Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp and Blackburn Rovers defender Nils-Eric Johansson in Saturdays Premier League match at Highbury.				 																																	Television replays showed Bergkamp stepping on the grounded Swede after a tangle during Arsenals 1-2 defeat, their third successive loss. The incident was missed by referee Graham Barber, opening the way for the FAs video evidence panel to act. 				 																																	Sydney: Australian former golf champion Norman Von Nida was recovering in hospital on Tuesday after being run down by a car.				 																																	The 88-year-old Von Nida underwent surgery after being knocked down crossing a Brisbane street. A hospital spokesman told local reporters he was in a stable condition.				 																																	Von Nida won more than 100 tournaments around the world during a playing career spanning the 1930s, 40s and 50s.				 																																	He also forged a successful career as a coach, guiding the likes of five-times British Open winner Peter Thomson.				 																																	Despite losing his eyesight, Von Nida possesses a sixth sense for the sport.				 																																	Sydney: An Aus tralian couple, cleared on charges of stalking Ian Thorpe, were ordered by a Sydney court on Tuesday to keep away from the Olympic swimming champion. The court instructed the couple to steer clear of Thorpe and the suburban pool where he trains, after the more serious stalking charges were dropped, local media reported.				 																																	n General, The Life: The Michael Jordan Classic from 12 noon on ESPN n Rowing, Fisa World rowing championships from 9 am on STAR Sports n Soccer, Uefa Champions League from 3.30 pm on ESPN n Soccer, AFC U-17 meet from 6 am (Thursday) on STAR Sports

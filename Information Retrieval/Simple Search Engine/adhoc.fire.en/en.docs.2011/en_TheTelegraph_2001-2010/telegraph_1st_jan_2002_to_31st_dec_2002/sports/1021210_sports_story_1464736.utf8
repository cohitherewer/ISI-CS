 							 - US PGA QUALIFYING BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Jeev: History beckons																								Calcutta: Jeev Milkha Singh is within one step of making history with one more round to go in the gruelling six-round US PGA Tour qualifying School at La Quinta in California. The 30-year-old Indian, who was the first from his country to qualify for the European PGA Tour, could add another first, if he finishes among the top 35 and ties at the end of the six rounds.																								According to information received here, Jeev, who is sponsored by Hero Honda, fired a two-under 70 in the fifth round to aggregate eight-under 352. He was tied for the 31st place in a competition led by Jeff Brehaut and Brian Bateman. Jeev earlier had rounds of 69, 69, 72 and 72 on the first four days. 																								In his fifth round, Jeev started from the tenth and had birdies on the 11th, 16th and 17th but also bogeyed the 14th to be two-under at the turn. On the back nine, he once again had three birdies, on the first, fourth and seventh. But he also dropped strokes on the second, fifth and sixth.																								On each of the five days, Jeev has found his birdies, five each in the first, second and fourth rounds and six in the fifth. He also had three on the third day, when he had a even par card.																								Breheaut and Bateman shared the lead at 17-under-par 343 with just one round to go. Brehaut fired the best round of the tournament with a bogey-free, 9-under-par 63 at the PGA Wests Jack Nicklaus Tournament Course, which along with the Tournament Players Club Stadium Course is hosting the six-round tournament.																								The qualifying school has gone through three stages and seen 4,000 golfers and only top 35 and ties will get the US PGA card.

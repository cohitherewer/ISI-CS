		 Monday, November 25, 2002 				 More than six, promise Taejon
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: Taejon Citizen of South Korea landed in the city Sunday hoping to improve on their 6-0 thrashing of Mohun Bagan in the AFC Champions League final round qualifier. Well give off our best and try to score more goals, Lee Tae-ho, head coach of the K-League club, told reporters through interpreter at a city hotel. 																								Lee, however, added that chilling weather back in Korea was the principal detriment to Mohun Bagans chances of a fight against his team. He also ruled out any problem of playing under much hotter conditions of 28-29 degree Celsius at Salt Lake Stadium in the return leg on Tuesday. Summer in South Korea is similarly hot and we are habituated to this kind of conditions, Lee maintained. 																								Goalkeeper Choi Eun-sun is the only World Cupper in the squad while Kim Eun-jung was in the Asian Games squad. Kim incidentally, is the current top-scorer for Taejon with eight goals in the K-League so far. Lee Kwan-woo is the main game maker in the team, according to a South Korean official, accompanying the team. 																								When asked about Holland coach Guus Hiddinks influence on Korean football, following the World Cup success, Choi said the players are now more organised and confident to face the worlds best. South Koreas fighting 2-3 loss to Brazil (in a friendly last Wednesday has spoken a lot about this change in attitude, he said. 																								Taejon usually play in the combined formations of 3-5-2 and 4-4-2.

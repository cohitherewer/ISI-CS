		 Friday, November 01, 2002 				 We can beat England 5-0: Warne
				 	 WARNE: Aussies red-hot favourites																								Sydney: Spin-king Shane Warne believes none on the current England cricket team is good enough to make Australias Ashes squad and is predicting a 5-0 series whitewash if the favourites fire.																								One shred of self-doubt in English minds is all it will take for Australia to crush England in the Ashes series, the outspoken leg-spinner told the Daily Telegraph. Labelling England a team unable to exert sustained pressure with either bat or ball, Warne said the Australians had the edge ahead of the first Test beginning in Brisbane November 7.																								There is absolutely no doubt in my own and every other Australian players mind that if we play to our ability we are man-for-man better than the English, he said.And for our part there is complete belief we have the form and mindset to beat England.																								In truth, if the question was would any England player get in the current Aussie team?, the answer would probably be no, he said.																								Warne said English players declarations that they would be competitive immediately says to me they dont believe they can beat us. 																								This time England are talking more positively, but if their attitude is not spot on they have no chance, he said. Warne said the only reason Australia failed to make a clean sweep of the last Ashes series was because they lost a Test due to bad weather, a brilliant innings from England batsman mark butcher and a sporting declaration from Australias stand-in captain Adam Gilchrist.																								He said Australia were the red-hot favourites for the upcoming series and would be looking to exert their dominance from the first session.																								If we play as well as we have been and execute our plans well to their batsmen we can win the series 5-0, he said.

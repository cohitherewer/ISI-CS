The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, September 06, 2002  Alsheim may amend failure 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: There being no outstanding runner in Fridays race-card, the competition is expected to be exciting in most of the six events. The main event,  the Balam Cup  in particular, may see a four-cornered contest among Arctic Fancy, Sky Command, Illustrious Reign and Alsheim. However, it is the last outing failed favourite, Alsheim who may come good with the light impost of 51 kg and in the hands of jockey S. Shanker. In the lower class, the Vijay Singh-trainee looked like in need of an outing thus performed below expectations with his topweight.Read as: Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, September 09, 2002 				 IBF headed for split
																								London: The International Badminton Federation (IBF) has been accused of making an attack on the womens game, something that could drag the governing body to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, it emerged on Sunday.																								The risk of a split between Asia and Europe has also arisen after the IBF council voted for a third different scoring system on the world circuit in little more than a year.																								A letter of protest from the European Badminton Union (EBU) and a threat from Canada, England, Australia and New Zealand to take the IBF to court are now being considered by the federations executive committee in Bangkok.																								After a decision on the scoring was deferred at the IBF annual meeting, president Korn Dabbaransi of Thailand, is said to have insisted upon it being taken by the council.																								The EBU, which is also disappointed about format changes to the Sudirman Cup, cites allegations from its member associations that whatever Asia says goes.																								They claim IBF decisions were taken without consultation.  (AFP)

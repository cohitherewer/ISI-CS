The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 08, 2002 				 Bagan likely to miss Bhaichung
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia has been all but ruled out of Mohun Bagans vital AFC Champions League away match against Taejon Citizen of South Korea to be played on Wednesday.																								Dr Vece Paes conducted a MRI scan on Bhutias troubled hamstring Thursday and though the report is expected Friday, it seems unlikely that the striker will recover in time from the injury sustained in the previous AFC Champions League match against Valencia of Maldives.																								Bhutias absence will put Mohun Bagan in trouble since the club has already registered 18 players for the away match including the striker. If Bhutia doesnt recover in time, the club will have to fly out with 17 men.																								Mohun Bagans home match against the Korean side will be played here towards the end of this month.																								Bagan-Tolly final																								Mohun Bagan will meet Tollygunge Agragami in the All Airlines Gold Cup final. They beat TFA 2-1 Thursday. Sunil Chhetri and Jose Ramirez Barreto scored for Bagan, while Periyar struck for TFA.

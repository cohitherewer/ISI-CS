		 Sunday, October 27, 2002 				 Goud shines on dull day
 							 - 3-day tie l Cuffy scalps four as Railways, Windies settle for draw				 	 Yere Goud: Well-crafted 107																								Pune, Oct. 26 (PTI): Yere Goud brightened up an otherwise dull day with a well-crafted century as the three-day tie between the West Indies and Ranji Trophy champions Railways petered out to a draw Saturday.																								Goud cracked a fine 107 before Railways fell for 402 in their first innings, 47 runs behind the West Indies score of 449 for eight declared. In the seven overs bowled, before play was called off half an hour before scheduled time, the West Indies managed 35 runs without losing any wickets.																								Goud faced 213 balls and hit 12 boundaries during his 278-minute stay at the crease before being the ninth man out. He held the Railways innings together after Cameron Cuffy had forced them on the backfoot with three quick wickets in the morning session. Goud stitched small but useful partnerships with nearly all the lower-order batsmen, taking the Railways score beyond the 400-run mark.																								Railways resumed at their overnight 179 for one and could add just 87 runs in the morning session which saw Cuffy dismiss Murali Kartik, Tejinderpal Singh and Jacob Martin in a fine spell of eight overs.																								Kartik, who rode on his luck to remain unbeaten on 72 yesterday, failed to add anything to his score and was clean bowled by the second ball from Cuffy this morning. His overnight partner Tejinderpal Singh progressed from two to 21 before being trapped leg before wicket by Cuffy. Tejinderpal Singh faced 31 balls in 42 minutes and hit three fours.																								The Railways, well-placed at 266 for four, then lost Jacob Martin before the lunch interval. Martin played a rash shot and was caught by Wavell Hinds at short covers off Cuffy after scoring five runs.																								The Railways regained their momentum after the lunch break and stepped up the gas with Goud doing the bulk of the scoring. Between lunch and tea, they added 104 runs to their total with Goud progressing from 34 to 89.																								Goud was a picture of confidence as he drove and cut with style. He was particularly impressive against Cuffy who was the pick of the West Indian bowlers, finishing with figures of four for 84. He reached his century shortly after the tea interval before becoming first of the two victims of leg-spinner Mahendra Nagamootoo, caught behind by Ridley Jacobs.																								This century is very special for me as I got it against a touring side which had a bowler of Cuffys pace, the 30-year-old Goud said after the match.																								The Railways innings ended thereafter with Kulamani Parida being clean bowled by Nagamootoo for two.																								Just seven mandatory overs were bowled in the West Indian second innings as play was called off about half an hour ahead of schedule. Wavell Hinds remained unbeaten on 22 with four fours while Chris Gayle was unbeaten on nine.

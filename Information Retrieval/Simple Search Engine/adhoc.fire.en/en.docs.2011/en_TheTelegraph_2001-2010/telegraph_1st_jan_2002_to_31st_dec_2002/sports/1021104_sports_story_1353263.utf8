		 Monday, November 04, 2002 				 Surya Sekhar closer to GM title
																								Bled (Slovenia): Led by a brilliant onslaught by Grandmaster K. Sasikiran and double GM norm holder Surya Shekhar Ganguly, India crushed the U.S. 3-1 and moved to joint eighth position with 20.5 points after the eighth round of the 35th Chess Olympiad Sunday.																								But the Indian women team went down to Bulgaria 1-2 after missing out on several winning chances.																								Russia scored their seventh victory in the Olympiad when they toppled Netherlands 2.5-1.5 to remain atop with 24 points and are followed by Hungary on 22.5 points. 																								In the womens section, Georgia (19) stretched its lead by two points defeating defending champion China 2.5-0.5. U.S. on 17 points shared the second spot while India were placed joint 13th with six more rounds to go.																								Sasikiran took a step ahead in establishing himself in the elite group with a well-crafted victory over Gregory Kaidanov on the top board. 																								Surya looks set to obtain his final GM norm as he has already scored 4.5 points in his six games so far.																								Playing white on the third board against GM Larry C. Hristiansen, Surya was up against a Caro Kann defence. 																								The middle game was fiercely fought after the players castled on opposite flanks in the classical set up and Surya was the first to obtain the breakthrough that opened up the kingside and made possible a dangerous navigation.

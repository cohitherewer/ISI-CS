The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, September 30, 2002 				 Indian board, Fica on same wavelength
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 DALMIYA																								Calcutta: There hasnt been any communication between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica), but the two are on the same wavelength.																								Its quite a development.																								While Fica has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to clarify the exact nature of its agreement with Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), the BCCI is set to call for the tabling of that very agreement at Tuesdays meeting of the IDI board, in Colombo.																								[The IDI is the business arm of the ICC, while GCC has marketing rights for all events till the 2007 World Cup.]																								According to The Telegraphs sources, the joint exercise is aimed at determining whether somebody unilaterally inserted unreasonable restrictions in the controversial Player Terms. And, if so, why?																								The BCCIs point of view will, of course, be placed by president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is already in Colombo. As for Fica, it has made a formal representation, signed by joint chief executive Tim May.																								Dalmiya (who was the ICC president till the tender-stage of awarding TV/marketing rights till 2007) wasnt available for comment, but well-placed sources pointed out that the BCCIs call will, in effect, be step No.1 towards a review of the terms.																								As one of the sources put it: If, according to the contract, the terms need not be so stiff, then it can quickly be re-drafted. Only when this bottomline is clear should the business of forming a committee(s) be contemplated.																								Incidentally, the mood will be known Monday itself, during the ICC executive boards meeting. After all, the same gentlemen  heads of the ten Test-playing nations plus three Associate nominees and key office-bearers  sit on the IDI board.																								As things stand, the ICCs sponsors (or commercial partners) arent inclined towards offering concessions  for the 2003 World Cup  on the lines of the on-going Champions Trophy.																								Meanwhile, speaking exclusively from Melbourne Sunday afternoon, May revealed the ICC has discriminated against the cricketers.																								For instance, while the teams sponsor isnt bound by the 30 days before and after (a tournament) clause on conflicting endorsements, the same concession isnt there for individual sponsors. Theres inequity, he remarked.																								May added that Ficas representation has essentially made three points (see box).																								Significantly, he confirmed the existing conflicting endorsement restrictions will hurt some Australians in the World Cup, besides obviously the top Indians.																								In fact, South Africas Jonty Rhodes, too, is going to have problems as his tie-up with Sharp clashes with one of the ICCs key sponsors  LG.																								It will, therefore, be foolish for the powers-that-be to look at the current controversy as being India-specific only.

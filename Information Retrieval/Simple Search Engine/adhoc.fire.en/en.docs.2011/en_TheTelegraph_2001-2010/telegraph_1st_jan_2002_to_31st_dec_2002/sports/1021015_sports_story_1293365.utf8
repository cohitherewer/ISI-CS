																								Madrid, Oct. 14 (Reuters): Real Madrids French midfielder Zinedine Zidane believes that with the addition of Brazilian striker Ronaldo the reigning European champions have put together a footballing dream team.																								No one would have believed it was possible to construct a side like this, the former World Cup winner told Spanish sports daily Marca on Monday. Not even in their wildest of dreams would anyone have thought that so many good players could appear together in one team.																								With Ronaldo, Zidane and Luis Figo on their books, the Real squad contains five of the last six winners of the Fifa World Player of the Year, while they can also boast of players of the calibre of Raul, Roberto Carlos and Fernando Hierro.																								Zidane believes that once Ronaldo recovers full fitness the team will be almost unbeatable.																								In his first game he (Ronaldo) scored two goals and he worked well for the team in the match at Seville. I dont think we could ask for any more, but when he is fully fit we will see what a really great player he is. When we are all 100 per cent fit it will be very difficult to stop us.																								The former Juventus player said he thought that Serie A side AC Milan would be the main threat to Real winning their tenth European Cup this season.																								Milan are the only team I can see on the same level as us in terms of great players. They have Rivaldo, (Andriy) Shevchenko, Rui Costa, (Filippo) Inzaghi, (Clarence) Seedorf...But I think we are more of a team than Milan.																								The French international went on to dismiss suggestions that after winning the European Cup with Real he had fulfilled his remaining footballing ambitions. 																								I am happy with what I have achieved so far. But I am not going to stop now. I want to win things again with France, help Real Madrid to a 10th European Cup and win the Spanish league.

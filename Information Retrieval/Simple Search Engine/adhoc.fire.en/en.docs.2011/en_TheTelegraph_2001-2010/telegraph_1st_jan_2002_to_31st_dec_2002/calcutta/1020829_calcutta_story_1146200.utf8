 															- Come Pujas, Howrah to get sport-cum-leisure destination with a personal touch SUBHRO SAHA																								Swimming and water sports; billiards tables and a disco; multi-cuisine restaurants and a fitness studio; air-conditioned guestrooms and a celebration of our heritage																								A rare Puja gift awaits residents of Howrah  a brand new clubbing destination with a personal touch, affordable, yet exciting. The Oasis Club, a 20-minute drive from Vidyasagar Setu on NH6, will open its doors in October to the people of the west bank. The sports-cum-leisure destination, where they can feel at home, is aimed not at the NRIs, but at Howrah residents who are starved of such an option near home.																								D.B. Ghosh of Kings Hotel and Resort, promoter of Oasis, is clear what the club has to offer and why: Our endeavour is to address the dreams and aspirations of the middle-rung, for whom there is virtually nothing in Howrah. 																								The 36-year-old entrepreneur has decided to branch out of his family business of iron-and-steel rolling mills to try and bridge a yawning gap in the largely-neglected twin city.																								Coming up on a four-bigha plot on the NH6, the first-phase construction of the British bungalows-style club complex, designed by architect Kingshuk Ghosh, is nearly complete. An adjacent 15-bigha waterbody, which is railway property, is being readied for boating and other water sports.																								The management is pegging entry fee at around Rs 40,000 to reach out to young professionals in Howrah and its hinterland. Support Act, the agency promoting membership, is keen to employ a strict screening to ensure there is no dilution of membership profile. The Oasis Club has earmarked a segregated area for walk-in guests, who will have access to its food-and-beverage section only.																								Phase-2 construction will commence immediately after the rains and is slated for completion in 15 months. There is a large catchment area in the form of residential clusters in Belur, Bally, Uttarpara, Konnagar, Hind Motor and Dankuni, besides the huge Jalan Industrial Complex in Jangalpur, just seven km from here, smiles Ghosh, who is looking at an optimum membership strength of 1,000 to begin with.																								Ghosh is also keen to host a steady stream of events to celebrate traditional festivals like Nabanna, Poila Boisakh and Poush Sankranti to give members a feel of our roots. Programmes linked to Bengals rich cultural heritage will bring celebrities to the club and give Howrah something to cheer about.

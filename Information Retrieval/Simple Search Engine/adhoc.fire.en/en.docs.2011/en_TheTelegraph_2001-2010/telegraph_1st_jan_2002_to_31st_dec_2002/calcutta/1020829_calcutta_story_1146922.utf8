 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 10 suspended at hospital
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The management of the AMRI- Apollo Hospitals on Wednesday suspended 10 workers, all members of the trade union owing allegiance to Intuc, the labour arm of the Congress, currently sponsoring an agitation over bonus at the south Calcutta hospital. 																								Chief executive officer Jose Verghese handed over the suspension letters to four of the workers and also moved the high court, seeking a directive against any agitation within 500 yards of the hospital. 																								The labour commission, on the other hand, has summoned the management and the agitating union to the discussion table on Thursday to thrash out the contentious issue of payment of bonus at the hospital.

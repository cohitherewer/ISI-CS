According to the police, 60-year-old Bally Thakur, a resident of Cossipore Road, was run over when two private buses on routes 204A and 42C were racing down Broad Street. Both drivers managed to flee with the vehicles. As news of the accident spread, about 250 people blocked traffic, protesting rash driving in the area. They damaged two other private buses. The blockade was withdrawn following police intervention. In another accident, Madan Mandal, 50, died when a bus on route SD4 knocked him down on Sahapur Road. No one was arrested.

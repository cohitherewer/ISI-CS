																								Shyama is a newly-wed bride who comes to her husbands house to live with her in-laws. She is clever and worldly-wise. The only weakness she has is her humongous appetite. The moment she eyes food, her greed is whetted and she loses control of herself. Contrary to the saying that God looks after the poor and the hungry, Shyamas appetite shocks even the village deity who stares at her unblinkingly in wonder and amazement as the bride devours food ravenously. From here starts a battle between two unequals: the immortal goddess and presiding deity of the village and Shyama. The goddess, in connivance with the brides weak husband, mean mother-in-law, a group of dacoits and villagers try to wreck havoc in Shyamas life but Shyama, with her ready wit and common sense, manages to counter and foil all moves and in the end she emerges victorious. This Sayak production is based on a Kannada folk-tale and is directed by Meghnad Bhattacharya. 																								When: Today at 3 pm amp; 6.30 pm																								Where: Bijon Theatre

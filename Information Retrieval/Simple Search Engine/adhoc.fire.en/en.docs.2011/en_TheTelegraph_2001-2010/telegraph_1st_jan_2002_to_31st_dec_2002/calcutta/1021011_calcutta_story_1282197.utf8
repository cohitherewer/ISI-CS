 Friday, October 11, 2002 				 Babys body on footpath
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Shock waves swept through Bangur Avenue on Wednesday afternoon after residents noticed streetdogs gathering around a bundle of torn newspapers near a local school. It was found that the newspapers hid the body of a month-old baby. The local police station was informed. Our officers recovered the body and sent it for post-mortem, said Bhabani Prasad Roy, officer-in-charge of Lake Town police station.																								The local Youth Congress alleged that a pair of foetuses, presumably dumped after abortion by local nursing homes, had been found on Bangur Avenue over the past month. Youth Congress leader Atin Roy led a deputation to the police station on Thursday and requested officials to intervene.

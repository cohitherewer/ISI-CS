 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who oversees police affairs, on Friday reshuffled about 30 senior officers in Calcutta and elsewhere in Bengal, throwing up a few surprises too. 																								One was the transfer of Partha Bhattacharya, high-profile inspector-general (IG) overseeing the CID, to the relatively less-weighty traffic department of West Bengal police, without change in rank.

Singh succeeds him. Joint commissioner Raj Kanojia has been appointed deputy inspector-general (CID), replacing V.V. Thambi. Thambi was appointed IG of the Intelligence branch (north Bengal). Present post-holder M. Khan was appointed IG (enforcement). 																								IG (western range) Jit Ram Bhagat, tackling the Peoples War and MCC in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, was appointed IG (railways), replacing R. Majumdar. Majumdar was appointed ADG (EB), replacing B.K. Sharma, appointed ADG (planning). DIG (presidency range) Gautam Chakraborty was appointed IG (western range), replaced by Vijay Kumar.																								DIG (operations) A.K. Ghosh was promoted as IG (welfare) and DIG (Midnapore range) was appointed DIG (railways). Superintendent of police, Bankura district, Basudeb Bag, was appointed SP of North 24-Parganas.

				 																																									EM Bypass is slowly becoming a den of vice after dark, as hoodlums, snatchers, robbers and drug peddlers terrorise the area. It is getting increasingly risky for people to drive without fear along that stretch after 9 pm. The authorities should arrange for police patrol after sunset. Safety measures will help check the rising crime. 				 																																									B.N. Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.				 																																									When I got off a taxi the other day, I left behind my bag containing my cellphone, keys, telephone diary and important papers. After about 2 hours, I received a call from the taxi driver, who had noticed my bag and located my number in my telephone diary. He promised to return my bag and true to his word, about another hour later, the taxi driver was knocking on my door. I cannot explain the surge of relief I felt at seeing all my things returned, intact. Sunil Dutta of Durgapur Lane has restored my faith in humanity and miracles. 				 																																									Chirantani Dey,				 																																									Picnic Garden.

				 																																									Some taxi complaint booths were set up a few years ago to help commuters, but harassment by taxi-drivers has not stopped. The situation gets worse in the evenings, when one has to wait for more than an hour to get a cab that is willing to go where one wants to. Most of the time the cabbies prefer to travel on routes of their choice. The complaint booths have lost their utility and the authorities should reactivate them.				 																																									Aparajita Dasgupta,				 																																									Address not given.				 																																									The drains in Woodburn Park and its adjoining areas are clogged and water that accumulates even after light rain takes a long time to recede.				 																																									S.S. Almal,				 																																									Address not given.

 Saturday, October 19, 2002 				 Rain rerun follows monsoon farewell
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Rain lashed the city again on Friday, a day after the official withdrawal of the monsoons. Alipore Met office sources said widespread light to moderate rain was likely in the city and the rest of West Bengal on Saturday, too.																								Deputy director-general of the Alipore meteorological centre R.N. Goldar said the rain was caused by low-pressure spread over Orissa, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal. The weather office recorded 37.8 mm of rainfall till 5.30 pm.																								The monsoons withdrew on Thursday and Fridays rain was not monsoon showers. There was an upper-air circulation over Chhattisgarh 1.5 km above sea level over the past two days. This gradually developed into a low-pressure trough, causing the rain, said Goldar.																								On Friday morning, some places in the districts received heavy rainfall because of the low-pressure zone. Harinkhola in Hooghly recorded 93 mm of rain, Suri in Birbhum 84 mm and Simulia in Purulia 73 mm. The average rainfall in the state was around 40 mm.																								The Met office chief said there was no immediate chance of a cyclone developing from the low pressure over Gangetic West Bengal because it is over land and not strong enough. To trigger a cyclone, low pressure has to form over the sea, said Goldar.																								The city woke up to dark skies on Friday and a downpour around 8.30 am led to waterlogging in many low-lying areas. There was more rain in the evening, flooding thoroughfares and triggering traffic snarls.																								n Picture on Page 16

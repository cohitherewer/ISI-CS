				 																																									A tea-stall has recently been set up at Tollygunge rail station in the Sealdah south section, blocking commuters passage to the ticket counter. Moreover, newspapers are pasted on the adjacent boundary wall and several people line up to browse them, adding to the problem. Those who want to reach the ticket counter have to wriggle their way out. It is strange that the railway authorities never realise this inconvenience to passengers.				 																																									Tapan Pal,				 																																									Batanagar.				 																																									A huge bust of Sri Ramakrishna was installed a few months ago at a triangular park in Kankurgachhi during a beautification drive by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. A toilet was also constructed in the park. Recently, some eateries have sprung up adjacent to the toilet, which is used mostly by truck-drivers. Moreover, the food stalls collect water from the taps in the toilet. How can the Corporation turn a blind eye to such unhygienic conditions? 				 																																									Diptimoy Ghosh,				 																																									Salt Lake.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, September 03, 2002 				 Dress to dare, but decently
				 				 																															To wear or not to wear that short skirt? Not is what most respondents to the Time to Talk question, Should students be allowed to wear whatever they want on campus?, had to say. Readers also felt that liberties should be granted, though decency should always be maintained. But who is to decide whether the hemline is too high or the neckline too low? Maybe, when we publish the rest of the letters next week, some light will be thrown on that, too.				 				 																															lIndia is a free country and students should be allowed to wear whatever they want. For girls there is one condition, though: eve teasing must be stopped first. It is not as though if a girl wears shorts, she will forget her cultural heritage. Wearing full-length clothing doesnt solve any problem, and wearing short skirts or shorts doesnt mean that ones academic performance will drop. Let girls be as free as the boys!				 				 																															Pratika Gupta				 				 																															Class X, Welland Gouldsmith				 				 																															lA dress code for students is the last thing one would expect. Clothes create the identity of a person. Every individual has his/her taste and preference and is comfortable in what he or she likes best. Obviously one does not expect boys or girls in shorts, so some decorum should be maintained.				 				 																															Anna Rozario				 				 																															J.D. Birla				 				 																															lStudents should be at liberty to wear whatever they want on campus. Dressing depends on individual tastes and preferences and this should not be circumscribed by any means.				 				 																															Udita Sen				 				 																															Gokhale College				 				 																															lCollege students can wear whatever they want on campus provided it is decent, without any display of vulgarity. But school students must have a uniform.				 				 																															Nandini Dasgupta				 				 																															lI really dont think mini-skirts and spaghetti-string tops should be allowed on campus. An educational institution is a place where students go to study. If any clothes are allowed, it will be hard to distinguish a college from a ramp. However, this doesnt mean girls should be barred from wearing clothes they are comfortable in, like jeans or trousers. Restricting the dress code to salwar kameez is as unacceptable as allowing skimpy dresses in college.				 				 																															Piali Dasgupta				 				 																															Class XII, Patha Bhavan				 				 																															lWhen students are in school, they should strictly stick to the school norms and be in uniform. But once they leave school, they should be allowed to wear what they want as long as they are decent.				 				 																															Vineeta Nair				 				 																															Class XII, Modern High School				 				 																															lIn a school, there are students from all communities and classes. If we allow students to wear whatever they want to, they will dress according to their own customs and tastes. This will defeat the very purpose of a school uniform, which creates a feeling of unity, irrespective of religion or social status. Uniforms highlight the fact that education imparts equality. Moreover, school years are formative years in a students life when he/she is taught moral values. So students should be taught to judge each other on merit, not on what clothing is worn.				 				 																															Ansul Goel				 				 																															Class XII, Don Bosco Liluah				 				 																															lIt is quite detestable and boring to wear the same old school uniform everyday. Students should be allowed to wear whatever they want on campus as their hip and vibrant clothing is refreshing for everyone. And if uniforms are mandatory for students, teachers should have uniforms too, shouldnt they?				 				 																															Shreya				 				 																															lStrict rules are not necessary, but decency is important. Clothes must cover the body properly. In India, traditional clothing has always stressed on decency.				 				 																															Moumita Rudra				 				 																															lI think liberalising the dress code will enable restricted students to be smart and vibrant in their outlook.

	 Animated gathering				 				 																															Disney for the destitute. That too at the Raj Bhavan. 				 				 																															On Saturday, Governors House was witness to a special screening of Walt Disneys forthcoming animation production Lilo amp; Stitch. About 260 children from three orphanages  Childrens Welfare Association (CWA), Dakshin Kolkata Sebashram and Disha Foundation  had come and the Brown Drawing Room on the first floor was abuzz with excited murmurs as they took their places on the sprawling carpet. 				 				 																															This is the first time a film is being screened at Raj Bhavan, said Arijit Dutta, distributor, Columbia Tristar. Such events will take place every three months. We will decide on the film in accordance with the age of the children coming. While todays group comprises those between five and 11, the next time if the age group is 12-15, the film chosen might be Treasure Planet, Disneys futuristic take-off on R.L. Stevensons Treasure Island, he added. 				 				 																															Saturdays bunch missed meeting the Governor as he had to fly off that morning on urgent business. Not that they were complaining. Anup Dhara, Shibshankar Patra and Anil Tanti were too busy checking out the chandeliers and the ornate chairs. Its just like a palace, isnt it? they whispered.				 				 																															Sormistha Biswas, who was co-ordinating the event on behalf of the NGOs, was busy finding places for them. Her worries were accentuated as one of the buses from Sarsuna, carrying the kids from CWA, was late. The film had already started when they trooped in. Another late-comer was Kusum Barui, from Navanir slum school, who had missed the bus in the rain and had to coax her mother to accompany her. 				 				 																															Ki re, bujhtey parchis (Can you make out whats happening) ? the teachers asked them during the intermission. Most nodded in confident affirmation. After all, they had been taking in their dose of He Man, Tom and Jerry and Mickey Mouse in the school common rooms. After some snacks in the Banquet Hall and a hasty exchange of notes on whether the big girl was Lilos mother or sister, they were back for the rest of the adventures of Stitch, the alien dog. 				 				 																															Its great to have a Governor who thinks differently. Whenever we propose something for a good cause, he is extremely enthusiastic. Last year, too, we had brought the children over for a magic show by P.C. Sorcar Junior, said Biswas. 				 				 																															At the end of the show, Lilo amp; Stitch T-shirts were handed out while the best student of each organisation was gifted a watch. And everyone had their share of fun on a day to remember.				 				 																
	 Tell-tale test				 				 																															Celebrating 125 years since its inception, the All India Anglo-Indian Association, Santragachhi branch, organised an Inter-School Story-telling Competition for students from Classes III to V.				 				 																															Being the first of its kind, the programme received an overwhelming response, witnessing a congregation of 27 schools from Howrah and Calcutta for the Frank Anthony Memorial Inter-school Story-telling Competition. Held at St Agnes Convent School, the chief guest was Neil OBrien, president of the All India Anglo-Indian Association. Superintendent of police, Howrah, Rajesh Kumar, was also present. All 54 participants grabbed the attention of the audience, with their humorous renditions or serious themes.				 				 																															The programme drew to a close with some kids dancing to You are my Sonia. Afterwards, the prize distribution ceremony saw National Gems Higher Secondary School walking away with the Best School award. As for the individual results, Soumi Das of National Gems stood first, closely followed by Shushman Choudhury of Calcutta Boys School and Surath Bhattacharya of Don Bosco Liluah. The participants list included Calcutta Boys, St Agnes Convent, St Aloysius, Frank Anthony, Don Bosco Liluah, Don Bosco Park Circus, La Martiniere For Boys and Girls, Loreto Bowbazar, St Thomas Kidderpore, Welland Gouldsmith School and Loreto House.

	 Chosen one				 				 																															Three cheers are in store for a name that features regularly in these columns. Sangeet Shirodkar, a student of Apeejay School, a Tiger reporter for The Telegraph in Schools, contributor for Young Metro and a former Star Spot, is on his way to ECPAT (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking) International General Assembly. Sanlaap, a Calcutta-based NGO that fights trafficking in South Asia, has nominated him for the Youth Board that is meeting alongside. Good luck to this guy with whirlwind energy, who also was awarded a certificate of honour for courage at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence on Saturday. He is the only one representing Asia at the Thailand meet for over 150 countries. Congratulations, Sangeet!				 				 																
	 Across borders				 				 																															Crossing borders was at the centre of discussions at the international seminar on The Asian-American Literary Experience at American Center last week. Organised by the American Literature Study Circle, it brought together experts from Bangladesh, Korea, Malaysia, Finland, the US and, of course, India, to deliberate on multiculturalism in literature, life and the other arts.				 				 																															Amitava Roy of Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) set the scene using The Telegraphs report on Gurbux Singh, Britains leading race relations campaigner. The Indian-born cricket-crazy Sikh had to resign after getting drunk with joy and misbehaving with cops after Indias win in the NatWest Trophy final at Lords. Despite having a British wife and being a rabid fan of the Wolverhampton Wanderers football club, Singh failed the Tebbit test for immigrants to Britain by rooting for Souravs men.				 				 																															 Aninda Basu Roy of Vidyasagar University pointed out how the 1990s border theory celebrated multi-cultural identities as opposed to the conventional melting pot theory where the immigrant has to give up his/her original culture to embrace the adopted countrys norms.				 				 																															The panel discussion on the second day brought up ways in which MNCs were exploiting a willing immigrant and Third World population, with emphasis on the software sector.				 				 																															Shubhabrata Bhattacharya of Jadavpur University revealed how Chinese-American writers like Amy Tan try to influence the film versions of their work while Subir Dhar of RBU fused theory with fun to give a provocative perspective on Indian and American political cartoons.				 				 																															The meet shed light on recent theories and problems of hyphenated identities.

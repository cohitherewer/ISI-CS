				 																																										lTrucks will be allowed to enter the city only after 11 pm from March, when the CMDA-constructed terminal at Kona, in Howrah, will be ready. The terminal will hold at least 180 trucks. Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said at Writers Buildings on Friday that truck operators were reluctant to shift office to Kona and the transport department had been asked to hold talks with them.				 																																										The necessary infrastructure, including space for offices, godowns, a drainage system, garbage disposal system, street-lighting, fire stations, a telephone exchange and a bank, is yet to be completed at the Kona complex. But by March, we will have bays to hold 180 trucks and truck operators will have to shift there, the minister added. There are plans to construct another truck bay, with a capacity to hold 180 more trucks. Bhattacharya spoke of government plans to shift business centres, like the Posta-Burrabazar belt, gradually to Kona and another proposed truck terminal at Dhulagarh, in Howrah. He said there was an 80-acre plot in Kona, where the government planned to build infrastructure for a new business centre.				 																																										A minor fire broke out in the office of fire services secretary R.K. Prasannan on Friday afternoon. Prasannan was not in when the condenser of a ceiling fan broke into flames. A portion of the false ceiling was damaged. Three fire engines reached the Secretariat but the blaze, by then, had been doused. 				 																																										The body of 25-year old housewife Reba Ghosh was found in her house in Baruipur on Friday. Police said she had been strangled. No arrests could be made.				 																																										S. Srinath Prasad, a miscreant, was arrested late on Thursday night near the Gobardanga railway station. Prasad spread terror in areas like Gaighata, Gobardanga and Swarupnagar, in North 24-Parganas. Police said heroin was found on Prasad, who was last arrested in 1994. Cases of illegal arms possession and murder are pending against him.				 																																										Three persons were killed at Uluberia, in Howrah, when a truck collided with a Maruti on Friday morning. Three more persons were injured, one critically, in the accident and admitted to the Uluberia sub-divisional hospital. Police said the collision took place at about 6.30 am at Amraberia, on National Highway 6, between an empty truck and the Calcutta-bound Maruti.				 																																										The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education will felicitate Madhyamik toppers on November 26. The first 20 rank-holders will be feted by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, said Board secretary Amar Patra. State higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty, school education minister Kanti Biswas and Board president Dibyendu Hota will attend.

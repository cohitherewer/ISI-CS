																								Umashankar Sharma is a Jaipur-based versatile and prolific artist of the Kishangarh (Rajasthan) gharana. Miniature painting is his forte and he has achieved a remarkable synthesis of traditional miniature painting style with elements of contemporary art to produce paintings of amazing beauty and rare charm. Sharma uses gold and silver leaves and rare pigments made from crushed semi -precious stones on hand-made papers to achieve a dazzle and a rare radiance that make his works so special. He has an eye for minute details and he applies colours with squirrel brushes to create delicate lines. Sharma depicts woman in all her grace and beauty, reproducing every turn of her head, every curve of her form, every glance of her eyes with a rare perfection. The current series depicts Rajasthans rural life, enlivened by use of vibrant colours.																								When: Till September 16; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery																								 Presidency Court, 55 Gariahat Road

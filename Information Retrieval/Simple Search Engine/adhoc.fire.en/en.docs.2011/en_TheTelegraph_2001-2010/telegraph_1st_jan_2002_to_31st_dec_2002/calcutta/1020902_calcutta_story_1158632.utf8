				 																																									lBowing to pressure from colleagues in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), mayor Subrata Mukherjee has reinducted Swadesh Bhattacharya, the civic bodys engineer-in-chief, into the CMDA. The post that Bhattacharya held for the past 11 months has been abolished. Municipal commissioner Debasis Som released Bhattacharya on Saturday. The CMC released me because it doesnt need me any longer. I was taken in because the civic leaders wanted the figurehead of an honest man. It is not possible for me to do what they expect me to do, said Bhattacharya on Sunday.				 																																									lThe driver was killed and six passengers were injured when the car they were in collided with a trailer at Uluberia at 4 pm on Sunday. 				 																																									lThe Howrah divisional office of LIC of India will celebrate Insurance Week, starting September 2.

 															- Post-graduate courses in games marketing and management A STAFF REPORTER																								In a bid to change the shoddy ways of sports administration in the country, the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM) is introducing special post-graduation courses in sport-business management from October-end.																								The course is being introduced for the first time in India, in association with a US-based university. 																								Institute officials feel that the specialised courses in sports management  one a two-month course and the second a more comprehensive 12-month diploma  are being introduced to shape future leaders.																								Sports has an economy of its own. It has high visibility and its impact is deep but, in India, it has never received its due. We need specialised people who can explore its commercial potential. The scope is definitely huge, prompting us to introduce this course in our institute, director Ashok Dutta told Metro on Monday.																								To begin with, the institute will start a two-month course on sports administration and industry to give students an idea of the multi-dimensional aspect of sports in modern society and tackle the expanding relationship between sports administration and commerce in India. 																								The 10-week programme will initially start with 30 students. The syllabus has been divided into four modules, which include a detailed relationship of sports and politics and the role of the media in the sports industry. 																								The session will include interaction with Olympian Leslie Claudius, P.K. Banerjee and the BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, among other leading personalities.																								The post-graduation diploma course in sports management, designed for qualified people to handle sports-related jobs, will, however, get underway early next year. We are collaborating with a top-notch American University on this, said Dutta.																								The syllabus for the 12-month course deals exhaustively on the theoretical, psychological and physiological values of sports. The students will be taught skills of commercial housework culture, with emphasis on sports marketing in India. 																								The faculty comprises leading national and international figures associated with the sports industry. We will have regular video conferences cutting across countries, which will provide students an insight into the sports culture of other countries, added Dutta.																								The course will also expose students to event management, contemporary trends and current issues in the sports industry, among other areas.

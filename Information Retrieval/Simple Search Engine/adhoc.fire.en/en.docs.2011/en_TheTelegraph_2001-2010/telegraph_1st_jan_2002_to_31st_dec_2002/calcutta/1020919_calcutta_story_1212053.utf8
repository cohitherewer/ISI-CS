The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 Kandahar agent aide held
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After eluding the police for the past eight months, Abul Hussain Gazi, 28, an associate of Mohammad Bilal, an ISI agent said to have links with the hijackers of the Indian Airlines flight to Kandahar in 1999, was arrested from Bhangore, in South 24-Parganas.																								According to Baruipur sub-divisional police officer Kallol Ganai, Gazi had rented a two-roomed house in Khatalia village, identifying himself as Babloo Ghosh, and had been living there for the past few months.																								It is a Hindu-dominated village and so Gazi had changed his name. He was staying there for the past seven months, said an officer of Bhangore police station.																								Police had gone to Bhangore last Friday to track down some criminals who had, apparently, taken shelter there and they landed a prize catch: Abul Hussain Gazi, alias Babloo Ghosh, from Hasnabad. 																								We initially detained Ghosh and interrogated him. The 28-year-old was a hard nut to crack and kept coming up with contradictory statements, Ganai said. But following sustained interrogation, he broke down on Tuesday and revealed his identity. The Bhangore police said Gazi even admitted his links with Bilal.																								A search of the house Ghosh, or rather Gazi, had rented did not reveal much but the police did recover two letters from his wallet, which could prove significant. Police later raided his Hasnabad house and claimed to have recovered incriminating documents on his links with the ISI and his association with Bilal.																								The papers pointed to his links with the ISI and revealed how he took orders from Bilal. Gazi runs a telephone booth, from where several calls had been made to London, Dubai and Sharjah, a CID officer said.																								On Wednesday, special superintendent of police Manoj Malaviya and his team took Gazi to Rajarhat for interrogation. North 24-Parganas police said Gazi was wanted in several cases in the Rajarhat and Hasnabad areas.																								The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has sought details on Gazi from city sleuths. Speaking to Metro over phone from Delhi, deputy inspector-general of police, special investigation cell, Loknath Behera, said the CID had alerted them about Gazis arrest on Tuesday evening.																								Behera said Bilal and Gazi were local operatives who are suspected to have organised fake passports and travel documents for the Kandahar hijackers.																								The CID and our local Calcutta unit have told us that Bilal and Gazi had helped two of the hijackers cross over from Bangladesh and proceed towards Nepal, a CBI officer in Delhi said.

				 																																									It is sad that the number of trees on most of our avenues have decreased remarkably. More trees should be planted on BT Road, Southern Avenue, Rashbehari Avenue, the EM Bypass and VIP Road, to make our city clean and green. Those who damage or cut down trees must be punished. 				 																																									Bhupen Bose, 				 																																									Dum Dum Park.				 																																									There is a growing menace of pickpockets operating on buses between Ballygunge Phari and CIT Road. These criminals, in groups of four or six, carry out their activities in half-empty buses. Passengers and conductors, often witness to such incidents, do not protest for fear of reprisals.				 																																									Name amp; address withheld.

 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 Trader murder in leather zone
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The body of a 27-year-old businessman, Mohammad Shamir, missing since Monday night, was recovered on Tuesday, chopped into seven pieces  each stuffed into a gunny bag and thrown into a ditch adjoining Bantala Road. The head is yet to be found.																								The detective department of the city police and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) are probing the murder of the Beniapukur-based leather trader. Two persons have been detained and one arrested, said special superintendent of police, CID, Manoj Malaviya.																								Mohammad Shamir used to run the family business, along with his three brothers. Family sources said they buy leather from Delhi and other parts of the country and supply the material to Topsia and Chinatown shoemakers.																								On Monday evening, Shamir had received a call from a business associate, who said a huge consignment of leather had arrived from Ghaziabad that he could come and pick up. Shamir was, apparently, asked to pick up Fermoz Ali, a broker, on his way to clinch the deal.																								The businessman took out Rs 1.5 lakh from the iron safe in his Jannagar Road house, wheeled out his motorcycle and told his brothers he would be back in a couple of hours. 																								When Shamir did not return till 11 pm, his brothers launched a hunt. Fermoz, too, did not return home, police said. 																								With no news about Shamir, his brothers lodged a diary at Beniapukur police station.																								Deputy commissioner of police, eastern suburban division, Sanjoy Mukherjee said the Beniapukur police tried to trace him, but failed.																								On Tuesday morning, the family received anonymous calls claiming that Shamir had been killed as he had refused to pay monthly protection money. A probe team reached Shamirs house to try and trace the call.																								At around the same time, the Beniapukur, Topsia and Tiljala police launched a joint combing operation. Acting on a tip-off, the police found Shamirs motorcycle near Park Circus. Two persons picked up for interrogation said Shamir was last seen on Monday night with Fermoz in a car, heading towards the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. Around 4 pm, Fermoz was arrested.																								Some local residents on Bantala Road, meanwhile, alerted Tiljala police about some bloodstained bags lying near an almost dry ditch. Police went to the spot to find the gunny bags stuffed with a human body chopped up into several pieces. 																								The head was nowhere to be found. Shamirs brothers were summoned to the spot and they identified the body.

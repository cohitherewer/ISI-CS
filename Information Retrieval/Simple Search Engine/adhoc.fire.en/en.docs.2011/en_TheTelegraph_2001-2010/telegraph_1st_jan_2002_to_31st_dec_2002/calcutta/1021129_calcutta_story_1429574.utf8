 Friday, November 29, 2002 				 Man mowed down by killer bus
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A private bus trying to overtake a government bus on Behala Chowrasta ran over Rabin Ghosh, 50, on Thursday morning. His wife, Subhadra, was seriously injured. Ghosh, a resident of Dakshin Behala Road, in Sarsuna, was a BSNL employee.																								The couple was waiting at the Behala Chowrasta bus stand. Ghosh was on his way to office and his wife had come to see him off as he was feeling unwell.																								A bystander, Sanjib Samaddar, and members of the local Sanghasree Club rushed the injured couple to hospital but Ghosh died on the way. Subhadra has been admitted to Vidyasagar Hospital in a critical condition.																								Immediately after the accident, a mob gathered on the spot and pelted stones to smash the windshields of passing vehicles, causing a major traffic dislocation on Diamond Harbour Road. The mob also blocked the road, adding to the chaos.																								When Shakil Ahmed, traffic inspector, South 24-Parganas, and Subhas Sen, officer-in-charge, Behala police station, went to the spot, they were surrounded by the mob, which demanded that the killer bus driver be rounded up. 																								Local residents complained that the four-point intersection was turning increasingly congested, in the absence of proper traffic regulations. Accidents are becoming a regular affair, they alleged. 																								They also complained that rash auto-rickshaw drivers, mostly unlicensed, were responsible for the traffic snarls and mishaps in the area. We shall take care of that, inspector Ahmed assured the crowd.

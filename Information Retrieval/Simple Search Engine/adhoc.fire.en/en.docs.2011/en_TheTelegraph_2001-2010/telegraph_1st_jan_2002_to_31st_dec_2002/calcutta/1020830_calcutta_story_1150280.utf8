 Friday, August 30, 2002 				 Minister push for AMRI truce
 A STAFF REPORTER																								State health minister Surya Kanta Mishra has asked the AMRI-Apollo Hospital management to resolve the contentious issue of payment of bonus to the workers through dialogue.																								However, he ruled out direct mediation by the government, saying that the labour commission was equipped to handle the case.																								Mishras statement comes a day after the Intuc union approached all unions and leaders, cutting across party lines, for help.																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed the union to restrain activities to a few metres outside the hospital premises. The court also directed the police to keep round-the-clock vigil. The management wanted us at least 500 yards away from the hospital, but the court has given us permission to carry on peaceful activities, said the Intuc working president Ramen Pandey.																								The union, while demanding the lifting of suspension orders on 10 workers, will continue to press for bonus for the years when AMRI made profits.

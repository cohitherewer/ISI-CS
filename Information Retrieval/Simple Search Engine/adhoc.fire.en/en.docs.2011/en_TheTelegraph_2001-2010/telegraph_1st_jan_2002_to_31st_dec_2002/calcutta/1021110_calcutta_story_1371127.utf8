 Sunday, November 10, 2002 				 Proxy votes rule garden berth battle
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Saturdays elections at the Agri-Horticultural Society of India (AHSI) in Alipore sent three new faces to the executive council.																								As there were no contestants for the posts of president, senior vice-president and vice-president, Sujit Chakraborty, H.P. Kanoria and Alka Bangur were selected automatically as the office-bearers, and the entire focus of the election drama revolved around the 12-member executive council.																								Preceded by a month-long campaign, which saw Calcuttas business barons levelling allegations against each other, this years election was shrouded with controversy. From financial irregularities to malpractice in the election process  charges and counter-charges flew thick and fast as some of the members took to firing open letters to fellow-members. The most significant of them was penned by S. G. Khaitan, one of the three patrons of the Society, where he talked of the highhanded and inefficient running of the Society. AHSI president M.K. Jalan and finance committee chairman B.P. Bajoria refuted the charges and reported their version of the story in another letter.																								Things reached such a pass that heavyweights like R.P. Goenka and B.M. Khaitan, the other two patrons of the Society, had to intervene. In an open letter, they urged all AHSI members to stop bickering and work towards the betterment of the Society.																								In a last-minute development, M.K. Jalan, immediate past president, pulled out of the race for executive council, citing personal reasons.																								This years election recorded the highest number of proxy votes  over 600  in the history of the 182-year-old Society. Only 250 members were physically present to cast their votes.																								The new members of the council are Deoki Poddar, Govind Kejriwal and B.K. Nahata. The other nine are S. K. Birla, Gaurav Swarup, P.B. Ghosh, B.D. Bose, S.K. Pal, S. Guha Niyogi, N.G. Khaitan, P. Gupta and M.K. Saharia.

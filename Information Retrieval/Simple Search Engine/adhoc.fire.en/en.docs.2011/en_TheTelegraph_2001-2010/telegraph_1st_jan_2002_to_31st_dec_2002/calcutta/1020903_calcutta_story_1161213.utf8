The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, September 03, 2002 				 Shot dead on the road
 															- Cops see love triangle as motive for killing A STAFF REPORTER																								Two goons intercepted a 28-year-old youth on a crowded street in the Metiabruz area, fired at him from point-blank range and vanished from the scene before anyone could react. 																								The youth, Kartik Mandal, died almost instantly. No arrests have been made till late on Monday.																								Nearly 24 people witnessed the two-minute episode, but neither mustered up the courage to chase the killers or even inform the police about the shootout. 																								Mandals killing is a rerun of the murder of another youth in south Calcutta four days ago. In that incident, at least 25 people were silent spectators to the killing of Rajkumar Paswan on a crowded road in the Hazra area. Paswans killers are still at large.																								According to the police, Mondays incident took place around 1.30 pm, when Mandal was returning home on his bicycle. Preliminary investigation reveals that the shooting is a fall-out of a triangular romance. Mandal, of late, was involved with a woman, whose lover allegedly ordered the killing, said Rajesh Kumar Singh, additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas. 																								One of the witnesses, on condition of anonymity, said: Mandal was cycling down Fatehpur Road, in Metiabruz, when the two youths intercepted him. As Mandal got off his cycle, one of the killers took out a country-made revolver and shot him dead. 																								Nearly 24 people watched in horror as Mandal slumped on the street, but no one took him to a hospital. The two assailants, meanwhile, fled the scene. We rushed to the spot after receiving a telephone call. Mandal was lying on the street when we reached the spot. Blood was oozing out of his chest. His life could have been saved if someone had rushed him to a hospital nearby, said an officer.																								Police took Mandal to SSKM Hospital. While we were on the way to the hospital, our sleuths questioned witnesses for the name of the killers. Mandal was dead by the time we reached SSKM, said the official.																								Police, meanwhile, have stumbled upon facts that Mandal and a man named Deepak Gupta had been at loggerheads over a woman. 																								It seems Gupta masterminded the killing, as Mandal had fallen in love with his paramour. We raided Guptas house, but he had escaped before we could reach the area. We are also trying to locate the woman, Guptas family members and friends. The hideouts in and around Metiabruz are being raided. We have also informed the city police in this regard, said Singh.

 Sunday, October 27, 2002 				 Cops seek raise in tax
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Faced with severe funds crunch, the Calcutta Police has sent a proposal to the state government requesting it to raise taxes on hotels, restaurants and similar establishments in and around the city.																								This is our first attempt in 24 years to mop up additional revenue, additional commissioner of police Kiriti Sengupta said on Saturday. Taxes may be doubled or even trebled, depending on the approval of the finance department, he added.																								According to him, additional taxes may net Rs 35 lakh in annual revenue. Revenue earnings, as a result, may reach Rs 1 crore from the present Rs 65 lakh.																								Calcutta Police collects taxes from tea and coffee shops, beer and foreign liquor shops, hotels and restaurants. During the financial year 2001-2002, taxes from such establishments amounted to almost Rs 65 lakh. 																								If taxes are hiked, Western-style hotels will pay Rs 3,000 a year instead of the present Rs 1,000 while foreign liquor shops will have to cough up five times the present rate of Rs 300.																								The police will also build up a database on trading activities of shops based on surveys in every police station area.

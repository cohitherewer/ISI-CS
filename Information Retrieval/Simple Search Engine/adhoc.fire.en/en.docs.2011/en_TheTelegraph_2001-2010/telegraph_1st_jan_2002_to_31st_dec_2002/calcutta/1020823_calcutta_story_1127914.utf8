 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 9-mm pistol for VVIP security
 OUR BUREAU																								Faced with increased threat from separatists, the police have decided to replace the obsolete revolvers of security guards of ministers and VVIPs with sophisticated 9-mm pistols. Police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty said the police have procured several 9-mm pistols.																								We have decided to allot the sophisticated weapons on a priority basis. The special branch has made a list of ministers and VVIPs who are high on the hit-list of militants. We have decided to equip the security guards of these VVIPs with 9-mm pistols, Chakraborty said. Policemen are being trained to fire these sophisticated weapons. 																								Police, quoting their internal assessment report, said KLO, Naxalites, PW and ISI-backed militants can strike in the city any time and any moment. 																								Deputy commissioner of police, special branch, Gaurav Dutt went to Writers Buildings on Thursday and reviewed the security of ministers, particularly those from north Bengal. More than a dozen ministers were present. Dutts visit is significant because intelligence agencies sent a report on Wednesday evening that militants might target ministers and VVIPs in the city.																								Dutt met ministers to get a feedback on the threat perception from them. He sought our permission for deploying policemen who can handle 9-mm pistols, said a senior minister from north Bengal. Another minister asked Dutt about the possibility of militants infiltrating the city.																								A senior special branch officer said: There are unconfirmed reports that three members of the KLO action squad have stayed in the south Calcutta residence of a sympathiser while on their way to north Bengal from Delhi last month. copy;  Copyrights 2002.

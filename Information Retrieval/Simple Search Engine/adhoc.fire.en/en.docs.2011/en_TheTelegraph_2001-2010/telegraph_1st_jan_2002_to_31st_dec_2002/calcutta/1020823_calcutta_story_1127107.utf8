				 																																									Measures to check pollution in the city are not being taken in earnest. Calcutta has already lost a huge amount of greenery, thanks to the highrise boom. Moreover, several waterbodies in and around the city are choked with litter, mostly plastics. The green fields, across Red Road, do not seem to be maintained either. A lot of refuse can be found strewn all around. Why doesnt the Corporation conduct a cleanliness campaign? If the civic body is short of manpower, it can invite schools and NGOs, which will willingly participate.				 																																									Sumant Poddar,				 																																									Kyd Street.				 																																									Recently, I had gone to a cinema hall at Esplanade with a friend. Along with many others, we stood in the queue in front of the counter selling current tickets. Then, all of a sudden, the counter closed and a few scalpers emerged with bunches of tickets. The passes were selling fast at high rates. All this was happening in the presence of some policemen nearby. They were absolutely indifferent to the unlawful activities.				 																																									Arindam Basu,				 																																									Birati. copy;  Copyrights 2002.

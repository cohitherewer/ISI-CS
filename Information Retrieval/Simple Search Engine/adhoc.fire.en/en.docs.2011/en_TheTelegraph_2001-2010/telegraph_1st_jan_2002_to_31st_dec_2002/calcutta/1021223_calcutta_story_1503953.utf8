The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, December 23, 2002 				 Kutte
																								This is the story of an urban youth who gets a salesmans job, canvassing consumer products. He is deputed by his company to a mofussil town. Out of sheer desperation to get used to the unfamiliar, alien surrounding where he is destined to stay on, the youth uses all possible ways to keep his monotony and boredom at bay. There the youth encounters his helper. The play is also about this wise-crack all-time companion-cum-assistant of the youth, a local worldly-wise know-all guy who learns a few lessons of life himself as he delivers his sermons to the gullible city-bred youth. Finally, the play focuses on the youths encounter with a woman, a widow from a feudal, high-brow family who staunchly believes that her husband has been reborn as a stray dog. Her firm belief in her husbands new avatar as kutte leads to a disaster. Being staged today in the city as part of Nandikars 19th National Theatre Festival, this bantering satire, originally written in Marathi by renowned playwright Vijay Tendulkar, has been translated in Hindi by Sushma Bakshi and directed by Jayadev Hattangady. A Kalashray, Mumbai production.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

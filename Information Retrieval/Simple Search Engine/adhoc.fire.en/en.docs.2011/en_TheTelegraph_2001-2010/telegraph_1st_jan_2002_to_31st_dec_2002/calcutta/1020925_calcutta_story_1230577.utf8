The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, September 25, 2002 				 																				satabdi roy								Actress																																							It is good to know that a senior film-maker like Yash Chopra has offered to help Tollywood on behalf of the Mumbai film industry. But to make a film count at the box-office we have to make good films, like he does. Of course, marketing ideas and finances are welcome. Chopra, for instance, takes his unit to Switzerland and the US for every song sequence while our reach is till Digha or Falta. This difference shows in the picturisation. Again, Tollywood would do well to adopt the deft distribution system of Bollywood. I, for one, feel that instead of leaving a film to just one distributor, the territories should be divided among many.

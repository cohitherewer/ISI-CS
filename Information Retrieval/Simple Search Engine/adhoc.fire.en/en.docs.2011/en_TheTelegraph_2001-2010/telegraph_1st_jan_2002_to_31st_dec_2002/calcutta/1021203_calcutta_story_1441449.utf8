The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, December 03, 2002 				 Into a surreal world
																								Azure sky, greenery all around, undulating plains, virgin territory, an utopian world  dont they sound cliche  lines from an ad jargon? Well, almost surreal in nature, these are the places we crave to go back to, but harsh reality reminds us these are snap-shots from a world we have willingly given up for acquiring a modern and luxurious lifestyle. Bhootnath Pal is far removed from this materialistic, urban lifestyle. This long-forgotten but extremely talented artist/teacher had the privilege to learn the basics of art from the very pillars of Bengal School of Art, including Nandalal Bose, Abanindranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baiz and Binode Behari Mukhopadhyay. He began his career as an art teacher at Bolpur High School. He also published essays on child art and use of folk art for social uplift. Meanwhile, he painted prolifically which were exhibited at various shows. His works in the past five decades have been varied both in form and content. The rarh (red soil region) land of Birbhum stirred his creativity. He was also influenced by the folk and ethnic symbolic art of the region that keep appearing in his works time and again in their most undiluted form. A feeling of nostalgia hangs heavy when viewing his works.																								When: Till December 7; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

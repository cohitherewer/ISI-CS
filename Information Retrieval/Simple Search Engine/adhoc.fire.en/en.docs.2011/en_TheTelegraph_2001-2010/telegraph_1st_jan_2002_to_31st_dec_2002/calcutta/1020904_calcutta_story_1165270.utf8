 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 Guardians demand fee-hike rollback
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Teachers of Anglo-Indian schools demanding their dearness allowance. A Telegraph picture																								Protesting the recent fee hike, parents of Calcutta Boys School students under the banner of the Guardians Forum of Anglo-Indian Schools staged a demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the institution on S. N. Banerjee Road. 																								The agitators met the school authorities and demanded immediate fee reduction. Later, the demonstrators left when the authorities assured them that they will review the revised fee.																								Guardians of 15 top schools of the city formed a forum last Saturday. Tuesdays agitation was part of their programme against the unjustified fee hike. Calcutta Boys School authorities hiked the school fee to Rs 1,040 from Rs 560 from April this year.																								Champak Bhowmik, one of the guardians who participated in Tuesdays demonstration, said: Todays programme was the first step of our movement. Only 200 of the 1,600 students attended classes while the parents of rest of the pupils supported our stand. 																								Right now, we have no plan to organise any more demonstrations as the school authorities assured us that the fee will be reviewed, added Chakroborty. The forum has lined up a string of protest programmes.																								Today, the school authorities told us to keep paying the revised fee till the final decision is made. But we did not agree, added Chakroborty.																								The fee was raised after the government reduced the funds allocated to the Anglo-Indian school in the form of dearness allowance. It is true that DA has been slashed by the government. But why should we guardians suffer? said Montu Pal, convener of the forum.																								Guardians of Our Lady Queen of Mission School in south Calcutta, too, submitted a petition to the authorities demanding a rollback in the fee hike.

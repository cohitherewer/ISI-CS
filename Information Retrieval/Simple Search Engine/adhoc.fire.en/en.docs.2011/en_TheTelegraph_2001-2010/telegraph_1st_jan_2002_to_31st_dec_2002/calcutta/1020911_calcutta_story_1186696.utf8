The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, September 11, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									Some English-medium schools in the city try to shift a substantial amount of their financial burden on to the guardians. A reputed school in central Calcutta has recently asked its students to deposit their tuition fees at a public sector bank, along with a service charge of Rs 101. Besides, students have been directed to buy books from a shop near the school. Even the uniforms have to be purchased from a particular shop. The school, apparently, receives a hefty commission from all these outlets. The state government is perhaps not aware that these are alternate ways chalked out by schools to make up for the dearness allowance slash.

The area surrounding Howrah station remains filthy most of the time due to irregular conservancy services. The road leading to the Howrah bridge is partially blocked with litter. The condition of the vegetable market is even worse. The Howrah civic body should address these problems.				 																																									Manoj Jhawar,				 																																									Howrah.

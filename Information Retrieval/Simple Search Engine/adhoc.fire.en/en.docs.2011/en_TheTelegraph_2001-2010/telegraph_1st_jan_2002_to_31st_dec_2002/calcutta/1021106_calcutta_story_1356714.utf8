																								The name of the play is a take-off from Sankha Ghoshs poem which centres around an ordinary girl, middle class girl who tries to mould herself according to the tenets of society but despite her sincere efforts she fails to find a foothold. She hankers for love and acceptance but finds none. Her woe is compounded by the birth of her baby, a daughter. Branded a misfit, rejection compels the girl to take the extreme step and she drown her baby and then herself  for the convenience of society and to free herself and her daughter from the indignity of a menial existence. And life goes on. This play tries to document contemporary events using material from art and literature as evidence. Debika, the solo performer of this play, etches various facets of women as reflected in Bengali poetry written in the last phase of the 20th century and the beginning of this century. In this production, woman is not portrayed as the archetype victim. Rather, the play traces a girls gradual transformation into womanhood, the real woman of substance. A Manirath production.																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: Mukta Angan

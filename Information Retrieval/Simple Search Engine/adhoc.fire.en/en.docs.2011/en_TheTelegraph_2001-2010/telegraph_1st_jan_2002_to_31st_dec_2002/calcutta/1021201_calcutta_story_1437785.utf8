 Sunday, December 01, 2002 				 CPM rings self-test bell
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Alarmed at the steady erosion of its support base due to a loss of ideals among party workers, the CPM on Saturday began an exercise to monitor the organisational performance of its cadres through mandatory self-assessment reports.																								All members, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, will be required to fill up the self-appraisal forms after every three months and send them to the headquarters for scrutiny, said CPM state secretary Anil Biswas on Saturday.																								Forms will be sent to party members from January 2003. Biswas explained that the move would help the party consolidate its political, ideological and organisational bases. The feedback will help us spruce up our act, he added.																								Biswas denied that the move was aimed at activating the organisation for the forthcoming panchayat polls. According to him, the practice of self-appraisal through such forms is nothing new. The move was implemented earlier in the districts, but not in a comprehensive manner. Now we plan to launch the process across West Bengal, he added.																								Death sparks roadrage																								A mob set a bus on route 239 ablaze on Saturday after a 51-year-old man, Shanti Sarkar, was run over by another bus on the same route on Beleghata Main Road. The driver and the helper fled but the vehicle was impounded. Firemen reached the spot with three fire tenders. By then, the bus was charred. Locals blocked the road for half-an-hour to protest rash driving.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, December 21, 2002 				 Kidnap key accused held
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Three years after the kidnapping of Exide chairman S.B. Ganguly and city businessman Sajjan Jalan, the special operations group of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) picked up Umesh Singh, a key accused in the two cases, from a house in Patna late on Thursday.																								Bihar director-general of police R.R. Prasad said on Friday that the special task force of the Bihar police had been coordinating with the Bengal CID to arrest Singh. We have already handed him over to them, Prasad told Metro over phone from Patna.																								Special superintendent of the CID and head of the special operation group Manoj Malaviya said Umesh, Ajay Singh and Ashim Singh had come to Calcutta to kidnap Ganguly and Jalan. The detective department of the city police, with the help of the CID, had subsequently arrested Ajay and Ashim from a Gaya hideout, but Umesh had given them the slip.																								A source in the Bihar underworld alerted the CID on Wednesday afternoon that Umesh was expected to visit a house in Patna to meet his associates. Umesh reached Patna from Gaya on Wednesday morning. He met his associates to chalk out future operations. Our mole was present, too. Once he was sure that Umesh would stay put in the hideout for the next couple of days, he rung us from a public call office, said Malaviya.																								CID officers reached Patna and alerted the local police and officers of the Special Task Force. They planned the operation on Thursday morning and decided to storm the hideout in the evening. Umesh was caught unawares. He did not put up any resistance, police said.																								According to information reaching Calcutta, the CID team will leave Patna for the city late on Friday. CID sources said Umesh hails from Gaya, but is constantly on the move. He had also built up a good network in Calcutta.																								We had been trying to track him down with whatever information we were getting about him, but were unsuccessful. Early this year, while acting on a tip-off that Umesh would be in a Patna hideout with his girlfriend, we raided the place, a CID officer said.																								Umesh slipped away, but the officers managed to nab a key associate. We told the goon that the police would set him free if he helped us find Umesh. The CID even offered to pay him for his services. We sent officers from Calcutta regularly to Patna to keep in touch with the informer, the officer added.

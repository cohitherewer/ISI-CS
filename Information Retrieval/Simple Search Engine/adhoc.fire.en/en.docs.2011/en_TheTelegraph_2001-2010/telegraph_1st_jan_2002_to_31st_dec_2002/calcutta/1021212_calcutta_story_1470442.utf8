The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, December 12, 2002 				 In fond remembrance
				 				 				 			To commemorate the 60th birth anniversary of Ananda Shankar, his companion of many years, Taufiq Qureshi and Tanusree Shankar pay tribute through a ballet, Uddharan and a special percussion item. Uddharan or uplift is inspired by a shloka (verse) from the Bhagvad Gita: Uddharate atmanah atmaanam. In other words, the uplift of a mans soul is in his own hands and if he wants, he can achieve it. This ballet envisages mans journey, his various experiences  his adventures and misadventures as he treads on a perilous path to uplift his soul, constantly aware and at war with the conflicting forces of vice and virtue and his need to choose between them. Ananda and Taufiq had created some haunting compositions many decades ago. I felt the need to revive some of them through Uddharan and Taufiqs pieces like Prateeksha, said Tanusree Shankar. Uddharan is the recipient of the West Bengal governments Uday Shankar Award for 2002.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Kala Mandir

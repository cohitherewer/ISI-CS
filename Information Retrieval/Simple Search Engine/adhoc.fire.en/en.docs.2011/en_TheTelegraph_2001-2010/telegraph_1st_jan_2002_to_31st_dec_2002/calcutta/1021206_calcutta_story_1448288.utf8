																								Manchageeti Chitrageeti: Shatabdir Anusriti (Theatre song and film song in the reflection of a century) is a unique, multi-media stage production that portrays the parallel trends of musical compositions of theatre songs (manchageeti) and film songs (chitrageeti) of different decades of the 20th century. The show documents how Bengali theatre, with its very own spectacles, melodramas and panoramas, influenced and led to the pioneering work in the sphere of Bengali films right from the beginning of the last century from such early works as Hiralal Sens Alibaba (1901) to recent works like Satyajit Rays Ghare Baire. Extensive research on recordings, notations, prompt books and clippings enrich this documentation that offers an exciting and altogether original view of artistic transition between media. It is a major retrospective of the songs of different genre, tracing the evolution of vision and craft. This multi-layered historical framework presents a grand narrative that puts independent musical compositions in their places, allowing for many thematic traits through recurring motifs and images. Conceived and created by Academy Theatre, the show features Riddhi Chattopadhyay, Devajit Bandyopadhyay, V. Balsara and Koushik Sen.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

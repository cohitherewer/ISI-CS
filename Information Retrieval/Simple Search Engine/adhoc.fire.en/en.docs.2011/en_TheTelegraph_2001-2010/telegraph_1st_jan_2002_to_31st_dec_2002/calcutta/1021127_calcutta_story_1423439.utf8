The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, November 27, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									It has often been observed that the tram track which runs by the west side of the CSTC garage, leading from the north (by the side of Bidhan Chandra Hawkers Corner) and enters the Esplanade tram depot after crossing Rani Rashmoni Road, is often used by private buses and taxis to take a short cut. This track is not meant for vehicular traffic. Nor was it meant for this purpose. Policemen posted there do not bother to book these vehicles. Will the CTC authorities look into the problem?

The importance of planting trees in a congested city like Calcutta cannot be exaggerated. But it is a matter of regret that during the last decade or so, the CMC is not planting enough trees. I recollect how saplings were planted in north Calcutta in the Seventies and Eighties. Most of the trees have long died and only the empty cages remain. The CMC can even involve students in tree plantation programmes.				 																																									Rabindranath Kar,				 																																									Vidyasagar College.

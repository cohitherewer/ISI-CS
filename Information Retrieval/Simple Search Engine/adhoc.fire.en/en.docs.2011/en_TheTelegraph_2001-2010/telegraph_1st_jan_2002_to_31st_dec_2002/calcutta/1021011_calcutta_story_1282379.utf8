Those whose names did not figure in the lottery turned the heat on Hidco officials and even tried to smash the computers. One person was arrested and the lottery stalled. Officials will announce the next date of the lottery soon.				 																																										The state government has decided to instal solar water heaters in all medical colleges and district hospitals in a bid to reduce electricity bills. The first such unit will be installed at SSKM Hospital on Friday. Every day, 200 litres of hot water at a temperature of 95 degree Celsius will be available from the unit, which is the first of its kind in eastern India. The hospital need not pay for this, said S.P. Gon Chowdhury, director, West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 A small song ... 
																								An older woman, giving advice to her daughter-in-law, says, Meanness is the only thing that keeps me alive... Sounds like an incredible confession straight from the heart? Thats the way Ron Price writes. Price is an American poet and currently the Poet in Residence at Julliard School, New York. In a special poetry-reading session, being jointly hosted by Srijan and the US Consulate General, Calcutta, Price will share his thoughts and works with like-minded people. Author of Surviving Brothers and A Crucible for the Left Hand, Prices most recent collection, A Small Song Called Ash from Fire, is a fiercely honest work drawn from his experience of living in the South. Rich with life, death and redemption, his poems are loaded with vivid imageries. He skillfully utilises found poetry, or moments stripped bare that would have gone unnoticed had the poet not been there to record them. The open-to-all interaction session with Price will be followed by a violin and guitar duet recital by Georges Lindenmeyer and Anup Dasgupta. 																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Srijan, Roof-top, 																								 176, Sarat Bose Road

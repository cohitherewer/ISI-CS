 Wednesday, November 06, 2002 				 Trio held for rape frame-up
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After two years of fighting the police and criminals, who had framed his 11-year-old son Sonu in a rape case, Uday Kant Thakur finally got justice. Three people were arrested this week in connection with the case.																								Earlier, Thakur and his family were hounded by the criminals, owing allegiance to two promoters, who wanted the family to move out of its Raynagar residence, near Regent Park. 																								Later, Thakur lodged a fresh complaint with deputy superintendent of police (Town) Subhankar Chatterjee and special inspector-general (Presidency Range) Gautam Chakraborty, who arrested the trio during raids in the city. The trio was involved in several cases of extortion too. A hunt is on for two more persons, said Chatterjee.

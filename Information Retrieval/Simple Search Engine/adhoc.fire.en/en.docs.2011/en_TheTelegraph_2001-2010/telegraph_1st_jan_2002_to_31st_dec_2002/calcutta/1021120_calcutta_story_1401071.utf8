 A STAFF REPORTER																								Biswajit Mandal, a six-year-old boy returning home after buying a packet of biscuits, was crushed under the front wheels of a private bus in Baranagar on Tuesday. The boy was running away from a dog that had tried to get at the biscuits.																								The local police managed to round up the bus driver and impounded the killer vehicle. Residents of the area put up a roadblock to protest rash driving, stalling traffic for over an hour.																								Later, the blockade was lifted when the police assured the agitators that a traffic constable would be posted in the area as soon as possible. 																								M. Harisena Verma, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, said the accident occurred around 10 am on Deshbandhu Road, in the Baranagar police station area. Biswajits parents sent him to a nearby grocery shop to pick up a packet of biscuits. After buying it, he was walking toward his house  a few metres from the shop. When Biswajit came out of the shop, a stray dog started barking at him. The scared child began to run. The dog, too, chased him. Apparently, the animal was drawn to the smell of the biscuits, said an officer of Baranagar police station.																								The boy started running across the road without bothering to check if the road was clear or not, Ratan Dhar, a local resident, told police. Suddenly, Biswajit stepped in front of the private bus on the Barasat-Dakshineswar route. The driver slammed the brakes but before he could stop the vehicle, the boy was crushed under the front wheels. He was taken to a local hospital, where the doctors pronounced him dead, said Verma.																								Local people rushed to the spot and collared the driver. They demonstrated on the spot where the accident had occurred. Later, policemen from Baranagar thana reached the spot and arrested the driver. Police requested the demonstrators to lift the roadblock. Local people said shanties and shops that had come up along Deshbandhu Road made it narrow. Besides, some truck-drivers use the road as a shortcut to reach BT Road. Rash driving has claimed four lives here in the past two months, said Nilratan Samanta, a resident.																								nDelhi flight delayed: A flight to New Delhi was delayed over the missing baggage of a tourist. The Belgian national misplaced his bag, containing important documents and Rs 75,000 in cash, at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport on Tuesday. Later, a CISF team, led by deputy commandant D.K. Dasgupta, located the bag and returned it to the owner.

				 HONING SCALPEL:An operation  at suraksha,soon for students eyes 				 																																																																				 Apropos the report Delhi boards read review script, published in Metro on November 11, it is really interesting to note that the ICSE authorities are considering the feasibility of a review of answer-scripts in line with the Higher Secondary recheck. In case the system is introduced by the Council, a fresh evaluation of scripts will be made. 				 																																													At present, the review system in the ICSE examination is confined to checking the papers for allotment of marks on each question and possible mistakes in addition. But even if an examinee seeks a review, the marks normally remain more or less the same. Grievances of candidates against the ICSE authorities are gathering momentum. Being an examinee of ISC examinations, 2002, I have noticed some abnormal variation of marks on the scoresheet. A candidate securing 95 per cent marks in mathematics, got 46 per cent in physics. 				 																																													Questions regarding such wide discrepancies may be raised because of the lack of transparency in the evaluation system. If the proposal is implemented, it will reduce the confusion among students. Otherwise, it may drag the ICSE authorities into avoidable legal hazards, as it has the Madhyamik and HS Boards.				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																													Lake Town.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Private push to health study (Metro, November 7), it is painful that the Marxist government failed to set up a single medical college in 25 years. Even former chief minister Jyoti Basu, claimed by many to be a visionary, did not follow the capitalist communism of China for the states development. However, with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee providing 25 acres at Rajarhat to Suraksha, a private hospital, to start an MBBS course, the Marxists seem to be shedding their obduracy.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																													lThe Left has taken a startling decision to welcome the private sector to start a medical college in Calcutta. In view of the paucity of seats available in government colleges, many students have to shift elsewhere to advance their careers. This move will stem the flow.				 																																													Subhasish Majumdar,				 																																													Sonarpur.				 																																																																				I was happy to see that people remember composer Salil Chowdhury (To preserve, protect and promote the music, Metro, November 9). But two of Indias all-time greats, Pankaj Mullick and Sachin Dev Barman, seem to have been relegated to oblivion. One wishes something is done to introduce them to todays generation. 				 																																													Mohun Roy, 				 																																													Raynagar, Bansdroni. 				 																																																																				Kudos for highlighting renowned juggler Abhay Mitra in Metro (Rays juggler tosses up tricks of the trade academy, November 11). It needs initiative, interest, skill and sincerity to become an expert juggler. We wish Mitra all success in his endeavour of training the youth.				 																																													Bhupendra Nath Bose,				 																																													Dum Dum Park.				 																																													lMany thanks to Abhay Mitra for taking steps to spread the art of jugglery. Every time we watch films like Jai Baba Felunath we are enchanted by his juggling skills. A serious student can take up this art as a profession. Besides, it will help them increase their agility and concentration. May Mitras dream of spreading the art be fulfilled.				 																																													Debyani Basu,				 																																													Saptagram.				 																																																																				I write with reference to an article entitled Fee favour indeed for students need (Metro, December 10) which appears to have inspired parents of students in other schools to demand like concessions. I would like to clarify two points. All Anglo-Indian schools give children fee concessions provided they are genuinely in need. 				 																																													All Anglo-Indian schools have been forced to raise their fees in order to make up for the deficit created by the reduction in government DA, and if parents refuse to cooperate, how does the school pay its teachers? Parents who can afford the cost of going to court can surely pay the enhanced rate which comes to only Rs 3,600 a year.				 																																													I request the parents who are harassing their principals to kindly examine how much money they are spending to provide luxuries for their children.				 																																													S.M. Cyril,				 																																													Principal, Loreto Day School.

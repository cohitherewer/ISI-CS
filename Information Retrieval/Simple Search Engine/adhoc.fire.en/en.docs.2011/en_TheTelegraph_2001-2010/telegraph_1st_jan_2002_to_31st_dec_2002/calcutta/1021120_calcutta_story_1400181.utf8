 A STAFF REPORTER																								Metro Railway services were disrupted for an hour on Tuesday morning after 32-year-old Sujit Banerjee leapt under the wheels of a train at Kalighat station. The suicide took place around 8.15 am. The station was nearly deserted, since it was a public holiday.																								Eyewitnesses said Banerjee was moving on the platform aimlessly for quite some time. As soon as the Tollygunge-bound train entered the platform, Banerjee jumped in front of it. The driver applied the brakes but by then, Banerjee had already come under the wheels.																								The driver and the guard lifted the body from the tracks and informed the authorities. Later, Banerjees body was handed over to Kalighat police station.																								Jayanta Das, officer-in-charge, Kalighat police station, said Banerjee hails from Chittaranjan, in the Rupnarayanpur area of Burdwan. He was a bachelor. He lived in rented accommodation in Behala and worked for a private firm. Some official papers were found in his trouser pockets. From his family members, we have come to know that Banerjee had been suffering from depression, said Das. 																								Banerjees sister-in-law Rinku said he worked at a computer firm, where he drew a paltry salary and was unhappy with the job. We were shocked when news of the accident came. We do not know how to tell my father-in-law, who is more than 70 years old, and my mother-in-law. Both are ailing, said Rinku. 																								Metro authorities said the death resulted in trains running at a 15-minute interval for an hour. There was, however, no disruption in Up services.

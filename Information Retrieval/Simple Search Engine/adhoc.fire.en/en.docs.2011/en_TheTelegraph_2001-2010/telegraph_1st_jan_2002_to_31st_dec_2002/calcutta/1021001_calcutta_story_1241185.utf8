The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, October 01, 2002 				 A system on life-support gear
				 				 																															The state of public medical facilities was in the news again, bringing out feelings of fear and helplessness. How does this make our citys future professionals feel? To find this out, last month Time to Talk asked The state of healthcare in the state is the biggest incentive/ disincentive for me to become a doctor because... Here is what Young Metro readers had to say:				 				 																															lI would have loved to become a doctor but due to the precarious healthcare facilities, I no longer consider this an option. Doctors face so much criticism from the public, while it is the government that is responsible for the disastrous conditions. If the state took a lead in improving facilities, more youngsters would have wanted to become doctors and fewer people would leave the state for treatment. Till the government takes the initiative and a code of conduct is imposed on doctors, I will stay away from medicine as a profession.				 				 																															Vineeta Nair,				 				 																															Modern High School				 				 																															lThe state of healthcare is an incentive for me to become a doctor because the present condition of hospitals is pitiful. It is sad to see Indias infrastructure getting worse by the day. I would like to become a doctor to play a greater part in improving the medical system of my country.				 				 																															Mehreen Saba,				 				 																															Class XII, Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan				 				 																															lAfter seeing the appalling conditions people have to deal with in hospitals, I would like to become a doctor to tend to the needy.				 				 																															Samreen Farah Naaz,				 				 																															Class X, Welland Gouldsmith				 				 																															lMedical facilities in our country need considerable repair. India needs good doctors who are aware of their duties and should not think only about money. They should come forward to cure those who need treatment but cannot afford it. A doctor is almost godlike in a patients eyes and this image should be safeguarded.				 				 																															Name not given				 				 																															lThe state of healthcare can neither be an incentive nor a disincentive to become a doctor as only sheer passion for a profession could make me take up a particular career. One should not get perturbed by external forces, as they can be easily changed if one has the determination to do so.				 				 																															Aakash Kamal Misra,				 				 																															Regional Computer Centre, Jadavpur University				 				 																															lA clean and healthy environment is the biggest asset in a doctors clinic. Just as a healthy body leads to a healthy mind, a healthy environment also results in accurate treatment. I would like to see hygienic conditions in hospitals around the city.				 				 																															Suchi Arya,				 				 																															Class XII, Modern High School				 				 																															lThe Bengal government takes no steps to improve hospital conditions, despite their rapid decay. How can this be an incentive to become a doctor? After the recent incident at the B.C. Roy Hospital, people are at a loss about what to do when lives are at stake.				 				 																															Udita Sen,				 				 																															Gokhale College				 				 																															lThe sad events at the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children should be encouragement enough to become a doctor.				 				 																															Sananda Sen,				 				 																															Asutosh College				 				 																															lIf one is determined to become a doctor and work for the welfare of the people  particularly the poor and needy  the state of healthcare should never stand in the way.				 				 																															Shreya Bose				 				 																															lThe prevailing conditions are a huge disincentive for me to become a doctor. With such bad administration and lack of infrastructure, treating patients would be great trouble. Without equipment, a doctor  no matter how able  can only be a quack.				 				 																															Piali Dasgupta,				 				 																															Class XII, Patha Bhavan				 				 																															lNowadays, without money, there is no healthcare. A doctor takes a vow to serve humanity before starting service, but unfortunately most just try to earn as much money as possible. While the state hospitals resemble horses stables, the rich have no trouble because of the advanced medical facilities available at luxurious private centres. This disparity should propel students to want to become doctors and do something about it.

	 Festive mood				 				 																															The annual fest of Lady Brabourne College, Kaleidoscope, is currently in progress. With some of the events being held on Saturday, the three-day event continued on Monday and Tuesday.				 				 																															The fest kicked off with an inaugural dance to Vande Mataram, after which followed the preliminary rounds of The Telegraph Kaleidoscope Inter-College Debate. There were two motions before the house: The City of Calcutta is not the City of Joy and Uncritical media creates an illusion of progress in India. The house heated up with teams from St Xaviers, Rani Birla, Jadavpur University arts and engineering faculties, Bhawanipur and the hosts coming to a head. St Xaviers, Bhawanipur and the two Brabourne teams made it to the finals. The hosts swept the war-of-words, bagging the top spot, the best speaker award as well as the first runner-up position. The other competitive event lined up for the day was recitation, before Bhoomi took the stage.				 				 																															The eastern solo round on Monday saw a blast from the past, with foot-tapping pop and rock dominating the western solo segment. Anjan Dutta was the guest artiste for the evening.				 				 																															There are loads more in store on Tuesday, in the form of Geet Gata Chal (antakshari), Sounds of Silence (dumb charades), Moonwalk (choreography) and a show by Utpalendu Chowdhury.

	 Harmonic notes 				 				 																															With the simple belief that every child is good at something, Hartleys High School hosts its inter-school fest, Harmonics. In its fourth chapter, the two-day fest saw participation from 13 schools.				 				 																															Sundays events started with director Raja Sen as chief guest at the opening ceremony. The day started on a melodious note with Raag Anuraag (Eastern group vocals). After that, Parnab Mukherjee hurled a volley of questions at Inquizitive (quiz), which Hartleys High swept, followed by South Point. The hit show of the fest was Ethnic Movements, a fashion parade, in which Gokhale Memorial came out on top. In Pentathlon, contestants had to sing, dance, do instant acting, field questions from the audience and do a Cyrus Broacha  la MTV Bakra. GD Birla was adjudged the best here. 				 				 																															Mondays line-up included a JAM session, called Breathless, Gunjan, an antakshari, and Rhythm-n-Life, a choreography competition. The fest also had its quota of off-stage events like Splash (face painting), Reflections (glass painting), wood-o-jute (collage) and thali decoration. Finally, the host school was handed the Champion of Champions trophy by principal Meena Kak.				 				 																
	 A visit with a cause				 				 																															The Interact District Council (IDC), in one of its endeavours to touch the lives of the needy in a meaningful way, decided to get up close and personal with inhabitants of a city old-age home.				 				 																															On September 29, members of the IDC, Girish Sharma, Kingshuk Sharma, Swati Dalmia, Debonita Chakraborty, Kulsum Khan and Madhumita Das paid a visit to Mulvany Old Age Home. The six elderly ladies living in the sprawling but barely-furnished home were overjoyed to have visitors. Many of these ladies used to work in their heydays and supported themselves and their families for years, but now they have no one to turn to, mused Madhumita.				 				 																															One such inmate is 81-year-old Renu Biswas. I was a nurse in a government hospital and served the people as long as my health permitted me to. Now I have to depend on people like you to fulfil my basic needs, Renu told her young visitors. The ladies, despite physical and emotional hardships, were still strong in spirit, smiling, cracking jokes and feeding stray cats, found the Interactors.				 				 																															The IDC crew had taken a few essentials along with them, like rice, lentils, salt and biscuits. They also invite any one who is interested to pitch in at the home, at 11, Dr. Kartick Bose Street, Calcutta 700009.				 				 																
	 Brush with paint				 				 																															Gurukul Playhouse and Montessori was witness to some stunning strokes on September 28. An inter-montessori/school sit-and-draw contest organised by Calcutta Park Street Ladies Circle 46 saw close to 400 children from 40 montessori houses and city schools like La Martiniere for Boys and Girls, Harvard House, Laxmipat Singhania Academy, Modern High and Mahadevi Birla Girls participating in the event. This competition, with five categories for children between two-and-a-half to 14 years, was a fund-raiser for the construction of schools and other facilities for underprivileged kids by Ladies Circle.

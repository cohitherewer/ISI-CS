The Telegraph - Calcutta

				 																																									On November 24, I took the Metro at 7.36 pm at Shyambazar station with my family. Surprisingly enough, till we got off at Jatin Das Park, there were no announcements regarding station identification. This caused a lot of inconvenience to passengers, many of whom missed their stop and had to make a return journey. The authorities should ensure that regular announcements are made, to avoid this unnecessary bother.

Due to illiteracy and superstition, people are ignorant about the dangers of HIV/AIDS. A massive propaganda, through the audio-visual media and community programmes, especially in slums and red-light areas, needs to be undertaken to educate them. Our city will be free of this deadly disease only through the efforts of its citizens, who should take an active interest in the campaign. The answer does not lie in stigmatising those suffering, since they are the victims.				 																																									Bhupen Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum Park.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

				 																																									Thanks to the Circular Rail, commuters from Gede and Ranaghat can reach the hub of the city directly. However, I never reach office by 10 am, since there is only one connecting train, the Bongaon local, which is always late. A special train from Dum Dum to BBD Bag is sorely needed. Also, the last train, recently introduced at 7.50 pm from BBD Bag, runs to full capacity. Therefore, a train to Bongaon at 8.30 pm should be introduced. Finally, there is no train between 1 pm and 5 pm from BBD Bag. So, one at 3 pm is required.				 																																									Sarbananda Gattani,				 																																									Rajakal.				 																																									The sight of skinned animals hanging outside meat shops, which are plentiful in the city, is terrible. This practice of parading dead animals before they are eaten is inhumane and should be banned. Simply writing meat shop on the store is enough to draw customers. A similarly offensive sight is that of hens, tied together in bunches, in vegetable markets. Their cries are very disturbing. 				 																																									Anushree Goenka,				 																																									Bagbazar.

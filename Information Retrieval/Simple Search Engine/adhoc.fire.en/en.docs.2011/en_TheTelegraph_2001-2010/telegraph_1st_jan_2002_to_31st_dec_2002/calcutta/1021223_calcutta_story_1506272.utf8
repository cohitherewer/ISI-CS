		 Monday, December 23, 2002 				 The right to choose whom to cure
								Biswajit Sarkar: If a doctor refuses to treat a person, what recourse can the patient take?																																																													A doctor practising privately in his chamber can choose his patients. But in case of an emergency, he cannot refuse any patient. However, you have also to consider the situation in which a doctor is working. Suppose you are taking a heart patient to a doctor who is not a cardiologist. In that case, the doctor is free to refer the patient elsewhere.

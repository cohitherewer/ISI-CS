 Friday, December 13, 2002 				 Tenants first in CIT flat sell-off plan
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After the state housing department, it is the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) that is planning to sell around 9,000 flats in different parts of the city. All these flats are presently let out on rent. The CIT plans to sell all these flats to the tenants.																								The authorities have sought the permission of the state government to sell the flats, which are located at Singhibagan, in north Calcutta, at Belgachhia, Entally and on Prince Anwar Shah Road, in the Tollygunge area.																								After the state government clears the proposal, the CIT will finalise the modalities for selling the flats. Sources said the present occupants of the flats would be given the first choice of buying the flats. They will, however, be allowed to pay the price in instalments. We will deduct the money the tenants have already paid to us as rent over the years, while finalising the price of the flats, said a senior CIT official on Thursday.																								Sudhansu Sil, CPM MLA and member of the CIT, told the state Assembly on Tuesday that it was gradually becoming difficult for the Trust to retain these flats, as maintenance costs were escalating. We require about Rs 4 crore annually for maintaining the 9,000 flats. Selling them out is the best option we have, Sil informed the Assembly.																								Barely a few weeks ago, housing minister Goutam Deb had announced the governments decision to sell about 29,000 flats, as it was finding it difficult to maintain them. Deb added that some of the flats were already sold to those who are living in them as tenants, while some would be sold through advertisements in dailies.																								nMystery death: Mystery shrouds the death of a youth, whose body was found in a lane at Golabari, in Howrah, on Thursday. Additional superintendent of police Rajsekharan said the youth has not been identified. The stretch on South Kolaghat Road, where the body was found, is always deserted. People avoid it, as there are no streetlights and criminals infest the area, he added.																								The Howrah police have alerted their counterparts in the district. We have sent the body for post-mortem. Initial investigations revealed that the youth was hit on the head with a heavy object, the additional police superintendent said.

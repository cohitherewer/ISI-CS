																								Once, when the famous litterateur, Fyodor Dostoevsky, was asked to comment on Russian literature, he had remarked, all literary works there emerged from Gogols Overcoat. This magnum-opus is written in Gogols unique style of critical-realism. The protagonist of Overcoat is the common man and the novel details the predicament of the underdogs of society in a despotic world ruled by the bourgeois class. This exploitation of the poor by the upper echelons of society still remains at the basis of modern society despite a change in place, time and characters. In post-colonial 21st century India, where by a queer twist of fate, mediaeval superstitions and ignorance co-exist with submarines, missiles and satellites, ordinary folks like Monojit, Prabir, Dhananjay, Sumita and Chithi Babu try hard to retain their identity. Their magnum and unequal war against a powerful foe forms the crux of this play. The overcoat in Russia is a weapon to fight against the bitter cold and an antagonistic nature out to destroy mankind from the face of Earth. Here, however, when the winter of decadence has set in, the warmth of the overcoat only adds heat to the fire. Based on Prithwish Roys play and directed by Tapas Singha, this is a Pratyay presentation.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Rabindra Sadan

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, December 04, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									In many areas of the city, including our Jadu Mitra colony, street lights remain on from 6 pm to 6 am. However, the timings should be changed with the season, to avoid inconveniencing the people. During winter, street lights should be switched on at 5.15 pm, to dispel the darkness. In another area in Behala, from the telephone office to the local State Bank of India, about 20 street lamps remain on till 9.40 am, causing a huge and unnecessary waste of power.				 																																									Ratan Gupta,				 																																									Behala.				 																																									The CESC meter-reading inspector came to take a monthly reading at my residence on November 23. Since they are usually in a hurry, I kept my meter room open for him in advance. When he arrived, he asked me my name, and promptly left to visit other houses in the area. He paid no heed to my requests, and kept an old man like me (66) waiting for 10 minutes. It is sad that the CESC send churlish, indecorous inspectors to visit consumers.				 																																									Govinda Bakshi,				 																																									Budge Budge.

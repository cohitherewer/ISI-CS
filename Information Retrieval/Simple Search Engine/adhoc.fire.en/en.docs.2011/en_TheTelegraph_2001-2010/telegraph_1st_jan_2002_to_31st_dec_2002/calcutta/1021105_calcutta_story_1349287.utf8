																								Amalkanti Chowdhury is a tired old man who lives in his past, surrounded by memories of his beloved son, Babua, and an intense longing for quot;what might have been. quot; Time was when Amalkanti was the monarch of all he surveyed, replete in his shining armour, he sold dreams to people, making them dream. But now at 63, he is a shattered man, stripped of all his glory. Twenty-five years ago, when he had full control over his life, he had built a nest for his wife and two sons amid natures lap. Today, his nest is surrounded by a concrete jungle of high-rises that look like monsters at night. His garden, deprived of sunlight, is barren although Amalkanti sows seeds religiously, hoping to see them germinate some day. His sons have left for greener pastures and are only occasional visitors to the little nest. Amalkantis only friend is Rajan, but an unseen wall of pride stops him from exploring and providing solace to Amalkantis intense pain and agony. Amalkantis only guiding spirit is his Big Brother  a man long dead but his larger-than-life presence illuminates Amalkantis existence. And then, one day, Amalkanti gets his Big Brothers signal to take the plunge. Based on Arthur Millers Death of a Salesman, this Nandikar production is directed by Rudraprasad Sengupta. 																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Charges fly over CPM leader murder
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Unidentified assailants shot local CPM functionary Asoke Mondal, alias Ranju, at Kabardanga, in the Regent Park area, on Sunday morning. Police said Mondal, 49, was fishing in a pond close to his house when the gunmen struck. He was taken to M.R. Bangur Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Five persons have been detained for interrogation.																								Senior police officers reached the spot to ensure that the situation did not spin out of control, as local CPM supporters blamed the murder on criminals owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress.																								Trinamul functionaries, however, refuted the allegation, claiming that Mondal had, in all probability, been killed at the behest of some local land sharks whom he had antagonised over some land deals.																								Shyamal Mondal, Trinamul leader and leader of the Opposition in the zilla parishad, said: The victim was involved in a number of illegal land transactions without his partys knowledge. We suspect that the murder was committed by his partymen, who are now trying to pin the blame on us. None of our party workers was involved.																								Sukumar Sarkar, zonal committee member of the CPM, said Mondal was a senior party worker and was involved in a number of social organisations. As far as we know, he had no enemies, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 Pandal duo steels a march 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee may see nothing wrong in puja committees trimming trees to make way for the Goddess, but at least two organisers in the city did their bit for the environment.																								Kasba Renaissance Club and the Nandibagan Sarbojanin Durga Puja Committee, off Haltu, have used corrugated steel sheets, instead of wood and bamboo, to erect their pandals.																								Help has come from the Union ministry of steel wing (the Institute for Steel Development and Growth, or Insgrad), operating from Ispat Bhavan, on Ballygunge Circular Road, and private-sector giant Tisco has agreed to sponsor the pandals. 																								This actually sets a new trend in Calcutta, Insgrad manager (civil and structural) Debasis Datta told Metro. We are now going to ask more puja committees to switch to this safer and environment-friendly medium, he added.																								Things, however, could be difficult. The fact that the Union ministry of steel project caught the fancy of only two medium-budget pujas shows how difficult it is to change conventions, particularly if they are not flashy or eye-catching, admit officials.																								The campaign against felling of trees influenced us and we decided to do our bit for the environment, said Shobhan Guha, Kasba Renaissance Club member. 																								The 29 ftX21 ftX20 ft structure, he admitted, would not be any great crowd-puller. We have done up a bigger structure to cover the core, he said. 																								The Nandibagan puja committee, too, had similar things in mind when it agreed to the Insgrad proposal. Besides the environment-friendly aspect, steel is non-inflammable, said Ranjan Ray, committee member. The puja, in its 13th year, has also covered the 40 ftX40 ft X25 ft core with a canopy in white and maroon, giving it a pandal-like appearance.

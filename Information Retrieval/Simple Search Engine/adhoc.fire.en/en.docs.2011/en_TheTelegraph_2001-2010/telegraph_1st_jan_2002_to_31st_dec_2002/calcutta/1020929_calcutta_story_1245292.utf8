The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, September 29, 2002 				 December of rallies at Brigade
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Come December, the Brigade Parade Ground will host a string of political rallies. While the CPI and the Trinamul Congress have already announced their dates, the Congress and the BJP are also trying hard to get the go-ahead from their Delhi leaderships.																								The CPI will hold a rally on December 29 on the Brigade after 13 years. The rally, organised to protest the rule of the BJP-led coalition at the Centre, is reportedly aimed at proving the partys potential to draw a crowd without the CPMs support. Sources said the Left Front, which, too, had plans to hold a rally on the Brigade in December, is now hesitant to proceed with the idea.																								According to sources, Left Front constituents are unhappy with the CPIs decision to hold the rally on its own. But CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said: The CPI is a separate party and can take decisions on its own.																								The Trinamul rally against the Left Front governments rule is slated for December 18. This will also help the party revive its organisation before the May panchayat elections. 																								State Congress leaders have sought AICC president Sonia Gandhis nod for their Brigade rally, said PCC general secretary Pradip Bhattacharjee.																								The Bengal BJP unit is not far behind in the rally race either. The state unit has approached its national leaders to hold the central executive committee meeting in Calcutta this time. If we host the meeting, a huge rally will be organised on the Brigade in December, said state vice-president Muzaffar Khan.

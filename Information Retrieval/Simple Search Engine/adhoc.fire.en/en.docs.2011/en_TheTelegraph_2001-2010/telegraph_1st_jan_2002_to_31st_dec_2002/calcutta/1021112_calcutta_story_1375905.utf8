The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, November 12, 2002 				 Cyclone signals wet spell
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								A cyclone is likely to hit coastal Bengal on Tuesday, warns the weatherman. That could mean dark clouds and sporadic showers in the city over the next 48 hours.																								R. N. Goldar, deputy director-general of the Alipore meteorological centre, said on Monday that a deep depression had formed some 1,000 km south-west of Calcutta, over west central Bay of Bengal, off the Andhra Pradesh coast.																								It is likely to intensify further and develop into a cyclone with a windspeed of 60 to 70 kph. Fairly widespread rain, with isolated heavy showers, is likely in the coastal areas of Bengal. Calcutta and its adjoining areas, too, could have rain under the impact of the cyclone, added Goldar.																								A low-pressure trough had drifted northwards from coastal Tamil Nadu over the past three days. This turned into a depression on Sunday evening and intensified on Monday, said Goldar, causing a light cloud cover and a nagging drizzle in the city. Once the skies clear, he added, the temperature is likely to dip by about five degrees Celsius.

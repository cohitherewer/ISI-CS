				 CLICK-QUICK: A familiar scene in an office 				 																																																																				 Apropos the report Heartburn over heartbeat implants (Metro, November 27), it is an open secret that innocent patients are victims of some motivated doctors who implant pacemakers to receive commissions of up to 20 per cent from the manufacturers. Now it is welcome news that an electro-physiological (EP) study machine has been installed at SSKM Hospital to screen patients to find out whether they need pacemakers at all. 				 																																													In this connection, the role of the Indian Medical Association is important in busting the racket since unscrupulous doctors have been toying with the lives of patients under its nose. Doctors are next to God goes the saying. It is a pity some of them have turned into devils!				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Our chief minister has announced that West Bengal will be among the top three IT states in India by 2010 (CM techs off vision 2010, Metro, November 26). The Left Front government had ignored the IT sector earlier which has resulted in Bengal taking a backseat. Trade union leaders had practically stalled the entry of infotech. There is no dearth of talent here. What is required is coordinated effort.				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																													Lake Town.				 																																																																				The report Party whip irks truant lawyers (Metro, November 23) was disturbing. With chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee opting to put a full stop on truant unions, the days of military trade unionism seem to be over. This way, Bengal may become the industrialists haven in the days to come. Will the industrialists driven away earlier, come back to Bengal? 				 																																													T.R. Anand,				 																																													Address not given.				 																																																																				The report Bantala set, tanners not, says minister (Metro, November 27) is another example of the Left Front governments ambivalence. Only a few days ago, the chief minister had blamed promoter Jagmohan Dalmiya for the tardy pace of development at Bantala. Why this sudden change in stand?				 																																													Jayanta Datta,				 																																													Chinsurah.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Charity sustains memories of Netaji (Metro, November 25), it is sad to learn that Hemantabala Chatterjee, the sole surviving female Indian National Army member in Calcutta has been spending her days in penury. Can the state government not provide her a monthly pension to enable this ageing freedom-fighter to spend her last days in peace and with dignity?				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Rail job fraud backtracks (Metro, November 21), I want to point out certain facts. We appreciate your efforts for highlighting a complaint made by one Madhab Mondal allegedly against a railway employee. It has been reported that a letterhead in my name and in my capacity as private secretary to the former railway minister was fraudulently used. I never held that post. Further, there was no letterhead printed in the name of any of the additional private secretaries of the former railway minister, of whom I was one. However, we shall be happy if the alleged racket is unearthed.				 																																													Gautam Basu,				 																																													Benoy Bose Road				 																																													Metro replies: The report makes it clear that Gautam Basu was in no way involved in the rail job fraud. It clearly states that his letterhead was either forged or had been stolen from his office. Where we have erred is in stating that Basu was the private secretary to Mamata Banerjee. But the fault does not lie entirely with us. While briefing Metro, DC, DD-II, P.K. Sanyal had stated that the letterhead in his possession mentions Basu as Mamata Banerjees private secretary. This further proves that the letterhead was forged and absolves Basu of any hand in the fraud. Metro did try to get in touch with Basu, but as he was unavailable, we sought the views of Manik Majumdar, an assistant of the former railway minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 Harlequinade
																								Based on a play by Terence Rattigan, with additional local scripting, the play centres around the dress rehearsal of a Shakespeare repertory theatre company touring a small town. As the play progresses, the usual madness and confusion that go into creating the magic of a play get further confounded when hilarious unexpected developments creep up on the troupe. Directed by Katy Lai Roy, the play features veteran artistes including Zarin Chaudhuri, Kabir Seth, Deena Ardeshir, Punam Singh, Dean Turner, Daleep Kakkar, Pervez Kaikobad, Tinnat Ahmed Lal and Swaran Chaudhury along with new young talents including Iftekar Ahsan, Bikram Ghosh, Dana Roy, Ronaan Roy, Simon Jennings, Aniket Deb Roy, Amitesh Roy, Sagnik Chowdhury, Aadil Rashid Khan and Roshni Mukherjee. This Red Curtain production will be presented by Eveready and The Telegraph to raise funds for Little Sisters of the Poor.																								When: Tomorrow at 7 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch, Pretoria Street

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, December 12, 2002 					 					 You share your birthday with...Rajnikant. Be prepared to go it alone. Time to play the leader when necessary. You will bond better with younger people. Those born on 1st, 4th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 19th, 22nd and 28th will count in your life. Professional changes are likely.  Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, October 17, 2002  Letters
				 																																																																				 Apropos the report School slams language divide (Metro, September 18 ), it is a harsh truth that students of English-medium schools are becoming victims of faulty evaluation by teachers from Bengali-medium institutions who lack the expertise to assess their scripts properly. 				 																																													Although school education minister Kanti Biswas did not accept South Points observation, the honourable minister would do well to remember that a shoe does not fit every foot. In fact, the cancerous disease of erratic evaluation crept into the examination system long ago. Thanks to the results scandal, it has been exposed in this years Madhyamik examination. It is high time that sensible educationists and school authorities demand a better evaluation system to save the futures of promising students. Suffering in silence is not the way to right the wrongs.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Progress push for traffic flow (Metro, September 10), it is heartening to note that the transport minister has unveiled some projects to ensure smooth flow of traffic in the city. The condition of roads here has steadily deteriorated and little has been done due to shortage of funds. A well-planned, systematic approach is urgently required.				 																																													Ranu Mukherjee,				 																																													Bagbazar.				 																																																																				The mid-day darkness could have encouraged criminals, but they dont hesitate to operate even in broad daylight (Cloud cover, crime spurt, Metro, September 21). A few days ago, around 11 am, my gold necklace was snatched near the triangular park in Kankurgachhi. Passersby, instead of chasing the miscreants, asked me all sorts of questions about what had happened, allowing the snatchers to flee.				 																																													Chandrima Ghosh,				 																																													Salt Lake City.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Hospitals to share cot counts (Metro, September 16), the government has taken a judicious step by reducing the pressure of patients on B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children by shifting some patients to other hospitals. The incessant flow of critical patients has resulted in the breakdown of services. However, the move will not yield the desired results unless adequate infrastructural facilities are provided. 				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee, 				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																																																				With reference to the report CU opens doors to distance education (Metro, September 19), students who have passed through the distance education system will be benefited by this move. Stiff competition in admission to colleges has resulted in jeopardising the futures of so many students. The open education system is best suited for their purpose.				 																																													B.N. Bose,				 																																													Dum Dum Park.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Varsity checks on truancy (Metro, September 17), it is heartening to note that university authorities are planning to improve the standard of teaching in colleges under its jurisdiction. In many colleges, classes are not held, nor are tests conducted regularly. As a consequence, students preparations for examinations suffer. 				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																													Lake Town.				 																																																																				It is a matter of disgrace that despite there being hundreds of super-specialist ophthalmologists in Bengal, the state government is inviting people from other states to set up a centre of excellence in ophthalmology like Sankara Narayana Nethralaya in Bidhannagar (Let there be sight, Metro, September 20). People are heading elsewhere, for so-called better treatment, purely due to lack of awareness. 				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																													lIt is heartening to learn that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in company with doctors S.S. Badrinath and Devi Shetty recently launched Sankara Narayana Nethralaya in Salt Lake, which is expected to open in January 2003. The new eye-care centre will be a boon to the people of the state.				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia.

				 																																									Construction work on the JL Nehru Road flyover, stretching from Lindsay Street to the Jeevan Deep crossing, is progressing at a snails pace and as a result, commuters are facing a lot of difficulty. The situation is worse for the residents and people attending office in the Kyd Street area, whose movement has been severely restricted by the no-entry sign placed at the mouth of the road. Kyd Street is a vital route used by the fire brigade and the police personnel, especially during an emergency. The MLAs hostel, the State Guest House and the Geological Survey of India office are also located here. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation should speed up work and lift the restrictions on traffic as early as possible.				 																																									Sumant Poddar,				 																																									Kyd Street.				 																																									The state government was to have start an eviction drive along Bagjola canal in mid-November. But no work has been started as yet. How can the authorities concerned keep deferring it, ignoring the interests of a large number of tax-payers?				 																																									Rabindranath Kar,				 																																									Sankar Ghosh Lane.

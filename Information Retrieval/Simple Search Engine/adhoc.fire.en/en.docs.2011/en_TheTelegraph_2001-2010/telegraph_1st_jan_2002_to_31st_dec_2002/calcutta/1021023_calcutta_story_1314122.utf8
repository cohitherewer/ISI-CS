																								Florian Ross, born in 1972, studied piano and composition in Cologne, London and New York with John Taylor, Don Friedman, Bill Dobbins, Joachim Ullrich and Jim McNeely. He released his first album in 1998 on Naxos-jazz Florian Ross Quintet  seasons amp; places. More followed. Ross music radiates with warm colours. It is built on a sheer elegant architecture of sound layers, at times Florians left hand being synchronised with the double bass. This technique lends his music a beautiful rhythmic and melodious compound. Ross has received many prestigious awards for his piano recitals and writings. He has written music for the Metropole Orchestra, the Vancouver Jazz Orchestra, the BMI Jazz Orchestra, Joe Lovano and the Irish Radio Symphony, the Brussels Jazz Orchestra. He is head of the department at Johannes-Gutenberg-Universitat in Mainz. Currently in the city as part of a musical tour, Ross presents his music with a sextet, with Paul Heller and Mathias Erlewein (tenor saxophones), Matthias Bergman (trumpet), Dietmar Fuhr (bass) and Jochen Ruckert (percussion). Though presenting a sextet, Ross knowledge and versatility in modern jazz make them sound much bigger at times. This programme is being hosted jointly by Max Mueller Bhavan, Goethe-Institut Inter Nationes, Calcutta and Calcutta School of Music.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, October 07, 2002 				 Puja deadline for Sunshine rerun
								Salman: We, residents of Colootola Street, are quite tired of the encroachments and illegal parking. 																																																													My ward is thickly populated. The problem you have pointed out is more than 50 years old. Some families even live on the footpath. However, I have asked them to vacate after the Pujas. Regarding encroachment by hawkers, I plan to discipline them after the Pujas. The traffic problem is really a headache. I have spoken to the local police station and the deputy commissioner about the problem.

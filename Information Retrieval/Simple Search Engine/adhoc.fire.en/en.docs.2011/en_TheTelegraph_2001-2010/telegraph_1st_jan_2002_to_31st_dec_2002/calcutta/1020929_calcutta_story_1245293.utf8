 Sunday, September 29, 2002 				 Postal worker hangs self at GPO
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Convinced that he would never recover from a kidney ailment, a 42-year-old employee of Railway Mail Service (RMS) hanged himself at the GPO on Saturday morning. Doctors said he could have been cured.																								K. Safiul Islam was found hanging in the prayer room on the first floor of the building. Officials of the Hare Street police station said Islam had been suffering from a kidney ailment. Recently, he had to be admitted to Medical College and Hospital. However, no suicide note was left behind. 																								M. Haque, his father-in-law, admitted that Islam was so obsessed with his ailment that he used to talk about it all the time. He had been suffering from depression for the past one month. So I got him to stay at our Dankuni residence, while my daughter and their two children stayed at his ancestral home at Rezinagar, in Murshidabad, said Haque.																								G.C. Saha, superintendent of RMS, said Islam joined duty on Saturday around 9.30 am  half an hour behind schedule. He was told to go to Kidderpore to deliver and collect mails from various post offices, said Saha.																								Before leaving, Islam told his colleagues that he was going upstairs and would be back within five minutes. But he did not return even after half-an-hour. After searching for an hour, they found Islam hanging from the iron hook fitted on the wall of the prayer room. The police have started a suicide case.

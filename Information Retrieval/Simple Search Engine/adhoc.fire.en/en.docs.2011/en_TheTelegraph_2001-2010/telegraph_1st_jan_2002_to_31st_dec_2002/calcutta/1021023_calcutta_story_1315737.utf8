 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 New address for quality healthcare
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, the super-speciality hospital on the EM Bypass, has finally gone on stream, admitting patients after its formal commissioning on Monday.																								Apollo Hospitals group chairman Dr Prathap C. Reddy said the emphasis at the centre would be on offering quality healthcare at affordable rates. A total of 100 beds  six in the emergency wing, 30 in the ITU and the rest in other special categories  were opened on Monday. The bed count will go up to 225 by January 2003, with the next phase slated to add another 125 beds. We hope the hospital will usher in a new concept of healthcare in this part of the country, said Dr Reddy.																								The charges are billed to be around five per cent higher than the rates prevalent in other super-speciality hospitals in town. Our charges for all specialities will be on par with Apollo Chennai, said V. Satyanarayana Reddy, chief executive officer, Apollo Gleneagles. We have decided to divide the packages into single room and deluxe rooms, keeping in mind the wide cross-section of patients here.																								The hospital boasts 50 super-speciality units, with experts from various parts of the country and abroad joining hands with doctors here. The entire nursing staff will be brought in from south India.																								The opening of the hospital next to Swabhumi was preceded by a flurry of activity, with the Duncans-Gleneagles tie snapping. After Duncans moved out, we decided to associate ourselves with Gleneagles to set up the hospital, which is being run on an equity-share basis, said Prathap Reddy. Gleneagles remains an active participant, with 49 per cent equity share.

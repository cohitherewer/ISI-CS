				 																																									College students have little time for co-curricular activities like outdoor and indoor sports. Earlier, there used to be active participation in inter-college cricket and football matches. Trophies like Eliot Shield and Heramba Moitra Shield generated a lot of enthusiasm among college-goers. If the interest in sports is revived, todays generation can be prevented from indulging in negative activities, like hooliganism and different sorts of addiction.

The shop used to offer tea to customers so that they could select the flavour of their choice. But the practice has been discontinued. It seems that the leaves on display now are different from the ones we buy. As the products are expensive, ranging from Rs 200 to Rs 300 a kg, the company should intervene.				 																																									Subhamoy Ghosh,				 																																									Salt Lake.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, October 01, 2002 				 Images of melancholy eyes
																								Calcutta-based Chandrima Roy is a self-taught artist and this is her first solo exhibition. Roy concentrates on the human form but her figures are rarely realistic. Her figures are mostly well-sculpted, robust men and women. Their well-built physiques are achieved through solid brush strokes, and the characters are reminiscent of the rural working class people of Bengal. The flat two-dimensional images are enlivened by the use of thick, heavy black lines to define the body structure. Melancholy eyes, silent frontal or profile faces are Roys prime focus of interest and she emphasises the subdued emotions with the use of warm colours. Her long brush-strokes create multiple images against a solid background. There is no scope for play of light and shadow in her works. Only a flat hidden light springs from the luminous colours. Most of her characters look melancholic and this temperamental depression is the hallmark of her works.																								When: Till October 4; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, West Gallery

 Monday, December 16, 2002 				 Parking zones for safety and civic revenue 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a bid to curb road accidents and attract more revenue, Bidhannagar Municipality will set up new parking zones in different parts of the township.																								A proposal to set up parking zones in Salt Lake is likely to be discussed threadbare and approved at the next board meeting of the municipality in January, convener of the transport sub-committee of the municipality Ashim Guha said. These zones will be given out on lease to private companies.																								Bidhannagar Municipality chairman Dilip Gupta explained that the parking zones were part of the municipalitys plan to deal with traffic chaos in the planned city. A team of civic body officers has identified key places for the new parking zones  the two gates of Banabitan, in front of Nalban boating complex, near the major hotels and restaurants, the Kwality bus stop on First Avenue from AE/BE block to SW-3, near the CGO Complex, and Telephone Bhavan and in front of Unnayan Bhaban and Vidyut Bhaban. 																								The municpality has already leased out two parking zones  one adjacent to Nicco Park and another in front of Suraksha private hospital.																								The existing rates of parking fees will be implemented, Guha said. These are: for the first hour, Rs 2 for two-wheelers, Rs 5 for cars, Rs 8 for vans and minibuses and Rs 10 for heavy vehicles. For the next hour, the rates are Rs 3, Rs 10, Rs 12 and Rs 20, respectively. The municipality earned Rs 3 lakh from the parking lot in front of Suraksha Hospital from the private bidder. The amount will increase manifold after the new zones are added. 																								Lots for night-parking will be identified. Space for chartered and schoolbuses will also be marked out. The municipality has deferred its plan to set up parking zones near all markets and local centres and schools in the township. The municipal authorities feel that asking local people to pay parking fees will have an adverse effect, the civic officer said.																								There will be no parking lot in front of the Hyatt hotel because, officers feel, it will cause traffic snarl-ups. Though there was a proposal to that effect, we are not considering it at present. Now, the vehicles will have to be kept on the road if we set up a parking lot in front of the Hyatt, said Baidyanath Mondal, executive officer of Salt Lake.																								At a recently-held meeting with the transport committee, the Salt Lake police has proposed to put up roadsigns in Salt Lake. These signs will be put up in collaboration with a private party. 																								nPower off: Gol Park and its adjoining areas went without power for over six hours on Sunday afternoon, following damage caused to underground cables of the CESC by civic workers digging a road.

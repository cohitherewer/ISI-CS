The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, November 05, 2002 				 Out of the box, leaders-to-be
 															- B-schools in 3-day jamboree A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Euphoria regales the Intaglio crowd. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Intaglio, the annual National Business School Meet, held at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC), ended this festive weekend. The big names in B-schools jumped on to the three-day Joka jamboree, supported by The Telegraph, Businessworld and ITC, with over two hundred participants turning up from across the country.																								The business events this year included a case study, two quizzes conducted by quiz-master Anustup Dutt and a host of other marketing, finance and strategy games, involving diverse management theories. This gave the teams the chance to compete in a simulated business environment. The emphasis was on provoking the participants to think out of the box.																								Shastrarth, the paper-presentation contest, was divided up into finance, economics, marketing, systems and strategy. The panel discussion, Ciceros Senate, organised by the Colloquia Cell, had the right mix  eminent personalities, one controversial topic and a definite clash of ideologies. Participants Russi Modi, ex-chairman of Tata Steel, Nirmal Jain, founder of India Infoline and IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus, Prof Ranjan Das, Strategic Management Group, IIMC, and Prof Kashyap, faculty member, IIMC debated whether MBAs make good corporate leaders. C.P. Singh, the regional enterprise manager of HP, was the moderator.																								The opening speaker was Jain, who believed that as a rule, MBAs make better leaders, although there were notable exceptions. Kashyap stated that management institutes, particularly premier ones, have been quite successful in developing tomorrows corporate leaders.																								Prof Ranjan Das cited Russi Mody, Narayana Murthy and the late Dhirubhai Ambani as examples of non-MBAs making it big, and M.S. Banga and Indra Nooyi, both products of the IIMs, as MBAs who did. He stressed that by securing a good management degree one could definitely increase ones chances of success. 																								Mody captivated the audience with anecdotes from his personal life, explaining how, in his opinion, leaders were born and not made and how no amount of management training could make a person a good leader. With the exception of Mody, the general consensus was that while there would always be exceptions, in general, a person with formal education in management would be better equipped to be a leader.																								The informals at Intaglio 2002 went down well, with the Hammer Age striking home with music and masti. The main attractions were the bands Euphoria and Krosswindz. Palash Sen and gang set the Joka campus rocking with tracks like Dhoom Pichak, Mayeeri, Shana Na and even a few from their upcoming album.																								IIMC students Kamakhya Prasad Mishra and Pratyush Prasanna were the winners of Quest de Midas, and Supratik Chaudhuri, G.S. Ramasubraminiam and Srivatsa Subanna took the top prize in Riddler on the Roof, the general quiz. Habeas Corporarus, the BizQuiz, was won by the team from K.J Somaiya Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai. Inderpreet Singh, Rohil Sahgal and Arijit Sarkar from IIMC led The Strategians, while Avantika Rajagopalan, Vipul Mathur, Sumit Mathur, Rohit Bansal, M.V. Ramesh and Vidya Murthy  from IIMC, again  took the first prize for Swiss Knife.																								In Shastrarth, Namrita Khandelwal and Shruti Chhabra from FMS, Delhi, shared top honours for marketing. Akhilesh Pandey and Siddhartha Tatereh from IIM Lucknow, came out on top in economics; Sumon Chattopadhyaya and Divyanshu Sharma from IIMC excelled in systems; Anuj Todi and Raghav Oberoi from ISB, Hyderabad won for social responsibility; Gunjan Bansal and Kunal Biswas from IIMC came first in the finance field; and Maloy Halder and Deekshant Sehrawat from IIMC dazzled the judges with their paper on strategy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Cell-tale sign of a show-off
				 				 																															The talk of the town is the new ad where a pooch becomes a handsome, sexy man courtesy the newest cellphone model in the market. So when Time to Talk asked whether cellphones are a luxury or a necessity for students, its not a surprise that replies flooded in. Here are a few; more to follow...				 				 																															lThough some may say cellphones are a necessity, one cannot deny that they highlight a status gap among students. Those who do not have a cellphone may feel insecure if everyone else has one. They may also divert attention of the students from books. So, cellphones should be a big no in a students life.				 				 																															Sharmistha Dan,				 				 																															Shri Shikshayatan				 				 																															lMobile phones are a luxury for students as they have no real need for them. The trend of carrying mobiles to school is very unhealthy.				 				 																															Siyanatullah Khan,				 				 																															Class XI, 				 				 																															St Augustines Day School				 				 																															lI dont quite agree that cellphones are a luxury for students. Being connected at all times figures high on the priority list for students these days. With facilities like SMS, picture messaging, e-mail and updates on sports and astrology, cell phones are not only a necessity but also make our lives spicier!				 				 																															Priyanka Aich				 				 																															IIIrd Yr, St Xaviers College				 				 																															lWith growing modernisation and fast-moving technological developments, cellphones may be considered a necessity. However, for students, they are more like fashion accessories. There is no good reason for students to carry cellphones in a metro where public phone booths are easily accessible. Cellphones are therefore only a source of extra expenditure.				 				 																															Anuraag Jaiswal,				 				 																															Class X, Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan				 				 																															lCellphones are necessary for one reason  as a statement in style. Students generally carry cellphones to college and school to prove their status over others. Its nothing but a way to impress other people. No student ever receives really important calls.				 				 																															Amrita				 				 																															lCellphones are a luxury and not a necessity for students. Sometimes they may need to call their parents when they go out but that can be done from a local phone booth, which would work out far cheaper than a cellphone. Students tend to misuse their cellphones by making unnecessary calls. They think of them as an object to flaunt.				 				 																															Reeti Roy,				 				 																															Class VIII, Modern High School				 				 																															lAt the most, students may require a telephone to speak to friends or family, for which a landline is more than adequate.				 				 																															Suyash Jaiswal,				 				 																															Class X, St Xaviers Collegiate School				 				 																															lIt is common to find a student chatting away on a cellphone. Some may also feel that these gadgets are a luxury for students, but I disagree. When I am carrying a mobile, I can keep in touch with my parents easily, so they are less anxious. Cellphones have actually helped parents keep tabs on their children during school and college hours.				 				 																															Subhobrata Basu				 				 																															IIIrd Year, Asutosh College				 				 																															lIn the age of information technology, a mobile is no longer a status symbol, but a very useful device for everyone. But using a cell while a class is on should not be tolerated.				 				 																															Sayan Ghosh				 				 																															lMobile telephony is meant for emergencies, not for an informal chat. So why should students carry a phone? They are capable of looking after themselves and parents need not provide a cellphone just to keep in touch while they are away from home. As a tool to set up meetings with friends, it is indeed a luxury for students. Moreover, its childish to flaunt ones wealth in front of ones not-so-well-off contemporaries.

	 Nov 14 unplugged				 				 																															Modern High: Smiling faces, great food and a colourful atmosphere greeted students at Modern High School on November 14. The teachers and the two school clubs  Clean (nature club) and Connect (social service club)  organised a mini fete on the school grounds, featuring games, food and arts and crafts stalls. But we were also in for a huge surprise. As the girls gathered around a small stage near the school planetarium, the party began. Teachers came dressed as clowns as the theme for the show was circus. They walked on ropes, a ringmaster with his elephants played with a ball. The ballerinas included Ms Narayanswami, Dr De and Mrs S. Roy. Lions, horses and goats jumped through rings, as weight-lifters, including our vice-principal Ms Sicka, showed their strength. Last but not the least, trapeze artistes  Mrs Bhattacharyya and our principal Mrs Kar  proved how down to earth they really are! The show ended with a special song dedicated to all the students of MHS.				 				 																															 Suchi Arya				 				 																															Class XII, Modern High School				 				 																															The Heritage: The Heritage School celebrated Childrens Day in its own unique manner, with a riot of colour and foot-tapping music as all the teachers took to the stage to entertain the children with a medley of song, dance, mime and play-acting. Children were treated to the unusual sight of their teachers letting their hair down. Gone were the stern looks, the maths problems and history quizzes. Instead they donned outlandish costumes and danced to the tunes of Lagaan, Bhoomi and the like. They then acted out everyday scenes from school life. For once, it was the students who were being imitated by their teachers!				 				 																															The Disha gang: Disha, the youth wing of Bharatiya Bhasha Parishad, celebrated Childrens Day in grand style on November 16 at the AJC Bose Road old-age home. The in-house quiz competition was the brainchild of Rupanjana De. Held in the homes auditorium, the five two-member teams comprised senior citizens, while the six quizmasters were aged between 10 and 14.				 				 																															Complete-the-nursery-rhyme, Act it out, Who am I, Whose nickname is it, an audio round and a visual round were what the participants had to face, with a number of teasers for the audience, too. Vivian McNamara and Agastun Gomes finally won. But the star attractions of the evening were the chief guests  four-year-old Karan and seven-year-old Nilanjan, both clad in kurta-pyjama.				 				 																															After the quiz, the participants and audience members belted out their favourite songs. We would all like to thank the senior citizens at the Little Sisters of the Poor and Sister Margaret, in charge of the home, for allowing us to spend time with them. It really made our day.				 				 																															 Anupa Law				 				 																															Don Bosco, Liluah: The whole school first assembled for a prayer service on Childrens Day. After a fancy dress competition, a mock marriage procession was taken out by the Class XII students. A fete, also put together by the students, followed. Games stalls, with lucky dip and computer games, lip-smacking dishes and ice-creams were a treat for the hundreds who dropped by. A song-on-demand stall was set up for those who wanted to dedicate tunes to friends. In the evening, a bash was organised for the underprivileged kids associated with the school by the past pupils association.				 				 																															 Ansul Goel,				 				 																															Class XII, Don Bosco Liluah				 				 																															BVM Montessori: I was very excited from the morning because I was supposed to go to the Centre of Handicapped at Institute of Child Health with my school friends and teachers.				 				 																															When I reached my school dressed as a clown, I saw my friends  Praijwal, Rahul, Antara, Ankit, Vasundhara and Rangeet  all dressed up as clowns, wearing colourful caps and faces made up. We reached there all ready to sing and dance to popular rhymes like A Fairy came adancing, Three little monkeys, Listen to the big drum, Lakri ki kathi... And I danced alone to the song Lal jhuti kakatua. Everybody was thrilled to hear our action-rhyme Three little monkeys and kept on clapping.				 				 																															Then our friends there, girls dressed in yellow saris with yellow marigold in their hair and boys dressed in white dhoti kurtas, danced to the song Piya amar ghore esheche. Then all of us sang We shall overcome, before going to the lunch room where our teachers served us cakes, samosas and biscuits.				 				 																															But it was time to leave. Our friend Amit Kolay from that Institute came and gave us sweet bags and balloons. It was a great day!				 				 																															 Irani Bhattacharya,				 				 																															BVM Montessori School				 				 																															Green Club: Music and masti was the motto at the Green Club Childrens Day celebrations at Gyan Manch on Monday. Six teams, each with two students from Abhinav Bharati High School, one under-privileged child from Ballygunge Prathamik Vidyalaya and one guest, participated in a fun-filled antakshari. The packed auditorium, with students from Abhinav Bharati enthusiastically joining in, sang along and cheered those in the hot seats. Some of the numbers that got the audience, teachers and students alike, on its feet, included Humma, Bach ke rehna and Roop tera mastana.				 				 																															After a tight finish, the Ananda Bazaar Patrika team, emerged winner, bagging prizes worth Rs 3,500 for each member. The Green Club team, with actor Biplab Chatterjee as guest participant, was first runner-up, with prizes worth Rs 2,500 .

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, November 13, 2002  We Ask You Answer				 Clear doubt, alert examiner
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should answer-scripts be distributed with Madhyamik/ HS marksheets? More letters will be published next week									

Sukumar Dutta, 
																		Jagaddal.																																																														This is no doubt a welcome decision. However, a dispute may arise if the student feels he/she has been given less marks than deserved. The guardians may still go to the legal authorities for redress.									

Pratike Gupta, 
																		Kankurgachhi. 																																																														Its a very good idea. This will help students know what their mistakes are and let them make improvements in those specific areas. They will not be able to blame the teachers, which probably is what some students do. Sometimes teachers make mistakes in addition, which can be immediately rectified under this system. 									

Seraj Alam, 
																		Bansberia.																																																														No, of course not. The distribution of evaluated answer-scripts along with marksheets may create a fuss among students. Every student can ask for revaluation even for small mistakes. This will unnecessarily overburden the Board and the Council.									

Pratyay Banerjee, 
																		Tollygunge.																																																														Yes. This way the students will not only be sure about the assessment, but can also find out about their mistakes and not make the same ones in future. 									

Indrani Bhagat, 
																		Kasba.																																																														I think it is a sensible approach. Students will not feel deprived this way and there will be no ground for anguish. 									

B.N. Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														A very fine idea. This move will help avoid a lot of confusion. Re-examination will be minimised and the candidates will know their shortfalls as well as their merits if answer-scripts are distributed with marksheets. Examiners will be very cautious while evaluating the answerscripts.									

P. Pramanik, 
																		Santoshpur Avenue. 																																																														Yes, the answer-scripts should be shown not to individual students but to the school authorities, for assessment of the evaluation standard. 									

Sugata Pyne, 
																		Tollygunge.																																																														A student who does not obtain his expected marks will claim that his answer-scripts have not been properly corrected. If the scripts are shown, his lips will be sealed. Moreover, examiners would do the assessment with much more care. Therefore, distribution of answer-scripts with marksheets is an absolute necessity to put an end to the confusion which is created once the results are out.									

Madhumita Mukherjee,
																		Park Side Road.																																																														Every year, after the publication of Madhyamik and HS results, we find some harried students and parents running from pillar to post seeking justice. Some irresponsible examiners check the scripts in haste and ruin the lives of many. The move will ensure fair evaluation.									

Reena Mukherjee,
																		South Sinthee Road.																																																														Answer-scripts must never be distributed along with marksheets as it will only create an unpleasant situation leading to the tampering of scripts. At the most, the papers can be returned to the respective schools so that examinees who are dissatisfied with their results can crosscheck.									

Sudeep Ghosh. 
																		Birati.																																																														My answer is a flat no. This will be a mockery of the ethics of the examination system. Giving away answer-scripts along with Madyamik/HS marksheets on the grounds of transparency does not make sense. The need of the hour is to penalise erring, work-shy invigilators.									

Naren Sen, 
																		Santragachhi. 																																																														The system will ensure that the examiners take a little more care while evaluating the answers. Besides, there will be no need then for a scrutiny or review. Candidates themselves can scan the paper to see whether the marks awarded are justified. 									

Ronak Pal,
																		Nabanagar.																																																														It is just a utopian thought. But if ever implemented, it will introduce transparency and students will be spared from being made scapegoats of a faulty evaluation system. But the authorities should at least ensure that students dont get incomplete marksheets.									

Ishita Banerjee,
																		Barasat.																																																														We dont want photocopies of our answer-scripts but correct evaluation from the examiners.									

Samir Saha,
																		Baguiati.																																																														Certainly not. The distributed answer-scripts may be tampered with, resulting in greater chaos.									

Ananya Banerjee,
																		Address not given.																																																														Distribution of answer-scripts along with marksheets may not yield any immediate result. But in the long run, students will benefit immensely as they will get an opportunity to know their mistakes. It will also make the examiners more cautious.									

Manturam Das,
																		Garia.																																																														Yes. It is the moral duty of the Board that the system is fair and transparent. After all, the students must be shown what they have done.									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury,
																		Barrackpore.																																																														Certainly not. Such a step is absolutely illogical. Complaints will start pouring in, leading to an absolute chaos in the examination system. Considering that even schools and colleges find it difficult to hold examinations and publish results on time, making such a step mandatory will only overburden the Boards.

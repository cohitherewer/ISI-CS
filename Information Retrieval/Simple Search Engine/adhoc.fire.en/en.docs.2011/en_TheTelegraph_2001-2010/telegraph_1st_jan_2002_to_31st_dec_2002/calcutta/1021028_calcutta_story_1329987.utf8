				 																																									Recently, I had taken my family to the Dakshineswar temple. I had parked my car in the nearby parking lot. When we got into the car after offering prayers, some youths asked me to pay a subscription. I gave them Rs 5 but they wanted more and started threatening me. I drove to the gate of the temple complex, where a few youths pulled me out of the car and assaulted me. My glasses were smashed and I was badly injured. Is this how a place of worship is maintained?				 																																									Sushil Kumar Daga,				 																																									Howrah.				 																																									Two electricity boxes, installed on the pavement near 1st Avenue in Salt Lake, should be removed immediately. An accident may occur anytime.				 																																									Subhamoy Ghosh,				 																																									Salt Lake.

				 																																										lTwo cyclists were killed in an accident on Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in Tiljala on Wednesday. Police said the cyclists were hit by an ambulance. Both of them fell into a ditch. The driver fled with the ambulance.				 																																										Sixty-year-old Sheikh Nasiruddin Ahmed , suffering from acute liver problems, died in custody in the jail hospital early on Tuesday. He was lodged in Alipore Central Jail on August 30 in connection with a power tapping case and released on bail on September 2. But the jail authorities could not send him back to his Maheshtala home on the same day since he was undergoing treatment at the hospital. It was decided that he would be released the next day. However, early on Tuesday, Nasiruddins condition deteriorated and he died in the jail hospital, said jail superintendent Ramapada Bhattacharya. He said the body was handed over to his son after a magistrate held an inquest on Wednesday. 				 																																										Justice Barin Ghosh of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday fined Mohammad Abbas Rs 5,000 for misleading the court by suppressing facts. The court also directed that from the realised amount, the School Service Commission (SSC) and the state government would get Rs 2,500 each as costs. Abbas had filed a case before Calcutta High Court that even after selection, the SSC did not allow him to join Baraz Madarsa in Burdwan as headmaster. On July 21, Justice Ghosh in his interim order criticised the SSC and directed that the petitioner be appointed headmaster. On July 28, the SSC filed a counter affidavit stating that Abbas had refused to accept the post in Baraz madarsa in 1999 and sought the same job in another madarsa in the same district. The next year, he was offered a job in another madarsa in the district but then he said he was ready to join Baraz Madarsa. The SSC told him that it was too late. Abbas then filed a suit in court.				 																																										Land for the proposed Rs 100-crore cancer hospital project  premises no. 58, 59 and 60, M.G. Road, Tollygunge  was inspected by SDO Sadar, Alipore, the competent authority, on Monday. The inspectors have sought the project details and plans, which have been duly submitted, according to A.N. Shroff, vice-president, Vishwa Jagriti Mission Trust (Calcutta), which is setting up the project. A report is being prepared to facilitate land-ceiling clearance. The promoters have promised to deliver within 18 months from the date of receiving clearance.				 																																										The occupants of four premises of Karnani Mansion (25, 25A, 27, 27A Park Street) raised Rs 44,000 from 60 residents and paid the sum as property tax due to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). The occupants lawyers informed the judges of the division bench of the high court hearing the matter about this on Wednesday. Justice S. Bannerjee and Justice P.N. Sinha had earlier advised the occupants to raise the money to pay the CMC. The owners of the buildings had told the court that they were not in a position to pay the property tax as they were not getting rents from the occupants.

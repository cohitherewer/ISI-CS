																								A commerce graduate by education, a police officer by profession, now in the corporate sector. Partha Pratim Majumdar is the quintessential jack of all trades, having worked in marketing, retail finance, PR, the police force and in schools. Knowledge is the vital tool of life, the 45-year-old explains. I am a multi-disciplinary man, because I believe that in life, everyone has many functions and sticking to just one is very restrictive.																								After graduating from Goenka College in 1978, he decided that a challenging job with plenty of action was the way forward. After making it to the Top 10 list in the All Bengal Entrance Exam, Majumdar went off to Police Training College. Fifty-two subjects, from judo and horse-riding to criminology and law, and gruelling 18-hour days had him hooked  driving him to third place.																								In 15 years as a police officer, the gallantry medal-winner has seen and done a bit and more. Being felicitated by community leaders for maintaining communal harmony and leading the Eastern Suburban Division to its first victory at the Calcutta Police Annual Sports Meet are just some of the achievements of Jyoti Basus former security officer.																								But just the job was never enough. Organising anti-drug campaigns, fire prevention and first-aid workshops, seminars on police administration and cultural programmes for Bijoya Dashami were all in a days work. During his two-year stint as vigilance officer at Burn Standard, the present Jenson amp; Nicholson (I) Ltd official was the youngest member of a committee appointed by Parliament to investigate financial and administrative anomalies.																								Three years into the 1990s, it was time for a dramatic departure. After resigning from the police force, the self-proclaimed man with many missions flitted from job to job. As regional director for an education company, he was engaged in sending students abroad for higher studies. A year each as administrative officer in Haryana Vidya Mandir and Lakshmipat Singhania School gave him the chance to explore the education sector, before moving into corporate chambers.																								Through it all, Majumdar has managed to pursue his two passions  learning and writing. A marketing management and research course, a post-graduate diploma in journalism from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, a post-graduate diploma in foreign trade from the Institute of Export Management in Calcutta and an MBA from Jadavpur University are under his belt.																								His pet project at the moment is Dream Profile, his brainchild. What Majumdar does is get the CVs of job-seekers to upgrade and fine-tune them according to the needs of the particular job. I love doing many different things at the same time, he sums up.

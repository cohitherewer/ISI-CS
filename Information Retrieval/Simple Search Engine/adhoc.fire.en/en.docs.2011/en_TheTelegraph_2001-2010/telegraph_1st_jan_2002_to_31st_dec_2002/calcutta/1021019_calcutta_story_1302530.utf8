 															- CM directive forces varsity to probe poor BA, B.Sc results MITA MUKHERJEE																								Alarmed at increasing complaints from examinees over poor marks in BA and B.Sc Part I examinations, conducted by Calcutta University (CU), the office of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has sought a clarification on this from the authorities. 																								The issue has prompted the university to take several steps to re-examine the answer-scripts of the aggrieved students and publish the reviewed results within a month from the last date of receiving the applications. Bhattacharjee had reportedly expressed concern over the results after complaints started pouring in from students.																								University sources said the chief ministers office had called up Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor, academic, last week and wanted to know the reasons behind the disastrous results, especially of those candidates who took the political science (honours) examination from Presidency College. Das had overseen the publication of the results that were declared on October 7. 																								The chief ministers office contacted the CU authorities on October 11, the day the university closed for the puja vacations. In the evening, vice-chancellor Ashis Banerjee, Das and some senior officials of the examination department held an emergency meeting to chalk out steps to resolve the situation.																								Das could not be contacted for comment as he had left for the US last Monday. The vice-chancellor, however, refused to divulge the details of the directive from the chief ministers office. He admitted that the university was concerned about the growing dissatisfaction among students who scored low marks. 																								Subrata Lahiri, senior teacher at Presidency College and member of the Calcutta University Syndicate, said the teachers of his institution were upset with this years Part I results, as such poor marks had not been recorded in previous examinations.																								It is not just political science where our students have fetched poor marks this year. We are surprised that several good students of our college have scored extremely low marks  some as low as 10 or 12 out of 100  in history and Hindi, said Lahiri.																								The political science results of Presidency College are said to be the worst as none of the candidates has been able to secure a first class. The highest a student got in political science (honours) is 231, nine marks less than a first-class.																								Not just Presidency, but principals of several colleges have written to me complaining that many good students have been awarded low marks in the Part I examinations. They have requested us to take steps to increase the marks of the aggrieved students, said Banerjee, adding that a decision on this matter would be made after the puja vacations.																								Apart from Presidency, students of other colleges, including Scottish Church, Lady Brabourne, Maulana Azad and Ashutosh, also complained of poor marks in the Part I examinations.

 Friday, November 08, 2002 				 Salt Lake rogue cops suspended
 AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR																								The two constables accused of beating up and snatching valuables from a Salt Lake businessman were back on duty on the same spot barely two days after being arrested. And they were apparently back in business  threatening the victim with dire consequences if he did not drop the charges against them.																								But before they could do any damage, Mrintunjoy Adhikary and Deepak Bhaumick, of the community policing section of Bidhannagar, were suspended, late on Thursday.																								The two, along with Deepak Barua, were on duty at Salt Lake early on November 1, when they allegedly robbed and assaulted Saket Anand Jha. With Barua absconding, Adhikary and Bhaumick were arrested on November 4. Sub-divisional judicial magistrate Subhendu Bhattacharya granted them interim bail on Wednesday and they were back at work on Thursday.																								I am scared, Jha told Metro. Adhikary and Bhaumick had allegedly assaulted him and snatched two gold necklaces early last Friday, while he was returning home after admitting his grandmother to a nursing home. Additional superintendent of police, Salt Lake, Ajay Nand said Adhikary and Bhaumick had been booked for robbery and assault in the Bidhannagar (South) police station (case no. 174, dated November 3). Nand said he was bound by rules to take them back on the beat as they had not been convicted.																								But with the case drawing the attention of the police top-brass, SP (north) M. Harisena Verma issued suspension notices on Adhikary, Bhaumick and Barua.

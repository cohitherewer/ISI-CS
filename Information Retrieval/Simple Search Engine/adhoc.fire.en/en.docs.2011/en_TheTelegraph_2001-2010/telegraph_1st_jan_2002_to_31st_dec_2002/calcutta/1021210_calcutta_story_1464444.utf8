 Tuesday, December 10, 2002 				 Rescue plea for killer dogs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The killer dogs, that mauled to death a worker in a mineral water-bottling plant in Barasat last Tuesday, are now in a stable condition and need not be snared into custody immediately, according to North 24-Parganas district magistrate H.K. Dwivedi.																								The district magistrate (DM) has received an appeal from the Compassionate Crusaders Trust (CCT), an animal-welfare NGO, which has offered to rescue and rehabilitate the dogs, should the authorities take custody of the animals.																								We will do the needful to see to it that no senseless violence or cruelty is meted out to the dogs in future, the CCT appeal said.																								Dwivedi told Metro on Monday that he has forwarded the appeal to the animal husbandry department. Vets have examined the canines and at the moment, they are not showing signs of rabies or any other infectious disease. So, we will wait and watch, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, October 12, 2002 Story  By the goddess, as bizarre as it  gets From snatches  of lomg-playing records to crushed sugarcane,from body-scrubs  to biscuits you cant bite --The Devi's address has gone  from sublime to the strange like never before
 'Bosepukur  Talbagan Sarbojanin:
 RECORD-BREAKER
 The results are not out yet, but this Kasba puja has  already broken quite a few records  more than 60,000,  by conservative official estimates. Hemanta Mukherjee,  on a Columbia disc, is doing duty on a panel on the  gate, as are Lata and Kishore on an Odeon 45 RPM.  The price: just 10-15 paise per long-playing record,  according to creator Pradip Dey, who got the idea  from scrap dealers weighing broken records in Gopalnagar.  Picture by Pabitra Das 
 Rajdanga  Nabauday Sangha: 
 BISCUIT BASTION
 Ma, why have they pasted biscuits on the walls? Can  I eat one? asks a toddlerin this Kasba pandal. Thirty  kinds of biscuits and breadsticks have added crunch  to the Devi and the dcor. The grounds have been specially  pest-controlled for two months to keep creepy-crawlies  away. The biscuits have been toughened in a heat chamber,  but creator Kishor Das is keeping his fingers crossed  that the rain god doesnt melt down his efforts. Picture  by Pabitra Das 
 Bosepukur  Sitala Mandir:
 SWEET SUCCESS
 Theres no stopping the creative juices from flowing  free, again at Kasba. Its sugarcane pulp this year,  after last years clay-cup wonder. Creator Bandan  Raha has kept the cane-crushing machines busy and  the juice-makers in business for over 45 days now.  Six to seven lorries of sugarcane have been squeezed  dry. And the refuse is on view on the 72 panels (depicting  Lord Krishnas childhood antics), walls and the huge  lantern. No entry for flies or fire, insist the organisers,  thanks to an anti-moisturiser sunbath and a liberal  sprinkling of anti-fire lotion.

 SPLIT is showing
 How long will Bengal remain neglected by the Central  government? is the key question at Lebutala Park.  Bifurcation of the Eastern Railway is the theme here:  depicted by a black chain that cleaves the Fairlie  Place building replica. Adding a historical twist  to the power-play pandal is the model of the first  engine, made in 1862 in Glasgow, that is stopped dead  in its uprooted tracks at Dhanbad by pro-bifurcation  activists. No Puja prizes for guessing who green-flagged  this pandal? Mamata no-bifurcation Banerjee, of course.  Picture by Pradip Sanyal Karbagan Sarbojanin Durgotsav:
 NEXT TO GODLINESS
 If  ever there was a pandal promoting personal hygiene,  this is it. The organisers cleaned out the markets  in the city (and a few districts, too), to gather  over 40,000 loofahs (body-scrubs) that deck the  interiors and exteriors of the Ultadanga pandal.  There is social conscience at work behind this  out-of-the-bathroom idea  inspire people to move  away from the popular synthetic scrubs, and back  towards their roots, to help the poor farmers eke  out a living. The Devi is, thankfully, made from  the more traditional mati. Picture by Aranya  Sen

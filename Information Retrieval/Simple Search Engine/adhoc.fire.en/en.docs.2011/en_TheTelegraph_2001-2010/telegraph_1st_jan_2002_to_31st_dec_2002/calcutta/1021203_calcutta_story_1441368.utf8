The Telegraph - Calcutta : Calcutta
		 Tuesday, December 03, 2002  Star Spot
				 	MOHIT BENGANI																									Said the guy at the recording studio when told that the voice belting out Lucky Ali and Enrique Iglesias belonged to a 13-year-old. He isnt the first  or the last  listener to be floored by the maturity in Mohits rendering of pop picks.																									For this Class VII student of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Proof of the pudding  top honours for the singer at Bata Quest 2001 and for the singer-actor-dancer at school fest Abhilasha 2002; second spot in Bharat Vikas Parishads Pukar 2002 and at the Bournvita quiz contest																									Does Kittu  as hes known at home  hope to spread the word. So, from student gigs to the big thing  hes already sailed past the All India Radio voice test and is registered on their rolls of promising singers.																									Is Mohits magic combo. One has been all encouragement at home while the other has always laid store by his talent on string and mike. And a special mention for the school as well, which has been supportive enough to juggle attendance and exams to help this star student.																									He balances well, handling everything but maths like a song sung true. His creative writing is neighbours-envy material, vouch teachers, but penning poetry has sadly been overtaken by every spare minute listening  to matters of the heart from Cliff Richard to Shaan, Westlife to Udit Narayan  and rehearsing.																									For once, cricket craze lost out to pop passion. Till a couple of years ago, Mohit was undecided whether to take the Tendulkar track or the Jackson jump. After hours spent at the batting crease, mike and moonwalk scored.																									For this Marwari minstrel in the making, but the road ahead could be paved with notes of a different kind. He hopes to give music a serious shot and dreams of the day hell be a name to beckon as singer and guitarist. Not singing to others tunes, but composing his own stuff.																									In Mohits mind. The word impossible sounds better when broken up into Im possible, cracks the just-turned teen.

 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 Experts file city birthday report
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Historian Nemai Sadhan Bose, former vice-chancellor of Visva- Bharati and chairman of the expert committee set up by the high court to ascertain the birth date of Calcutta, submitted a nine-page report to the registrar-general on Tuesday.																								The division bench, presided over by Chief Justice Ashok Kumar Mathur, constituted an expert committee to determine Calcuttas birthday after a joint petition was filed by the Sabarno Roy Choudhury Paribar Parishad and some eminent citizens, challenging the validity of August 24 as the citys birthday. They allege that Calcutta was founded much before 1695.																								The division bench is expected to hear the matter on November 22, when the seal on the report will be broken in the presence of the lawyers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, December 25, 2002 				 																				B.B. Paira								Director, Heritage Institute of Technology																																							No reservation is the ideal situation. If students from all provinces study together, it will promote national integration on campus. Once the students pass out, they will have to face competition at the national level in the job market, anyway. When our boys and girls can go and study in other states, why should we not allow candidates from elsewhere to come here? But some reservation is necessary as a transitional measure. From 100 per cent to nil reservation is not an acceptable situation.

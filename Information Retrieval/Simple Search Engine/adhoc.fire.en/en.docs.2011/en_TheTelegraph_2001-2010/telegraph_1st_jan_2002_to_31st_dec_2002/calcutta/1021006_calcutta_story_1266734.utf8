 A STAFF REPORTER																								Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan is coming up with a state-of-the art paediatric unit on a 14-cottah plot opposite the hospital on Sarat Bose Road.																								The new unit, equipped with intensive neonatal care facilities, ventilators and incubators, will also serve as a referral hospital in West Bengal. At present, the states only referral hospital is B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children. We have been considering the proposal as the city urgently needs a specialised paediatric unit, said Pratisthan secretary Swami Sarvalokananda.																								The Pratisthan authorities got possession of the plot after relocating 74 slum-dwellers. Once the new hospital comes up, the authorities will shift the 30-bed paediatric ward of the existing hospital to the new building.																								An obstetrics intensive care unit was inaugurated at the Pratisthan on Saturday. It will serve as a 24-hour care centre for women who complain of less foetal movement during the advanced stages of pregnancy. 																								A Cardio Toco Gram (CTG) machine has also been installed at the centre recently. The machine will help us determine whether a woman needs to undergo premature caesarean section or not, said gynaecologist Sajal Dutta. Earlier, a patient complaining of less foetal movement had to be monitored for days in the hospital. The machine will enable us to take an instant decision about her condition, Dutta added. The centre will have 10 resident doctors on round-the-clock duty.																								The hospital has also procured an autoclave machine for sterilisation of medical instruments, the secretary added. 																								Cyclotron centre																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee laid the foundation stone of a medical cyclotron centre at Salt Lake on Friday. 																								Bikash Sinha, director of Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics and Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, was present on the occasion. Sinha said the government had allotted a 5.2-acre plot on the EM Bypass for the centre which will come up in two years. A first in India, the centre will help produce thalium chloride for the diagnosis of heart and artery malfunctioning.

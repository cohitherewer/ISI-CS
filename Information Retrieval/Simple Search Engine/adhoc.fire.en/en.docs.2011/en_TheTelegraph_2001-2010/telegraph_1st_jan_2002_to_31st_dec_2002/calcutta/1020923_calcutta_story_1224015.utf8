 A STAFF REPORTER																								Behala will soon have a park with a difference. 																								Around a lakh residents of Behala West will enjoy the benefits of this eco-friendly park, to be set up on a 10-bigha plot. 																								The man behind the project is local Trinamul Congress councillor Anjan Das. If all goes well, work on the proposed park will start after the Pujas. When completed, it will be one of the largest parks in the city, said Das.																								The spot where the proposed park will come up was earlier a dumping ground and a den for criminals. Till the mid-90s, smugglers and criminals would carry out anti-social activities in the area. 																								Around this time, garbage used to pile up to the height of two-storeyed buildings and the area would stink, posing health problems for the residents. It was then we decided to do something about it. Once the park comes up, at least the areas residents will be spared the stink, said Das. 																								Elaborating on the project, Das said that apart from the usual equipment like swings, roundabouts and see-saws for children, rare trees would be planted to add a touch of green to the project. 																								Apart from children, senior citizens can use the park for their morning and evening walks, said Das. 																								Also on the cards is a gymnasium and a clubhouse for the youth. The project is expected to cost around Rs 30 lakh.																								Already, local Trinamul MP Krishna Basu has donated Rs 5 lakh for the proposed park. MLA Partha Chatterjee and Rajya Sabha MP Dinesh Trivedi, too, have promised to provide Rs 4 lakh each for the development of the park.																								Since sponsors are not willing, we have to depend on donations to lay the park. If necessary, we will appeal to the areas residents to contribute to the project. A project of this kind, naturally, needs a large sum of money, added Das.

 Friday, December 27, 2002 				 Cop quarters waterline cut
 A STAFF REPORTER																								More then 250 families at the Jadavpur Police Lines, in South 24-Parganas, will have to do without drinking water as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) disconnected their supply line on Thursday. The decision was taken after the district police failed to pay up dues to the tune of Rs 6.42 lakh, despite reminders.																								Earlier, residents of Kamarhati, after a three-day crisis, had their water supply line restored on Thursday. Sources said mayor Subrata Mukherjee had directed the water supply department to restore services after verifying the issue with the chairman of the municipality, Govinda Ganguly.																								On Thursday, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya inspected the progress of the proposed Rs 20-crore southern drainage pumping station, along with mayor Mukherjee and mayor-in-council (drainage amp; sewerage) member Rajib Deb. The pumping station has been funded by the CMC and is likely to function from June.

 Thursday, November 21, 2002 				 Vagrant halts Sealdah run
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An unmindful vagrant caused disruption of train services in the Sealdah division for over two hours on Wednesday. Trains on all the routes, including the main line and the Dankuni and Bongaon sections, were held up at various stations.																								Trouble started when the woman, cooking a meal on some concrete slabs in the railway yard, failed to notice a piece of burning wood falling through the slabs on to some cable ducts of the route-relay interlocking (RRI) system. The cables got singed, stalling trains around 10.30 am.																								None of the trains could leave Sealdah or arrive at the station, said Dulal Mitra, divisional railway manager, Sealdah. As engineers and technicians set about repairing the snag, Mitra himself conducted a raid on the platform. We could not round up the culprit but intercepted four others who, too, were cooking in the yard, close to the tracks and railway installations, Mitra added. Services resumed only after 12.50 pm, when the RRI system limped back to life.

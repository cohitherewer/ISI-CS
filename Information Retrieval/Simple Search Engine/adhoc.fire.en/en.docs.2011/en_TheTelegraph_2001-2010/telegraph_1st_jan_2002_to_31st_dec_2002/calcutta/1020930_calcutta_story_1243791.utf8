																								Bikash Bhattacharjee, the genius as we know him through his pastels and oils, showed early promise. Bikash Bhattacharjee: Early Drawings showcases Bhattacharjees pastels done 40 years ago, when he was a final year art college student. These paintings, done mostly in the live classes or elsewhere, are not merely the works of a talented trainee artist, rather they look like studies by an accomplished painter. In fact, more than studies, most of these are finished works in the totality of their treatment. But certainly, these paintings are exercises in which the young artist practises, measures and tests his own skills of negotiating on the canvas the most difficult and tricky hurdles of defining all the visual nuances of shape and forms in bare human bodies. The disciplined skills that Bhattacharjee mastered early are abundantly evident in the ongoing show and his paintings sparkle with a mature visual intelligence.

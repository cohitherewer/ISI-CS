The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, November 12, 2002 				 Chokher Bali
																								Based on Rabindranath Tagores novel of the same name which was first published in a serialised form in 1901, this contemporary dramatic production (scripted by Partha Chatterjee) centres around Binodini, a young widow who finds refuge from neglect and poverty in a rich household in Calcutta. She then becomes entangled in complex relationships with two men, Mahendra and Bihari, and the two other claimants of Mahendras affections  his mother, Rajlakshmi, and wife, Ashalata. It is not the conventional story of exploitation of women by a traditional society, but rather an attempt to trace individual characters as represented by Rajlakshmi, the traditionalist and the modernist, Binodini. The latter did not want to fade into oblivion like other widows of her time. Yet, Tagore sent her off to Kashi. A century later, the new adaptation of Chokher Bali gives her a fresh lease of life. Eminent social scientist Partha Chatterjee, in his new script of Chokher Bali, explores Binodini in yet another light. This Kushilav production is directed by Runu Chowdhury.

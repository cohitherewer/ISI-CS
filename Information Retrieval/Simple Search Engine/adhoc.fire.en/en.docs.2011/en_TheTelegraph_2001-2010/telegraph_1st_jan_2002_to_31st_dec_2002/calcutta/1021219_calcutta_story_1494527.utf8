 Thursday, December 19, 2002 				 Entry hike at Cuba-theme book fair 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Erida Grevara, daughter of Cuban President Fidel Castro, is likely to visit the Calcutta Book Fair, to be held from January 29 to February 9, 2003.																								Kalyan Shah, general secretary of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, said on Wednesday: We have chosen Cuba as the focal theme and partner-country for the 28th Calcutta Book Fair, as the 150th birth anniversary of Jose Marti, the revolutionary Cuban poet, falls on January 28. Noted Cuban author Luis Toledo Sande will inaugurate the fair.																								Frank Agiireo Gomez, director-general and editor of Granma International, the largest circulated daily in Cuba, will deliver the Ashoke Kumar Sarkar Memorial Lecture at the fair. A film festival, with select films from Cuba, will be screened at Nandan during the fair.																								The entry fee has been raised by a rupee, though the price of the season ticket remains the same, Guild officials said. The rent of stalls, too, has not been hiked.																								Although visitors will be warned about fire-related accidents, there will be no strict measures on behalf of the organisers. We dont want the visitors to face any inconvenience, an official said.																								Like last year, the visitors will enjoy an insurance cover of Rs 50,000. If any visitor falls ill inside the fair or meets with any kind of accident, then they will be entitled to insurance cover, confirmed Shah. This will extend to 150 metres outside the fair.

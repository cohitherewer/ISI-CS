The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, September 29, 2002 				 Drug racket bust nets one
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A drug peddler was picked up during a raid in Howrah on Saturday. Shiv Kumar Shaw, 40, was caught near a highrise. A consignment of heroin, worth Rs 10 lakh, was recovered from him. 																								Shaw confessed to the Howrah police that he had set up base in a slum behind the highrise. He would recruit teenagers to peddle drugs in Howrah and Calcutta. Some of them have already been rounded up. More raids will be carried out in Howrah on Sunday.																								Such rackets have reportedly extended to the Northeast as well. An arrest in September 2001 in Burdwan had shed light on the drug-peddling network. 																								nExtortion probe: The Salt Lake SDPO has ordered an inquiry to track down the policemen who had allegedly harassed and extorted money from two IT professionals of a Saltlec-based IT firm. The report was carried in Metro on Saturday. I am heading the inquiry team and we will take appropriate steps against the policemen. But the process will become easier if we get an official complaint from the two men, said Sujoy K. Chandra, SDPO, Salt Lake.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Feel that early-morning and late-night nip in the air, even though its not yet November? Its the northern wind blowing, not winter come early, says the weatherman. Temperatures have dropped to two to three degrees below normal these past few days, confirmed Alipore Met office director-general R.N. Goldar.																								But he was quick to attribute the phenomenon to the cool northerly winds blowing for the past three days. This does not mean winter has arrived early. The temperature can rise any day. This kind of a development is normal, Goldar added. Pushing the barometer further down was the clear sky this week. But on Wednesday, the Met office spied cloud formations, suggesting that temperatures may rise in the next few days.

 Sunday, December 29, 2002 				 CPI lines up rally for bigger say
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The CPI, one of the constituents of the ruling Left Front, is likely to voice its protest against the CPMs big-brotherly attitude and demand more importance in the coalition at Sundays rally on the Brigade Parade Ground.																								CPI leaders said on Saturday that they would raise some serious issues concerning the functioning of the ruling Front and its unity in the run-up to the panchayat elections, slated for 2003, in Bengal.																								The party mandarins have held the CPM responsible several times for jeopardising unity among Front partners by encouraging in-fighting and taking several decisions related to the governance of the state unilaterally, without bothering to discuss them at the Front level.																								The CPI is holding its rally on the Brigade Parade Ground after nine years and has taken all possible measures to make it a success. Party general secretary A.B. Bardhan is among those who will address the meet.

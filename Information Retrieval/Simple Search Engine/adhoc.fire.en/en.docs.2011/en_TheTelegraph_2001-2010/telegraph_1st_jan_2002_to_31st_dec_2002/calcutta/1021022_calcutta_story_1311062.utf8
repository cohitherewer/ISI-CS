 Tuesday, October 22, 2002 				 Cash, gold robbed from traders flat
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a daring robbery in south Calcutta on Sunday night, goons scaled the drainpipe of a traders apartment and escaped with Rs 4 lakh in cash, along with gold ornaments.																								While tr ader Prakash Saha and his family were busy with Lakshmi puja, the robbers raided their fourth-floor apartment on Southern Avenue and escaped with the booty. Police suspect the role of more than one person in the incident. 																								Deputy commissioner of police, south, Kuldeep Singh, said Saha lodged a complaint at Tollygunge police station. A team went to the spot. But there are a few loose ends in the robbery, Singh said. It is strange that despite the presence of several guards in the building, no one noticed the robbers reach the fourth-floor apartment. The miscreants had broken a bathroom window to reach the bedroom, where the safe was kept, he added.																								According to an officer, the sound of glasspanes being broken should have alerted the guards and neighbours. No one seems to know anything. The robbers were well-informed about where the money was kept. Maybe an insider is involved in the crime. Going by the modus operandi, the whole operation did not take much time, the police said. Three people have been detained in connection with the robbery.

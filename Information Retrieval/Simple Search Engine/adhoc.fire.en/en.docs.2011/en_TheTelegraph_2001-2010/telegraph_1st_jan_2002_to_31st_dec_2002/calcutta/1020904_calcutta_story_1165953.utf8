Justice D.P. Wadhwa, president, National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, in a letter to state chief secretary S.N. Roy, said the courts do not belong to any department of the state government. He said the move to shift the Calcutta district courts, without the state commissions knowledge, was not acceptable.

In view of the commissions intervention, lawyers and consumer organisations will be back in action from Wednesday.

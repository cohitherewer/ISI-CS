				 																																									While I was on my motorcycle with my wife the other day, an auto-rickshaw flouted the traffic light and knocked us down at the Pratapaditya Road-Sadananda Road crossing. Much to my dismay, although we were injured, the mob, mostly auto drivers from the nearby stand, blamed me for the accident. It is time the authorities take action against errant auto drivers				 																																									Name and address withheld				 																																									The number of stray dogs in the city has increased alarmingly over the past few years. The CMC should take action to sterilise the dogs. They are a menace in front of food shops. It is also pathetic when puppies come under the wheels of vehicles.				 																																									Bhupen Nath Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum Park

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Calcutta
		 Tuesday, September 24, 2002  Star Spot
																									Dekh, and you are most likely to see Mahesh there, living it up at Pizza Hut. The 18-year-old likes chilling out with friends, but that doesnt stop the Class XII student of Don Bosco Liluah from making his presence felt where it counts.																									After the calorie-fest. This jock has played for his school in the Under-16 and Under-19 CAB district matches, 1999-2000 and 2001-02. Ever since he was a kid, he has been representing his class in cricket, football, volleyball, basketball and carrom. Could take up pro cricket, but not before his Board exams.																									At a Tug of War last year at the Calcutta Girls fest, rocked the ramp at the Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan fest fashion show, rolled out the Rangoli, sent em flying at a bowling tourney, led the players in a drama show, shook a leg, all at the inter-school level. Has held the mike a few times, too, shooting off questions at the inter-class quiz he organised this year.																									At school. Being the keeper of the discipline and decorum of the school may not be a loveable job, but someones gotta do it. The ex-class monitor has had plenty of experience. Leads by example, and has received certificates for full attendance in school for the past four years. Has the energy left to co-ordinate The Telegraph In Schools activities at DBL.																									Is the Mahesh motto, as he goes around bagging bites from the likes of Madhuri Dixit, Karisma Kapoor, Taslima Nasreen, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and Governor Viren J. Shah. He doesnt shirk his books, either. The guy who has been awarded for academic excellence, is on his way to do his school proud at the All India Reynolds Scholarship Contest. Then, MBA and Mass Com beckon this fan of Amitabh, Sachin and dad.																									Is our man who is treasurer of the Friends Club, a social group. Mahesh here has organised anti-pollution rallies, distribution of clothes to the poor and street plays. Was part of the Dream Environment Drive in March 1998, a rally against pollution. Spends his summer holiday mornings teaching the kids of the schools non-teaching staff.

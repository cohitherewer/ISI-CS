 Monday, November 04, 2002 				 Twin probes for officer assault on constable
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police chief on Sunday directed two senior officers to separately probe the alleged assault by an off-duty sergeant on a constable. And the two  Aniruddha Panda and Nityananda Majhi  continued to trade charges the day after the ugly incident.																								Panda, travelling in a taxi, was caught in a traffic snarl near R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital late on Saturday. Constable Majhi, who was manning the crossing, said Panda suddenly confronted him and abused him for causing the traffic chaos. When Majhi protested, Panda punched him in the face and on the chest.																								The constable has been admitted to the city police hospital, where doctors said his condition was stable.																								Sources said police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty has directed deputy commissioner, traffic, M.K. Singh, and deputy commissioner, reserve force, Debashis Roy, to probe the incident separately.																								While Panda is with the reserve force, Majhi is attached to the Shyambazar traffic guard. There was a traffic jam near R.G. Kar but it was not the constables fault, said an officer of the Shyambazar traffic guard.																								Panda, however, told senior officers that he saw Majhi taking money from a lorry parked in the middle of the road. He went up, identified himself and admonished the constable. But Majhi, claimed Panda, abused him. The sergeant then lost his cool and pushed the constable away, before returning to the taxi.																								According to the Lalbazar police control room, Singh and Roy will visit Majhi in hospital for a blow-by-blow account.

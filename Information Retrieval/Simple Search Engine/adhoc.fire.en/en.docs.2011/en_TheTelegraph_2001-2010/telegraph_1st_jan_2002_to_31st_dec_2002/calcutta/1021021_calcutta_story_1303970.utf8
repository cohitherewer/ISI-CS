																								Usha Ganguli is one of Indias well-known theatre directors, who has been leading Rangakarmee for nearly 25 years. Yet, she still remains essentially an actress who loves to take on challenging roles. Her artistic growth as an actress has been rooted in a concern to react and respond to all those forces that inhibit the fulfilment of humanity. The characters she has played over the years have been, for her, experiences of living other lives and learning the modes of survival and the struggles they call for - in different situations. The women she has created and lived on stage have been drawn on Gorky, Ibsen, Wesker, Kroetz, Brecht, Franca Rame, Dario Fo, Rabindra Nath Tagore and contemporary Indian playwrights including Mahesh Elkunchwar, Ratnakar Matkari, Mannu Bhandari, Mahasweta Devi and Shafaat Khan, and above everything else, on the plight of women living in different social and economic strata. As she plays out some of these roles in this collage of acts ( quot;...in conversation with my characters quot;), she demonstrates her negotiations with a rich and complex reality through her performance. This Rangakarmee production is written, directed, designed and performed by Ganguli. The innovative set has been designed by Khaled Choudhury, recipient of this years prestigious Kalidas Samman.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

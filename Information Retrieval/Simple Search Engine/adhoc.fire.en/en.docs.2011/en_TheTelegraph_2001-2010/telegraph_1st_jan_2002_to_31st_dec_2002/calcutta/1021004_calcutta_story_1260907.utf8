The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 04, 2002  The City Diary
				 																																										lWorried at the recent spate of malaria cases in the city, the state government has asked the civic health department to step up its anti-malaria drive. According to state government figures till September, 8, 877 persons were detected with malaria, compared to 8, 406 in 2001. The CMC has, however, refuted the governments claim. Officially, three persons died of malignant malaria in September, although sources put the figure at nine. The government has asked the civic department concerned to gear up to counter the menace in October and November, when risk of the disease striking the city is the highest.				 																																										Justice G.C. Dey of Calcutta High Court on Thursday admitted a petition filed by US-based doctor Kunal Saha, challenging the verdict of the trial court acquitting physician Abani Roy Chowdhury in the Anuradha Saha death case. The court has fixed the matter for hearing two weeks after the Puja vacation. 				 																																										A full-bench meeting of the judges of Calcutta High Court, presided over by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur, on Thursday discussed the enhancement of payscale of state judicial officers. The Supreme Court in March 2002 passed a verdict directing the state authorities to re-fix the salaries of the judges and to provide them with some other facilities. The court also directed the state governments and the high courts to appoint 50 judges for every 10,000 people. At present, there are 550 judicial officers (including judges and magistrates) in West Bengal. The state government has prepared a panel of 57 persons for appointment of judges to 125 vacant posts in sub-ordinate courts.				 																																										A high court division bench, comprising Justice A. Talukdar and Justice A. Barua, on Thursday rejected the bail prayer of Arshed Hossein, a resident of Beniapukur. Hossein was arrested for allegedly taking money from unemployed youth by promising them jobs in Singapore. Police said Hossein had collected Rs 7.5 lakh this manner. 				 																																										Railway police personnel posted at Sealdah were felicitated by the state wildlife department for outstanding efforts in stopping endangered varieties of birds and animals from being smuggled out of the country.

BOOKS				 																																	 Gayatrike  Facsimile edition of selected verses composed by Benoy Majumdar; published by Pratibhas, Calcutta; Rs 60.00.				 																																	omposed four decades ago in his youth, Majumdars writings had been confined mostly among connoisseurs of Bengali literature who consider him a living icon of modern Bengali poetry in the post-Tagore era. A hero of the Hungry Generation of the heady Sixties, Majumdar spearheaded the movement to free poetry from the old, traditional mould in which it was safely ensconced. An extremely bold and intense poet, Majumdars creations have so long remained inaccessible to contemporary poetry lovers. This special edition is a gift to poetry lovers to realise the potential and power of contemporary Bengali poetry.

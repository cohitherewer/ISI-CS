				 																																										lWith new traffic regulations coming into force, there were widespread snarl-ups in south and central Calcutta on Wednesday. Police closed the stretch of AJC Bose Road from the Rabindra Sadan-Chowringhee Road intersection to facilitate construction of a flyover. It had a ripple effect in Harish Mukherjee Road, Theatre Road, Park Street, Minto Park, Ballygunge Circular Road, Asutosh Mukherjee Road and surrounding areas. Traffic moving towards Minto Park from Alipore and Kidderpore was diverted through Cathedral Road and then to Chowringhee Road. They took the left turn from there to proceed towards Moulali and Sealdah, deputy commissioner of police, traffic, M.K Singh said. We were forced to withdraw one-way regulations on the stretch of Chowringhee Road from the Theatre Road intersection to the AJC Bose crossing, he added. Striking lawyers added to the confusion by holding a sit-in on Asutosh Mukherjee Road near the Hazra four-point intersection on Wednesday noon to protest the court fee-hike. The agitation threw vehicular movement out of gear in the area. 				 																																										At least seven persons, including a child, were injured in a stampede at Science Park in Ashoknagar, North 24-Parganas, on Wednesday. A huge gathering at the park, which was earlier inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, tried to get in as soon as he left. However, the authorities locked the main gate and opened two other smaller gates, causing the stampede. All the injured have been admitted to a local hospital. A seven-year-old child and two women were among the injured. State finance minister Asim Dasgupta and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya were present at the inauguration. 				 																																										One man was arrested on Wednesday in front of the Writers Buildings for allegedly cheating unemployed youths with false promises of jobs. The man is being interrogated at Hare Street police station. Another man was arrested on cheating charges on Wednesday near CIT Road. The man, owner of an advertisement firm, had allegedly taken Rs 2,15,000 from another man promising to make him a franchisee of his company and also give him a share of the profits.				 																																										 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee requested municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharaya for legislation to enhance the trade enlistment fee of the CMC to Rs 2500. Under the CMC Act-1980, civic authorities cannot charge more than Rs 10 as trade enlistment fee. The CMC was forced to discontinue the collection of trade licence fees from city traders as the state government was collecting professional tax from them. The government through an enactment had already allowed the municipalities to collect trade enlistment fees up to a limit of Rs 500.				 																																										The mayor announced on Wednesday that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had agreed to unveil a bronze statue of Indira Gandhi at ITC Park near Birla Planetarium on Republic Day.

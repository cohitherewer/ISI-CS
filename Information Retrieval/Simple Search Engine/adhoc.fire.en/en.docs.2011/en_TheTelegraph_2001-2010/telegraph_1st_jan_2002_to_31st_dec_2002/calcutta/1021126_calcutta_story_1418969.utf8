 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 					 					 It's Your Birthday So...Travel is on the cards. You will now get a chance to act on old plans. You will be involved in many relationships in the year ahead. A good year for self-improvement. It will be relatively easy for you to sell your ideas and push through projects.  Kusum Bhandari

		 Tuesday, December 10, 2002  Star Spot
				 	SMITA BHANDARI																									A designer of garments, a girl with grit. The 24-year-old who has graduated from the National Institute of Fashion Technology this year has shown that she has what it takes to make hers a household name.																									Does the girl, who draws inspiration from R. Kelleys Space Jam song. The peak for her would be seeing her name on the labels in every teens wardrobe in the city. She has started working towards it too, and is now called chief designer for Kosa, a label she launched with a senior from NIFT Delhi, who was also a teacher at the Calcutta branch.																									May save nine, but this green-belt in karate has taken her time to decide which field to pursue. She has the degrees to show for it too. The former basketball and throwball player has a Bachelors degree in commerce and a diploma in fashion design from BILAMS, after concluding which she signed up at NIFT. Even now, she has a finger in more than one design house. She is working part time in fabric development at Epic Exports, too.																									Come naturally to this ex-student of Ashok Hall, who was well known for her propensity to empty everyones tiffin box. Started writing for local English dailies when just a kid, and by Class XI, she had designed the school newsletter, Ashok Hall Times. Interviewed the likes of Suneet Verma and Tarun Tahiliani. Managed not one, but two lengthy interviews with her idol, Sachin Tendulkar, one of which was published across columns in a city paper. Has continued writing on a number of subjects  from fashion to theatre, cosmetic surgery to vegetable dyes  through college and institute days alike.																									Can go hand in hand for the design dame. The funky, cool, price effective clothes of the Kosa line rub shoulders with her work with traditional artisans and craftsmen in the villages. The gal who, as part of her course, conducted research on dying crafts and textiles in rural regions near Bangalorewould like to revive some of the local dying arts, integrating them into her work.

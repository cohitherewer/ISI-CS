 Saturday, October 26, 2002 				 Evaluation of a multi-faceted talent
																								Ashoketaru Bandopadhyay, the revered exponent of Rabindrasangeet, was also synonymous with Valmikis role in Tagores Valmiki Pratibha. On the occasion of his birth anniversary, Taru-Shruti, an organisation founded by him, pays homage to this versatile artiste with an offering of Tagore songs by seven of his senior disciples and a lecture-demonstration on Dhrupadi Shilpi Ashoketaru, based on the artistes own renderings along with a discussion by scientist-musicologist Debabrata Mukhopadhyay. Bandopadhyays mother came from the illustrious Bramho Samajist family of Nishikanto Basu. Bandopadhyay grew amid Bramho Sangeet and was intensely drawn towards music from a very early age. His formal training in classical music began at the tender age of four. His first guru was Rabindra Lal Roy (brother of D.L. Roy and father of noted classical vocalist Malabika Kanan). His classical music training continued under V.V. Wazelwar at Santiniketan. Meanwhile, he began training in Rabindrasangeet from Sailajaranjan Mazumdar. He started his professional career as a musician at the age of 18. Simultaneously, he continued his training in Dhrupad, Dhamar and Khayal from Suresh Chandra Chakraborty. Chakraborty later advised him to take up Rabindrasangeet seriously. His rendition of Raag Kanada was most appreciated by connoisseurs of music. Bandopadhyays deep, melodious voice and his sound classical grooming gave him a definite edge and he was instrumental in popularising many lesser-known Rabindrasangeet numbers.																								When: Tomorrow at 6 pm																								Where: Abanindra Sabhaghar (Charukala Bhavan, Calcutta Information Centre)

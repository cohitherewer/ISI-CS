 Tuesday, November 26, 2002 				 Presidency teacher wins a breather
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two days after his transfer from the state run-Presidency College to Chandernagore Government College, Emanul Haque, the controversial Bengali teacher, won a reprieve on Monday.																								The state administrative tribunal (SAT) stayed his transfer till December 20, which appears to have been ordered on account of his constant complaints against the government on various issues.																								The governments position on Haque was becoming inflexible ever since he started speaking out, at times provoking his students into taking an anti-government stand. He was critical of issues such as the screening of the controversial film on Lenin, Tauras, the states campaign against the Naxalite Peoples War (PW) and the arrest some time ago of Kaushik Ganguly, the Rajabazar Science College teacher, for suspected PW links.																								Haque, who was served the notice on Friday, had filed an appeal with the tribunal against his untimely transfer on the same day. 																								It is learnt that the state government has not taken kindly to Haques criticism of the arrest of Kaushik Ganguly, and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees initial stand vis--vis madarsas. He is also believed to have earned the ruling CPMs ire by opposing the partys stand on screening a controversial film on Lenin at Nandan.																								I have full faith in the countrys judiciary and I hope to get justice, said Haque, after getting the tribunals interim order. The order was given by SATs third judge, S.B. Aich.																								There was resentment at Presidency College on Saturday after some students of the Bengali department protested Haques untimely transfer. They organised a signature campaign and submitted a memorandum to the authorities against the transfer. They opposed the decision, saying that Haque had joined the college a little over a year ago. According to norms, a teacher can be transferred after he has served an institution for at least four years.

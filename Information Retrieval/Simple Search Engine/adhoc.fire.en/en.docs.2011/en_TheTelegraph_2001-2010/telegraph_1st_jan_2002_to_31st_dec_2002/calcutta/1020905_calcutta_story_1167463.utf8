Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								This festive season, music aficionados in Calcutta could have a rare treat in store. Legendary violinist-composer Dr L. Subramaniam is keen to do a concert in the city with French virtuoso Jean-Luc Ponty, the wizard of the electric violin.																								I have collaborated with Jean-Luc on various studio projects, but have never played with him on stage. Its been a long-standing desire to do a live concert with him and I want to do the first series of duets in India, Subramaniam said, after inaugurating a weeklong festival of South Indian music at MusicWorld on Wednesday.																								Subramaniam, who has a brief window between October 28 and November 2 in his hectic tour schedule, wants to squeeze in three evenings with Ponty during that period. I am already in dialogue with Jean-Luc and Calcutta is surely one of the stops we are looking at, the maestro confirmed, adding that wife Kavita and daughter Sita will join them on stage.																								Everything depends on corporate support and we are talking to event-management agencies to try and make the series happen, he added. 																								Subramaniam, who had earlier collaborated with Stephane Grappelli to create the milestone album, Conversations, is also planning to bring a global music festival to Calcutta in January.																								Calcutta is an absolutely amazing city for musicians, smiled Subramaniam, who will present Ustad Rashid Khan and Pandit Anindo Chatterjee as part of the Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival window at the Berlin Festival (October 14-18) this year.																								Subramaniam also released a double-VCD pack of his live performance with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Royal Albert Hall, London, at the Park Street store. 																								I am looking forward to the launch of my mega fusion project next year, which features the likes of Grappelli, Herbie Hancock, Ponty, Ernie Watts and George Duke, he signed off.

 Saturday, October 19, 2002 				 Money trail leads to mill murder arrest
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Posta police swooped down on a house in Kidderpore Lane on Thursday night to arrest one Prem Agarwal on charges of killing the manager of Uttar Pradesh-based Govind Mills, a few days ago.																								Deputy commissioner of police, central, Zulfiquar Hasan said Agarwal was a dreaded criminal, who was convicted in the Port area three years ago, on charges of murdering a rival. Santraj Singh, the manager, was killed inside the Strand Road factory on October 14. We had information that Agarwal would often visit Singhs house and stay with him, police said. The two knew each other for the past four years.																								After his arrest, Agarwal told the sleuths that he had noticed large sums of money stashed away in Singhs locker. Of late, Agarwal was going through a cash crunch. 																								He had tried his hand at several businesses but failed. He was even involved in extortions in the Kidderpore area but claimed that the money was not enough to support his extravagant lifestyle.																								When Agarwal visited Singh on October 13, he again eyed the cash in the locker. The following evening, he arrived with a couple of friends at Singhs place. The group sat down for a drinking session.																								While Singh went on a binge, Agarwal and his friends waited for a chance to rob him, Hasan said. When Singh lost consciousness, the men slashed him with a sharp weapon and took away Rs 5 lakh from the locker.																								On Friday, police raided Agarwals Kidderpore hideout and recovered the money. We are now trying to net Agarwals friends who were involved in the murder, Hasan added.

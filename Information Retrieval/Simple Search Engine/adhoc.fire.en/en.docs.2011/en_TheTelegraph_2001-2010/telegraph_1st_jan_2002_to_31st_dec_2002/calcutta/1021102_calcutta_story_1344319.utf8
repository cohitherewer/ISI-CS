The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, November 02, 2002 				 City Lights
				 Bold brushstrokes on walls				 																																									Max Mueller Bhavan, Calcutta, will host a novel exhibition of posters by German artists entitled Voices against right-wing extremism. To be held on the MMB premises between November 8 and 23, the exhibition will feature 30 posters called attacks. The posters respond to the violent attacks on foreigners, which were carried out at the beginning and during the course of the Nineties in Germany and circulated the world over as TV pictures and photographs.				 																																									These posters were created to depict the situation in Germany, but are socially and politically relevant in the global context as well, not the least in todays India, says S.V. Raman, programme officer, MMB. The posters are born of rage, shame and despair and the attempts at organising resistance through aesthetically striking means do not apply just to Germany. They can equally mobilise resistance to right-wing violence in other countries.				 																																									The pictures of the venomous mob and martial parades of fanatic skinheads had a devastating effect on the image of a unified Germany. In view of the past and a fear that the German Republic could again drift to the right, a critical eye was kept on possible relapses of the two German states. This observation has become self-observation, as the posters verify.				 																																									Revolving around the poster exhibition, MMB is organising a string of satellite events under the broad banner  The politics of Extremism. We will invite graphic artists of the city to view the exhibition and then do posters of their own to interpret the subject, says MMB director Ingrid Maria Keimel-Metz. The institute plans to announce a competition of these posters and give away prizes to the top three. Later, we will display these works of local graphic artists on our premises, the director adds.				 																																									MMB will also screen German and Indian films which address the politics of extremism. The Experiment, a docu-feature directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, will be the main attraction, while there will be shorts as well. The institute is tying up with Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre for sourcing Indian films. The centre will also help us create a faade outside the campus to go with the theme, Keimel-Metz says.				 																																									Two musical evenings have also been planned in sync with the subject. The first one, a Music Caf, will be a listening session of discs on Rock Against Right, a music movement in Germany against right-wing extremism. The second, scheduled for November 16, will have live sessions divided into two parts. The first part will feature original rock numbers specially composed on the subject by Anjum Katyal and Jayshree Subramaniam, with Gyan Singh and Amyt Dutta on guitars. Then, Anjan Dutta takes the stage with his own interpretation of the subject.				 																																									A panel discussion on Politics of Extremism on November 21 will be moderated by Victor Banerjee. We want to make it an open forum with five panelists chosen from various fields, says Raman. 				 																																									 Subhro Saha				 																																									Ritika, who was Sony Musics debut artiste in India, has sung all the numbers and has produced the album, while Varsha has penned the lyrics and is responsible for the concept and the tunes. These songs are specially created for children who love music and want more than the traditional nursery rhymes, and the parent and the teacher who are always on the lookout for songs that teach while they entertain, explains Ritika.				 																																									The album, released by Music Today and supported by Air Sahara, is accompanied by a colourful book of lyrics covering topics ranging from rain to rainbow, lollipop to days of the week, vegetables and colours. The music is catchy and the rendition spontaneous and peppy. An interesting feature is the brief incorporation of Hindi verses into some of the songs.				 																																									Ritika had received a gold medal for her Masters in music and went on to record her first solo album, Chena Shukher Khoje, with HMV. She has done jingles and songs for films and teleserials in Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Bhojpuri and Punjabi. She also heads the communications department of the Spastics Society of India.				 																																									Varsha, who has been teaching music in city schools, released an album entitled Wild About Animals through Brightsparks, a division of Tata Infomedia Ltd, writing and illustrating 20 songs for kids aged four to 10. She later did the title song for a childrens CD-ROM, which was translated into eight Indian languages. Also a freelance cartoonist, Varsha is currently working on two new toon series.				 																																									The duo has pledged to release one new album for children every year.

																								Layavinyas, a city-based music troupe formed in 1990, will be celebrating its 12th anniversary with a musical presentation tomorrow. A brainchild of well-known mridangam artiste N. Shankar, Layavinyas is a percussion-cum-melody ensemble that aims at creating fusion music. Using Carnatic percussion instruments like mridangam, ghatam and kanjira and amalgamating with Hindustani percussion instrument like tabla along with sitar and Western instruments like drums, guitar and keyboards, a unique brand of music is created which is sheer magic. Shankar and other talented musicians of Layavinyas are engaged in constant experimentation and amalgamation of different strands of music in their compositions. They have not only created original rhythmic music, but have incorporated elements from Western Jazz and Rhythm amp; Blues to enrich their wonderful repertoire. The rhythm cycles and solphas of these percussion instruments give rise to innovative melodies which is the hallmark of this organisation.																								When: Tomorrow at 6 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch, 11 Pretoria Street

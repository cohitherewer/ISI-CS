The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, December 07, 2002 				 Props that set the party right
 															- Orchids and lilies, lanterns and havelis the theme for dream dos SUBHRO SAHA																								Mexican motifs to Mughal havelis, Japanese cocktails to zardosi fabrics, peaches to orchids  designer-dcor bashes are the order of the day. And amidst all the innovation, the traditional continues to spring eternal  from the lanterns of Ferozabad to the marbles of Agra, from the images of Kumartuli to the pottery of Khurja.																								Its no longer just ornate floral patterns. Its all about props, hanging lanterns, candlelight arrangements, metal halogens, matching fabric and music to suit the mood. 																								Theme dos are big in town these days, in weddings and star hotels, clubs and social gatherings. And a 29-year-old self-taught artist is working hard to harness the various elements under one roof and ensure that the party never stops.																								The dim perception of Calcutta harboured by party-happy Delhi and Mumbai is completely misplaced, feels Rohita Bhaskaran, who now has her hands full, designing the launch bash of ITCs Sonar Bangla and the Oberoi Grands Christmas party, besides numerous high-profile wedding receptions.																								As an artist, it gives me an edge in planning and executing theme parties, since I can conceptualise everything on paper and know what elements to look for, says Rohita, who did Ravi Art-of-Living Shankars white-flowers-and-scallops stage at the Netaji Indoor Stadium earlier this year. She will also be dressing up the three-night, big-bang wedding party of Hero Hondas Munjals in Gurgaon this winter. Closer home, theres Grain of Salts first Christmas gala.																								Once the client chooses a theme and the initial sketches are okayed, she sets about outsourcing the materials. It entails a lot of travelling, as I believe in networking personally with the artisans at the point of origin, says Rohita. She started her Calcutta sojourn with a gold-and-silver theme at the Millennium New Years bash at Oberoi Grand, and has since been overwhelmed by the citys response to her concept dos.																								Rohita is planning to set up a one-stop shop in January to offer complete thematic solutions, like a South Indian mandap, Thai pagodas, Kumartuli icons, designer diyas or simply a backdrop for a church wedding, without overwhelming the purity of the place. The young artist is keen to take her theme for a dream do beyond the upper crust. We need not always get into the orchids or lilies. Local flowers and regional elements can be fused to create an exotic feel, without pinching the pocket, she smiles.

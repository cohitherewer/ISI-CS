 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Vet script not marks, says court
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday set in motion a process that may lead to the amendment of a rule which will have far-reaching consequences for Higher Secondary (HS) candidates.																								Hearing the petitions of four students who have contested their HS results, the court has asked the state government if it has any objection to amending a clause in the rules that says that in case of disputed results, the answer-scripts will not be re-examined. Currently, when a candidate seeks a review of his HS results, only the marks are re-tabulated.																								All four petitioners have challenged the validity of this clause and requested the court to direct the HS Council to strike it down. Justice Barin Ghosh on Thursday made the state government a party to the case and asked advocate-general Balai Roy to file an affidavit-in-opposition, stating why this clause should not be changed.																								After the Madhyamik and HS 2002 results, over a hundred candidates moved court, seeking its intervention in ensuring that their answer-scripts were properly examined. In a number of cases, the marks had increased after court intervention. 																								While Madhyamik rules permit scripts to be re-examined, HS rules do not. Many of the candidates whose marks had remained unchanged felt that had their scripts been re-examined, the evaluation would have been more fair. A mere re-tabulation amounts to nothing, they say.

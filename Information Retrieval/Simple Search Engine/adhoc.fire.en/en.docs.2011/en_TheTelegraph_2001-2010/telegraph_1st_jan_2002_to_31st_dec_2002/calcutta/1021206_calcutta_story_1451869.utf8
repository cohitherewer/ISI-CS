 MITA MUKHERJEE																								Two months after the disastrous results in the BA (Part I) political science examinations flooded Calcutta University (CU) with complaints from colleges, the decks are being cleared for a re-examination of the answer-scripts.																								Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor, academic, CU, said on Thursday that the varsity would conduct the mandatory inquiry before ordering a re-examination. We need to conduct some inquiries before we finally begin re-examining the answer-scripts. We will be in a position to give a clearer picture by December-end, added Das.																								A re-examination will require all four papers in political science honours to be evaluated all over again. The re-examination may become necessary, as the complaints have mostly come from good students of reputed institutions, Das said.																								Among the colleges pressuring the university to probe the political science fiasco are Presidency, Lady Brabourne, Bethune and Gokhale. 																								For the first time in years, even Presidency couldnt manage a first-class in the subject. The government, too, is said to be keen to set the record straight.																								A day after the results were published, Presidency teachers, led by the college principal, had raised the matter in the CU Syndicate meeting and urged the authorities to conduct an inquiry into the disastrous results.																								Taking the cue from Presidency, heads of other colleges wrote to the university authorities, demanding re-examination of political science (honours) answer-scripts of their students.																								It does appear from the results that the students have suffered mainly because of some abrupt changes in the pattern of the questions this time, said a college principal.																								CU officials said on Thursday that the under-graduate council would soon hold a meeting with the head of the board of studies in political science to probe the causes of the poor results. In keeping with the complaints of the principals, our first job is to find out whether the questions set in the political science honours papers this time were in tune with the existing syllabi, said pro vice-chancellor Das.																								Then, the varsity will have to ascertain whether there were any lapses on the part of the examiners in following the instructions concerning evaluation of answer-scripts. Once that is done, the under-graduate council will submit a report to the vice-chancellor.

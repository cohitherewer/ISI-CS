 Thursday, December 05, 2002 				 New format for swifter traffic fines
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With the traffic system in the city chaotic, especially in Esplanade, in the event of flyovers coming up, the authorities have decided to do away with the cumbersome procedure of paying road fines. The city police are going to change the old format of penalising traffic violators by introducing a new collection form. 																								The traffic department is expecting a government nod to the proposal, following which they are hopeful of a better revenue through road fines.																								Sources said the traffic department has already sent the file, mentioning the contents of the new form, to the finance department at Writers Buildings. 																								So far, we have not received any reply from the authorities on this. But we are hopeful that the proposal will be okayed, said M.K. Singh, deputy commissioner of police, traffic department, on Wednesday.																								Elaborating the process of fine-collection, an official said: The new system will enable the violators to pay their fines at a nearby nationalised bank, instead of the earlier process of visiting police stations, etc.																								Under the present system, the state government spends at least Rs 7 to inform a violator about his dues. But the new system will cost the government only Rs 3. In the current system, the violator will simply be informed of the Section under which he has been booked. 																								Earlier, he was often in the dark about the exact cause of the penalty, giving rise to further complications. Under the new system, we will inform the violator of the nature of grievance and the requisite Sections, an official said.																								A senior official said in the old system, a traffic constable would take down the number of the errant drivers vehicle, pass it on to the nearest traffic guard, from where it would be sent to Lalbazar. As a result, offenders never paid their dues and unpaid bills continued to pile up. The new system will end this lengthy procedure, he added.

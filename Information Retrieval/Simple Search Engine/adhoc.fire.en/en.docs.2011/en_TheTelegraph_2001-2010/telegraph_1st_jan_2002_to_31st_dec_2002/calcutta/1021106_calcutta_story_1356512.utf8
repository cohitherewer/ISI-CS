 Wednesday, November 06, 2002 				 Nod for Behala bypass
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A new bypass connecting Biren Roy Road to Taratala through the Behala Flying Club will be opened shortly to avoid congestion on Diamond Harbour Road.																								On Tuesday, state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the government has given the go-ahead for the Rs 1.20-crore project to meet a long-standing demand of Behala residents. The bypass will not only ease congestion in Taratala, Behala and Thakurpukur but also reduce traffic pressure on Diamond Harbour Road and James Long Sarani, he added.																								According to urban development department officials, the decision came in the wake of regular appeals from residents of Oxytown, Shakuntala Park, Sarsuna and their adjacent areas. The proposed bypass, running parallel to the D.H. Road, will definitely ensure smooth vehicular traffic, said an official.																								Sources said the government decision has also been propelled by regular persuasion of Trinamul Congress MLA of Behala (West), Partha Chatterjee. Putting forward the residents grievances to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and urban development minister Bhattacharya, the Trinamul MLA has finally succeeded in getting the government to okay the proposal.																								From the governments standpoint, the proposal is workable and offers room for ruling party-Opposition collaboration for local area development, said sources. We are happy that Buddhababu and Asokbabu have shown interest in the project, Chatterjee said, adding that he had been persuading the two leaders since last July. 																								Anjan Das, chairman of Borough 13, which covers Behala and its adjacent areas, has been asked to work out the details after a discussion with the residents. The CMDA has reportedly begun a detailed survey on the project and will submit a report to the government in the months ahead. 																								nDrain revamp: Besides construction of the new road, Chatterjee also sought government help in improving the age-old defective sewerage system of Behala. A large portion of the area is flooded with drainwater in the monsoon. A brief shower leads to waterlogging, much to the inconvenience of the locals, he added.																								Officials said a technical team from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will visit the areas within a week to study the entire sewerage system. The team will discuss the matter with the engineers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.																								Sources said work would involve laying of trunk-sewers and drains, construction of new pumping stations, and augmentation of existing sewerage and pumping stations. We have been told that the sewerage system scheme will be implemented under the Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project, to be aided by the ADB, Chatterjee said, adding: In all probability, work will begin by 2003-end.

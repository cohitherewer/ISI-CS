 A STAFF REPORTER																								Trinamul Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee has decided to use the party-led Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to nurse her constituency. She plans to set up a Rs 12-crore booster station at Kasba without help from the Left Front. 																								Earlier, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya had dismissed CPM MLA Rabin Debs claim that the state government had accepted his proposal for a booster station at Kasba. We are yet to complete the two booster stations at Ranikuthi and Bansdroni, Bhattacharya said.																								Four months ago, Deb announced that the state government had agreed to his proposal for a booster station at Kasba, following a meeting with member, mayor-in-council (water supply) Sovan Chatterjee.																								The Trinamul Congress, meanwhile, is busy scheduling a meeting in Kasba where Banerjee and mayor Subrata Mukherjee will announce the CMCs booster station project.																								The project will take about two years to complete. Once commissioned, around 10 lakh people living in the Tiljala-Kasba-Topsia belt will receive filtered surface water from Garden Reach. Presently, the areas needs are being met by 100 deep tubewells. According to a Trinamul Congress spokesperson, the meeting has been slated for October 31, but it might be changed in view of the India-West Indies cricket match. 																								It is better that the state government stays away from the construction of a booster station, otherwise it will meet the same fate as the Bondel Gate flyover, said mayor Mukherjee on Thursday. 																								I think the Bondel Gate flyover will make it to the Guinness Book of World Records for taking so long to get completed. It is a shame that the government cannot complete a small flyover in 12 years, he added. Of the seven wards which will benefit most from Banerjees booster station-scheme, five belong to the CPM, said member, mayor-in-council (health), Javed Ahmed Khan. The seven wards are 65, 66, 67, 68, 91, 107 and 108.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, November 28, 2002  Letters
				 																																																																				 Apropos the report Security cry at SSKM (Metro, October 26), it is a matter of concern that mob fury at hospitals, protesting the death of patients is on the rise. Such incidents, as the assault on medical staff at SSKM Hospital, are condemnable.				 																																													Perhaps more ridiculous is the security system provided at such a leading hospital like SSKM, which failed to protect the doctors and nurses. The outsiders not only roughed them up but also smashed furniture and destroyed important hospital documents. There is no denying that death of any patient due to lack of medical care or sheer negligence should be castigated. But the condition in which the patient is brought to hospital should also be considered. If the patient is brought in a critical state, he may not survive even if he gets the best treatment. His death in this instance would be very unfortunate, but in no way should doctors be held responsible for such cases.				 																																													Assault on doctors jeopardises the normal functioning of a hospital and causes disturbance to other patients who need constant medical attention.				 																																													The situation should be dealt with before long, so that doctors do not feel threatened while discharging their duties. 				 																																													Sunil Banerjee, 				 																																													VIP Road.				 																																																																				The report Pay for better diet at state hospitals (Metro, November 1) was disturbing. Is there any government hospital in India, where paying-bed patients are charged extra? Are government hospitals like hotels where the meter keeps ticking with meals and every other facility availed of? Whose brainchild is this quality diet with nutritive value at Rs 14 only a day? State government hospitals are run for the welfare of the citizens, not on a profit motive. 				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar, 				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Doctors hone strike scalpel (Metro, October 29), it is welcome news that doctors from the east zone will meet to protest the state governments health policies as also to restore strained doctor-patient relations. Doctors are usually manhandled for no fault of theirs due to poor infrastructure in government hospitals. Again, the states proposal of air-conditioning chambers for private practice is ridiculous. A move to curb wrongdoings of unscrupulous doctors is the need of the hour. 				 																																													Govinda Bakshi, 				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Syllabus boost sparks hike in medical fees (Metro, October 28), the proposal to increase medical education fees will deprive especially the poor students. Although the government is citing excuses for the move, it is well-known that the real reason is an acute shortage of funds. The authorities would do well to confess that it is unable to provide subsidies to educational institutions. 				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee, 				 																																													Nayapatty Road. 				 																																																																				Apropos the report Manpower audit or DA axe threat for schools (Metro, October 28), it is amusing to note that the ruling Reds are trying to interfere in the administration in English-medium schools with the sole objective of bringing the teachers under the fold of its trade union wings. If the party gets a say in the management, especially in the appointment of teachers, the standard of education in these schools may deteriorate with the infiltration of its cadres. 				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee, 				 																																													Lake Town. 				 																																																																				Apropos the report In the net, out for Rs 300 or less (Metro, October 29), it is distressing that policemen are harassing people, who cross the Kestopur-Salt Lake footbridge, with the sole objective of extracting money. Presumably, these cops were taking advantage of the closure of court during the festive days as these people could not approach the court for bail or to seek redress for their grievances. 				 																																													Rabindranath Kar, 				 																																													Sankar Ghosh Lane. 				 																																																																				The report Space odyssey: 15 minutes to the sun (Metro, October 31) was exciting. Kudos to the authorities of Wbreda for bringing such a novel item to Calcutta. This will definitely benefit students. Such developments add sheen to the city as well as boost its tourism potential. One request: Let the entrance fee be affordable.				 																																													T.R Anand,				 																																													Budge Budge Trunk Road.

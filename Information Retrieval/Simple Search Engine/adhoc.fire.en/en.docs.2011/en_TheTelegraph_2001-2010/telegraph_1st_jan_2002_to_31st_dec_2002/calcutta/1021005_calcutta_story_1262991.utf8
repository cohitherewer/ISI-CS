 Saturday, October 05, 2002 				 Court prod on water test
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The green bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the public health engineering (PHE) department to collect water samples from different parts of the city and test them for bacterial contamination.																								Earlier, the court had directed the civic authorities to test water samples in different hospitals, education centres and other public places in the city. It also asked them to make arrangements to purify the water if found unfit for consumption.																								The court had even accorded permission to the civic employees to visit any such public place, without prior notice, and collect water samples. On Friday, activist Subhas Dutta suggested that the court ask the PHE to conduct further tests on water samples to find out whether the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had actually carried out the court order. 																								Earlier this year, Dutta, on behalf of the Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity, made a comprehensive study of the drinking water scenario of Calcutta and Howrah. The samples were found to contain bacteria. On the basis of the report, the court had asked the CMC to take measures in this regard. The Howrah civic authorities had taken time from the court to file a report on this.

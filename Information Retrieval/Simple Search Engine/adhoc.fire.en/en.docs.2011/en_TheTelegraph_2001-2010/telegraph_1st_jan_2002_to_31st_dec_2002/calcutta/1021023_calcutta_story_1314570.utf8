				 																																									Passengers have no option but to avail of pre-paid taxis while returning from Dum Dum airport. Recently, I had to cough up Rs 100 while returning to Salt Lake from the airport on a pre-paid taxi. But the same distance (Salt Lake to airport) cost me only Rs 68 on the meter. The pre-paid rates are exorbitant. The airport authorities should arrange for metered taxis too.				 																																									Sanjay Beria,				 																																									Salt Lake.				 																																									Tagore Park Main Road, connecting the Tagore Park residential area and the EM Bypass, has been in bad shape for the past few years. As there is no underground drainage and the stretch is unpaved, puddles form even after mild showers.				 																																									Dhruba Ray,				 																																									Ghatakpukur.				 																																									Commuters have to bear a horrible stench when trains cross the Park Circus-Ballygunge stretch. The civic body should take steps to improve this.				 																																									Kamal Mandhyan,				 																																									Jyotish Roy Road.

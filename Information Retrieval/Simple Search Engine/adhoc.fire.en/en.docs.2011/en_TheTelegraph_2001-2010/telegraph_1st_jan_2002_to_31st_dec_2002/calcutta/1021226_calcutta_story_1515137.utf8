 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Ramakrishna Mission has received the Unesco award for the promotion of tolerance and non-violence throughout the world in 2002. The Mission has now spread its wings across several countries, from Malaysia to Bangladesh, apart from strengthening its welfare activities in and around the city. It has opened a new centre at Baranagar, on the eastern fringes of the city, exactly where the first monastery of the mission was started in 1886. 																								A new centre has also just been started at Chittagong, in Bangladesh, after a similar centre in Petaling Jaya, in Malaysia, received rave reviews for its outstanding work in the field of welfare activities. Another centre was launched at Habibganj, in Bangladesh.																								We have also opened a new unit at Chapra, in Bihar, where welfare work is on in full swing. The Mission has spent Rs 1.92 crore on scholarships for poor students during the year, said Jai Shankar Maharaj of the Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math, on Wednesday.																								In 2002, the Mission undertook extensive relief and rehabilitation programmes in several parts of the country, benefiting nearly 5.75 lakh people in 800 villages across India, said officials during the recently-concluded 93rd annual general meeting.																								During the year, a number of rural and tribal development projects were undertaken at a cost of Rs 8.28 crore, added the officials.

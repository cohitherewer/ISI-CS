																								Kantha is an indigenous, utilitarian art form devised by rural women of eastern India, specially by the women of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Women gather old pieces of cloth and stitch a quilt, which is the base or the canvas, the kantha. On it, unique multi-coloured patterns are stitched and exquisite embroidery is created slowly and painstakingly. The entire procedure is fairly complex and strenuous. Artist-craftsman Biswajit Mukhopadhyay has ventured into this difficult terrain and has used the needle as his paint brush to create superb stylised works of art. Mukhopadhyay has been researching on the arts of different tribal groups in an effort to unravel the mystery of those strange, symbolic motifs and then improvise them artistically in his original, often semi-abstract pieces of art. His efforts to promote and popularise these traditional folk art forms have won him many laurels. An exhibition of his works is currently on.																								When: Till December 1; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, Central Gallery

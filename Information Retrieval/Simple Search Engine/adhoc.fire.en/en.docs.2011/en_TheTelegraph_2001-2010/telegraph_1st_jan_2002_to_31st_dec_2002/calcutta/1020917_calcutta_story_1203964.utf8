																								Painters 80 is a 22-year-old group with umpteen shows to its credit. Most of its founder members have either migrated to other parts of the country or abroad, yet the core organisation, along with relatively recent entrants, remains active both as individuals and as a group. The present exhibition was inaugurated on September 11, the eventful day which saw the destruction of the twin towers of World Trade Center in New York a year ago. The group, comprising Amitava Dhar, Amit Chakraborty, Aloke Sardar, Bhaskar Mukherjee, Debashis Chakraborty, Dipankar Dutta, Pradosh Paul, Tarun Dey and Suneel De, sees this event as a spill-over of violence of the 20th century  a century that was perhaps the most materially prosperous, scientifically innovative and heinously destructive in all human history. The group feels human beings are the most endangered species on earth and are on the precarious brink of mass extinction. Events, since that fateful morning in New York, are like severe warnings to human beings to change their wicked ways. The group members have felt a strong urge to express their anguish and frustration overtly in their artistic expressions.																								When: Till September 18; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North amp; West galleries

 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 Mamata support offer to CPM allies
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Trinamul Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee on Sunday said her party was prepared to support a non-CPM government formed by the CPI, the RSP and the Forward Bloc to save the state from complete economic ruin in the wake of the Marxists corruption and wrong policies.																								Referring to the state governments announcement on the reduction of Puja bonus and advance to its employees after keeping the major Left Front partners in the dark, Mamata said: The CPM does not have absolute majority and still it is ignoring the Front constituents. I will, therefore, urge the latter to quit the CPM-led coalition and try to form an alternative government in the peoples interest. We are ready to back this alternative government from outside.																								Mamata claimed that Trinamul Congress never allowed any unilateral decision taken by the NDA government to go unchallenged. We used to raise our voice against any decision which affected the people. Why can the Left Front partners not follow our example? she asked.																								Rally on Sunday																								The Trinamul leader will organise a mass rally in the city on Sunday to highlight the state governments failure on every front and protest against Eastern Railways bifurcation. She called for an economic emergency to reduce all unnecessary expenditure being incurred by the ministers and top bureaucrats.																								Sundays rally will begin at the foot of the Gandhi statue at the crossing of Mayo Road and Dufferin Road at 12 noon and terminate at Dharmatala in the afternoon. 																								We want the rally to last only for a few hours so that it does not affect puja shoppers, Mamata said.

																								This is an innovative attempt at a dramatic collage, a montage. Set in contemporary society, the collage tries to capture the multiple facets of the city  its tradition, its ephemera, its mob, its individuals, its politics, its culture, its feverish energy, its inanity and ennui, its cruelty and its generosity. The youths are the protagonists of this play who are constantly waging an unequal battle against an all-powerful, indestructible foe. They are at once the hunter and the hunted. These youths have always been there  in fables, they were the courageous characters Laalkamal and Neelkamal, Kankabatis and Kanchanmalas; in contemporary society, they may be identified as Hari, Jadu, Madhu, Sita Geeta et al. Names have changed, but their quest for identity continues. The play derives its style and structure from a combination of individual and collective story-telling traditions. For language and material, it depends on anything from classical Bengali literature to works of contemporary poets, including Sunil Gangopadhyay, Shakti Chattopadhyay and Joy Goswami. A Nandikar production, created by Rudraprasad and Swatilekha Sengupta and Goutam Halder.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

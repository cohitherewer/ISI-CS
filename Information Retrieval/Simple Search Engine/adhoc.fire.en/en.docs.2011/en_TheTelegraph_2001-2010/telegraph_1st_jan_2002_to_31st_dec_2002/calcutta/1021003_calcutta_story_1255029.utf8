The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

				 																																																																				 Apropos Address shadow on infant adoption (Metro, August 28), the report points to a major contradiction in the attitude of the educated class of a metropolitan city like Calcutta. 				 																																													While progressive organisations are actively engaged in raising their voices against discrimination against sex workers and womens forums are continuously fighting to protect their rights, the incident shows reality in a different shade. It brings to light the unsavoury fact that deep-rooted moral inhibitions and prejudices continue to create obstacles in the process of reforms in our social set-ups. Unless we change our moral yardsticks to judge things, we can never do away with the menace of orthodoxy in our society. 				 																																													In an age-old civilisation marked by frequent projection of the libido in art and literature, does this attitude of abhorrence to red-light areas not smack of mindless hypocrisy?				 																																													Indranil Chaudhuri, 				 																																													Address not given. 				 																																																																				Apropos the report Hope of life, dole of death (Metro, September 3), it is painful to note that a hospital is functioning without proper facilities. And the government remains a mute spectator. Parents who admit their children here throw them into a valley of death, but being poor, they have no alternative. The government has a responsibility towards these people, and should rather close down this hospital. 				 																																													Rabindra Nath Kar,				 																																													Sankar Ghosh Lane.				 																																													lIt is shocking to learn that 14 babies died in two days at the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children. The healthcare system in the state has taken a nosedive, mainly due to negligence on the part of the attending physicians. 				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia. 				 																																													lIt is sad that expensive hospital equipment is lying unused at the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children (Health aids down in dumps, Metro, September 5). Perhaps, had there not been a tragic series of child deaths there, the disgraceful condition of the hospital would not have come to light. 				 																																													Sunil Banerjee,				 																																													VIP Road.				 																																													lThe report B.C. Roy staff pay, but not for deaths (Metro, September 20) proves the adage Do not speak the unpleasant truth. The superintendent had to open the Pandoras box, because his repeated pleas to the authorities for assistance had fallen on deaf ears. So, obviously, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra transferred him and other staff members to hush things up. But Mishra should realise that people are not fools. Will Mishra explain why Group D staff are never punished for negligence of duty?				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																													lHow is it possible to run a hospital without the required number of staff and the necessary instruments? The ministers, perhaps, can never imagine what happens to parents when they see their new-born babies die. This is really a sad and shameful situation.				 																																													Rajarshi Ghosh,				 																																													Bansdroni.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Tech dose for govt hospitals (Metro, September 2), it is good that the government wants to improve infrastructural facilities in state hospitals. Not much has been done to modernise city hospitals in the last two decades, which has resulted not only in the deterioration of services, but also a mushrooming of private nursing homes. People who can afford to pay are going elsewhere, resulting in a loss of revenue for the state.				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																																																				The report Booked for going by the book (Metro, August 21) is really stunning as it points a finger at the prevailing sorry state of the hospitals in our state. Generally, a person is punished for dereliction of duty, but this particular incident completely contradicts the notion. Niladri Shekhar Pal was handed the showcause notice because he was true to his duty. 				 																																													Arindam Basu,				 																																													Saptagram.				 																																													lThe report was shocking. Niladri Shekhar Pal had guts but committed a blunder by exposing the truth about the dereliction of duties by his superiors. Calling a spade a spade is a crime in a corrupt society.				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.

				 																																										lCriminals struck at the FMC Fortuna building on AJC Bose Road near Minto Park, in the Bhowanipore police station area, an hour after Wednesday midnight and looted more than Rs 3 lakh from two offices in the complex. Deputy commissioner of police, detective department, Soumen Mitra said three or four youth muscled into the building, which houses several offices. They were armed with revolvers and cutters. Mitra said the Fortuna building has a nightguard and employees of an interior decorating concern were at work in an office on the third floor. But no one saw the criminals go up to the fourth floor. They broke the lock of Canal Devices, a private company, smashed open the iron chest and took Rs 2.73 lakh, he said. Then they opened one of the windows at the back of the room and climbed up the rain pipe to the fifth floor office of HTC Engineering. About Rs 73,000 was looted from the office. Detectives suspect that the workers and the guard were involved in the incident. Bhowanipore police have detained five persons.				 																																										The state government has slapped a one-time fee of Rs 2,500 for fire-fighting licence instead of the present practice of levying Re 1 for every square foot of pandal erected by organisers of public entertainment programmes all over the state. State fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said at Writers Buildings on Thursday that the decision was taken following complaints from organisers about rampant corruption while measuring the area covered by the programme pandal. Normally, over 15,000 sq ft covered area is required for musical programmes in district towns. Most organisers do not pay the actual fire-fighting fee by showing much less covered area. A fixed amount for fire licence, irrespective of the size of pandals, will help stem corruption, Chatterjee said. 				 																																										Gold ornaments worth Rs 80,000 were stolen from two Kali temples in Thakurpukur and east Jadavpur. Police said both the thefts occurred in the early hours of Thursday. Thieves broke the grille of the temple near Karunamoyee bridge on Mahatma Gandhi Road in Thakurpukur and stole jewellery worth Rs 50,000. In another incident in the Nilachal area, in East Jadavpur, jewellery worth Rs 30,000 was stolen.				 																																										Sudipto Roy, owner of the private company where an employee was bitten to death by four dogs, is suspected to have fled the country, police said. A case of unintentional murder has been filed against Roy. Police are apprehending that Roy, who is also wanted in several fraud cases, has fled with a woman, who stays in Salt Lake. Recently, police teams from Mumbai and Indore conducted raids in Lake Town and Salt Lake in search of Roys companion.				 																																										 Md Naser, 55, was hit by a minibus while riding a bicycle on CIT Road in the Beniapukur police station area. He has been admitted to Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital with serious injuries.

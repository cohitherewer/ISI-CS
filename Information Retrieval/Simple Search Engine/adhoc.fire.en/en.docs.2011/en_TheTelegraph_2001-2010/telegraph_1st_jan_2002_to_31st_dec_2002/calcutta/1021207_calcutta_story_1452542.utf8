 Saturday, December 07, 2002 				 Raga Utsav
																								Come winter and the city sets out to herald a host of cultural programmes including classical music and dance festivals. Now the citys twin sister, Salt Lake, joins the race with Ali Akbar Sangeet Kaksha and Salt Lake Post jointly hosting a two-day festival of Indian classical music, the Raga Utsav. To be inaugurated this evening by author Buddhadev Guha, himself an accomplished Tappa and Puratani singer, the programme will feature renowned classical vocalist Pandit Falguni Mitra (in the photograph). Pandit Mitra is widely acclaimed as a purist among classical musicians. He has added a new dimension to the style of dhrupad singing. His father, late Pandit Shib Mitra, was the disciple of Pt Bhola Nath Pathakji, doyen of the Betia Gharana. Pt. Faguni Mitra learnt the intricacies of the gharana from his father. He has blended the extraordinary charm and sweetness into the heroic style of dhrupad rendition, making the music soulful. He will be accompanied by Jyoti Goho (harmonium) and Tapash K. Das (pakhawaj). The second and concluding days programme (December 8) features a discussion on Indian Classical Music. Participants include Kumar Prosad Mukhopadhyay, Dipali Nag and Pt. Falguni Mitra. This will be followed by Barun Kumar Pals Hansa Veena recital.																								When: Today at 5.30 pm																								Where: Ali Akbar Sangeet Kaksha, CF-339, Salt Lake City, Calcutta 700064

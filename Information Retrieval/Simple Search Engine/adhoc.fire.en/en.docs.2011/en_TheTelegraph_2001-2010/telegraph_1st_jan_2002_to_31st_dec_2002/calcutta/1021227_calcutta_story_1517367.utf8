				 																																									While getting off a tramcar a few days ago, I sprained my ankle. As the vehicle didnt have a foot-board and the road surface was uneven, I fell on the ground. Elderly people like me would benefit if the tram company introduced foot-boards in all the trams.				 																																									Sunita Wadhwani,				 																																									SR Das Road.				 																																									The government can consider improving steamer services between Chandpal Ghat, in Howrah, and Outram Ghat. More people will avail of this mode of transport and traffic snarls in peak hours will be eased to a great extent.				 																																									Bhupen Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.				 																																									A large number of trees was chopped to make way for the bypass off VIP Road, constructed recently between Ultadanga and Bangur Avenue. A waterbody was also filled for the purpose, but no initiative has yet been taken to restore the lost greenery. 				 																																									Biman Saha,				 																																									Lake Town.

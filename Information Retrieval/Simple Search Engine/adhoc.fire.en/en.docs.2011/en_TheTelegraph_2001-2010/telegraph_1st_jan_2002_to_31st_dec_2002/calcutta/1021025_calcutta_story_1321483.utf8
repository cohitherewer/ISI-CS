				 																																									On its platinum jubilee, the Bakulbagan puja committee recreated a rural atmosphere in the pandal. Artisans from 12 districts displayed their crafts handloom, dokra patachitra and terracotta products. In the evenings, the stage was set for folk artistes. Moreover, a sumptuous lunch was arranged for the residents of the area on Nabami. The procession for the puja immersion also drew a huge crowd, with men in kurtapyjamas and women clad in white-red saris and their faces smeared with vermillion. The para camaraderie touched my heart. The Durga Puja is an occasion when active participation of the entire community brings neighbours closer. Wish the spirit would prevail round the year.				 																																									Piyali Manna,				 																																									Bakulbagan Road.				 																																									The litter strewn around the Howrah station makes it difficult for commuters to navigate through the area. The stench of the garbage is unbearable. The Howrah Municipal Corporation should step up its conservancy service.				 																																									Manoj Jhawar,				 																																									Howrah.

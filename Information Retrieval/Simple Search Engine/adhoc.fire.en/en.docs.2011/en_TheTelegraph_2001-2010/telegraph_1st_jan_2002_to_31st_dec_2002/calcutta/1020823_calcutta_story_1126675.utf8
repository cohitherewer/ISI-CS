The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Happy birthday Calcutta!
																								The Calcuttans ability to laugh at his inadequacies helps him gain worldwide acceptance. However, bogged down by the pressures of day-to-day existence, Calcuttans are losing their sense of humour. In an effort to resuscitate the city and give Calcuttans a taste of the citys characteristic humour on its birthday, Prayasam, a city-based development organisation, in association with Studio PrintArt, Exide Industries Ltd. and Eveready Industries, has arranged Mojaru Kolkata. The event will showcase the humorous nature of Calcuttans, which lends the city its unique flavour. Joining forces for the project are the photographers of CESC Sports Association and music bands from different colleges of the city. Over a period of two days, CESC photographers will exhibit their works capturing the witty mood of Calcutta. Students from different schools and colleges will sing for their beloved city. Prizes will be given on August 24 at 4 pm to the best photographer and the best band. 																								When: Today amp; tomorrow; 1 pm - 8 pm (photography show); Tomorrow at 11 am (band com-																								 petition)																								Where: Asutosh Birth Centenary Hall, Indian Museum copy;  Copyrights 2002.

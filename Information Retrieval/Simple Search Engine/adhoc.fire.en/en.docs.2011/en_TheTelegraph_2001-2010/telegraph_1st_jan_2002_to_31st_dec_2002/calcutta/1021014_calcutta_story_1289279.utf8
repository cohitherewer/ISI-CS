 Monday, October 14, 2002 Bengal Kudos for concept quintet Hinduatan Park Sarbojanin:
 Religion of Man 
 The enduring image of the Gujarat riots a young  man with hands folded and tears of fear in his eyes  sets the tone for the theme of communal harmony.  Peace is the message, the pandal its medium. Hindu  and Islamic art have been sensitively, and seamlessly,  worked into the pandal architecture by creator Goutam  Basu. The structure has a mosque in the centre, flanked  by temple domes. The pathway to the mandap is lined  with columns depicting the two artistic styles. Stained-glass  panels closer to the idol bear words of wisdom from  Ramakrishna and Kabir, Vivekananda and Nazrul  Pictures by Pradip Sanyal, Pabitra Das and Aranya  Sen

 Goddess' greenhouse
 The setting is rural, the theme is agrarian economy  and the dream is green. This colourful pandal has  been created without any artificial colours. Conceived  by artist Prakash Bera, lush paddy saplings have  been used to decorate both the interiors and the  exteriors. More than 20 farmers from Midnapore have  been here, near Hedua, striving day and night for  the past two months. The result is a giant greenhouse  for the Goddess, bang in the middle of our concrete  jungle  
	Md Ali Park 
 Industrial Inaction  
	A broken chimney robbing the Goddess of some of  her halo and the despairing cry of the jobless  Industrial sickness is the mother of all problems  in Bengal, reiterates this puja in the heart of  our business hub. The focus is on the crumbling  manufacturing sector and the resultant retrenchment.  Inside the pandal, inspired by the Dilwara temple  of Mount Abu, jobless workers plead with Durga,  created by artist Alok Sen. The need of the hour  is an industrial revolution. Can the Devi pull off  this miracle?  
	Jatra Shuru Sangha 
 Pay Rage
 
	Hirak Rajas giant statue on a patch of green  and two santrimoshais at the cave door; a spooky  tunnel with the jantar mantar chamber and bagh mamas  lair opening into a dazzling court, where Goopy  Gyne and Bagha Byne have the Devi and her devotees  in thrall. The Baishnabghata pandal, conceived and  executed by a team of Government Art College students,  led by Kishor Das, recreates the Satyajit Ray classic  Hirak Rajar Deshe. An exhibition of Rays writings,  magazines, sketches and film posters is being held  alongside  
	Bagmari Progressive Youth Association:
 Paper Power 
 Ravanas  puja of a paataler Durga, ascending  from darkness surrounded by rakshasas, rather  than descending from the heavens. Lanka is the  setting for this Maniktala puja, created by art  director Roopchand Kundu of teleserial Ek Akasher  Niche fame. The pandal, pratima and d eacute;cor  are made from newsprint, tinted brick red, though  the idol looks as though it has been carved from  black stone. The dark Durga cuts a striking figure,  with her children on her wings and the head of  a mahish at her feet. Copyright  copy; 2002 The Telegraph. All rights reserved. Conceptualised

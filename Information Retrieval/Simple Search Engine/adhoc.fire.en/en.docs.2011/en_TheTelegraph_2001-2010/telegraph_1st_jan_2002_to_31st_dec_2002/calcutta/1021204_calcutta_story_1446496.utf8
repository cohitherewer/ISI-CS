 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two persons were killed and four injured at 7.40 pm on Tuesday, after the front tyre of a Tata Sumo burst while it was speeding towards Calcutta along VIP Road. The vehicle overturned, flew across the divider, and landed on a Maruti on the other flank of the road.																								Additional superintendent of police Ajay Nand said: There were three passengers in the Sumo. Two of them were killed on the spot, while the third was badly injured.																								Police said the dead and injured persons have not been identified so far. 																								Three passengers of the Maruti, proceeding to the airport, were also seriously injured. Both the vehicles were reduced to a tangle of metal that blocked the passage to the airport.																								Local people rushed to the spot and tried to extricate the trapped passengers from the two vehicles. 																								We had to break the doors and pull out the injured. They were bleeding profusely. We stopped passing vehicles and sent the injured to local nursing homes and hospitals, said Sunil Gupta, a local youth.																								There was a major traffic snarl in the area immediately afterwards. The way to the airport was closed to traffic as the two badly damaged vehicles blocked VIP Road, Nand said.																								The Tata Sumo had picked up close to 100 kph. My car was three vehicles behind it. Fortunately, it had overtaken my vehicle. There was a tremendous noise. I saw the Sumo overturn. It flew across the divider, said Sujit Sengupta, who was driving an Ambassador.																								Later, North 24-Parganas police said they were planning to impose speed restrictions on VIP Road to avert accidents.

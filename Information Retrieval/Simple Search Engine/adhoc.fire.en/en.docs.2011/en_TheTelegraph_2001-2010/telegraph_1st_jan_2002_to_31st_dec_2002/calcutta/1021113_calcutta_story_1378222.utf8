 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sujata Das, 17, alias Ganga, a domestic help, committed suicide by jumping off the third-floor balcony of a house in Howrah late on Monday.																								In her suicide note, Sujata wrote that no one was responsible for her death. She added that she had made several requests to her employers to provide her jobless brother with some work.

When she returned on Sunday, her employers noticed that she looked depressed, the police said. 																								On Monday night, after dinner, her employers had retired to their room, when they heard a thud. They came out of their house to find Sujatas body in a pool of blood.																								She was taken to Howrah General Hospital, where the doctors declared her dead. Kumar said there had been no foul play in the incident. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

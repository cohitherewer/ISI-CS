				 																																										lThe authorities at Banabitan in Salt Lake have decided to drop plans to impose an entry fee at the park. Taking public sentiments into consideration, we have cancelled the proposal to impose fees for morning walkers, G.B. Thapliyal, principal chief conservator of forests, said on Monday. However, the increased fee for visitors after 8 am, will be taken at the increased rate of Rs 10 from January, instead of the present Rs 5. A controversy started after the authorities planned to impose an entry fee of Rs 5 for morning-walkers. But protests from residents forced a temporary rollback and a notice was issued in December that Rs 2 would be charged from 5 am to 8 am. We received a mass petition and numerous phone calls from Salt Lake residents on Tuesday, urging us to withdraw the decision, a senior forest official said.				 																																										Five persons were injured in an accident at Sonarpur on Tuesday evening. Police said the injured were travelling in an auto-rickshaw which collided with a Matador van.

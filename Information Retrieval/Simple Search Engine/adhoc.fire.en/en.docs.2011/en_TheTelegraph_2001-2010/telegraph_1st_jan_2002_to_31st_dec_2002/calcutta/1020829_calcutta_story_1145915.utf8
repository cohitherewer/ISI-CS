 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 4 new tariff rates for WiLL users
 AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR																								Calcutta Telephones has cut the charges of wireless in local loop (WiLL) mobile sets, making cellular phones affordable for common people, according to the revised tariff circular released on Wednesday. The telecom major has devised four alternate tariff plans for the subscribers.																								Chief general manager S.P. Chakraborty said the revised tariff would be effective from September 1. The WiLL mobile will be the cheapest cellular phone, which we will market from Thursday, he said. We have convened a meeting of area managers and other senior officers at Telephone Bhavan on Thursday, he said, adding that the WiLL mobile could be used in the Calcutta Telephones area, covering Kalyani, Howrah, Amtala and Bantala. At present, there are 1,000 subscribers of the WiLL mobiles, said general manager, customer relations, R.K. Mishra.																								The WiLL service was introduced eight months ago. A subscriber had to initially pay Rs 10,000 for the handset and Rs 3,000 as security deposit. While incoming call charges were free, outgoing calls cost Rs 1.20 per three minutes. 																								But the authorities have now changed the tariff to make it more affordable. There is, however, no change in registration, rental and security deposit for connection and handset charges.																								To register, a subscriber will have to pay Rs 500 and an adjustable security deposit of Rs 2,400. The rental is Rs 200 per month, while the current price of the handset is Rs 5,000. 																								In the standard and alternate Plan I, there are no plan charges. In Plan II and Plan III, the plan charges are Rs 100 and Rs 450 per month.																								The caller-line identification (CLI) facility is not available in standard plans, but is there in the other three plans. The charges are Rs 50 per month.

 Monday, November 11, 2002 				 Twin blazes take toll of three, leave 13 injured
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two devastating fires, one early on Sunday on the southern fringes and the other a few hours later in Barasat, towards the north of the city, left three dead and 13 injured. Two of the killed were children.																								In the first incident, a fire broke out inside a market at Survey Park, in the Purba Jadavpur area, South 24-Parganas, around 2.40 am. Residents rushed out of their houses near the market and the fire brigade was alerted. Fire-fighters reached the spot a little after 3 am.																								The fire was spreading rapidly, and we had a tough task trying to control it. We had to remove a lot of combustibles from near the site, a fire brigade official said. After battling for an hour and a half, the flames were doused and the charred body of 14-year-old Biswajit Das, who was sleeping inside a small tea-stall in the market, recovered. Another body of a 65-year-old eatery employee, identified as Nibaran, was also brought out.																								A small eatery was gutted and a few shanties were destroyed. Police said the fire started from an oil lamp kept inside the eatery. I heard someone crying out for help and raised an alarm, said Sumati Mondol, an eyewitness.																								Seven hours later, a massive fire broke out in a godown-cum-factory in Barasat, leaving one dead and at least 13 injured, five seriously. Additional superintendent of police Rahul Srivastava said the godown belonged to a thinner-manufacturing company and the fire broke out while unloading the highly-combustible substance from a 10,000-litre tanker.																								Eyewitnesses said parts of the tanker were blown high into the air after a huge explosion. The impact of the blast also blew away a few coconut trees around the factory. The containers inside the godown started exploding in rapid succession. A seven-year-old girl, whose identity could not be ascertained, was standing next to the tanker when it exploded, and died almost instantly. The fire spread rapidly, sending people scurrying for safety. A cycle-parts shop was also gutted. 																								At least 13 persons, including three fire-fighters, were rushed to Barasat Hospital, where the condition of five was declared serious. They were shifted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.																								Among the injured, five-year-old Md. Suraj, 28-year-old Akbari Bibi and Yasmin Khatoon, 22, were still battling for life. The fire was brought under control after a few hours, but we are yet to ascertain the cause, a fire official said. A police picket has been posted on the spot.

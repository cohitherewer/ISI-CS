				 																																									The population around EM Bypass has shot up with the mushrooming of multi-storeyed buildings, but the transport system has not been able to keep pace with the population boom. The number of private and government buses plying through this area is extremely inadequate. More vehicles need to be introduced via Gol Park.				 																																									Sujit De,				 																																									Sodepur.				 																																									SN Banerjee Road, stretching from APC Road to Chowringhee, is very congested. The pavements have been occupied by hawkers, and pedestrians have to walk along the thoroughfare. A few cinemas are also located in this zone and their queues spill over to the road. 				 																																									As private buses are always in a rush to overtake each other, this arterial road is one of the citys most accident-prone areas. The police are reluctant to rein in the drivers. 				 																																									Jyoti Bakshi,				 																																									Heysham Row.

				 																																										Students of the Government College of Art and Craft, who had boycotted their classes from August 8 to protest the indifference of the authorities to their dilapidated hostel at 20 Jadulal Mallik Road, temporarily withdrew their strike on Wednesday. The students decided to withdraw their agitation after Ramakrishna Mission Ashram, Narendrapur, which is the landlord of the hostel building, last Saturday started repairing the bathrooms which were falling apart. The students were waiting for the Ashram to do this. On Thursday morning, a nine-member team of educationists, artists, doctors and architects will visit the hostel to see for themselves the conditions prevailing there. Students will submit their report to the higher education department for further action. They will resume their movement if they are not satisfied with the repairs.

Subsequently, about 500 agitators were arrested at different places.

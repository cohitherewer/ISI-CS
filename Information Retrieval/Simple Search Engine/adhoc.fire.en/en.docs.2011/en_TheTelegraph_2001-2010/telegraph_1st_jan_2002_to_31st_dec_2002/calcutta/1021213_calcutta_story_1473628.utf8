				 				 		 Geeta Mahalik was perhaps born to dance. Endowed with large eloquent eyes, nimble feet and a supple body, Mahalik breathes dance in all her gestures and postures. Born in Orissa, it was natural for her to take up Odissi at an early age. She underwent rigorous training under two eminent gurus: late Debaprasad Das and Mayadhar Raut. Decades of devoted training under the gurus, each representing the diverse streams in the vibrant tradition of Odissi dance, has resulted in a perfect blending of the best that Odissi offers. To this religious training in the grammar of Odissi, Mahalik has added her own dimension  the expression of rasa in both its religious and secular aspects. She has the rare talent to communicate the subtle nuances to create an immediate empathy in the audience. Being a leading exponent of Odissi, she has performed extensively both in the country and abroad. She has also toured in remote parts of the country, giving lecture-demonstrations in schools and colleges to popularise Odissi. The Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) hosts her dance recital this evening.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

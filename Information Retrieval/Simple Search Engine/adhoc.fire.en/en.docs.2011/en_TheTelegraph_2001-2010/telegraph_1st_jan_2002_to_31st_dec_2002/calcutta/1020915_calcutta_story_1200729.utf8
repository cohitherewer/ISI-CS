 Sunday, September 15, 2002 				 Puja committee claims permit
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Ballygunge Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsav committee on Saturday said it had permission from the civic authorities and the police to construct its puja pandal on Dover Road.																								On Friday, deputy commissioner, traffic, M.K. Singh had said that two puja committees, including Ballygunge Palli, had been asked not to block thoroughfares. They were also directed to push back their pandals by at least five feet. 																								In a letter to Ballygunge Palli on Saturday, Singh warned that action would be taken if the pandal was not shifted from the main road. When contacted, Rudra Narayan Chowdhury, a puja committee member, showed a copy of the no-objection letter written by the Ballygunge police regarding the construction of the pandal addressed to the civic authorities.																								We have reduced the width of the pandal from 25 feet to 22 feet. Now there is enough space for two vehicles to move side by side. Singhs directive has put us in a spot, Chowdhury said.

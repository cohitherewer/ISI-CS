 A STAFF REPORTER																								Students taking their Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in the next session will have a wider and more extensive syllabus, instead of focusing on selective study, after major changes announced in the JEE syllabus.																								The new syllabus booklet for admission to engineering, medical and technological degree colleges in West Bengal will be available at all college counters from Monday. Its price has been scaled down to Rs 10 from Rs 20, West Bengal Board of Examination officers said on Sunday.																								In the new syllabi to be released by the JEE board, the overall marks in biology and maths have been reduced to 100 from 200. The examination will, however, continue to be three-hour-long. We thought that a student is used to appearing for a 100-marks test in three hours and it should be the same in JEE. During evaluation, the marks will be doubled to 200, said a board officer.																								The new syllabus lays more emphasis on short questions, and the modules in biology, which was earlier divided into 20 parts, have now been shortened to only 10, but cover an exhaustive syllabus. Each module will carry 10 marks each.

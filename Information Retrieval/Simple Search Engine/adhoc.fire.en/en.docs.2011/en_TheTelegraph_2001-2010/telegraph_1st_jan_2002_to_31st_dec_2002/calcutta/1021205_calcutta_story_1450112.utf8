				 																																																																				 Apropos the report Joint entrance made simpler (Metro, October 30), the shift in JEE by lowering the existing 400-mark test to a shorter 300-mark one from next year is heartening news for students aspiring to be doctors or engineers. There is no denying that many students, who do well in the HS examination, shy away from appearing in the JEE due to the tricky nature of the exam, and opt for mainstream courses instead. Due to the speed factor involved in answering 200-mark papers in such a short time, even good students sometimes fail to get deserving ranks in the competitive ladder. This decision of the JEE board will pave the way for fair play in that students will not have to run for assistance to private coaching centres, which most of them cannot afford. This way, more students will qualify, and with numerous private engineering institutions offering a large number of seats, there will be no problems in accommodating them. 				 																																													But the most pertinent point is that the standard of engineering and medical education should not get diluted. Otherwise, the move will backfire. 				 																																													Sunil Banerjee,				 																																													VIP Road.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Asim covers cash to crime (Metro, November 4), it is interesting to note that finance minister Asim Dasgupta is taking time off to solve day-to-day problems like traffic management and crime. I recollect how in the early 70s, while teaching at Calcutta University, he used to take interest in solving problems of students and would participate in sports, drama, debate etc. Few are aware that he was also a good footballer.				 																																													Rabindranath Kar,				 																																													Vidyasagar College.				 																																													lKudos to Asim Dasgupta for his commendable work as a crime-buster in Salt Lake. 				 																																													Mohal Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				It is heartening that a charitable unit is planning to plug the infrastructural vacuum in combating and curing cancer (Awareness the key for cancer crusaders, Metro, November 4). It seems in the long run, cancer patients from the city will not have to run to Mumbai or Chennai for treatment. We wish the Cancer Foundation of India all success. 				 																																													B.N. Bose, 				 																																													Dum Dum Park. 				 																																																																				Hearty congratulations to Metro for upholding a just cause against the rule-breakers in power (Rules must rule mayor, minister, November 4) . The SSKM Hospital incident tells a tale of misuse of power by people quite oblivious of their duty to the public. The hospital is not anyones personal property and there is no reason for patients to suffer the stench of uncleared garbage. 				 																																													Gita Datta, 				 																																													Bosepukur Road. 				 																																													lThe way the mayor stormed into the SSKM supers office transcends all sense of decorum, and the further threat of retaliatory action is tantamount to a boors insolence which he is accustomed to show from the beginning of his political career. On the other hand, it is laudable that the ex-police commissioners have stood by the dutiful sergeant, Rajat Krishan.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi, 				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																													lHats off to police sergeant Rajat Krishan for not allowing one of our law-makers to break the law. We congratulate Metro for highlighting the news and hope other honchos will think twice before breaking the law. 				 																																													Ratan Gupta,				 																																													Address not given.				 																																													lThe superintendent of SSKM and the policeman on duty at Eden were unduly subjected to the wrath of the high and mighty. The government should reward the efforts of these public servants in order to restore the confidence of the public in the administration.				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee, 				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																													lMetro is right. Rules are rules and it is immaterial whether one is a VIP or an ordinary person. In the present context, it is felt that Mamata Banerjee should rein in mayor Subrata Mukherjee and the CPM politburo should tame minister Asok Bhattacharya.				 																																													S. Bose, 				 																																													Address not given.

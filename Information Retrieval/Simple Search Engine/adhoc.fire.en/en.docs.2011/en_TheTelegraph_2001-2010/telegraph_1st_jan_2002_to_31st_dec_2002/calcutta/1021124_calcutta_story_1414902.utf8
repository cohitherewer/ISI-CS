 Sunday, November 24, 2002 				 Manslaughter accused netted 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a major breakthrough in the mysterious murder of a youth, whose headless body was found four months ago at Barasat, the key accused was arrested in Nagpur on Friday.																								Mohanty Mistry, 25, allegedly plotted the murder as the victim had protested his real estate deals. He was picked up from a construction company office in Nagpur and booked for murder.																								Haricharan Das, 21, was murdered on August 2 at Nabapalli in Barasat. Police recovered the headless body two days after the incident, from a nearby field. We searched the adjacent areas for the head, but in vain. 																								A few days later, we arrested three youths and after grilling them we recovered the head in October  two months after the incident  from a wetland in the area, said Rahul Srivastav, additional superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.																								According to Srivastav, the killing was a fall-out of a clash between members of two local clubs. Haricharan, a member of the rival club, was up in arms against Mohanty who was trying to grab vested land to construct a high-rise. He fled when a gang led by Mohanty stormed into his house and called out to him. 																								A week later, Mohanty, along with his henchmen, waylaid Haricharan on a deserted spot when he was returning home and murdered him, said an officer of Barasat police station.																								Later, Mohanty went to Nagpur and was employed by the construction company, from where he was picked up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, December 30, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									I am a regular commuter of Metro Railway and have recently undergone heart surgery. Unfortunately, I have to get off at Central station, where the escalator has been out of order for the past few months, compelling me to climb the steep stairs every day. There are several others like me who often sit on the stairs to catch their breath. Recently, a few of us met the station-master, who said urchins had damaged the escalator. He didnt know when repairs would be undertaken. 				 																																									Pritam Das,				 																																									BB Ganguly Street.				 																																									There are no streetlights on the stretch between Southern Avenue and the Lake lilypool. Hoodlums find it very convenient.				 																																									Sumitra Mukherjee,				 																																									Lake Gardens.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, November 20, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									Indian Railways is celebrating its 150th anniversary, but the condition of the railways has hardly improved. At the Baidyabati rail crossing in Hooghly, I often find two trains on the same track. Though both will travel in the same direction, the possibility of an accident cant be ruled out. Level crossings are not in the best of shape, especially in the suburbs. The fissures between the roads and the tracks have expanded into craters. The levelling is so unbalanced that a major mishap is crying to happen. Children often run along the tracks in a hurry to reach school. The authorities should take steps without delay.				 																																									Sumant Poddar,				 																																									Kyd Street.				 																																									Bata India Ltd burns a lot of scrap rubber on a plot owned by it, adjacent to the rail tracks, in Batanagar. The entire area then gets enveloped in smog, causing physical discomfort to the residents. Its strange that neither Mahestala Municipality, nor the pollution control board is taking any action.				 																																									Chameli Pal,				 																																									Batanagar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Waugh a song-and-dance, skipper!
 															- Souravs boys will help raise funds so Steves girls get a home to live in A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Sourav and Steve: A new ball game																								There is no love lost between the two on the cricket field. But now, they are padding up for a common cause off it.																								Steve Waugh and Sourav Ganguly will be leading  from a distance  a star-studded team for a masquerade ball, song and dance and gala dinner on the night of November 23. And itll all be by Souravs boys for Steves girls. The Calcutta Foundation Orchestra, which has the Indian captain as figurehead, will comprise orphan boys from Oxford Mission. And the money is being raised for Ashray, a home for girls of leprosy sufferers, that has the Australian skipper as patron.																								Although the two top draws wont be around, tickets  or rather tables  are selling like hot cakes. The 200 seats, with a price tag of Rs 1,000 each, at the 20 tables in the Taj Crystal Room, are nearly all taken. Doing the star turn will be Lee-Alison Sibley, wife of the US consul-general in Calcutta, who will be belting out favourites down the years  from Frank Sinatra to Barbara Streisand  accompanied by the Orchestra. 																								All with good reason  the proceeds will help build an extension for Ashray, a project run by the Philanthropic Society of the Orthodox Church, housing 200 orphan girls in Nepalgunge. Ashray will mark the second innings for Waugh in Calcutta, following his role in Udayan, another Calcutta Foundation project that helps children of leprosy sufferers. He has already set the ball rolling by promoting Ashray in Australia.																								Steve has a way of getting into peoples hearts and they are always willing to give when he asks. Thanks to his efforts, weve received numerous cheques, from five to 500 Australian dollars, says Shamlu Dudeja, chairperson of Calcutta Foundation. The building blocks at Ashray are already in place, with the proceeds from Waughs campaign. The plan is to construct a multipurpose wing next to the existing one, that will house 200 girls of leprosy sufferers, as well as a primary school for the under-14s, a vocational training scheme for battered women and an auditorium where the Calcutta Foundation Orchestra can practice.																								The Orchestra consists of a bunch of boys from Oxford Mission, a city orphanage near Behala. Sourav used to play with the boys of the Mission as a child and so, when we approached him to be a patron for the Foundation Orchestra, he agreed, says Dudeja. Souravs boys have bowled Sibley over: They are marvellous musicians and wonderful to be with.

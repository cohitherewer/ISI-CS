				 																																									Several corporate houses nowadays sponsor puja awards. But the judges should reject pandals which have been erected by felling trees. Most puja committees forget that they are vandalising public property in the name of religion. If such acts get sanctioned, club members can get away with whatever they want to. The panel of judges, comprising eminent persons, should not forget that they, too, have a social responsibility. 				 																																									D.K. Chanda,				 																																									Dover Lane.				 																																									I had sent two money orders from the Park Circus post office to an address in Andhra Pradesh in July and August. But neither of them has reached the destination yet. After waiting for a month, I lodged two complaints with the same post office, which were received on August 9 and September 9, respectively. But action is yet to be taken and the money is still missing. How can the postal department be so lackadaisical? 				 																																									N. Elisha,				 																																									Park Street.

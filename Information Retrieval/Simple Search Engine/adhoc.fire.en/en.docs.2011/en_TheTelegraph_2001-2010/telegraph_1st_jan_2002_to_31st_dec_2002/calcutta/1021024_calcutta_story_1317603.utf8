The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, October 24, 2002 				 Tech tool debut in Asia-Pacific
 A STAFF REPORTER																								City-based firm Intera Systems is all set to enter Asia-Pacific with its tech-tools. To make its presence felt outside the traditional market in the US, the technology provider to the US $ 4-billion Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry is now in the midst of finalising marketing tie-ups with a host of strategic partners. 																								Our focus has always been the US market since we launched our operations in India, early 2000. We were primarily developing tools for our US counterpart. But now, we want to explore the opportunities in other markets like Asia-Pacific, said Sanjay Mittal, managing director, Intera Systems India, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intera Systems, USA.																								And not only the market, the fledgling company is also broadening its basket of services. 																								We have been catering to the EDA industry, which supports chip-manufacturing majors like Intel. Recently, we have started offering design and verification services as well. Besides, we are also working on some new technologies in our research and development centre in Salt Lake, he added. 																								Besides Calcutta, the company has offices in Noida and Santa Clara. 																								Commenting on the companys performance during the IT slowdown, Mittal said: Its true that our revenues suffered due to the market conditions. But we are expecting to touch around Rs 10 crore this year from our India operations and reach Rs 15 crore by the next fiscal. The future of the entire electronics industry depends on chips, where we have a significant role to play. We expect a turnaround in the market, which will help us in meeting our targets. The veritable list of Intera customers includes US biggies like Synopsis, Sequence, Fujitsu, Intel and Cadence. 																								Besides technology, the company takes pride in its human resources, picked up mainly from the IITs. At its Saltlec (Salt Lake Electronic Complex) R amp;D centre, the company employs over 60 engineers and is planning a 20 per cent addition to its workforce. 																								Ours is an engineering company and we need quality man-power. And the availability of human resources has been the major reason behind our decision of setting up a base in Calcutta, explained P.P. Das, head of engineering in the company.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, November 04, 2002 				 An intimate journey 
 Vasant Pandit is a very well-known and respected name among city connoisseurs of art and artists. In the ongoing exhibtion (his 24th solo show in the city), this cerebral artist sees ordinary day-to-day objects and surroundings through his minds eyes and then delineates them, transmitting his own thoughts and feelings through the images. Following in the footsteps of Bonnard and Vuillard, two true representatives of Intimism, Pandit calls himself an intimist. His simple interiors are charged with a palpable sense of being ensconced cozily in a dream-like plane, far removed and aloof from the mundane existential world. His landscapes, too, have a kind of serene, virginal insularity, untempered by civilisation. Pandit himself emphasises, ...Why landscapes? Only to enhance aesthetic boundaries. This show, which he has dedicated to the memory of Satyajit Ray, enhances his views once more. 																								When: Till November 5; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery																								 55 Gariahat Road

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 Threat shadow on victim family
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Two years after the Regent Park police framed a 10-year-old boy in a false rape case, one of the conspirators, then sub-inspector Jayanta Dutta, has been suspended, but the two realtors alleged to have masterminded the plot continue to torment the victims family.																								The nightmare has refused to end for Uday Kant Thakur, wife Mandokala and son Sonu, now 12. During the Puja days, they were, apparently, being shadowed from their Charu Market residence to pandals by goons threatening them to drop all charges against the conspirators or face dire consequences.																								Thakur has lodged a complaint with the police stating that the promoters have been threatening him and his family. On September 31, he was, allegedly, assaulted near Bansdroni by henchmen of the promoter. Another complaint was filed in the Shakespeare Sarani police station, after the promoters threatened to silence each member of the Thakur family over telephone in Uday Kants office.																								In a bid to oust Uday Kant Thakur from his house, the realtors had conspired with the local cops to lodge a false rape case against Sonu on March 28, 2000. Two days later, the boy was arrested and sent to a juvenile home.																								After several weeks of wrongful confinement, the court observed that the police had submitted a concocted chargesheet against the boy, even ignoring a medical examination report that proved his innocence. The court freed Sonu and forced Regent Park police station sub-inspector Jayanta Dutta to apologise to the Thakurs.																								The human rights commission, which had first refused to accept the case, finally took it up following a series of reports on the case carried in Metro.																								The police, which had been asked by the court to probe the case and arrest the culprits by September 5 this year, have so far drawn a blank. We have been trying to find the accused duo, but they are absconding. The court has asked us to investigate the case, which is being done, said deputy superintendent of police (town) Subhankar Chatterjee.																								A distraught Uday Kant, however, refuses to believe the police version. How can they say that the two promoters are absconding when they are roaming freely? For the past one month, I have often tried to contact the police, but they have refused to meet me on one flimsy excuse or the other. I am scared now. My whole family is under threat, he says.																								Jayanta Dutta is not the only one under the scanner. The role of other police officers of Regent Park and their possible links with the promoters is also being probed.																								Special IG (Presidency range) Gautam Mohan Chakraborty said the department had decided to suspend Dutta on the basis of an investigation carried out by Subhankar Chatterjee. If it is proved that other officers had played a dubious role, we will definitely take action against them, he added.

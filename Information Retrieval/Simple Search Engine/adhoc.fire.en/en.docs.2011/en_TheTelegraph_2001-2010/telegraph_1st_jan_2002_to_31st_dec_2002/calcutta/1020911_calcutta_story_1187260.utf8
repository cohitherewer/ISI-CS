		 Wednesday, September 11, 2002  We Ask You Answer				 Avoid court, but court law 
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Is out-of-court settlement the way out of legal logjam? More letters will be published next week									

K.L. Ghosh, 
																		Kalindi.																																																														Even if out-of-court settlements may seem the best solution for two parties engaged in a dispute, it may create social, legal and domestic problems for them due to their ignorance of legal matters, specially if the lawyers take advantage of them. The legal logjam stems from our inefficient legal system, which is not target-oriented, and our huge population. Therefore, only a few select cases, under advice of the court, could be considered for out-of-court settlements.									

Govinda Bakshi, 
																		Budge Budge.																																																														A person often has to wait for years together in our country for a case to be settled. In some cases, the judgement is awarded after the demise of the contending parties, making it meaningless. Moreover, court records reveal that lakhs of cases are pending for want of judges on the bench. In view of the slow-moving legal system, out-of-court settlement is a welcome proposal. It will save time and promote goodwill. 									

Arnab Chattopadhyay, 
																		Dhakuria.																																																														The Indian judicial system has lost its flexibility and takes a long time to give a verdict, however trivial the matter may be. Thus, the common people, tired of waiting, seek out-of-court settlements. This gives rise to the practice of bribery. Through money power, they try to resolve the case as soon as possible. Therefore, even if a case gets stuck in court, out-of-court settlement is not the proper way out.									

Samir Ghosh, 
																		Hindustan Park.																																																														Out-of-court settlement is not the panacea for all the ills of our judiciary. Mutual consent of both parties is necessary for this. There will always be people who will refuse to settle, and misuse the system to delay the case for as long as possible, to serve their own interests. Legal logjam in our courts will continue so long as it is a level playing field for unscrupulous people.									

Sandipan Dutta,
																		Sukantapally.																																																														There are various forums to settle legal disputes out of court. In the rural areas, the panchayat plays a big role in solving disputes. 									

Ananya Banerjee,
																		Address not given.																																																														The courts are burdened with too many cases. Thus, it will be wise to opt for out-of-court settlement.									

Fakhre Alam,
																		Tiljala Lane.																																																														It is preferable to most to settle their legal problems out of court in order to avoid legal paraphernalia. People are scared to move court because of the spectre of long-running cases. As the court keeps on giving date after date, the poor can ill afford to fight for justice. They just surrender themselves to destiny. People are known to sell off their land and property to fight court cases. 									

Kirti Asopa,
																		Address not given.																																																														This entirely depends on what type of case it is. If it is a case for recovery of money or property, or a family matter then certainly out-of-court settlement is helpful because the opposite party always tries to delay the case to avoid payment. On the other hand, if a case is based on a wrong which cannot be compensated monetarily then it is advisable to take the legal recourse.									

Anindita choudhury,
																		Teghoria.																																																														It depends on what type of case it is. If the matter can be solved by talking things over, then it is most certainly a solution. After all, nobody wants to get into the hassle of courts and lawyers. But if the matter is really serious, then one has to take the path leading to the court.									

Durga Kumar Guha,
																		Andul Road.																																																														The huge number of cases that accumulate in court is a cause for concern. To decrease the load on the court, out-of-court settlement is a viable option.									

SUMANTRA BANERJEE,
																		Lansdowne Place.																																																														Out-of-court settlement was always prevalent in India. In most cases, the court takes a long time to give a simple verdict. So people try to avoid the legal recourse, thinking it will yield no positive result other than waste of time and money.									

ARJUN MUKHERJEE,
																		Moulali.																																																														Out-of-court settlement is definitely the easy way out but not the politically correct thing to do. To settle for something less than you deserve is simply lazy thinking. It will be a miscarriage of justice.									

Semanti Ghosh,
																		Address not given.																																																														In view of the huge span of time which a legal process consumes, I think out-of-court settlement is surely a wise way out of the legal logjam. Personal matters can remain concealed by this process.									

Rhitam Basak,
																		Surji Dutta Lane.																																																														Yes. Courts are famous for dilly-dallying. Moreover, everybody knows about the malpractices associated with the legal system. Out-of-court settlement is cheaper and saves time.									

Debasish Bhattacharya,
																		West Street.																																																														An adjustment or settlement out of court helps avoid legal hassles. There are umpteen cases pending in various courts.									

Suyash Jaiswal,
																		Hungerford Street.																																																														Yes, it is wiser to settle problems internally rather than taking the matter to court, especially if a compromise is possible. Taking a matter to court not only results in publicity, but also involves a lot of time and expenditure.									

Subodh Acharya,
																		Address not given.																																																														Yes, out-of-court settlement is the best solution to clear the legal logjam. It will help save time, labour and money of the parties concerned. Retired judges may be appointed for settlement of the pending cases to give the process a legal status.

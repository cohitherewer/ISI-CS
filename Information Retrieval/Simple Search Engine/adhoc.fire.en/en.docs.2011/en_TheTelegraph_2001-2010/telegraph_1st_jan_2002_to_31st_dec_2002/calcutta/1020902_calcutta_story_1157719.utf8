 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Bus robbery at gun-point
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Vikram Sethia, of Salt Lake, was robbed of his belongings at gun-point in a minibus on Saturday night. But even 24 hours after the incident, no arrests have been made. Sethia, 22, boarded the Esplanade-bound mini at Parnasree around 6.30 pm. When the bus reached the crossing of Behala police station and Taratala, three armed youths got in and aimed a revolver at him.																								In a complaint lodged with the Behala police, Sethia said the youths picked a quarrel with him immediately after boarding the mini. They then whipped out a revolver and asked him to part with his cash and other valuables. 																								One of them extricated Rs 3,000 and my cellphone from my pocket. Then they took off my gold ring and threatened to chop my finger off if I protested, Sethia recounted on Sunday. The robbers accomplished their mission in only about seven minutes, after which they got off the bus. 																								Behala police station officer-in-charge Subhas Sen admitted that no one has been rounded up so far. But we are carrying out raids in different hideouts in search of the criminals. We might also interrogate the driver and conductor as part of the investigation. The youths may be known to them, he added.

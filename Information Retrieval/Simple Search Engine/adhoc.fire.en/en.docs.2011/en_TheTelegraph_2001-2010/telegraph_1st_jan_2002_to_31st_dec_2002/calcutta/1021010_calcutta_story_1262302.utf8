 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 Figure fudge in malaria death toll
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The CPM Opposition in the Corporation has alleged manipulation of figures by the health department.																								Sources allege that while officer on special duty (OSD) Atanu Mukherjee claims the incidence of malaria in the city till September has been 11 per cent less than last year and infection with the malignant malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum 32 per cent less, the data in 51 civic clinics show a steep rise. 																								In the last three weeks of September 2001, infection with malaria was detected among 23.4 per cent of 26,387 Calcuttans who visited the civic clinics. This year, 30.58 per cent of the 23,253 patients tested positive. 																								According to deputy director (malaria), S.N. Datta, so far, three people in the city and around 47 in the state have died of malaria. But Mukherjee was reluctant to accept the figures on the grounds that Plasmodium falciparum was not detected in the victims blood samples.																								Anticipating that malaria may wreak havoc between October and January because of the inaction of the civic health department, Mukherjee has fudged the figures, alleged CPM leader Sudhansu Sil.

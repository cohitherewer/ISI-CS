				 				 																															The debate rages on. Cellphones: A Necessity or Luxury? Last week in Time to Talk, we presented the views of some Young Metro readers. Here are a few more, with more to follow next week. Whether students want them or not, cellphones are hot!				 				 																															lThe cellphone may be a wonderful invention, but nowadays, they are used by the youth to show off. Students can only have one use for cellphones: to chat with their friends. But they fail to realise that, now, when everyone has one, carrying a cellphone has ceased to impress anyone.				 				 																															Md. Tarique Nisar,				 				 																															Ist Year, St Xaviers College				 				 																															lCellphones help parents keep track of their childrens whereabouts, but it looks ostentatious when students carry them to schools and colleges.				 				 																															Shreya				 				 																															lToday, a student is not confined to the boundaries of home and school. Every student goes for tuition or classes of some kind. To keep in touch with everyone, especially parents, cellphones have become a necessity. But the utility depends on how the students choose to use their phones.				 				 																															Sourajit Saha,				 				 																															Class XII, Indira Gandhi Memorial High School				 				 																															lIf students are engaged in some kind of productive activity that allows them to bear the expense themselves, it is definitely legitimate to carry a mobile phone. But a student who only goes to school, college or tuition, besides freaking out, does not need one.				 				 																															Manan Agarwal,				 				 																															1st Year, St Xaviers College				 				 																															lCellphones are a luxury for students. They are costly gadgets that many cannot afford.				 				 																															Sananda Sen,				 				 																															IIIrd Year, Asutosh College				 				 																															lAnything that is not a necessity is a luxury. A cell is useful for keeping in touch, and parents can easily keep track of their children because all that is expected is that he or she reach school in time, pay attention in class, take a break during recess and be back home when school gives over. Students generally do not get much time for nightlife, without adult supervision.				 				 																															Abhishek Arya,				 				 																															Class X, St Xaviers School				 				 																															lCellphones are a necessity for professionals who need to be contacted at all times. However, as students are supposed to spend most of their time studying, they have very little need for a cellphone. Once they build a career for themselves, there will be plenty of time for cellphones.				 				 																															Piyal Mukherjee,				 				 																															1st Year, Institute of Engineering and Management				 				 																															lCellphones are strictly meant for those whose work demands travelling, so that they can be easily contacted wherever they are. Not for teenagers.				 				 																															Fatema Zakir Marfatia,				 				 																															Class XI, Saifee Hall School				 				 																															lCellphones are a necessity for students at the Higher Secondary level. This is when we start to go out ourselves, without our parents. The world we live in is not very safe, so it is necessary for our parents to be able to keep in touch with us when we go out.				 				 																															Vivek Mukherjee				 				 																															lHalf a decade ago, cellphones may have been a luxury for students. But for todays generation, they are as important for students as office-goers. Extra classes at college, extended tuition, dance practice, part-time jobs or parties no matter where we are, we can easily let our parents know. A busy parent can ensure his or her child is fine by just dialling a number. Parents can insist that children pay their own phone bills.				 				 																															Suchi Arya,				 				 																															Class XII, Modern High School				 				 																															lFor some students, cellphones are not at all a luxury. Many students are involved in many activities and stay out a lot. Its not always possible to make calls from a public phone booth.				 				 																															Moumita Rudra,				 				 																															Gokhale Memorial Girls College				 				 																															lCellphones could either be a luxury or necessity. They make it easier to access information. But they have also become time-consuming, distracting objects.

	 Stage fever				 				 																															The city saw four days of theatre with more than one cause. Black Coffee, an amateur theatre festival, had five companies from Calcutta and Delhi staging 30-minute plays at four venues  Oxford Bookstore, Seagull and Swabhumi for the festival days, and a competitive finale at the St Xaviers College auditorium on Sunday.				 				 																															Despite an accident that saw the sixth act, The Hindu, from Delhi, backing out, things started on schedule on Tuesday. St Xaviers and Jadavpur University put up plays, with actors Victor Banerjee and Rituparna Sengupta in attendance.				 				 																															At the same time, Presidency College and the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences kept the audiences engaged at Seagull, where Gitanjali Jolly also dropped by. The sole remaining team from Delhi, E=MC2, performed at Swabhumi. Over the next two days, the teams flitted among the three venues. The carefully chosen addresses had tried to create the feel that the audience and the players were on the same level.				 				 																															The whole festival was put together by two students, Antara Haldar and Sinjini Mukherjee. I have always been told that theatre was not a viable option, and I wanted to see if this could be pulled off. At the same time, I had heard so much about Calcuttas rich stage, which had declined over the years. I wanted to help revive it, explains Antara, the creative director from St Stephens who conceived the project. Part of the proceeds also went to Concern India Foundation.				 				 																															On Sunday, the festival shifted to the proscenium. Director Mrinal Sen attended a part of the mornings proceedings, which saw the only outstation team E=MC2 being honoured for their efforts in Hip-Flask and Cobwebs.				 				 																
	 Home, not alone				 				 																															The Interact Club of Welland Gouldsmith participated in a zonal project at Mulvany House, an old-age home, sponsored by HelpAge India. We spent the afternoon with the ladies, talking about our lives and getting to know each other. The residents of the home sang some Bengali songs for us and later on, we attempted a joint rendition of our national anthem. We distributed nightgowns, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap and cold cream among them.				 				 																															 D. Kavitha,				 				 																															President, Interact Club, Welland Gouldsmith				 				 																
	 Jacobian joyride				 				 																															November is an eventful month for the boys at St James. They have just bagged first prize at the 10th Limca Book of Records Inter School Quiz. Don Bosco Park Circus came in a close second, and La Martiniere for Girls trailed at third place. The national finals for the 10-city quiz will be held in January 2003 in New Delhi, where St James will be up against the other regional finalists.				 				 																															Next week will see more on-stage action for St James, with its version of Oliver, an extravaganza in jazz. From Wednesday to Saturday at Kala Mandir, 7 pm onwards, the students, under the direction of Katy Lai Roy, will present the musical based on the Dickens classic. Working with music director Maurice Menezes for the project is jazz personality Carlton Kitto.				 				 																
	 Tata talk				 				 																															The Annual Foundation Day 2002 of Indian Institute of Management Calcutta was celebrated at the Joka campus on November 16. The annual Foundation Day lecture was delivered by R. Gopalakrishnan, executive director, Tata Sons Limited, on the Musings of Leadership. Drawing from his experiences with various companies, he spoke of the sustained impact of good leadership, institutionalised versus personalised leadership and the occasional downsides of being at the top.				 				 																
	 Party time				 				 																															Toon celebs are about to hit town. The Powerpuff Girls, Scooby Doo, Dexter, Dee Dee, Johnny Bravo, Tom and Jerry will be the special guests at Toon Yatra, the biggest bash the season promises for Cartoon Network freaks. Music, dance, games and prizes galore are in store at Salt Lake stadium this Sunday, 5 pm.

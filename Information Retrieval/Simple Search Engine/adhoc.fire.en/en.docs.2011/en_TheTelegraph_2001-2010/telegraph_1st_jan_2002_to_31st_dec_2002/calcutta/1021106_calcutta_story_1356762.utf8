The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, November 06, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The Calcutta Police deserve praise for their untiring efforts in maintaining law and order during the Pujas. Traffic snarls were few during peak hours and the festive days passed off peacefully. It must have been a tough job for them to manage the surging crowds around the popular pujas. If the law-enforcers put in half the effort on normal days, living in this city would become much more enjoyable.				 																																									B.L. Chandak and Anita Chandak,				 																																									Salkia.				 																																									Food kiosks, rickshaw stands, hawkers and car repair shops are multiplying on the citys pavements by the day. Residents of ground-floor flats and buildings near markets are the worst affected, as they have to put up with the constant din. The congestion is almost suffocating. These makeshift stalls are also frequented by rowdies and this destroys the homely environment of a para. How long will the Calcutta Municipal Corporation continue to turn a blind eye? 				 																																									Jagdish Kumar,				 																																									Chittaranjan Avenue.

 Sunday, November 17, 2002 				 Molestation charge against doctor
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A senior doctor of B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre was suspended on Saturday, following a molestation charge levelled against him at the Alipore police station by a woman activist of an NGO, working for underprivileged children.																								The woman, in her mid-thirties, had gone to visit the doctor with a child from an orphanage on Friday afternoon when the doctor allegedly molested her. She lodged a complaint with the police later in the evening.																								Trouble broke out on Saturday morning after a 100-strong mob gathered in front of the hospital, shouting slogans against the doctor and the hospital management. We want immediate action to be taken against the doctor, Mahila Congress president Krishna Debnath said.																								Later in the day, the hospital management held an emergency meeting. Since the hospitals reputation is involved, we decided to ask the doctor not to attend work until investigations are over, said Amit Dey, administrator of the hospital. The management has also formed a probe team.																								Deputy commissioner of police (south) Kuldip Singh said the police were investigating the case. If needed, we will arrest the doctor, he said.																								But the police have found some discrepancies in the allegation, which they say need to be looked into before the doctor is arrested. Some of them are:																								2Why didnt the woman raise an alarm during the molestation?																								2Why did the woman take such a long time to lodge a complaint? She has claimed that she was waiting for her husband to return from work, a statement, which the police are verifying. 																								2The woman has mentioned in her complaint that the chamber was locked from inside, but some staffers say that the door was open.

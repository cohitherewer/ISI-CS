More than 2,000 policemen will be on duty during the five days of the Test match, starting October 30. 				 																																										Mayor Subrata Mukherjee softened his stand regarding the traders of College Street market at the request of Trinamul Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday. He agreed to restore power supply to the market against payment of the outstanding power bill of Rs 14 lakh to the CMC and directed the municipal commissioner to serve fresh notices to the traders of all 23 civic markets asking them to clear their dues to prevent disconnection of power and water supply. 				 																																										A Bihar police team on Tuesday arrived in the city to arrest Raj Kumar Goel and Ram Gopal Saraf on charges of cheating unemployed youths in Begusarai of several lakhs of rupees. The Hare Street police said Goel and Saraf had taken money from about 100 youth, promising them jobs. After collecting the money, they fled to Calcutta. Saraf and Goel were taken to Begusarai for interrogation.				 																																										The state government has approved the proposal of a bypass from Biren Roy Road in Behala to the Flying Club, Trinamul Congress MLA of Behala (West) Partha Chattopadhyay said on Tuesday.				 																																										Two youths on two-wheelers were arrested in Salt Lake on Tuesday for teasing two plainclothed women constables. Police said a trap was laid on the basis of a tip-off.

Samarendu Chakraborty, secretary of Manabikatabadi-O-Juktibadi Kendra lodged an FIR with the New Alipore police station on Tuesday, demanding the arrest of Deep Ghosh for allegedly cheating residents of Chetla. Devotees flocked to Ghoses residents when he spread the word on Sunday night that a Laxmi idol was turning into Kali. Chakraborty alleged that Ghosh was making money by collecting pranami from the people on the basis of a rumour.				 																																										The vacation bench of Calcutta High Court on Tuesday refused to admit a case filed by the Reliance Telecommunication Company against the order of a subordinate court, restraining it from constructing a tower at Barasat for maintenance of Basic Telephone Service Equipment and DG-sets. Earlier, the Barasat court, on the basis of a petition filed by some local residents, had passed an interim order directing Reliance to maintain status-quo with regard to the tower. Rathindra Ray Chowdhury and three other residents had sought the order, directing the respondents to stop erecting the tower as a World Health Organisation (WHO) report had allegedly warned against a harmful ray from such towers. The Reliance Telecommunication Company in its petition before Calcutta High Court cited an agreement with the director of telecommunication drawn on July 20, 2001, allowing it to lay fibre cables across the country. The high court bench of Justices D. Seth and A. Banerjee refused to accept the petition and directed the company to first file an appeal before the district judge.

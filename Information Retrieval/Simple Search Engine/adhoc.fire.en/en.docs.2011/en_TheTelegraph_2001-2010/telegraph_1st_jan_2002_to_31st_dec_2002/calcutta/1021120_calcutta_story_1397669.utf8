 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 A life like mine
																								Sibasish (in the photograph) is a 14-year-old lad of Rishi Aurobindo Colony slum. Born amid poverty and deprivation, this young boy has seen the grim side of life from a very tender age. Yet he dares to dream and aspires to create a better world order  not just for himself, but for his family, neighbours and all children of the world. Two years ago, he and his friends formed Ekjot. Under the guidance of Prayasam and Unicef, this group has been actively involved in educating slum-dwellers through skits and role-plays highlighting the benefits of healthy living and practising hygienic habits for a better life. The efforts of these child advocates have been duly recognised. In fact, they are the only representatives from India to feature in A Life Like Mine, a book on child achievers in the field of social welfare being released by Unicef today on the occasion of Childs Rights Day. Unicef will also give out a special award of recognition to the Area Health Minders of Rishi Aurobindo Colony. A dance montage, Shustho Thakar Aw-Aa-Kaw-Khaw, will be performed by Prayasams Ahlladi group. Deyala is also on the cards.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Bidyut Bhavan Auditorium, Salt Lake City

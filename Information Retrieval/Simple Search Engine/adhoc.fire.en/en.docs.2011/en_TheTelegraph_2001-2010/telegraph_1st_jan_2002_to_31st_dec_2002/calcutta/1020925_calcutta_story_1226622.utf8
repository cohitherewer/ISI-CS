 Wednesday, September 25, 2002 				 A reflection of life
																								A group of 12 contemporary artists who have been working tirelessly under the umbrella organisation of Chitri-O-Bhaskar Gosthi are currently hosting an exhibition of their paintings, sculptures, drawings and graphics. These artists have their own distinctive styles. The group has three sculptors: Ranen Dutta, Asim Basu and Dipankar Dutta. Ranen Dutta depicts social life, experimenting tirelessly with mass and volume in terracotta, bronze, wood, stone and glass. Basus stylised figurative humans and animals depict action, speed and motion. Dipankar Dutta is inspired by nature and in his work he disintegrates the original form and retains the essence. The painters, too, have their individual styles. In Asoke Kumar Biswas work, the elementary functioning of events is etched in a particular form through a mental process. Prithwis Sikdar experiments with colours and medium. Ratan Banerjee expresses contemporary society in his own language. Prithwis Sen juxtaposes past and present in his works. Chandrasekhar Acharyas world is steeped in between dream and reality. Rama Prasad Ghatak is influenced by the simplicity of folk art. Nature inspires both Dinesh Gain and Gautam Sharma. Subbudha Ghosh expresses himself through The doorways. 																								When: Till September 26; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, Central gallery

				 																																																																				 This is with regard to the report Church shuts gate on family (Metro, August 8). I find it difficult to understand why the church authorities are trying to drive away this poor family from the premises. The Armenian church committee is supposed to look after all the Armenians here. As there are hardly any Armenians left in the country and there are a lot of church properties which are being given on lease or sold as there is nobody to occupy the premises, Armenians, who are occupying the premises, should not be evicted. It is strange that the committee is trying to do exactly that. The Armenian church committee might ask the Stephens to perform some duties to the church, if it wants. There must be something wrong somewhere as there seems to be no apparent reason for an Armenian family to be made to forced out if they have been living in a church property for so long. 				 																																													I, as an Armenian, would like all the community members to get together and solve the problem internally, without taking the issue to court and making a big issue of the whole thing. After all, this tarnishes the communitys image in society.				 																																													Mesrov Minassian,				 																																													Address not given.				 																																																																				It was sad to read about the death of a six-year-old due to a fall from the footboard of a bus (Girl pushed off bus crushed by wheels, Metro, August 8). What is amazing is that the child was following her parents off the bus. The parents, specially the father, should have made sure that the child got down first as they could see another bus coming from behind. Since buses are known for their rash driving, it is the public who have to safeguard themselves.				 																																													Purnima Vasudeva,				 																																													Rowland Road.				 																																													lThe Supreme Court has directed all states to take steps against rash driving, which has not been heeded. Also, it is a matter of disgrace that Behala Balananda Brahmachari Hospital does not have an emergency section. Many more Namakshi Mukherjees will have to be sacrificed before the authorities wake up.				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				It is heartening to learn that Calcutta High Court has decreed that no liquor shop should exist within 1,000 feet of educational institutions, places of worship, hospitals and bathing ghats (High court pushes liquor shops 1,000 ft away, Metro, August 9). But is it not a penal offence under the law of the land to use any unit of measurement other than metric ones? Will the legal metrology wing of the government please take note?				 																																													Chameli Pal,				 																																													Batanagar.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Medikit on return route (Metro, August 2), it is quite unfortunate that Rotary Club of Calcutta Mahanagar will have to return equipment worth Rs 5 crore to Carter Blood Care in the US as the NGO shall have to cough up around Rs 90 lakh as customs duty. Alas! Donor is willing but receiver is reluctant.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Green-zone draft gathers dust (Metro, August 6), it is distressing to learn that the much-hyped green belts have not been created in the city due to the apathy of the civic body. Given that Victoria Memorial draws so many visitors, the civic body should plant more trees there. Besides, the angel atop the building should be made to rotate.				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia.				 																																																																				While Calcutta University deserves kudos for publishing records of its undergraduate examinations in record time, the authorities should also make sure that the evaluation is accurate (Shah pat for results records, Metro, August 6). 				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																													Lake Road.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Torture complaint (Metro, September 4), Rev Debdutta Sarkars allegations against me are baseless. Instead, I should have been the complainant. My husband tortures me physically and emotionally. My mother-in-law and sister-in-law, witness to his ways, came to my rescue along with the Karaya police when he hit me a week ago. We still live under the same roof and never has he mentioned filing a suit against me. Nor have I received any summons from the court in this regard.				 																																													Victoria Sarkar,				 																																													Address not given.

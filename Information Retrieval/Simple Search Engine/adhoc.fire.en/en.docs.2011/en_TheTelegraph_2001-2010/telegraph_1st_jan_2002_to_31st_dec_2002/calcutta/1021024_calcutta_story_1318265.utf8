 Thursday, October 24, 2002 				 Truck hijack ring busted
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An inter-state racket in intercepting goods-laden trucks and hijacking them across the border to Bangladesh was busted on Tuesday. Six criminals, including the kingpin, were detained.																								Additional director-general of CID, S.I.S. Ahmed, said sleuths trapped the mastermind, Mohan Singh, on Tuesday at the Chichira checkpost in Midnapore, when the group was trying to intercept a city-bound truck. Two key men are still absconding.																								During interrogation, Singh confessed to the crime and took the sleuths to various hideouts to recover the stolen vehicles and goods. Special superintendent of police, CID, Manoj Malaviya said three trucks carrying expensive goods went missing while on their way to the city recently. The first truck from Ahmedabad, with garments for export, did not report to its Calcutta office on October 2. Similarly, another Baruipur-bound truck carrying plywood from Mathabhanga went missing after it crossed the Farakka checkpost last week. The third, carrying white oil from Jhargram and bound for Assam, also disappeared mysteriously. 																								A spate in such incidents prompted us to step up patrolling near the checkposts. On Tuesday, we finally managed to bust the racket, Ahmed said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Fog shroud hits air, rail schedules
 OUR BUREAU																								For the second day on Thursday, a shroud of fog disrupted life in the city. With visibility between 500 metres and 1,000 metres, air traffic and train services were thrown out of schedule. The weatherman brought more bad news, saying the city could expect another foggy morning on Friday. 																								On Thursday, flights could neither land nor take off till 9.30 am, airport sources said. About 18 flights, including Indian Airlines, Alliance Air, Jet Airways and Air Sahara, were held up at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport because of poor visibility.																								A Delhi-bound flight of Indian Airlines was the first plane to leave Calcutta shortly after 9.30 am. Incoming flights, too, were delayed, said airport officers.																								Some of the flights of the four airlines, bound for Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, were delayed in the afternoon and evening because planes from other airports arrived late. 																								Train services were also affected by the fog. They were disrupted on different sections in Sealdah and Howrah as the signals were not quite visible, railways officials said.																								Eastern Railway sources said on the Howrah section, trains were delayed by around 20 minutes on an average, and on the Sealdah section, they were more than 10 minutes late. Drivers stopped trains at different stations for passenger safety. Visibility was so poor that they thought it would be unsafe to run the trains, a senior Eastern Railways official said.																								The fog was particularly heavy on the EM Bypass and the outlying areas of the city.

 Saturday, December 28, 2002 				 Tribute to a living legend
					 Pandit V.G. Jog 																								Very few artistes have enjoyed the rare privilege of being one of the ruling monarchs in the Indian classical music scene for over four decades like the wizard of violin, Pandit V. G. Jog. Born in Maharashtra in 1922, Pandit Jog was trained by some of the renowned musicians of his time including Shankar Rao Athavle, V. Shastry, Dr S.N. Ratanjankar and Ustad Alauddin Khan. Groomed in the Gwalior, Agra and Bakhle gharana, Pt. Jog evolved his own characteristic style: blending of gayaki and gatkari, noted for purity of melody and rendition, a formidable laykari and ability, dignity, crispness and ease to communicate musically. Recipient of innumerable awards and honours, Pt. Jog is at present suffering from a debilitating illness. However, the music world has not deserted him. The Shakhri Begum Memorial Trust (founded by Ustad Rashid Khan, in memory of his mother) and Ramakrishna Institute of Culture will jointly confer the Quibla Inayat Hussain Khan Smriti Puraskar (2002-2003) to Pt Jog today. An evening of Indian classical music will be held on the occasion featuring Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan (vocal) with Ustad Sabir Khan (tabla), Amaan Ali Bangash (sarod) with Bikram Ghosh (tabla), Pandit Anindo Chatterjee and Anubrata Chatterjee (tabla lahara) with Pandit Ramesh Misra (sarangi). 																								When: Tomorrow at 5.30 pm																								Where: Vivekananda Hall, The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture

 Saturday, October 05, 2002 				 Foodstall fare check sought
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Consumers, students and scientists on Friday decided to send a list of recommendations to the state government for measures to ensure sale of quality food from roadside stalls.																								The suggestions were worked out at a programme organised by students and teachers of Jadavpur Universitys (JU) food technology department on Friday.																								Scientists, including JU teachers, and officials of the Central Food Research Laboratory and the Central Food Technology Research Institute said complaints were on the rise of bacterial contamination in cooked food being sold at roadside stalls in the city. All this has sparked off health problems and should be checked fast, the group said.																								B.R. Ray, former director, Central Food Research Laboratory, said deteriorating standards of sanitation and hygiene in most stalls were responsible for the rise of diseases in the city. Representatives of various consumers organisation, attending Fridays programme, stressed the need for government intervention to stop the practice.																								Scientist D.C. Sen said special drives should be conducted by the health department, as well as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), to ensure that all rules related to sale of cooked food are diligently followed by the stall-owners.																								The suggestions at the meeting include setting up of separate enclosures for foodstalls, especially on those stretches where the existing ones are already located, adequate supply of water at the foodstalls, electricity connections and regular monitoring by the government and the CMC.

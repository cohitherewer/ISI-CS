																								Veena Bhargava is a veteran artist whose exhibition of paintings begins today. Most of her imageries spring from her urban experience. Not one to remain aloof and ensconced in her self-created universe of colours and forms, this sensitive artists canvases depict her strong social concern. Her paintings are city vignettes. Bhargava draws inspiration from just about everything she comes across  from media, mythology, calendars and almanacs to kitsch and popular film culture. In an effort to integrate the energy of different fine arts, the gallery is simultaneously holding performances by dancers and musicians along with Bhargavas exhibition. Priti Patel and her troupe (picture left) will present a dance performance tomorrow at 6.30 pm. Musicians Anjum Katyal and Jayashree Singh will perform on September 6 and painter Adip Dutta will deliver a lecture on September 14. 																								When: Till September 15; 4 pm - 8 pm																								Where: The Artery, Himadri Building																								 22 Ballygunge Park Road

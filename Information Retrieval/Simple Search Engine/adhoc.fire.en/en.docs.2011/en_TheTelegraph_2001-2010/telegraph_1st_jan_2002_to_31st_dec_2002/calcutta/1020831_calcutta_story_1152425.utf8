 Saturday, August 31, 2002 				 2 stabbed, one hacked to death
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Three persons, including a woman, were murdered in the city and its suburbs on Friday. 																								A 26-year-old woman, Shanti Mullick, was stabbed to death in Nimtala, in the North Port police station area, early on Friday. Deputy commissioner of police, port division, Harman Preet Singh, said Shanti and her husband Ganesh lived with their two sons and a daughter in two rooms of a house near Nimtala Ghat. Shanti was stabbed twice in the back around 3.30 am in her room. She bled to death. Ganesh works in the Nimtala crematorium.																								There are two versions to the story. Neighbours told the police that Shanti was having an affair with Bimal, their neighbour, and Ganesh had threatened them. Ganesh might have killed Shanti while she and the children were asleep, Singh said.																								Police, quoting Ganeshs statement, said Shanti had a quarrel with Bimal last week because he was trying to rent out the adjacent room to another woman. Bimal left his house a couple of days earlier and had not returned till Friday.																								In another incident in Howrah, Zeeshan Mullick was hacked to death by his brother-in-law after a quarrel at Kharda, in Amta, on Friday morning, Howrah superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar said. 																								Mullick had demanded money to start a business on Thursday night, but his brother-in-law refused. On Friday morning, while Mullick was asleep, his brother-in-law hacked him to death with a chopper. The police are looking for the brother-in-law.																								In another incident at Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, Swapan Mondal stabbed to death his brother, Khokan, 30. Additional superintendent of police, industrial, Rajesh Singh, said the two brothers were at loggerheads. On Thursday night, they had an argument and both attacked each other with knives. Khokan succumbed to his injuries on Friday morning. Swapan is absconding.

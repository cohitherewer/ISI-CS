 A STAFF REPORTER																								A mother put an end to her sons life as punishment for siding with his father against her. The neighbours handed over the woman to the local police. 																								The incident occurred on Saturday morning at Biswaspara, in the Thakurpukur police station area. Sabita Patra, the accused, had been quarrelling with her husband Nabin since early on Saturday. Their son Pinku was sleeping in an adjacent room.																								Unable to bear the commotion, Pinku came out and intervened, taking his fathers side. The quarrel stopped and Pinkus father left home, said Debkumar Ganguly, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.																								The youth, then, returned to his room. The humiliated mother followed Pinku and hit him on the head with a wooden bolt of a door, said Ganguly. On hearing the youth scream, neighbours rushed in.

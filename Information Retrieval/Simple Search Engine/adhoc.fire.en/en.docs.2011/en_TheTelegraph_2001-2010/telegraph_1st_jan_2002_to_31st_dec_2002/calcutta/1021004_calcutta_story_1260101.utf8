 Friday, October 04, 2002 				 Doctor deposes in Bypass murder case
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A year and a half after Gopal Roy, 55, died in an attack by miscreants on the E.M. Bypass while on his way home, a doctor of Alipore morgue, P.B. Das, testified in court on Thursday. According to the police, Das is a key figure in the case and his report could establish that Roy had been murdered.																								The post-mortem report indicated that Roy had suffered concussions in the brain after being hit with a rod, an officer said. Das testimony in the court of ninth additional district judge Gopal Sarkar is extremely vital to confirm that the miscreants had, indeed, murdered Roy and escaped with the valuables.																								Roy had gone to his daughter Satarupas house in Thakurpukur on February 28, 2001, with his wife Sumati. On their way back on a scooter, three miscreants waylaid them near Captains bheri, on the Bypass. The miscreants hit Roy on the head with a rod and escaped with a suitcase containing valuables. Roy was taken to Ruby General Hospital, where he later died. Sumati, however, recovered from her injuries.																								The incident sparked widespread protest against police inaction. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee summoned South 24-Parganas superintendent of police D.K. Ganguly and directed him to arrest the culprits. The force was asked to step up vigil along the Bypass and increase patrolling.																								After a series of raids, three miscreants  Kancha, Raju and Phuchka  were arrested from their Chingrihata hideout. The three have been charged under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.																								Additional superintendent of police Rajesh Singh said several witnesses have testified in the past year. Investigating officer Somdeb Banerjee and another officer, Biswanath Halder, who produced the inquest report of the case, will testify before the judge in the next few days. A verdict is expected in a fortnight.

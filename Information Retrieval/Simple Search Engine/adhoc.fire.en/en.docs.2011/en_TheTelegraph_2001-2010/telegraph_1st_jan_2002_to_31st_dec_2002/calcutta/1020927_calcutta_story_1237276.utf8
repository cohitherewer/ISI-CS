 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 A festival of diploma films
																								The Satyajit Ray Film amp; Television Institute will be hosting the SRFTI Film Festival 2002  a two day festival of Diploma Films made by the second batch of students from the institute. The festival begins with a screening of Khoj, a 27-minute film, directed by Tridib Kumar Poddar. This short film was shown at the Festival Du Cannes (Cannes Film Festival) this year and was awarded the BFJA Award for Best Director (short film) this year. The other films to be screened today include: Chhota Aasman (Dir: Nilanjan Banerjee; 30 minutes) and Sundor Jeebon (Dir: Sandeep Chattopadhyay; 37 minutes). The line-up for September 28 are: Abhiman Band Party (Dir: Shiladitya Sanyal; 31 minutes), Kalu Ravi (Dir: Sagar Chanabasappa Bellary; 34 minutes), Jharna (Dir: Vivek Kishore Kakade; 21 minutes), Oass (Dir: Saugata Purakayastha; 32 minutes) and The Swing (Dir: Prasenjit Ghosh; 35 minutes). The films give an insight into the psyche of young, contemporary filmmakers-in-the-making who explore tender human relationships and depict the various facets of contemporary society in their films in their unique pictorial language. Poverty, violence, jealousy, exploitation and other facets of life are depicted very sensitively and it is the novelty of treatment and the taut editing which keep viewers glued to the films.

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Imported at a high cost, MosBuster, the mosquito destroyer deployed experimentally by the civic health department in north Calcuttas Kali Singhi Park, has proved a huge flop.																								Though the supplier firm claimed that the vector annihilator, working on technology developed by USDA and NASA, was the most effective mosquito-control device in the world, the machine, during its 15-day trial run, could trap only two flies and seven mosquitoes.																								Tejendra Garg, managing director of Industrial Gases Limited, the firm which imported the MosBuster, had claimed: It starts delivering tangible results from Day One. The bags filled with dead mosquitoes every day prove its worth. Garg couldnt be contacted on Sunday for a response.																								The poor performance of the MosBuster prompted local councillor Smita Bakshi to write to member, mayor-in-council (health), Javed Ahmed Khan and health officer of the borough Sekhar Ghosh, to remove the useless machine and make room for the puja pandal of Simla Byayam Samity. I was surprised to see some mosquitoes buzzing around the machine, said Bakshi.																								I have forwarded the letter to municipal commissioner Debasis Som, as I was always kept in the dark about the machine, said Khan. I heard that the supplier had organised trial runs in the CMC office, but I was never invited to the demo. Nor was I consulted before negotiations with the supplier, he added.																								Negotiations over the MosBuster were handled entirely by the municipal commissioner, said officer-on-special-duty (health) Atanu Mukherjee.																								Som admitted he was convinced now that the performance of the machines is not encouraging at all. He said he had spoken to ITC officials last week. The company, which had installed the MosBuster on the campus of its upcoming hotel on the Bypass, was also not satisfied with the results.

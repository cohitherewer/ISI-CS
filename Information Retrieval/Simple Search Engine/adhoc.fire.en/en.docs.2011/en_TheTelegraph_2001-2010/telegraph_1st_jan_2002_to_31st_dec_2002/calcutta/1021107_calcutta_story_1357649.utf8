																								Three senior artists  Tridib Chandra, Kamal Kumar Mukherjee and Deba Prasad Guha  are currently holding an exhibition of their recent works under the banner of Trio. The members of Trio have individualistic approach to their subjects, their treatments differ, but what binds them together is their commitment to art and creativity. Bubbling with ideas, the three artists often reach out for symbolic expressions occasionally verging on abstract art. Their works are striking and contemporary, and the compositions intricate, profoundly effective with a maturity acquired over the years. 																								When: Till November 9; 10 am - 7 pm; Saturday (10 am - 3 pm)																								Where: Gallery Chemould, 12F Park Street

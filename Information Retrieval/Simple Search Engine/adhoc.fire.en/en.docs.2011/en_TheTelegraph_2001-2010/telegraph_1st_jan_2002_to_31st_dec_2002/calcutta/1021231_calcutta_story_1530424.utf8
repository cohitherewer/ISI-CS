				 	AMIT CHOUDHARY																									May as well be his motto, with the time-defying activity he has seen himself at the centre of. Debating, acting, advertising, event management, writing and loads more to follow.																									Operations are this guys forte. The 21-year-old has made fests his business. Not only is he noticed when he performs on stage, he holds the reins backstage, too, with his event management organisation  Byond Dreamz. He starts from scratch, designing the mascot, punch-lines, stage dcor, invitations and trophies. The emcee coordinates with moderators, hosts, judges and, of course, the students.																									Is what he was dubbed when he left his Birla High School days behind, with the Best Outgoing Student Award in hand. After his sterling record on the fest circuit with debates, mock parliament, dramatics, creative writing, medley, impact and poster-painting, they had little choice. He wrote skits, took the stage at the British Council drama fest, was called best speaker at L.N. Birla Inter-school Debate, 1999-2000.																									As visualiser in a city advertising agency. The six-month stint was a learning experience, and should aid his cause of signing up at a premier B-school, with majors in marketing.																									But just as enriching were his days wearing the writer-editor cap. The third-year commerce student at St Xaviers College started out editing his school magazines English section, and the annual student Hindi publication. Freelanced with city dailies, too. But in his spare time, he prefers writing poetry, rather than prose, in both English and Hindi.																									At the dude who still manages to ace the acads. He topped class throughout secondary school, and was school topper in Class X boards. Won a merit certificate from the Government of India, for being among the national toppers in mathematics, and a scholarship from Vidya Mandir Society. Early-morning B.Com blues aside, he has secured 72.5 per cent in the Part-I Honours exams already. Counts amongst his inspiration, pals Rahul and Girdhar and brother Sumit.

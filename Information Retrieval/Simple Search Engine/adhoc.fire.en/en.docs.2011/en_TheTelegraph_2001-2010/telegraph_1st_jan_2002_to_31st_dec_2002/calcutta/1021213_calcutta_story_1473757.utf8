The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, December 13, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									In Calcutta and the surrounding areas, the ground available is occupied by cricket enthusiasts round the year. Either matches are being played or coaching camps are being held. As a result, children interested in other sports are being deprived of practice opportunities. It may be pointed out that the game of cricket is costly as it requires quite a few props. I appeal to the CMC authorities to earmark time slots for separate games at the grounds under its jurisdiction.

There are several temporary markets in and around Calcutta, which deliberately mislead customers. The shop-owners sell their products at reduced prices, thereby attracting crowds. But the sellers use fraudulent balances to weigh the goods. The customers, too happy to get a good bargain, are usually unaware of the fact that they are being cheated on the weighing scale, since no one inspects the weights and balances.				 																																									Bhupen Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.

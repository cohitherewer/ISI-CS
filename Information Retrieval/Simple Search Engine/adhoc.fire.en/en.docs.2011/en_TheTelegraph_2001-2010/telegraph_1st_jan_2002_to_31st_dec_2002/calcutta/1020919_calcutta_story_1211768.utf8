				 																																																																				 Apropos the report Dawn rain with kiss of death (Metro, August 13), a child fell prey to the gross negligence of irresponsible people.				 																																													The source of the mischief was a switchbox installed at the crossing of Allenby Road and Heysham Road at a height of hardly a foot from the ground. Moreover, the cover of the box was open, the earthing wires were disconnected and the insulation of the switch had already been damaged. To top it all, the box was submerged under knee-deep rainwater.				 																																													Any person other than the unfortunate girl, who was escorting her three younger sisters back from school, could face the situation even without the water-logging. The faulty streetlight circuit did not snap instantly, leading to the victim being electrocuted for a prolonged period. So, by the time the poor child was taken to hospital, she had breathed her last. 				 																																													Who is responsible for the maintenance of the power supply gear? The following day, CESC personnel were seen busy digging in the area to pre-empt any possibility of a leak in current!				 																																													Strangely enough, there was no hue and cry for such a tragic end of a child who did not belong to an affluent family. 				 																																													The incident should at least act as an eye-opener for the authorities, as there are plenty of such power pillars and streetlight columns in the city left in precarious conditions by callous electricians.				 																																													Incidentally, it was praiseworthy of the press photographer who took the snap of the ill-fated switchbox, and brought home the horror of the situation.				 																																													Jyoti Bakshi,				 																																													Heysham Row.				 																																																																				According to the report Pause before you pop the next pill (Metro, Aug. 17), even the Indian Medical Association is worried over doctors prescribing medicines unnecessarily. The existence of an unholy nexus between doctors and drug companies is an open secret. To combat the menace, the doctors should be allowed to prescribe only the generic name of the medicines and not particular products.				 																																													Sujit De,				 																																													Sodepur.				 																																																																				Isnt it peculiar that when the headmaster plays such a vital role in a schools administration, 1,100 schools in the state were left to function without one for six years? (Six years to appoint headmasters, Metro, August 19) It is appreciable that finally, the West Bengal School Service Commission is gearing up to fill the vacancies. Better late than never.				 																																													Bhupendra Nath Bose,				 																																													Dum Dum Park.				 																																																																				Is the incident reported in NRS doctor beaten up on train (Metro, August 14) an example of the security of passengers? A compartment full of people did not dare to raise their voices against the miscreants. This reminds me of a similar incident, Magistrate beaten up, thrown out of running train (Metro, April 24, 2001). Where personal security is under threat, maintenance of trains is asking for too much!				 																																													Dr. Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				It is because of people like Mahnaaz that our social structure has not collapsed, despite the likes of Narendra Modi, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Bal Thackeray (Lessons laced with love and hope, Metro, August 15). 				 																																													Kalyan Ghosh,				 																																													Park Street.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Doctors casualty in clean-up (Metro, August 16), it is heartening to note that the government is taking remedial measures to improve work culture in hospitals. It has been found time and again that the doctors are not available during duty hours, which sometimes results in the death of the patients. Private practice is where their attention lies. The government has shown ample courage in taking this step.				 																																													Rabindra Nath Kar,				 																																													Sankar Ghosh Lane				 																																																																				Apropos the report Cops cross over close shave (Metro, September 17), it is a fact that the West Bengal Minorities Commission recommended to the state government the amendment of Regulation 684A of the Police Regulations of Bengal, 1943, which allows only Sikhs and Punjabi Muslims to grow a beard. The recommendation states that Rule 684A be suitably amended to remove this discrimination between Punjabi and non-Punjabi Muslims. I am desired by the chairman, Justice K.M. Yusuf, to state that he did not mention anything about long flowing beards.				 																																													M.A. Alam,				 																																													Member-secretary, West Bengal Minorities Commission.

																									Of things to do, and HV is doing it. The 22-year-old makes time for just about everything in his wall-to-wall schedule, where books and the blues rub shoulders.																									About music is what makes this saxophone and piano player tick. The dude from the B.Com batch of 2002 at Xaviers has been part of the college western music band, and with Harsh on the sax, they won several inter-school fests. Started playing the violin in Class VI, but it was on a trip to Europe in 96 that he first heard the sax and got quot;obsessed quot; with it, and hes been hooked ever since. Now, the guy who prefers to play blues and jazz has passed Grade V in the Theory of Music from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London. But while he makes sure he gets enough classical music in his system, he balances it with some country, grunge, club, reggae, trance and techno																									In acads, either? The M.Com student is also pursuing a Chartered Financial Analyst diploma, a Certified Treasury Manager tag, specialisation in taxation and corporate law. He is busy at work in his fathers exim house plans on getting an MBA some time soon, too. All with the aim of being in the foreign trade and forex management biz.																									Has he. After all, you cant be a politically correct businessman without getting your birdies and bogies right. But the guy who loves teeing off at RCGC also did his time at the badminton and volleyball court, in the TT room and on the cricket and football pitch. The former boy scout was also the patrol leader of the Tigers, part of the Xaviers scout troop. The real PC has sunk its teeth into our boy, as well, who happens to be into multimedia and web-page design. His artsy flair extends to painting and digital photography too.																									God and country is what he was taught to be at the school Leadership Training Service. Showed he cared for nature with his work for the school nature club Xavier Green. Played his part for the underprivileged kids at Titli, where they called him Sir. A more trivial pursuit you could call his stint with the quiz team, Xquizite.

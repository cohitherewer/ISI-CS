				 																																									The ophthalmology ward of SSKM Hospital is in a pathetic condition. There are two toilets opposite this ward and the doctors chamber is filled with a nauseating stench. I had gone there for an eye check-up and the scene reminded me of the unhygienic conditions in a jail. Even some of the jail hospitals are cleaner than this ophthalmology department. Another room was equipped with a computerised eye-testing machine. The hospital authorities should at least ensure a hygienic environment and also shift the gadget to an AC room.

Every other day a blood donation camp is being organised in several localities of the city. In several cases, the organisers exhort residents of the area to donate blood for needy patients. While the move is highly laudable, what irks me is the fact that we scarcely find any political leader donating blood. Are they too precious to be involved in such campaigns?				 																																									Somnath Ghosh,				 																																									Kankurgachhi.

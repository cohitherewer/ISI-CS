 Wednesday, October 30, 2002 				 Tracing footprints in the sands of time
																								It seems like yesterday, but two years have passed since Shaibal Ghosh left for his creative abode. The amicable mans smiling countenance concealed his steely determination to pursue and succeed in his chosen sphere in life. Despite his training in commercial art, watercolour was the ruling passion of Ghoshs life. Traditionally, watercolour is often dismissed as a pallid and wishy-washy medium, but he contented that if handled in the right way, it could easily create an illusion of mass and density. In fact, Ghosh took it as a challenge to elevate this neglected medium to the exalted level of oils and worked tirelessly towards this end. His first major break was his exhibition of Dutch masters at Gallery Katayun. Patiently using his brush to lay on innumerable layers of transparent watercolour, he became skilled at creating solid forms and masses like the Dutch masters, though the latter used oils. Gradually, Ghosh developed a style of his own that was a perfect vehicle for articulating his allegories about life and death. Ghosh had a deeply romantic vision of death. To him death was the blue god (Krishna) who played the flute in a universe flooded with moonlight. He believed death was the fountain of creativity, and the creative soul drowned himself in this fountain to continue his never-ending search. A retrospective of Ghoshs works has been mounted to get a vignette of life traced by him.

				 																																									It is sad that the Salt Lake stadium, one of the best football stadiums of Asia, is falling in standards due to lack of regular maintenance. Cracks have appeared on the walls, the playing field is uneven, and overgrown bushes near the gates have become a haven of snakes.				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Nayapatty Road.				 																																									A number of hardware stores have come up in lanes and bylanes off the Kailash Bose Street- Amherst Street junction. At night, trucks laden with iron rods are parked in front of these shops, blocking the streets, thereby not allowing even emergency vehicles to pass.				 																																									Tathagata Kar,				 																																									Kailash Bose Street.

Sources said the brick-laden truck, travelling at a high speed, crashed into the Byayam Samity truck. Our truck was moving through the Bangabasi area when the accident took place. The idols of Ganesh and Kartick were damaged, said the member. Bystanders rushed to the spot and helped remove the injured to hospital.																								Seven people were taken to the Howrah State General Hospital, while 17 others were admitted to a local nursing home. Three of the injured, whose condition deteriorated, have been shifted to SSKM Hospital. 																								The accident threw traffic out of gear in Howrah.

Five teachers, who were removed from service recently, had started an indefinite hungerstrike on the campus last Wednesday. Pashupati Mondal, general secretary of the state-level organisation of part-time teachers of various state-aided universities, said the association would observe a ceasework in various universities on November 20 to protest a recent decision of the authorities to appoint new part-time teachers after retrenching those who had been working for the past five to 20 years.

A team from Bidhannagar South thana reached the site, along with the branch manager, and switched off the alarm, that went off due to a technical snag.

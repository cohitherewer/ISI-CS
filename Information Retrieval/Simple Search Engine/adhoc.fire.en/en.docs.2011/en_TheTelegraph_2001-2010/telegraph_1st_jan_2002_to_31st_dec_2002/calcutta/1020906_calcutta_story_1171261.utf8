 Friday, September 06, 2002 				 Court orders HS paper recheck
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								After Justice Barin Ghosh and Justice M. Sinha, it was the turn of Justice S.K. Mukherjee of Calcutta High Court to direct the Council for Higher Secondary (HS) Education to re-examine the papers of Subhradip Ray, who had scored 60 per cent in all his subjects, barring mathematics, in HS 2002. In Maths, he was given just five marks.																								On Thursday, the judge also directed the Council to submit the post-publication scrutiny (PPS) report of another student by September 19, 2002.																								Supradip Roy, counsel for the aggrieved student, said Subhradip, a student of Hizli High School, in Kharagpur, had appeared for HS 2001 but scored only 20 in mathematics. In 2002, he reappeared in HS, but could manage only five marks in mathematics. According to Roy, the headmaster of the school had written a letter to the Council stating that a meritorious student like Subhradip could never score only five in mathematics. 																								About his second petitioner, Shalini Chajjar of Mallavpur High School, in Birbhum, Roy said she had got much less than she expected in physics and chemistry in HS 2002. The court directed the Council to re-examine the mathematics papers of Subhradip and submit Shalinis PPS report.																								Roy had earlier served notice to the Council, threatening a contempt case for its violation of a court order. In that order, the court observed that the Council should change the methodology in the publication of results and bring in more transparency to minimise the grievances of students, Roy claimed.

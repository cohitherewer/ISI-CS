 Tuesday, October 08, 2002 				 Cop helpline on Puja donations
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said those harassed by Durga puja organisers for subscription could inform the city police over telephone (214-3230, 214-3024). They need not disclose their identity. The police will take action against the organisers on the basis of the complaints, he said on Monday.																								The secretary and three members of New Agragami Sangha, in Chetla, were arrested on charges of threatening businessman Pawan Agarwal, of BL Saha Road, for subscription. The four were later released on bail.																								Inspector-general Chayan Mukherjee, in charge of law and order, said that a meeting would be convened on Wednesday to determine the deployment of forces at key pujas. 																								Police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty said cops, armed with self-loading rifles, would man the streets near important pandals. 																								Detective department officers would carry out periodic screenings of pandals in troubled spots. We have put nearly 1,100 pujas under the scanner, the police chief said.																								Vigil will be stepped up at the Howrah and Sealdah stations, as thousands visit the city during the Pujas. 																								Traffic curbs																								The police have restricted vehicular movement from the Chowringhee Road-SN Banerjee Road intersection till Park Street because of the incomplete construction work. We are forced to divert the vehicles as the contractors have taken up more than three-fourth of the road, Chakraborty said.																								Unveiling traffic plans for the Pujas, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) M.K. Singh said the Rashbehari connector from the eastern slope of Bijon Setu will be made one-way and traffic can only move from Gariahat towards Ruby Hospital. More than a lakh Kasba residents will have a trying time from Friday noon, after the police put the traffic restrictions in place.																								Singh also announced that traffic along Gariahat Road will be diverted through Swinhoe Lane and Cornfield Road. We will not allow private cars to ply on Gariahat Road. Gol Park-bound cars will have to take the Gariahat flyover, he said. Auto-rickshaws will not be allowed to ply on Rashbehari Avenue from the SP Mukherjee Road intersection till Bijon Setu.

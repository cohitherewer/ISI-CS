The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, November 18, 2002 				 Pashapashi Eka
																								This contemporary play explores modern society and how it has turned human beings into rocks  selfish, insensitive and drifting aimlessly, chasing intangible dreams. Akash and Leena, two protagonists of this play, epitomise the bitter yet true experiences of our daily lives. The play makes a deep dent into the monotonous yet smooth fabric of society and brings to the fore all those key invisible cracks that seem to distance and disintegrate people on social, political, religious, regional, cast, language and other fragments. Things fall apart/ The centre cannot hold, The ceremony of innocence is drowned.... (W.B. Yeats). Pashapashi Eka is an effort to trace the root of this disintegration and weed it off. It searches for the discordant note and tries to replace it with harmony. Written by Rajat Shubhra Pyne, this Dream Theatre production is directed by Goutam and music is by Souvik Chakraborty. 																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Madhusudan Mancha

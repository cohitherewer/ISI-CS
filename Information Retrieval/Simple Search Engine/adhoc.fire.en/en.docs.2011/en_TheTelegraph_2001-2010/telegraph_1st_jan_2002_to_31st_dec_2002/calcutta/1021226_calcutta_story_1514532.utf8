																								The renowned Bharata Natyam and Kuchipudi dance exponent, Indira P.P. Boras name is synonymous with Sattriya dance. She has been instrumental in reviving, developing and popularising this 560-year-old dance form from Assam for the past three decades. She has enhanced the Sattriya dance repertoire by incorporating Borgeet (a distinct devotional genre of Indian classical music) into its fabric. This evening, she, along with her talented daughter, Menaka, will perform selected Sattriya dance numbers including Sutradhari Nrittya, Krishna Vandana, Dash Avatar and Gopi Nrittya. This will be followed by a solo Bharata Natyam recital by Menaka. Blessed with lithesome grace and expressive face, Menaka is fully equipped for a promising career in Bharata Natyam. This evening she presents Natesha Koutuvam, Varnam, Astapadi and Tillana. The programme is being jointly hosted by Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) and Kalabhumi, Guwahati.

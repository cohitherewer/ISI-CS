																								Hosted by Anamika Kala Sangam in association with Taj Bengal, the play, 30 Days in September, focuses on the plight of a victim of sexual abuse who is gradually recovering from her nightmarish experience. She re-lives the trauma of childhood abuses as she digs up painful memories that lie buried deep within victims of incest. The play recounts harrowing incidents in a young girls life when, during her summer holidays, she is sexually abused every day by her lecherous uncle. Her situation is worsened by the fact that her mother turns a blind eye to the entire sordid episode. The traumatic experience leaves the young adult shattered. However, the play ends on a positive note, advocating support for the victim and sharing as a means of therapy. Written by Mahesh Dattani, the play is directed and enacted by Lillete Dubey. Other members of the cast include Joy Sengupta, Neha Dubey and Darshan Jariwala. 																								When: Tomorrow at 5.30 pm																								Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

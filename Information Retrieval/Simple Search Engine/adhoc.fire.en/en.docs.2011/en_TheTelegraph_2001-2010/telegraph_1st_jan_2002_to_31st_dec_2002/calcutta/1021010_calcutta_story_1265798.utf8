 SOUMITRA DAS				 	 A face with a fresh knife wound by Jogen Chowdhury																								Faces and bodies distorted by lust, the weight of years and greed have appeared time and again in the works of Jogen Chowdhury. Lecherous men with bellies like sacks slyly eyeing a tasty morsel, women with breasts hanging loose, oily, avaricious and corrupt politicians with porcine eyes, eggheads turned pumpkins, all peek from Chowdhurys gallery of grotesques.																								With dabs of paint and pen and ink he creates a grey world of venal human beings, expressed through sinuous lines that have the grace of the folk alpana but pack enough punch to take the hot air out of a conceited neta, or to bring out the ludicrousness in a seduction scene.																								But over the past year, his figuration has been undergoing a subtle change. The carnage in Gujarat has made a deep and profound impression on him and this is being gradually expressed in his new works. Some of them will be displayed at his forthcoming exhibition at Bose Pacia Gallery in New York from November 7.																								 Chowdhury has done a series of profiles where every feature is exaggerated to the point of being caricature-like. But with eyes bulging and eyeballs reduced to pinpoints of rancour, their expression is so fierce and vicious, they seem to spew hatred. Grimacing in pain or in anger, they bare their teeth. Their serrated cheeks are riven with fissures, cancerous growths and deep knife wounds. A severed head lies on the side wearing a serene expression. It could be a still life. But its cheek, too, is disfigured with the fresh mark of a knife. The ugliness of these visages is a pointer to the rottenness and the violence seething within.																								When he does nudes, the lines often become angular, like geometrical figures. His figures hover between the real and the unreal. A nude has breasts like lollipops. But her nude female companion sitting next to her wears the moustache of a Kartik image.																								Chowdhury says his work has always stemmed from human relations. I have been shaken by the riots in Gujarat and this is reflected in the characters I have depicted. My work will change radically within a years time. The violence and aggressiveness have left their mark. You must have heard how the stomachs of pregnant women have been ripped apart and the foetus exhibited. So I cannot paint or work like I used to before, says the artist, whose couples in carnal embrace, too, were a disconcertingly repellent sight.																								But he is in no obscene hurry to change unless he has a valid reason for doing so. Nor does he have any call to modify his work to keep abreast of the latest trends in international art. My concern is humanity. The figures create tension in my work. So does space. Many new trends have been thrown up by globalisation and post-modernism. But I have developed a style of my own. I can revitalise it with a new sensibility and consolidate my own position. But I should make sure my individual way of working is not liquidated. I will not break form nor experiment with installation just for the heck of it. I should be able to catch the spirit of our times through lines, says Chowdhury. An artist needs the courage of conviction.

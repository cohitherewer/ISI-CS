		 Monday, October 21, 2002 				 Pedestrian safety a matter of discipline
								Kamal Jaju: If one-side parking is introduced on G.T. Road, pedestrians will benefit immensely. Do you plan to introduce such a system?																																																													Your suggestion is quite appropriate. Before we introduce such a system, people need to make themselves more disciplined. They should cultivate habits like using footpaths and not walk in the middle of the road. We have arrangements for a car park near Bangabasi cinema. Moreover, every promoter should keep in mind that multi-storeyed buildings should have car-parking space.

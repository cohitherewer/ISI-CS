				 																																										The Barasat police arrested a 28-year-old woman and four youths from a house where a kidnapped businessman, Lalan Chowdhury, and his associate Paresh Giri were kept confined. The woman, Shahdad Begum, had been used as bait to abduct the two. The mastermind, Sheikh Manwar, also known as Seku Sheikh, is among the arrested. Police said he, along with two others, had been picked up on December 12, 1999, for robbing a Chinese businessman of Rs 1.7 lakh. Manwar obtained bail from the Alipore court even before the trial began. We filed the chargesheet within the stipulated time. But this time, he jumped bail. He was again arrested and the court sentenced him to five years rigorous imprisonment on August 8, 2002. He and his two associates were sent to Presidency jail, DC, DD, Soumen Mitra, said. On October 10, the last day before the court closed for puja vacation, Manwar moved a bail petition in the high court and was granted bail. On November 6, he snatched a Maruti van from the Bhowanipore area. He used the stolen vehicle for the abduction, added Mitra.				 																																										Manwar engaged Shahdad to trap Chowdhury. After Chowdhury and his associate walked into a trap near Park Circus, they were taken to Barrackpore. Unable to find a hideout, the abductors took the victims to a house in Barasat. Alerted by local residents, the police raided the house, arrested the gangsters and rescued the businessman and his associate. The Maruti van and the taxi used in the abduction were also impounded. We will write to the judge who granted bail to Manwar, informing him about the goons criminal activities after his release, said Mitra.				 																																										Two persons were arrested on Wednesday in connection with a theft at the bio-chemistry laboratory of Medical College and Hospital on October 30. Unidentified persons had broken into the laboratory and made off with two computers and several gadgets, causing the hospital tech network to crash. A police team arrested Shankar Mullick and Md Zainal. Investigations revealed that Mullicks father Ramdhan was a Group D staffer at the hospital. Mullick had stolen the computers and kept them hidden at Zainals residence in neighbouring Giri Babu Lane, from where the duo was picked up on Wednesday morning. 				 																																										Jayati Patra, 40, was knocked down by a CSTC bus on RG Kar Road, in front of RG Kar Hospital, on Wednesday afternoon. She was taken to hospital, where doctors said her condition was stable. The vehicle was impounded but the driver escaped.				 																																										Residents put up roadblocks in two areas to protest power cuts on Wednesday morning. Around 250 people blocked Nilmani Mitra Street for two hours from 10 am. They alleged that the area had gone without power since Tuesday night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, December 09, 2002 				 School buses cause chaos
					 CHARIOTS OF IRE: Autos  wreak havoc on Behala roads. Pictures by Kishor Roy  Chowdhur				 	 ALAPAN BANDYOPADHYAY, district magistrate, South 24-Parganas, met readers of The Telegraph at the Zilla Parishad conference hall. Participants included Sanjit Roychowdhury, Subrata Ghosh, Sukumar Debnath, Deepak Bhattacharya, Sunil Kumar Pal, Joydeb Ghosh, Arup Ratan Mukherjee, Probir Biswas, Arup Mukherjee, Dilip Ganguly, Kalyan Sengupta, Lalit Mohan Tyagi, Subha Pramanik, Bejoy Mukherjee, Chhatradhar Das, Jitendranath Sapui, Sudip Kumar Khanna, Karun De and Priyabrata De				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Subha Pramanik: James Long Sarani was built to speed up traffic. But during the day, a chaotic condition arises because of school buses that are parked along the road.																																																			An identical situation prevails in the city proper too. In the James Long Sarani pocket of Behala, some renowned schools have come up, so the problem is aggravated. Of course, I shall see that the buses are parked as per rules.																																																									

Jitendranath Sapui: The stretch of road from Taratala to Diamond Harbour remains dirty round the year.																																																			To keep the roads clean, both government and individual initiatives are required. However, we have managed to remove the bottleneck at Amtala. Usti bridge has reduced traffic congestion on Diamond Harbour Road. Some foreign countries have evinced an interest in developing Diamond Harbour Road. 																																																									

Chhatradhar Das: I am a resident of Rajpur, on the southern fringes of the city. Here, traffic is crippled by roadside markets.																																																			Actually, congestion is not localised to Rajpur alone. It continues up to Garia. However, you will be glad to know that work on the Sonarpur flyover will start within a month. Construction is in progress on the Baruipur bypass and the Garia junction is being widened. Another six months may be needed for land acquisition at Garia.																																																									

Lalit Mohan Tyagi: We have acquired land at Siriti to start an international-standard educational institution. But the area is quite dirty and a law-and-order situation persists. 																																																			The government is duty-bound to provide security to every citizen. However, here in West Bengal, the law-and-order situation is not alarming at all, though there may be some petty crimes. Regarding cleanliness of the area, the residents themselves need to be aware. 																																																									

Sudip Kumar Khanna: Raja Rammohun Roy Road in Behala needs to widened.																																																			Some stretches of Biren Roy Road have been widened. Encroachments need to be removed before the rest can be widened.																																																									

Sudip Kumar Khanna: A plot of land was donated for an engineering college in Siriti. But work has not progressed at all. 																																																			Actually, the government is not interested in opening any new engineering college. Already, on private initiative, eight or nine engineering colleges have come up in the district. 																																																									

Karun De: How do you propose to check arsenic in areas like Baruipur?																																																			There are both Central and state government projects to tackle the menace. Within a short period, residents of these areas will reap the benefits. 																																																									

Priyabrata De: Kasba, densely populated as it is, has no organised market. 																																																			The government is financially handicapped. So, any private proposal to set up a market will be welcomed.																																																									

Priyabrata De: Those who live along the EM Bypass have no government hospital.																																																			There are a number of hospitals of repute on the Bypass. However, I shall keep your need in mind and talk to the authorities concerned.																																																									

Dilip Ganguly: Bagha Jatin state general hospital is in a shambles. Do you have any revival plans for it?																																																			We are quite concerned about the condition of Bagha Jatin hospital. The situation is being monitored.

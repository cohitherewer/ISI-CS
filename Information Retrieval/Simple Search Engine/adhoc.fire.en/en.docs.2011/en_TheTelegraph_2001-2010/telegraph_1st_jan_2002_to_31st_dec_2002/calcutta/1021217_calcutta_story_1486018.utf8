The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, December 17, 2002 				 The Spirit of Anne Frank
 Fleeing the Nazi regime in Germany  in 1933, a young Jewish girl, Anne Frank, arrived with  her family in Amsterdam. On the eve of her 11th birthday,  the Germans invaded The Netherlands. The Frank family  had to go into hiding. During the time, engulfed in a  claustrophobic state of mind, Anne began to write a diary.  Through her writings, Anne emerges as an intensely gifted  young girl who confronts her rapidly changing life and  the increasing horror of her time with astonishing honesty,  wit and determination. The play, directed by Roysten Abel,  seeks to explore the Dutch experience within the Indian  multi-cultural society. It subtly weaves in issues of  social and ethnic discrimination and religious intolerance.  As five women  a tarot card reader, Ann Kapoor (Shabana  Azmi), a textile designer, Anamika (Nandita Das), a history  teacher Mrs Chandramukhi (Zohra Sehgal), a Hindustani  classical music student Purbani (Mandakini Goswami) and  an Australian dancer-choreographer, Analise (Anastacia  Flewin)  travel in a train, the journey becomes more  perilous. An exchange of pleasantries leads to unravelling  of stories of love and betrayal, of truth and lies. Gradually,  they connect and bond, but discover a danger lurks nearby,  threatening their lives. Presented by the Royal Netherlands  Embassy, ABN-Amro and Spandan.																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: Vidya Mandir

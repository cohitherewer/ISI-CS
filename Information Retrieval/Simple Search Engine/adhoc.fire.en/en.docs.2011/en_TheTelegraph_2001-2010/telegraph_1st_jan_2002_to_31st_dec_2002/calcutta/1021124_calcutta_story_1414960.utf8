 Sunday, November 24, 2002 				 Papers delay post-mortem
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The body of an Indian Navy cook was shifted from one morgue to another before a post-mortem could be carried out. Sources said necessary permission could not be obtained from director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee. The post mortem was finally conducted on Saturday, three days after the man died.																								The cook, an HIV patient, was admitted to the Command hospital on October 21. A month later, he died after falling off the hospital terrace. We sent the body to the Kantapukur morgue, said officer in-charge, Alipore police station, Pinaki Mandal. But the Kantapukur morgue sent the body to the Calcutta Police morgue as it does not conduct post mortems of AIDS patients. 																								Chatterjee, however, claimed he was in the city all the while. No one contacted me, he said.

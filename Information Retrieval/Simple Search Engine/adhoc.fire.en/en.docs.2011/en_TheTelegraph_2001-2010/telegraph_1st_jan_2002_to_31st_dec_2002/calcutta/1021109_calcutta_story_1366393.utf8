																								Based on the Euripides tragedy, The Trojan Women, this play is set in the period after the defeat of Troy by the Greeks. It focuses on the effect of war on the innocent Trojan women. The Greeks, led by King Agamemnon, have won the war by unfair means, killing King Priam, his gallant son, Hector, and thousands of Trojan soldiers, leaving behind an indelible trail of blood and wailing women, including widowed Queen Hecabe, innocent Polyxena and the seer priestess, Cassandra. They all await stoically for the Greeks to decide on their fates. Meanwhile, the victorious Greeks, swelling with pride, commit various outrages. Retribution descends on them as their collective hubris enrages the gods, Poseidon and Athene. But all fail to fathom why the Trojan women are made to suffer so terribly. These innocent women lived peacefully, away from the glare of war and all its evils, following the tenets of society, managing their homes and hearths. Yet they become the actual victims of war. In a strife-torn world, this play highlights the helplessness of human beings  men and women alike  in the face of destiny. This Theatron production is directed by Saswati Biswas.																								When: Tomorrow at 3.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

 Monday, September 23, 2002 				 Silent visual drama
																								Nabanita Banerjee is a talented artist and this is her first solo exposition. Most of her works are done in acrylic with a dash of pastel here and there. She has painted both in large canvases as well as in moderate and small sizes. Her works can be classified in two parts: in some of her works human figures appear as if from limbo, to create a silent visual drama, others are purely abstract optical music juxtaposed in contrast and harmony of colours, says art critic Sandip Sarkar. Banerjees semi-abstract canvases speak of her ability to select her visual frame in which lines and colours mingle in an essentially lyrical relationship. 																								When: Till September 25; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

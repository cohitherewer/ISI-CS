The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, December 19, 2002  Letters
				 Whats in a name? BBD Bag, still  called Dalhousie Square 				 																																																																				 Apropos the report Govt cracks code whip on schools (Metro, November 12), it is amusing to note that in view of the latest Supreme Court judgment, the ruling Reds are formulating a new set of rules and regulations for Anglo-Indian schools. This is clearly meant to help them wrest control of these schools, which they have failed to do so far. Since the government spends a substantial amount on DA grants, it is determined to interfere in the administration of these minority-controlled educational institutions, which are widely acclaimed. However, it is felt that compliance of the guidelines of the government may drag them into hazards in one form or the other, which may lead to the deterioration of the standard of teaching. Authorities of these schools would do well to bear in mind that succumbing to pressure will bring little practical gain as they will be reduced to puppets at the hands of politicians. They should be rest assured that in a city like Calcutta the people are willing to pay enhanced tuition fees for quality education.				 																																													Rabindra Nath Kar,				 																																													Sankar Ghosh Lane.				 																																																																				It is heartening to learn that mayor Subrata Mukherjee has realised that renaming roads by the Marxist government was a historic blunder. (Dalhousie back in BBD Bag, Metro, November 20). The proposal to abolish the road-renaming committee and revive the older names is a step in the right direction. 				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																													lOur political leaders are always interested in cheap publicity stunts. I am glad that one leader has realised the futility of the practice of renaming roads, however peculiar may be his reasons. 				 																																													Virendra Shah, 				 																																													Amratalla Lane. 				 																																													lMost of us are used to the old names of the roads. As a large number of changes in the names of roads have recently been made, it creates confusion. The old names still fascinate us. 				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee, 				 																																													Lake Town. 				 																																																																				Apropos the report Repair drive on city hub pavements (Metro, November 19), it is quite amusing to note that the CMC has allotted a lump sum for undertaking repairs of pavements in the different wards. The allotment of Rs 2.5 lakh to each ward is not logical as the condition of pavements may vary from one part of the city to the other. The funds allotted should depend on the extent of damage. 				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Varsities brook no Vajpayee book (Metro, November 18), it is perplexing to learn that University Grants Commission chairman Arun Nigavekar requested vice-chancellors of three city-based universities to buy copies of a book on Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The request is in bad taste. 				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia.				 																																																																				The report Bangla arrests with ISI link (Metro, November 19) confuses fact with conjecture. On November 18, during the routine press briefing session, it was only stated that two Bangladeshi nationals possessing illegal firearms were arrested and they allegedly had criminal records in their country. The remaining ingredients were entirely the views of your reporter and cannot be attributed to the Calcutta Police. 				 																																													Soumen Mitra,				 																																													Calcutta Police Headquarters, Lalbazar.				 																																													Metro replies: There is no reason to believe that the report confuses fact with conjecture. Soumen Mitra did say two Bangladeshis were arrested. This he has not disputed; the rest he has. But the facts do not stop here. For Mitras information, Metro conducted its own investigations, including talking to other police officers as well as intelligence officers in the Bangladesh government, to garner further information. The end result was an exclusive investigative report, of which Mr Mitras input formed only a small part, and not conjecture.				 																																																																				It was great to know that Sourav Ganguly has decided to pitch in for leprosy sufferers (Waugh a song-and-dance, skipper, Metro, November 19). Role models like Steve Waugh and Ganguly should get linked with humanitarian causes.				 																																													B.N. Bose,				 																																													Dum Dum Park.

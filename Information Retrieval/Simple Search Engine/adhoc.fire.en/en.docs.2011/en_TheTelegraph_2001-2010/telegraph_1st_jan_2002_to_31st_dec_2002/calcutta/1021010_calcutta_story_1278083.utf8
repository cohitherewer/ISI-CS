The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

				 																																																																				 When friends and relatives of the passengers on the ill-fated Rajdhani Express were desperately trying to trace their near and dear ones, our honourable leaders Mamata Banerjee, Subhas Chakraborty, Ajit Panja, etc., were trying to polish their image by their unsolicited presence at Howrah station, giving hope and solace to the devastated (Solace show on political platform, Metro, September 12). Indeed, it was an irony of humanity. 				 																																													Did their presence make things better for victims and their families? The answer is no. The information counter could be best described as a marketplace, where pandemonium had broken out. The presence of these ministers and their repeated show of sympathy did not improve anything and only added to the chaos. 				 																																													The most unexpected was the presence of a learned lawyer like Ajit Panja, whose supporters were trying to project him as a messiah, who was there to fight the mismanagement of the Left-ruled government. 				 																																													Couldnt all of them find a better place to settle their political scores? 				 																																													Sumant Poddar,				 																																													Kyd Street.				 																																																																				It is amazing how, year after year, pandals come up blocking the road (Pandal brake on blaze battle, Metro, October 3). These not only obstruct traffic, but also create other inconvenience. Since pandals are constructed with inflammable materials, it is in the residents interest to ensure that the local pandal stays off the carriageway. The Tiljala Road incident could have occurred in any locality.				 																																													Krishna Banerjee,				 																																													Jodhpur Park.				 																																													lThe report Pandal brake on blaze battle is totally incorrect so far as Samaj Sebi Sangha Durga Puja is concerned, because of the following factual errors:				 																																													Samaj Sebi is not located on Lake View Road. It is situated on Lake Road (Ballygunge Cultural Association Durga Puja is on Lake View Road).				 																																													Since 1995, we have been leaving enough road space at our pandal site for a fire tender to pass through and the size of the pandal has been kept the same as agreed upon by the police, civic and fire brigade personnel. Moreover, we pushed the pandal 160 ft behind the crossing of Lake Road and Lake View Road to ease traffic congestion on Lake View Road, in spite of severe objections from many of our members and the local people. In appreciation of our gesture, the then police commissioner, Tushar Talukdar, gave us a special prize for co-operation with the authorities.				 																																													Our club has no political inclinations or affiliations. Debu Chatterjee relinquished his office in 1982 and has not been involved in club activities since. He was actually expelled from the club in 2000.				 																																													Anurup Maitra,				 																																													joint treasurer,				 																																													Samaj Sebi Sangha.				 																																																																				It is heartening to know that IPER is doing good work for streetchildren in providing food, shelter, medicine and education for them (Mainstream push for sidelined kids, Metro, September 13). There are several other NGOs like IPER who are engaged in welfare work for the downtrodden. 				 																																													Such organisations definitely need support and recognition from the public. 				 																																													B.N. Bose, 				 																																													Dum Dum Park.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Leprosy cure (Metro, September 3), it is good to learn that the state health department has entrusted the Calcutta Municipal Corporation with carrying out its national leprosy eradication programme in the city. Although door-to-door surveys are being planned to locate leprosy patients, clinics all over the state are in a miserable condition.				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia.				 																																																																				No word is strong enough to condemn the inhuman reaction of a section of political leaders to the mass deaths of children at B.C. Roy Hospital (Sound and fury amid the suffering, Metro, September 5). 				 																																													The state administration, too, took a cue from the political bosses and turned a blind eye and deaf ear to the sufferings of the sick babies at the hospital. Politicians behave as though they are above humanitarian feelings. Is it a civilised society? How long will people tolerate such thick-skinned men at the helm of affairs?				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar, 				 																																													Budge Budge.

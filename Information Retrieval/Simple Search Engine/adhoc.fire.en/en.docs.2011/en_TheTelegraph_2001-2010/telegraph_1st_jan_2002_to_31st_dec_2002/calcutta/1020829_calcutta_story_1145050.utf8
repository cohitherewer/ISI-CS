 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 Lalbazar imparts legal lessons
 A STAFF REPORTER																								They have been in service for the past 20 years. Yet, most cops in the city force are not aware of various sections of criminal procedure. This was revealed during a recent interactive session between police chief Sujoy Chakraborty and officers of different police stations.																								With the Pujas approaching, Chakraborty felt the need to educate his men on legal sections, which would help them in checking crime, especially during the forthcoming festive season.																								On Wednesday, additional police commissioner Damodar Sarengi coached the first batch of officers-in-charge (OCs) at the Lalbazar briefing room. Officers of the eastern suburban division attended the first educative session. After the session, most officers agreed that the orientation was very much necessary... Almost all of us are ignorant about such sections, an officer said on conditions of anonymity.																								There are around 80 inspectors, posted as OCs and additional OCs in city police stations. Joint commissioner Raj Kanojia said the department is looking at alternative ways to check crime and Wednesdays session was one such step in this direction. 																								There are several provisions in criminal procedure that could help the police keep track of miscreants and prevent crime, he said. Sections 151, 107, 109 and 110 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) are effective in checking crime, he said, adding that a recent study revealed that most officers are unaware of these legal provisions.																								Kanojia said an officer has the power to arrest a person for breach of peace under Section 151 of the CrPC. Under Section 107, if the police is of the opinion that a person is creating trouble, he can be asked to report at the police station. The person has to submit a bond that he will not create mischief and keep officers informed about his whereabouts regularly. If he breaks the provisions of the bond, he can be arrested and put behind bars, Kanojia added.																								Police said Section 110 deals with habitual offenders who could be arrested anywhere in the country, while Section 109 mentions that a police officer can crosscheck the identity of a person and even ask him to furnish a bond about his activities. 																								These are effective sections to check crime and maintain law and order. The OCs have to compile history-sheets of suspicious people and put them under different sections. Psychologically, when a person understands that he is under the cop scanner, he will think twice before committing a crime, Kanojia said.

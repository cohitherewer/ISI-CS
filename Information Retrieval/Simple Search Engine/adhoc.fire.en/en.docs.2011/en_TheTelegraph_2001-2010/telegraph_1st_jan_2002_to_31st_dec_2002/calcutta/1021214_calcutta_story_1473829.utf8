 Saturday, December 14, 2002 				 Vignettes of a bygone era
								 			On the occasion of the annual Uday Shankar Utsav, West Bengal Dance Group Federation and West Bengal State Music Akademi are jointly hosting a unique exhibition of still photographs, Nritya Ek Prajanma Theke Aar Ek Prajanma, tracing the history of dance over the past 75 years. Conceptualised and curated by Aditya Mitra, this collection of rare photographs traces the evolution of contemporary dance forms over the years. The rare, sepia-tinted shots familiarise viewers with the changes in the various styles, costumes, make-up, stage, presentation, etc. that swept the arena of dance since early 20th century. Beginning with Rabindranath Tagores ballet productions to Uday Shankars ballets (picture above) and IPTA productions down to contemporary dancers, the photographs are a glimpse of the rich heritage we have inherited. 																								When: Till December 15; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Gaganendra Shilpa Pradarshasala (Calcutta Information Centre)

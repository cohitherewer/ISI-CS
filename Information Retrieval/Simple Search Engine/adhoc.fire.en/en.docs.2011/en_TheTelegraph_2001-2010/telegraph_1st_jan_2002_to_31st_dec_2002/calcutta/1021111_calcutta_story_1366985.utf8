The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, November 11, 2002 				 Nostalgia
																								Bengal has always played a crucial role in the development of art in India. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Bengal emerged as the nucleus of the Indian Renaissance. Calcutta was the epicentre of Indian art, culture and revolutionary ideas, and attracted the finest creative minds of the time. Post Independence, a new generation of artists probing into modernity came into existence. The Sixties marked an exciting phase in Bengals art. Artists, by now accustomed to democracy, searched for bold and freer form of self-expression. This spirit of adventure was further stoked by the socio-political upheavals that rocked the country. In 1964, a group of enthusiastic and like-minded talented young painters congregated to form Calcutta Painters Group. More than three decades have passed since. The artists have weathered many rough winters, but nothing has been able to wither their creative spirits. An exhibition of their recent works is currently on view. Participants include Robin Mondal, Gopal Sanyal, Prokash Karmakar, Bijon Chowdhury, Jogen Chowdhury, Dhiraj Choudhury, Isha Mohammad, Tapan Ghosh, Bipin Goswami, Amitabh Sengupta, Shibaprasad Karchowdhury and Anita Roychowdhury. 																								When: Till November 14; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

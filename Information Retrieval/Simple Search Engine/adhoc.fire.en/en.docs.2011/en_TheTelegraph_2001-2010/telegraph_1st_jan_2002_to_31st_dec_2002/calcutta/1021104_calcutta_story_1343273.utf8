The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, November 04, 2002 				 Whats Sachin doing in class? In class with Mom and Dad
 															- Enter, new-age pre-school where presence of parent is a must SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 Sachin Tendulkar in his sons school																								The best breakfast of my life, scribbled a proud father, left-handed, in the Khar school notebook. In a white chefs hat and a yellow-and-green apron, he had just rustled up a meal and served his son, two-year-old Arjun. At Eden Gardens on Sunday morning, in trademark blue helmet and all-white, he was feasting on the West Indies bowlers with relish.																								Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar may be the toast of the cricketing world, but back in his sons pre-school, he is just another father whose attendance is compulsory on Breakfast with Dad day. And its not Sachin alone. The same goes for Shah Rukh Khan and Sridevi. Everyone has to do duty at Gymbaroo, Mumbais new-age pre-school inspired by the Australian model, where a parents presence is a must.																								Now, the good news for parents and kids here  Gymbaroo, along with its elder counterpart, Kangaroo Kids, is coming to Calcutta this December. Initially, the pre-schools city branch will admit 36 kids, with six teachers to take care of them. Calcutta will be the 24th centre in the country for the pre-school started by Lina Ashar, an Australian national, in 1992 in Mumbai, where the curriculum is upgraded every month.																								Says administrator Mallika Verma: Gymbaroo is an activity centre for kids aged above 10 months. In the Toddlers Club section, we insist that the mothers accompany the child. When the tots graduate to the Toddlers Transitional Programme after a year-and-a-half, it becomes optional. The facilitator explains the activities to mother and child together. Then it is the mother who takes the child through the paces under the supervision of the facilitator.																								While the mother is the key figure, the centre that will travel to Dubai and Bahrain next year makes it a point to involve the childs entire family into his/her learning environment. 																								If Breakfast with Dad calls for the fathers services, other days on the school calendar, like Grandparents Tea Party and the Messy Play Day, held close to Holi, involve the others. On field trips, too, a guardian has to volunteer to be the class representative (Shah Rukh often takes up duty for son Aryans batch when they go to neighbourhood parks). A parent is often invited over as guest lecturer.																								There are three workstations among which the activities are divided  motor development, drama and language. In the first, through rhythmic movements to music beats and climbing of frames, a childs listening, sequencing and balancing skills are developed.																								At the drama station, they play out their fantasies and ape the professionals who visit them. If a doctor is the months guest lecturer, the kids will be playing out a hospital scene... Live demonstration is the best way to teach at this level, Verma explains. Slides, movies, books and reciting of rhymes make up the language station roster. A theme is specified every month on which all activities in the workstations are based.																								The mothers presence in class, says Verma, is vital. This way she gets to know what exactly is being taught to the child and how. So if she wants to supplement the coaching at home, she does not confuse the child by following other methods.																								But not every parent is keen to go back to class. Skipper Sourav Gangulys wife Dona, for instance. The Odissi dancer is looking forward to daughter Sana  who turned one on Sunday  going to school, so that she can have time to spare for her dance practice and classes. If I have to go with her, whats the point of sending her to school? exclaimed Dona, before being cut short by her daughters wail.

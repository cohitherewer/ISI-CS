 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 A brush with success
																								Our country is not lacking in talent, but lack of opportunities often deprive budding artists from getting their due recognition as their works remain unnoticed, hidden from public view. But thanks to organisations like the Camlin Art Foundation, we get an opportunity to view some of the most original paintings annually. Set up to promote art activities in India and provide a platform for both amateur and professional artists, the foundation provides the much-needed succour for sustaining and expanding the sphere of art in the country. The third Eastern region art exhibition is currently being held here showcasing the brightest and freshest talent in the country. Besides getting an opportunity to display their works, the artists with the best paintings will also qualify for national selection for the coveted Europe Art Tour 2003.																								When: Till November 3; 12 noon - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, 																								 New South Gallery

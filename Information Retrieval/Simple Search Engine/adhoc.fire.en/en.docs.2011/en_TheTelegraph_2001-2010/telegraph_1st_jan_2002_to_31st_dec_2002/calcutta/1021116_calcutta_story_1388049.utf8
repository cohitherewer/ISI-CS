 Saturday, November 16, 2002 				 Maid admits to dacoity in empty flat
 A STAFF REPORTER																								More than a lakh in cash and ornaments were robbed from a flat at Sahapur, in Behala, late on Thursday. The domestic help had been picked up for interrogation, and she has confessed to committing the crime.																								The burglary took place while the occupants of the flat, Gayanath Sinha and wife Dolly, were away, said deputy superintendent of police (town) Subhankar Chatterjee on Friday. Sinha, an employee with the food and civil supplies department, is posted at Canning and comes to his Behala residence off and on. 																								Dolly, an employee with the public health engineering department, had gone to Krishnagar on Monday to a relatives house for Jagaddhatri puja. The couple had given maid Dipti Pal the keys to the flat so she could carry out her daily chores. Dipti was asked to keep the keys with her till the couple returned. 																								But on Thursday evening, Dipti asked the landlord, Sitish Bhowmick, to keep the keys, which made him suspicious. On being asked why she was handing over the keys, Dipti could not come up with a convincing reply.																								Bhowmick accompanied Dipti to his tenants flat, which he found in a state of disarray. He called in the local police. During interrogation, Dipti confessed that she took the valuables because she needed money for her daughters wedding. She admitted that she had roped in two local youths for the robbery. 																								The Sinhas were informed of the burglary and rushed home. Police are on the trail of the two youths, who have been absconding since Thursday night. We hope to round them up soon, added DSP Chatterjee.

		 Wednesday, November 06, 2002 				 																				Meenakshi Atal								Headmistress, The Heritage School																																							The advantage of giving back answer-scripts is two-fold. This way, the students can rectify their mistakes as well as add up the scores. At our school, we always make it a point to let the students take a look at the scripts after all the examinations, be it class tests or terminal assessments. But in a public exam, where thousands of examinees are involved, it is not feasible, even if the idea is sound. Rather, the examiners should be more careful. We owe it to the students, as their entire future depends on the scores of the exam.

 Sunday, October 06, 2002 				 State buildings in civic tax net
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will impose taxes on all state government buildings, including Writers Buildings, the Assembly and Raj Bhavan, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Saturday. The tax net may spread to the Union government buildings as well.																								The state government has been insisting that we generate funds to run the CMC. So, there is no alternative but to take such measures, Mukherjee said. He will meet urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya on Monday to finalise the matter. 																								According to the mayor, the CMC rules have provisions to impose property tax on buildings belonging to the Union government. But no tax has ever been realised. Recently we imposed wealth tax on the Union governments sales tax office at Beleghata. All other Central government buildings may also come under the tax net, he said. The Union finance department has no objections to the CMCs imposing service tax on its buildings, Mukherjee added.																								The mayor said the CMC would go ahead with its plan of realising service tax from clubs and parks. Notices have been sent to well-known clubs, asking them to pay Rs 10,000 as service charge. Small clubs will not be spared either. A minimum of Rs 100 has to be paid by every club, Mukherjee said.

 Friday, November 29, 2002 				 Classical perfection
																								Dhrupad is the origin of Indian classical music. It is very ancient and sacred form of music performed to invoke the Almighty. However, mastering this classical form is not easy and requires total dedication, years of rigorous training and above all, a mellifluous voice. Once patronised by the royalty, Dhrupad lost much of its glory and popularity owing to lack of sponsorship and dedicated pupils. However, thanks to pioneering efforts by people like Baba Bairam Khan Dagar, founder of the Dagar Gharana, that Dhrupad got a new lease of life. He felt the need to create an atmosphere for rendition of a Raga before starting the Bandish and created the Alap. The Alap prepares the ground for the perfect formation of a Raga. Kaberi Kar, a Calcutta-based singer, had the privilege of training under some of the leading contemporary Dhrupad singers including Ustad Rahim Rahimuddin Khan Dagar, Ustad Sayeeduddin Khan Dagar and Ustad Asad Ali Khan (Beenkar) has already made her presence felt by the sheer power and beauty of her performance. A leading exponent of the Dagar Vani, Kars deep knowledge of swar, laya, taal, raga, voice production, shuddha mudra  the very basis of Dagar Vani is impressive. She holds regular workshops not only in India, but also abroad.

 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 Apex court moved for eviction stay
 R.VENKATARAMAN IN NEW DELHI																								A writ petition seeking to restrain the West Bengal government and the Centre from initiating any action to evict an estimated 5,000 families from the banks of the Beleghata canal was moved in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.																								The petition, filed by the Janabasti Uchchhed Protirodh Committee, will be taken up by a Bench presided over by Chief Justice G.B. Pattanaik on Wednesday during mention hour, counsel for the petitioner Bejan Ghosh said. The petition seeks an ex parte injunction restraining the state government, its agents, subordinates, personnel, assigns and anybody else concerned from proceeding in any manner whatsoever with the declared eviction and demolition drive on the East and West Canal Roads, Calcutta, until further order of the apex court.																								The Committee sought an apex court directive for rehabilitation of the evicted, in tune with the government policy of shelter to all by 2007. Pleading that conscionable justice be rendered to them, it said the petition had been moved in public interest for protection and promise of shelter of these ill-fated 5,000 families, who live below poverty line, and will be roofless.																								Apart from the Centre and the state government, the petition has made the state urban development and municipal affairs ministry, and the officers-in-charge of Shyampukur, Narkeldanga, Ultadanga, Maniktala, Beleghata and Cossipore police stations parties to the case.

 															- Why house-hunters are headed for Rajarhats Action Area I A STAFF REPORTER																								Landscaped green corridors, blue waters, ultra-wide tree-lined roads, polycentric urban facilities, dream homes. As Action Area I of New Town, Rajarhat, starts to take shape, brick-by-brick, the focus of house-hunters has swung to the exciting new megacity. And there are a few options to choose from  more than a thousand apartments, by 2004.																								Apart from its own Millennium Towers, the West Bengal Housing Board is involved in three joint-sector projects coming up near the gateway to New Town. Bengal-Ambuja, Bengal-Shrachi and Bengal-Peerless are the three private-public partnerships building housing complexes in Rajarhat Phase I, catering to low, middle and high-income segments.																								Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Ltd, which is developing Utsa, The Condoville, launched Luxury, the HIG apartments of the complex, last month. Plans for Efficiency, the LIG apartments and Comfort, the MIG apartments, were unveiled earlier. Utsa will have 400 apartments in all. There will be 208 two/three bedroom apartments in Luxury, 144 two-bedroom apartments in Comfort and 48 one-bedroom apartments in Efficiency.																								While planning the Condoville, the stress was more on open ground space for recreational activities. The south has been left open to channelise breeze right through the complex, said architect Prabir Mitra, who conceptualised the complex.																								Luxury will house a residents club with a swimming pool, gymnasium, games room, childrens corner, lounge and banquet. A commercial complex will cater to the daily needs of residents and people of the neighbourhood. Utsa, The Condoville at New Town is unique. In many ways, I think it will outshine Udayan (the companys signature project), said Harshavardhan Neotia, managing director, Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Ltd.																								Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltds Greenwood Park, spread across 20,098.65 square metres, proposes to build more than 400 housing units, covering a built-up area of around 40,000 sq m. The complex will also house a central commercial facility over 1,700 sq m.																								A unique feature of Greenwood Park is an open-air theatre facility. A first-of-its-kind amenity to be associated with a housing project, the developers hope this will help in culturally binding people from various walks of life.																								Today, people are looking at economically-viable options of socialising and the open-air theatre will provide residents of Greenwood Park with a solution, Rahul Todi, managing director, Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd, said at the launch of the project. Greenwood Park will have approximately 62 LIG units, 150 MIG units and 200 HIG units, besides a shopping centre, a pre-primary school with playing area, diagnostic centre, health club, restaurant, community hall, childrens park and landscaped terraces.																								The third joint-sector project coming up in Action Area I is Bengal Peerless Housing Development Co. Ltds Animikha. The company, which has developed Anupama on VIP Road, promises to provide quality lifestyle for all sections of society. According to the developers, Animikha guarantees the likeness of the social housing concept of Anupama, thus integrating the complex into a family.																								The Bengal Peerless project, also located at the doorstep of New Town, will have a community hall, childrens parks, landscaped gardens and shops for household provisions.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								The city police on Wednesday asked their commando personnel to be on the ready, in the wake of a recent terrorist attack on a temple in Jammu. A force, armed with sophisticated weapons, has been instructed to be on the alert round-the-clock.																								On Tuesday, Kundan Lal Tamta, acting deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said a group of 15 commandos, under the leadership of an officer, will be ready to combat all sorts of subversive actions. 																								There will be two Maruti Gypsies for the high-profile security personnel to reach their destination as soon as possible. The force will be given sophisticated weapons, like self-loaded rifles (SLR) and carbines, Tamta said. These commandos will be able to reach any trouble spot within 10 to 15 minutes.																								Security in the city was beefed up immediately after the temple shootout in Jammu. Minutes after the incident, city police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty rang up his officers and instructed them to intensify vigil, said a senior officer. We did not wait for an intelligence report from the Special Branch to step up vigil.																								Elaborating on the security arrangements, Tamta said a tight security ring has been put in place around all vital places of worship in the city, following the shootout in Jammus Raghunath temple. Six policemen have been deployed in and around the Kalighat temple, who are manning the entry and exit points. Kalighat police station has also been asked to keep vigil on the temple premises round-the-clock, Tamta added.																								Security personnel have been deployed in front of the Swaminarayan temple, on Lansdowne Road, and the Birla mandir in Ballygunge. Apart from general public, police are frisking the devotees as well. We have directed the police stations to continue their patrol on the temple premises, said Tamta.																								According to Tamta, both the Radio Flying Squad and the High Radio Flying Squad are also patrolling the city round-the-clock. All police stations have been put on alert, he stated. 																								Policemen keeping an eye on the citys exit and entry points, such as the Ultadanga-VIP crossing, Park Circus-E.M. Bypass connector, Rashbehari connector, the second Hooghly bridge and Howrah bridge, have been asked to step up vigil. All vehicles leaving and entering the city are being checked thoroughly, added Tamta.

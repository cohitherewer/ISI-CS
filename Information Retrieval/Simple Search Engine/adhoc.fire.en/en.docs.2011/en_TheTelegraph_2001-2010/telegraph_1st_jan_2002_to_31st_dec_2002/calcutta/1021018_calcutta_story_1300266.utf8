The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 Green bus for clean roads
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The city will soon boast a fleet of green buses. The government will buy 800 buses for different transport corporations under it, transport minister Subhas Chakra-borty announced at Writers Buildings on Thursday. Of these, 400 will belong to the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) and 100 or so to the Calcutta Tramways Corporation (CTC).																								Chakraborty, who discussed transport problems in the city and elsewhere with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, said the buses would be bought within two to three months to make things easier. 																								The buses of Euro-II standard will be low-slung and comfortable. We discussed how earnings from state buses could be increased and how workers unions could help us, he said. Citu leader Rajdeo Goala was present at the meeting.																								According to Chakraborty, 200 buses will be purchased for the North Bengal State Transport Corporation. The rest will go to the South Bengal State Transport Corporation (SBSTC) and the Surface Transport Corporation (STC). He requested the chief minister to ensure that the cess imposed on petrol and diesel was utilised for developing the transport department infrastructure alone. 																								Chakraborty ruled out the possibility of winding up tram services from certain routes. A Japanese concern, Jaica, has already sent a Rs 350-crore proposal for introducing high-speed tram services on the Thakurpukur-Esplanade stretch.

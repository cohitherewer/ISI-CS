 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 Road map for snarl-free Pujas
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Help wanted for hassle-free pandal-hopping during the four festive days. Thats the message from the city police to the revellers. 																								As part of the action plan to ensure smooth traffic movement during the Pujas, the police on Saturday sought the co-operation of vehicle-owners to ease snarls at vital intersections across the city.																								We face immense traffic problems during this period every year. It is vital in our scheme of things that the car-owners co-operate with us, said deputy commissioner of police, traffic, M.K. Singh.																								Unveiling plans to clear bottlenecks during the festivities, Singh has asked drivers to avoid Jawaharlal Nehru Road and the Rashbehari Connector. Traffic is usually maximum on these two key roads, he said. 																								Singh pointed out that the problem would aggravate as the first-phase of the construction of the proposed flyover on Jawaharlal Nehru Road would begin on September 30 and about 50 per cent of the total road space would be blocked for the purpose. 																								The first phase of the work will begin on the stretch between Park Street and Kyd Street junctions on Jawaharlal Nehru Road. So, heavy traffic jams are expected up to Esplanade in the north and Chowringhee crossing in the south, Singh said. 																								The traffic police chief suggested that car-owners use Camac Street or Red Road in order to avoid Jawaharlal Nehru Road during the Pujas. 																								Once a major portion of Jawaharlal Nehru Road is occupied for the construction work, only a 13-metre stretch will be left for two-way traffic movement. Double-line vehicular movement will not be possible on such a narrow stretch, he observed. 																								Singh also announced that the Rashbehari Connector would be open to one-way traffic. Only vehicles from west to east will be allowed to ply, since two big pujas in Kasba on the main road are expected to draw massive crowds, he added.																								Even the Park Circus connector should be avoided due to the Park Circus puja on the Maidan, he said. Vehicle-owners have been asked to avail of the Gariahat flyover instead.

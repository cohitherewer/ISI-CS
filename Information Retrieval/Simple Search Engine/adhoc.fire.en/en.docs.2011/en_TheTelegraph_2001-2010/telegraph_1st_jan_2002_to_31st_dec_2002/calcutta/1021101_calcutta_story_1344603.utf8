				 																																										Chief secretary S.N. Roy on Thursday summoned surgeon superintendent of SSKM Hospital, D.D. Chattopadhyay, and sought from him in writing the details of the incident on Tuesday when mayor Subrata Mukherjee charged him with misbehaviour. Sources at Writers Buildings said Chattopadhyay briefed the chief secretary on what happened after the mayor stormed into his room over a delay in admitting a patient to the hospital. My fault was that I was taken by surprise and forgot to ask him to take a seat, Chattopadhyay reportedly told the chief secretary, adding, that he had already apologised to the mayor for that. Minister of state for health Pratyush Mukherjee said he had asked the mayor to bury the hatchet as the SSKM surgeon superintendent had already apologised. The mayor on Tuesday had ordered that the waste in the hospital should not be removed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporations conservancy department. But he withdrew his order on Wednesday, following chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees intervention.				 																																										The Supreme Court deadline of October 31 to shift the 538 tanneries from the city to the 1,100-acre Calcutta Leather Complex at Bantala ended on Thursday. The state government-appointed build-operate-transfer (BOT) promoter M.L. Dalmia and Company has failed to provide infrastructural amenities at the leather complex. An industry department spokesperson said at Writers Buildings that the expiry of the deadline did not mean that the tanneries in operation at Tangra, Tiljala and Topsia will be closed from Friday. Earlier, the Supreme Court had ordered that the BOT promoter would have to complete work by October 31. The industries department officer said the case is expected to come up for hearing in the Supreme Court in November. We will present a status report and wait for the verdict, he added.

Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said the campaign will be launched in Howrah, Bhatpara in North 24-Parganas, Harishchandrapur and Chanchol in Malda and Bhagabangola in Murshidabad. Trained health workers will ask people not to eat stale food and cut fruits and to wash their hands before meals. Chatterjee said a few cases of cholera were reported from these areas.				 																																										A passport racket was busted in the airport area on Thursday. Police said four persons were arrested after some fake passports were found in their possession.

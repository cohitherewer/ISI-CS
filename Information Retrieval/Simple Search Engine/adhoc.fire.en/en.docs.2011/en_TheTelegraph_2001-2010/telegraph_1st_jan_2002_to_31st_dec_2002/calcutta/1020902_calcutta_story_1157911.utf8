		 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Strike plays havoc with road repairs
								Samiran Mondal: We are residents of Gopal Mishra Road. But the road is non-existent. The main carriageway is over-run by shrubs. Moreover, the entire stretch remains in darkness as there are no streetlights.																																																													I was assured last year that repairs on the road would start in December-January and be completed by March-April. But due to the contractors strike, work has been affected. However, now that the strike has been withdrawn, it is expected that work will resume after the Pujas. Apart from that, the road will be cleared of its shrubs. And streetlights will be fitted soon.

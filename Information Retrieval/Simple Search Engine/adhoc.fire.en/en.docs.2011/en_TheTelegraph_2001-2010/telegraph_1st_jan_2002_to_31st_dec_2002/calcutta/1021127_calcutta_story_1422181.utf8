The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, November 27, 2002 				 No access to exam records
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Former students of Calcutta University (CU), awaiting information on their results, have to be prepared to bear with the silence of the authorities. The reason is not far to seek. 																								The universitys controller of examinations department has no access to the huge record room, where result-related documents are filed.																								In a situation unheard of in any academic institution, the record room is lying blocked for the past four years, ever since the authorities installed a new lift at the rear of the Ashutosh Building. 																								The staircase leading to the record room, situated on the third floor of Ashutosh Building, was demolished to bring in the elevator four years ago. With the demolition of the staircase, the entry and exit points to the record room are blocked.																								Since then, the controller of examinations department has not been able to use the room, resulting in documents not being despatched to several applicants. 																								Applications for duplicate copies of admit cards, certificates and marksheets are often submitted. It has become impossible for us to respond to such appeals, as we do not have access to the room. Most result-related documents are gathering dust and could even be misplaced if things are not put in order right away, warned university officials on Tuesday.																								According to the officials, apart from seeking duplicate marksheets and admit cards, the records relating to examinations and results, are often needed for reference by the controller of examinations department, are in the room. Also, a large number of passouts  mostly married women  often approach the department for fresh certificates. But since access to the room is next to impossible, their appeals go unanswered, said sources.																								Officials of the engineering department have been requested time and again to construct a new staircase but they have not responded to the appeal. Sources said since examination-related documents are increasing, space is becoming a constraint. 																								Admitting the inconvenience caused, Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, CUs controller of examinations, said the problem is likely to end as the authorities have recently given an assurance on a new staircase soon. Once the staircase comes up, there should be no problem to despatch examination-related documents, added Adhikari.

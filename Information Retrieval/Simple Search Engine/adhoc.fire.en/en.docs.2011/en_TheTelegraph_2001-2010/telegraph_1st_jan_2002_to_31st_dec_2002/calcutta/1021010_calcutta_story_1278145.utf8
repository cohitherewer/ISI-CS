The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 School shut over fee hike
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The authorities of Calcutta Girls School, one of the oldest English-medium institutions in the city, had to close their gates on Tuesday, following an agitation by the guardians of students over a tuition-fee hike. The school had recently decided to raise tuition fees by Rs 300.																								School sources said tension erupted on the campus on Tuesday when nearly 100 parents allegedly barged onto the premises and held demonstrations, demanding an immediate rollback of the enhanced tuition fees.																								Mantu Rakshit, principal, said the parents had agitated on the basis of a rumour that the management would not distribute report cards to those students who had not cleared their tuition fees. 																								We had no such plans. Yes, we have hiked the fees but there is no reason for victimising innocent students by not giving them their report cards if their parents are unable to pay the higher fees, said Rakshit.																								Members of the guardians forum of the school, however, said their agitation on the premises had been peaceful.

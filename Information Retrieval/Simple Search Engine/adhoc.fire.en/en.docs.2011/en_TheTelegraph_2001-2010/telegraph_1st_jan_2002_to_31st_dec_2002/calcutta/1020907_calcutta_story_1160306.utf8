 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Concerned over the mushrooming of driving schools and the rampant issuance of licences by them, the state government has initiated a move to wrest control over nearly 600 such training schools in the city and suburbs. The transport department is setting up an institute, Transport and Traffic Management and Training Institute, on the lines of Punes Central Institute of Road and Transport.																								The institute will be set up in Dum Dum and nearly 50 acres have been allotted for it. The Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) will implement the project at a cost of Rs 12 crore. There will be provisions for training officials on transportation management, driving school courses and proper maintenance of vehicles. Special training will be imparted on eco-friendly transportation, said TIDC director G.G. Bhattacharya.																								The proposed institute will function as an affiliating agency of motor training schools. No driving school can function without permission from the institute. Besides, private motor-training institutes must engage at least one person trained by the institute, sources said. I have convinced the Union surface transport ministry of the need to set up such an institute, said state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.																								Computerised car-testing, car-servicing, auto emission-testing and an exhibition room will be some of the features of the upcoming institute. We want to produce quality drivers, said Prashant, joint secretary of the transport department and director of the Public Vehicles Directorate.

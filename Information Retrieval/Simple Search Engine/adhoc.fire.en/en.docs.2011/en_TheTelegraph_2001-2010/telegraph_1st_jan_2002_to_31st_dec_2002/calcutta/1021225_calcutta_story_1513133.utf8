The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, December 25, 2002  We Ask You Answer				 Open class doors for fair play
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should berths be reserved for local candidates after the Joint Entrance Examination domicile bar is lifted? More letters will be published next week SORRY SIGHT: Empty seats in a  college classroom 									

B.N. Bose,
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														Certainly! Berths for local candidates must be reserved, especially in medical courses, as they may serve people in our rural areas. In our adjoining states, the domicile bar has not been lifted. Candidates from other states are not allowed to sit for their exams. So why should we be harsh to our own boys and girls?									

Prasanta Kumar Ghosh,
																		Barasat.																																																														With the lifting of the domicile bar, a large number of students from outside will be trying their luck to seek admission. There will be keen competition for admission. Sixty per cent of the seats should be reserved for local candidates, thirty per cent for all-India candidates and 10 per cent for sportsmen and handicapped students.									

Piyal Mukherjee,
																		Lake Town.																																																														In order to do justice to candidates from all parts of the country, admission to professional courses should be strictly on merit. The professional colleges will get the best talent in the country if the above procedure is followed. Reserving berths for local candidates will promote provincialism which is not at all desirable in the present context. Moreover, it is pertinent to point out that as the seats available in the professional colleges are limited compared to the demand, reservation of berths for local candidates will deprive deserving candidates from other parts of the country. So, the proposal is uncalled for.									

Tapan Pal,
																		Batanagar.																																																														Before withdrawing the domicile bar, the state should stop funding medical and technical education. The people of the state do not pay taxes to subsidise education for candidates from other states.									

Diptimoy Ghosh,
																		Salt Lake City.																																																														There is no harm in throwing open the door of the Joint Entrance Examination to students from all over the country for studying technical and medical courses in our state. The cream of our candidates will get a chance to compete with students from other states.																																																														However, reservation of some berths is always desirable for local candidates. If this concession is not allowed then local students may get frustrated. It will be a sad situation if our meritorious students do not get a chance here and have to go to other states to seek higher education. 									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury,
																		Barrackpore.																																																														The state government will do well to throw open the JEE doors to students of neighbouring states. The step, no doubt, will draw good students from other states. As quality and reservation can never co-exist, especially when the well-being of the state and the nation is involved, the idea of reservation for local candidates should be dropped. 									

Prahlad Agarwala,
																		Nadia.																																																														Although the idea is controversial and debatable, the proposed step contains much pragmatism. As so many meritorius students belonging to the economically backward segment of society cannot afford to pursue medical or engineering studies in other states, the reservation of berths for local students carries a lot of sense.									

Ujjal Bhattacharyya,
																		Entally.																																																														Reservation of berths will definitely benefit local candidates, but will also mar quality. The state governments decision to throw open the Joint Entrance Examination door to students from outside Bengal is nothing but a manifestation of sheer desperation to fill up seats of new colleges. Nevertheless, the decision is logical and worthy of implementation. But keeping berths for local candidates will indicate a biased approach.																																																														The very concept of reservation should be done away with, even in case of government recruitments.									

Udayan Banerjee,
																		Bhadrakali.																																																														No, berth reservation for local candidates appearing in Joint Entrance Examination is unacceptable. One must make sure that only good students are picked. The reservation policy may elbow out deserving students from outside Bengal. Also, it will fuel the concept of parochialism. Local candidates should be encouraged to achieve success by dint of labour and intellect, not through the reservation backdoor.									

jayanta datta,
																		Chinsurah.																																																														In the present situation, it is not a good idea. There should not be any borders in education. If the bar is lifted, the atmosphere of competition will increase. But if a quota is introduced, the wrong signal will reach the world about the Indian education system. 									

Aakash Kamal Misra,
																		Krishnapur.																																																														In professional exams, such as JEE and IIT, there should be no reservations on the basis of caste, creed or domicile status. If the students fulfill the eligibility criteria then they should be welcome or else... sorry! 									

S.S. Almal,
																		Address not given.																																																														Lifting the domicile bar is a good idea as students from nearby states like Bihar and Orissa may like to study in colleges here. But there must be some reservation for state students.									

SANANDA SEN,
																		New Alipore.																																																														I think berths must be reserved for local candidates after the domicile bar of Joint Entrance Examination is lifted. It is necessary for our students to complete an engineering or a medical course to get employment. 									

Aparajita dasgupta,
																		Jadavpur																																																														No. Let merit be the only yardstick for admission. This will help the local institutes turn into centres of excellence with the admission of the cream of students at the national level. If meritorious students from outside Bengal show interest in enrolling for courses here, it will be beneficial for colleges which are running to empty berths as well as for the educational profile of the state.

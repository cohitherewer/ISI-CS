 A STAFF REPORTER																								It may have been a nine-year-olds idea of fun, but it prompted the city airport authorities to look for a bomb that never was.																								Netaji Subhas Bose International Airport was put on red alert following an anonymous call, saying that a Guwahati-bound aircraft would be hijacked and blown up. The call came at the Jet Airways city office early on Monday morning.																								Jet Airways immediately informed the airport authorities and additional CISF forces were deployed in and around the airport. Bomb squad experts began to look for any explosive that may have been kept either inside any aircraft or at the airport itself. 																								All the adjacent police stations were alerted. An inquiry was started to trace the call, the number of which was recorded in the Jet Airways office.																								The call was made from a house on Rawdon Street. The police then picked up a woman, a 12-year-old girl and the nine-year-old boy who lived there. 																								They were taken to Shakespeare Sarani police station, where the airport police interrogated them.																								While the woman and the girl said they knew nothing about the telephone call, the boy confessed that he made it for the fun of it.																								As we were sure that the boy was not up to anything sinister, we released them, said G. Balakrishnan, CISF commandant.																								The boy had returned from abroad last week. He told the police he wanted to have some fun and thought that if flights were delayed, it would be reported in all the newspapers. But despite the search, no flight was delayed.

				 																																									I have seen several people on minibuses being extremely indifferent to aged women who board the bus and travel with much difficulty. Seldom have I seen anyone offer them seats. Most elderly women have to put up with constant elbowing and rash driving, as the bus drivers, too, have scant regard for passenger comfort. One feels helpless when one finds the lack of compassion in todays youths. Bus operators should consider reserving four seats for elderly women in minibuses.

The delayed supply is inconveniencing most consumers, especially office-goers and schoolchildren. Besides, the quality of the product has deteriorated.				 																																									Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																									Lake Town.

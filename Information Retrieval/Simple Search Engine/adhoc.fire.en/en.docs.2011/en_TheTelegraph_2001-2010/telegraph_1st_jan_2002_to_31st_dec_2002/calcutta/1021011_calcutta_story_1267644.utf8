 Friday, October 11, 2002 				 Salt Lake civic body gets park control
 SANJAY MANDAL																								The stand-off between the CPM-controlled Bidhannagar Municipality and the state urban development department over parks and green areas of the township seems to be finally heading for a solution. 																								We will send a proposal to the urban development department soon, said Tapan Talukdar, chairman-in-council, Bidhannagar Municipality. The issue was discussed in the board meeting of the civic body earlier this month, at which it was decided that the municipality would take responsibility of maintaining the parks. 																								The authorities are also planning to mobilise revenue from the parks. Maintenance requires a lot of funds, said Talukdar. According to him, the municipality is thinking of getting sponsors and renting out the parks for marriage and social functions.																								The municipality had taken over the parks of Sector I more than five years ago from the urban development department. Things, however, turned complicated when the municipality wanted to take over the parks of Sector II and III. The civic body wanted the department to carry out maintenance work in the parks and green areas before the handover.																								We submitted the proposal to the urban development officials much earlier, but they did not take the initiative to improve the parks. We have asked the urban development department to complete the process of handover as soon as possible, since residents have long been demanding well-maintained parks, a municipal officer said.																								Officials, however, say paucity of funds had stalled the restoration of parks in Salt Lake. We have conveyed this to the municipal authorities, said a senior official.																								However, there are fears that even after the parks are taken over by Bidhannagar Municipality, they will not be maintained properly. The parks of Sector I were taken over five years ago. But since then, nothing has been done to maintain them, charged Anupam Dutta, Trinamul Congress councillor and leader of the Opposition in the municipality. I hope the officials will stick to their promise this time, he added.																								Cable case																								Calcutta High Court judge Kalyanjyoti Sengupta will hear an appeal for injunction by Howrah-based cable operator Sanjib Kumar Santra against RPG Netcom on increased connectivity after the three-week Puja holiday. 																								Santra had filed a petition against the multi-system operator to put on hold a new agreement for an enhanced subscriber base, appealing to the court to make the stay valid for all operators who have been asked to pay more. The petitioner has been asked to serve notices to the respondent.

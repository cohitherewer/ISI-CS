 Wednesday, November 20, 2002 				 Goon caught in crossfire with cops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 22-year-old goon died in the crossfire between cops and criminals at Mahisbathan, Salt Lake, late on Monday. Two policemen were also injured in the raid to flush out some criminals.																								Sources said Rakesh Sharma had hired a Tata Sumo from a Thakurpukur travel agency on Monday evening. He took the vehicle to Salt Lake, picked up about a dozen goons and then returned to Thakurpukur late in the evening. The criminals had planned to kidnap a promoter in Thakurpukur and demand a ransom, said Chandan Neogi, officer-in-charge of Thakurpukur police station.																								Police intercepted the vehicle as it neared Mahatma Gandhi Road, in Thakurpukur. On seeing the cops, nine goons jumped out of Sumo and fled. Neogi said three of them, Bapi, Bapan and Mithun, were picked up. We decided to raid the Salt Lake hideout to nab the others, he added.																								At Mahisbathan, the posse was first greeted with brickbats as it tried to carry out a door-to-door search. Then, bullets started flying, forcing the police to return fire. Additional superintendent of police Ajay Nand said around 10 rounds were fired between the warring groups over half an hour, but the goons managed to give the cops the slip under cover of darkness.																								One of the goons injured in the encounter was taken to MR Bangur Hospital. He succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday evening. Nand said his identity was yet to be ascertained. Thakurpukur police are coordinating with their Salt Lake counterparts to track down the criminals.

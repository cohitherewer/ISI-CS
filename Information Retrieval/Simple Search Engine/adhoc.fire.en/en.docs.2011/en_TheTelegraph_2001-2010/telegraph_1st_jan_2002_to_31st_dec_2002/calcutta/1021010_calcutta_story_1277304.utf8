The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 A lifetime of moulding the deity
																								niranjandas? The house beside the decorators shop. Everybody in Kumartuli knows where the oldest artisan in the clay-modellers hub lives.																								Even in the autumn of his life, Niranjan Pal has a spring in his stride, though he has retired from the profession.																								My grandfathers father had come to Calcutta from Krishnagar, Nadia. The Fort William area was a haunt of dacoits then, he said, settling down at a neighbouring studio. The 83-year-old remembers the Pujas in his boyhood. There were such grand Pujas in the locality  at Gangaprasad Sens, at the Duttas of Hatkhola, at Khelat Ghoshs in Pathuriaghata. I would go over and watch the puppet shows and the jatras. Pal insists that the men who portrayed the female characters then were more convincing in their looks and gestures than the actresses of today. As he grew up, Pal became involved in organising the local puja. Once Netaji had to mediate to settle a dispute at Bagbazar, he recalls.																								Though Pal grew up in a family of artisans, it took the persuasion of friends to make the doll-maker switch to idols. My friends wanted me to make a Saraswati for them. I modelled one on the four-handed goddess in Bikaner Fort, he recounts. It was not before he turned 32 that he actually took to Durga. I started the ekchala concept at Bagbazar Sarbojanin, says the veteran artisan.																								Another chapter in Pals life unfolded when he stepped on the Tollywood floors. The first film for which he did the sets was Jadubhatta. (I cut my hands hammering in the nails) Then followed films with Nitin Bose, Kartik Chatterjee, Debaki Bose, Agradut, Agragami 																								Pal fondly looks back upon his association with Uttam Kumar. I used to make the Lakshmi idol at his house. He would wait in his car on the main road and his driver would call me. The fear of being mobbed was well-founded. When Tarun Kumar came over to watch the chokshudaan at my studio, he sat till 2.30 in the morning on a sataranchi. The entire locality flocked to see him. Uttam Kumar would solicit Pals opinion on his acting too. I told him I did not like his Urdu as Chunilal in Debdas. Pal even appeared on the silverscreen because of Uttam Kumar. In Sabar Upare, there was a scene at a dolls shop. He coaxed me to appear on camera, he laughs. He also created the Saraswati and the Lakshmi idols at Supriya Debis.																								Pal is a name in organising the community movement too. The mritshilpi union was formed in my house, he says. No wonder his presence is still mandatory at the meetings.																								According to Pal, nothing has improved at Kumartuli over the years. It is sad enough that we have to sell our art. The returns are not even worth the compromise, sighs the follower of Gandhiji who has worn khadi since age nine.

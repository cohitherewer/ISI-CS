 Friday, August 30, 2002 				 Employee suicide at Writers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 47-year-old employee of the state governments law department, Sukumar Dinda, jumped from the third floor of C block of Writers Buildings on Thursday afternoon. Deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, Sivaji Ghosh, said Dinda was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.																								Law department officers said speculation was rife about the possible cause of Dindas death. Many felt he might have taken the extreme step out of frustration, for not getting his salary on Thursday morning.																								Witnesses said Dinda chose the right moment to jump when the area was desolate. It was during lunch break, around 2.40 pm, and employees were busy doing their thing. 																								Dinda lay on the ground for a good two minutes before people noticed him. They were, initially, too taken aback to react.																								Then there was a tumult. Employees informed the police. Dinda was put on a stretcher and taken to the ambulance in the Writers portico. At Medical College and Hospital, doctors declared him dead.																								Dinda had joined the record supply section of the law department in 1985 after his fathers death. His father, too, was a state government employee. 																								Police said Dinda lived in Bally, and is survived by his wife and two sons.																								According to his immediate boss, section officer in the law department Kalyan Chakraborty, Dinda was a quiet, unassuming man, who kept to himself. Chakraborty ruled out any chances of Dinda being mentally unstable. 																								There was nothing unusual in his behaviour, he said.																								Hare Street police ruled out foul play. Police said Dindas family was informed about the incident. We will speak to Dindas wife to find out if he had mentioned anything to her, deputy commissioner of police, central, Zulfiquar Hasan, said. 																								Dindas body has been sent for post-mortem, Hasan added.

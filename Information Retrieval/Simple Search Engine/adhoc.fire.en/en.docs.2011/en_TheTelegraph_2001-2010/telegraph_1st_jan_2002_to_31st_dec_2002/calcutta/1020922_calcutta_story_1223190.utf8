The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, September 22, 2002 				 Jailed lecturer hospitalised
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Kaushik Ganguly, who had been arrested two-and-a-half months ago from his Calcutta residence on charges of having links with Naxalite outfit Peoples War and put up in Midnapore jail, was admitted to SSKM Hospital on Friday night. He had complained of claustrophobia and severe body ache.																								Kaushik, a lecturer of the chemical engineering department in Rajabazar Science College, was picked up by the police on the midnight of July 4. He was produced before the Midnapore court on July 6, which remanded him in five-day police custody. He was produced again at the Midnapore court on July 11. This time he was sent to jail custody. Kaushik was twice denied bail.																								Kaushiks father Narayandas Ganguly, who met him at SSKMs Woodburn Ward on Saturday, thanked the government for having taken a wise decision to shift him to Calcutta and arrange for a thorough treatment. Kaushik has been kept under tight security and only his close relatives are allowed to see him.																								He has lost at least 10 to 15 kg since his arrest, his father said. Kaushiks wife Tanushree, who had moved high court demanding his release, also appreciated the administrations move.																								Tanushree said her husband had sustained severe waist injuries in the police lock-up. 																								His ankle had been damaged due to torture. Of late, he has developed claustrophobia, too. He was not in a position to even shut the door while in the toilet, she added. 																								Confinement in prison can kill a claustrophobic person, Kaushiks brother Sauvik said.																								His father reiterated that Kaushik had been framed by the police. He is an absolutely apolitical person, Narayandas said.

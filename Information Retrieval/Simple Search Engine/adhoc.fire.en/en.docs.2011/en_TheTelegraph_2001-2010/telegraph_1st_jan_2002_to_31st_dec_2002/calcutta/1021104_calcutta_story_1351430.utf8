 A STAFF REPORTER																								Faced with criticism from Salt Lake residents for the townships bad roads, the state government has drawn up an elaborate plan to repair the thoroughfares within three months.																								Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya held a meeting on Tuesday with his department officers and Salt Lake municipality chairman Dilip Gupta to finalise the plan.																								A large amount of money is required for the project and the municipality alone cannot shoulder the expenses. So, it has been decided that four agencies  the CMDA, the urban development department, the municipality and Webel  will take up the job. We have sanctioned Rs 1.9 crore to the CMDA to start work immediately, the urban development minister said on Saturday. 																								A sum of Rs 5 crore has been earmarked for the project, Bhattacharya added.																								The CMDA officials had been asked to start repairing the roads on an emergency basis and complete the work as soon as possible. Though the state government is going through a severe financial crisis, we have released funds for the project, Bhattacharya said.																								The CMDA has been entrusted with the task of repairing the major thoroughfares, while the municipality and the urban development department will take care of the lanes and bylanes. 																								Webel is to pay Rs 2 crore to repair the roads in Sector V, the townships industrial zone, the minister added. 																								It had earlier been decided that Webel would shoulder the responsibility of repairing the roads in Sector V and spend Rs 2 crore. But they did not pay. I have referred the matter to commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen, so that Webel is directed to release the funds at the earliest, Bhattacharya said.																								In another decision, the minister said the stretch of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass which falls within the jurisdiction of the Salt Lake municipality, from Ultadanga to the Nicco Park crossing, would be maintained by the civic body. 																								Funds for the scheme will be raised by collecting taxes from outdoor advertising companies for hoardings and selling space on the road dividers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, September 25, 2002 				 Club wall scaled, cash stolen
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Six goons struck at The Conclave, on AJC Bose Road, late on Monday. They scaled the compound wall of the club, entered the complex, attacked the two security guards, forced open the iron safe and looted Rs 30,000.																								Police said the same gang had struck at Samilton Chambers, about a kilometre from The Conclave, a fortnight ago.																								Deputy commissioner of police, detective department, Soumen Mitra said the criminals overpowered the guards at 216, AJC Bose Road, gagged and tied them up, before locking them in a room. After an hour-long search, they found the safe on the ground floor, smashed it open and took away the cash.																								It is most surprising, since there has never been any such incident in the past. Although the police were quite prompt in their action, they should ensure such incidents are not repeated, said R.K. Fenn, general manager, The Conclave.																								The two mobile patrol vans stationed on AJC Bose Road and Theatre Road had no clue about the break-in. Sources said police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty had directed Mitra to intensify efforts to arrest the gang that has been operating in the area for the past few months.																								Mitra said gang-leader Manoj Rai had been arrested three years ago and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, but he had managed to obtain bail recently and resume operations.																								Police said Manoj was a local lad who was holed up somewhere on the outskirts of the city, but masterminding operations in this belt of south Calcutta.

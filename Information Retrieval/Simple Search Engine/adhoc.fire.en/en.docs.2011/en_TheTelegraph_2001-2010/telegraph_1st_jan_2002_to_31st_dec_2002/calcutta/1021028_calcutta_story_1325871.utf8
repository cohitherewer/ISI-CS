The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, October 28, 2002 				 An exposition
																								It has been quite a while since the last photography exhibition was held in the city. While probing the cause for this, one might conclude that either there is a dearth of talent or there are no takers for this art form. But both the causes are negated if one gives a cursory glance at Chhayapaths ninth international salon of photography, which is currently being held in the city. This show is dedicated to the memory of two of the organisations members: Biplab Kumar Banerjee and Dwijendranath Sarkar. For its ninth salon, Chhayapath received 813 colour and monochrome prints from 27 countries. After a rigorous selection by five eminent judges, a total of 98 photographs  41 monochromes and 57 colour prints  have been put up at the show. The photographs are excellent vignettes of life which re-emphasises the age-old saying, a thing of beauty is joy for ever.																								When: Till October 31; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

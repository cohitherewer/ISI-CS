 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 Remembering legends
																								Group theatre began in the 1940s as an anti-Establishment movement to project the struggle of the underdogs of society. Beginning as a protest movement, it gradually developed into an urgent need to explore the various facets of art. Theatre was constantly being shaped and re-shaped as experiments in form and content emerged, and the period from the 50s to the 70s may safely be called the golden age of Bengali group theatre. Some of the greatest talents emerged during the period and modern theatre, as we witness today, stands on their edifice. However, negligible efforts have been made to introduce these legends and their works to contemporary audience. Arghyas three-day theatre festival, beginning today, is an effort towards this direction. The fest begins with Keya Chakraborty Smarane: Keya, a collage of plays comprising some of the stage characters made all-time memorable by the renowned actress. To be enacted by Kajal Chowdhury, Chhanda Chatterjee, Soumitra Basu, Deepa Brahma, Soumya Majumdar and artistes of Arghya, and recollections by theatre personalities of her time. Tripti Mitra Smarane: Aparajita, to be performed solo by Anasua Majumdar. The next day (September 5) features Krantikaal, a performance by Saoli Mitra, to be followed by Arghyas play, Sankat, directed by Manish Mitra. The last day (September 6) features Shesh Roopkatha, an Arghya production based on Abul Bashars novel and directed by Manish Mitra.																								When amp; Where: September 4 at Rabindra Sadan (6 pm); September 5 at Academy of Fine Arts (6.30 pm); September 6 at Sisir Mancha (6.30 pm)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, December 01, 2002 				 Andha Gali
																								T.S. Eliot spelt out the predicament of modern man when he prophesied: We are the hollow men, we are the stuffed men. We are constantly driven by an insatiable ambition to acquire more and rise in life to reach the very pinnacle of success, as defined by a materialistic society. Age-old values are sacrificed in the altar of greed. Families and relations disintegrate. Andhagali aka The Blind Lane traces this downfall of modern man. Soumyadev and his wife Ranita are two contender in the fast lane of life. Their ambitions pull them from opposite directions and their personal lives are in a shambles. Their only son Raju is most cruelly affected in this tug-of-war. Meanwhile, Soumyadev finds solace in Nilanjana. But he is so possessive about her, he wants to own her solely. But he is incapable of doing so when Nilanjanas past is revealed and challenges him. They both confront a terrible truth, yet they have to find a solution, because in order to survive, a mid-way has to be evolved. They try again, with determination, to find the right track. Directed by Meghnad Bhattacharya, this is a Sayak production.																								When: Today																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

				 On a soul-search sojourn A scene from The Spirit of  Anne Frank 				 																																									The spirit of Anne Frank has come to symbolise hope amidst holocaust, honesty amidst deceit, laughter amidst fear, life amidst death Some of that eternal spirit and the contradictions of life have been captured in Roysten Abels play that opened in Delhi last Friday, before it travels to Calcutta, via Bangalore.				 																																									The timing of the tour is no mere coincidence  The Spirit of Anne Frank, inspired by the consequences of extreme nationalism, persecution and destruction debuts on Babri Masjid demolition day. It ends at Ahmedabad seven days after the Gujarat polls.				 																																									The play, presented by The Royal Netherlands Embassy, brings together a five-woman star cast in a train compartment  a history teacher (Zohra Segal), a tarot-card reader (Shabana Azmi), a textile designer (Nandita Das), a Hindustani music student (Mandakini Goswami) and an Austrian dancer-choreographer (Ansatacia Flewin). The journey on wheels becomes a metaphor of life, traversing love and betrayal, truth and lies, intolerance and compassion.				 																																									The Spirit of Anne Frank will come alive on the Vidya Mandir stage on December 16 and 17, at 7 pm. This marks another couple of red-letter dots on the packed Spandan calendar. Bringing this play marking 400 years of Indo-Dutch collaboration and boasting such a powerful cast and talented director is a real pleasure, says Renu Roy of Spandan.				 																																									The Park Street-based culture hub has been particularly busy this year, with three productions in eight months and two more to go before the curtains come down on 02. It began with Mantri Mandal, moved on to Kal College Band Rahega, before bringing Renu, Konkona Sen Sharma and Niharika Seth together in Pinky and Asha Mary, under the watchful gaze of Sohag Sen. The stage is now set for Koi Ek Raat, with Renu and Nandini Chatterjee playing mother-daughter. The December 22 show of the Ashok Singh play promises a dramatic twist at the end of a long nights journey into day. The last day of this year has been booked for Neil Simons Broadway Bound.				 																																									Next year begins on a high with the National School of Drama (NSD) festival featuring Ek Violin Samundar Ke Kinare, Dimage Hasti and Janeman. Another must-see will be Cassandra Now, a Scandinavian dance drama between January 23 and 25, followed by Twelve Angry Men and Glass Menagerie. Other Spandan firsts to watch out for are Aparna Sen and Konkona taking the stage together; and maybe Victor Banerjee making a move towards the city stage!				 																																									And its by no means just theatre thats keeping Spandan busy. Fourteen diverse events ranging from music to story-telling to star talk have been lined up at Landmark. Art exhibitions will be on at the gallery throughout. But before all that, December 23 will find the Eureka orchestra playing for underprivileged children at Raj Bhavan, on the special request of Governor Viren J. Shah. A taste of the dramatic from  across the country is coming to town again, with the 19th  chapter of Nandikars National Theatre Festival.  Starting December 16, this years selec not;tion  is as wide as ever, despite flagging interest and funds  from the corporate sector.
 The shows to be performed at the Academy of Fine Arts  include Phullake not;tur Paalaa by Bohurupee on Monday.  Local groups Sanskriti with Winkle Twinkle, Samatat with  a childrens play, Wajeb Miyaar Biyaa, Nandikars  own Shesh Saakshaatkaar and Sundarams Saajaano Baagaan  are set to take the stage.
 The first outofstation crew to per not;form will be Nata  Bendele from Bhopal with Chanda Bedni on Tuesday. Rang  Saptaks Rangbhoomi, Kaatha from Oris not;sa, Ritusamhaaram  from Manipur, Sha not;yari from Amritsar, Urubhangam from  Thiruvananthapurm, Kutte from Mum not;bai, Ek Qatra Khoon  from Ajmer and Peyythther from Pondicherry will follow.  Bringing the curtains down on Christ not;mas is the sole  act from Bangladesh, Chhoy Behaaraar Paalki.
 I am looking forward to seeing Natya Chetana perform,  as well as Surendra Sharmas play Rangbhoomi,  says Rudraprasad Sengupta of Nandikar. Natya Chetana,  based near Bhubanesh not;war, lives in a commune, while  Sharma is a nonceleb National School of Drama  graduate. This will also be the premiere of Peyythther  by ThaliKKol, performing in Tamil.
 The end of the festival will not be the end of the festive  action from Calcuttas leading group theatre outfit.  The Womens National Theatre Festival is set to make  a comeback from February 27 to March 3, with a group from  Switzerland also expected to make an appearance.
 Nandikar has also, finally, started off a training centre  for 25 actors and ac not;tresses under 30. We have  not been allot not;ted land for a centre, so currently  we are working out of a hall in Bagbazar, ex not;plains  Sengupta. The oneyear produc not;tionoriented course  has just started off this month. Unless we start  with chil not;dren and young people, there will be no  hope for a brighter future.
 An award ceremony and photo exhibi not;tion to commemorate  the late Vivek Das contribution to theatre is also  lined up at the Academy.
				 																																									 An elderly schoolteacher and a boy who challenges his fibre, on screen. A veteran from Bengal Dhritiman Chatterjee and a one-film-old youngster  Amol Mhatre of Leela fame  are brought together on film by Rajshree Ojha, who started out in Calcutta.  Badger, a 25-minute film,  will be screened at Priya on Saturday morning, 9.30 am.  Though this screening is meant mainly for family and friends,  the thesis film has already won the Spirit of Excellence  Award at the American Film Institute (AFI). It has also  gained an entry into the festival circuit, having been  accepted at a French short film festival, and the San  Francisco Asian Film Festival.				 																																									The Los Angeles-based director chose the California city as locale. But it is such a Calcutta story that I wanted it to be screened here as well, explains Rajshree, in town for the screening. The ex-student of Ashok Hall, who went on to Bangalore, New York University and the AFI, also held a screening at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute on Friday.				 																																									While working with Dhritiman, who came highly recommended, was a great experience, she also had Satyajit Rays former cinematographer Subhendu Roy on board for some of the sequences. I wanted them all to see the final product, says the 28-year-old. Amol, on the other hand, was working on his second film. He is a great friend of ours, and he and Dhritiman got along very well, says the young film-maker.				 																																									Rajshree, who has directed a number of short films as part of her course, is embarking on another project based on the short stories of a Delhi-based writer. She hasnt yet acquired the rights, nor has she chosen her location, but she has not yet ruled out Calcutta. A brickandclick  combination is what the future holds out for us, they  say. And so, Virtual Reality hopes to offer the onestop  solution to home shopping. Part of the Virtual Group,  one of the largest Di not;rect Marketing Associates  of IDBI Bank, the company promises to provide customised  solutions to both builder and consumer. With six branches  in and around Calcutta, the recentlylaunched firm (details  are at virtualhomes@ sify.com) could well be in the right  place at the right time, with residential hous not;ing  in the city riding a wave.  Fun City, the amusement park  near Thakurpukur, has come alive with a twoday Bangla  band carnival on world peace and harmony.  Popular bands Chandra not;bindoo and Paras Pathar took  the stage with Nachiketa and upcoming outfit Pratibimba  on Friday to rock the theme park, the highlight of the  highvoltage evening being a chorus peace song.
 Saturday is expected to be equally ex not;plosive, with  Silajit, Cactus, Bhoomi and Sahar belting out favourites,  besides

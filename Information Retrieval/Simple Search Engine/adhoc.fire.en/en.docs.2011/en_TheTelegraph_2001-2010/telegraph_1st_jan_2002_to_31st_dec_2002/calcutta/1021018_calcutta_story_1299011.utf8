																								Antara is a middle class girl who had an arranged marriage with Ritwik. But unfortunately, the marriage did not work out and she never had any conjugal life. However, Antara had nobody to fall back on and had to stick to her boisterous, philanderer husband. Ritwik, meanwhile, had an illicit affair with the maidservant, Mary. The affair ended with Mary conceiving. When Antara came to know about the incident, she convinced Mary to continue with the pregnancy and not go for an abortion and sent her to a welfare home (Ashram). In due time, Mary gave birth to a baby girl, Jolly. A year later, she re-joined the Ritwik-Antara household. Jolly grows up as an orphan in the Ashram and Antara takes utmost care of her needs and fills up the void in her life. Twenty-three years later, Jolly, now a young attractive woman, encounters Ritwik, neither of them knowing about their relationship. The play then takes a sharp turn as each character inevitably moves towards its pre-ordained destiny. There is an element of Greek tragedy that sweeps across generations, engulfing all those involved in this contemporary tragic play. The play is in the classical Greek form and like the Chorus, here the entire episode is narrated by Ashis, who is also an intrinsic part of the play. Written by Indrasish Laharry and directed by Arijit Guha, this is a Chenamukh production.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

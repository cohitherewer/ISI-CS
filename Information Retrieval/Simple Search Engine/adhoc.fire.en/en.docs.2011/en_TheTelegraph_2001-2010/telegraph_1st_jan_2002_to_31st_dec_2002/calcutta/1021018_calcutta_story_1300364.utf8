The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 18, 2002 				 Myanmarese in police custody
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Zaw Min, the Myanmarese national arrested from Dum Dum airport on Wednesday by passport patrol officers, was handed over to the airport police on Thursday. Zaw, 38, was allegedly staying in India for the past three years without a valid passport. He was about to board an Indian Airlines flight to Yangon when he was apprehended with a forged passport.																								Airport police said Zaw can only understand Myanmarese, prompting them to hunt for an interpreter. But inquiries revealed that he came to Calcutta in 1999 and his passport expired that August. He will be produced in court on Friday. A group of touts, along with members of the passport department, is engaged in issuing forged passports to foreign nationals, said a police officer.

 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Cheating case bail rejected
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail petition of an advocate in a cheating case. According to the prosecution, the state government had recently requisitioned a building to accommodate police personnel. An amount of Rs 1.41 lakh was handed over to the Land Acquisition Collector for the purpose.																								The accused, Pankaj Bera, posing as an attorney of the owner of the building, took the Rs 1.41-lakh cheque from the collector on November 13 and opened a fake account with the Corporation Bank in the owners name. He deposited the cheque on November 27 and withdrew the amount the next day.																								When the real owner of the building claimed he had not received the money from the collectors office, government officials advised him to file a complaint against the advocate. 																								The counsel, on behalf of the advocate, argued that his client was falsely implicated. Opposing the prayer, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah said investigations revealed that the petitioner was involved in the crime. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, September 20, 2002 				 Lessons in gain, weighed in pain
 Guest Column brendan maccarthaigh																								Parents pay through their noses to keep their kids in school, for them to score high marks and make it in life. But does all this teach them how to be happy?																								in a kids Value Education book I saw this week, there was a page of statistics, about the percentage of children who are in schools, who drop in and then drop out of schools, who never got into schools in the first place, and the few who finally make it to the top. It is hard these days to keep your spirits up in the context of what our children are going through.																								Fees. Ye gods. I live for the past six years in a small rented flat in central Calcutta but off the beaten track. When people phone that they want to come, it is difficult to explain to them how to turn left, right, inside-out, follow Orions Belt, and then make a wish. I like it  its quiet, self-contained, private. One of the two rooms is the SERVE office. As city-centre rents go, its ok. Next statement: apart from odd jobs giving talks and courses and such, my day-job is as a consultant to an NGO.																								Now then, three quarters of what they pay me goes on my rent. I have no complaints about either set-up, only to say this, that if I did happen to have a couple of kids in school or college, I would have to take them out now, with the recent escalation of fees. So, all you parents who are at your wits end meeting household expenses plus getting your children through the education mincer, you have my sympathies.																								 Sympathies, yes. But let me not pretend that therefore I go along with all the extra pressure that is now falling upon those kids. God knows I understand, when you feel pressured, the normal response is to take it out on somebody else. Since the children are for the most part the direct source of the money-drain from your house, it is, yes, entirely understandable that your annoyance should be vented upon them, if upon anyone. And to judge by our tele-counselling experience, that is what is happening.																								Parents are demanding louder and louder that their children study, attend their tuitions (and to heck with those who pretend it isnt necessary), and bring home big marks. All very logical, very rational, and very dangerous. That is, among those of you are able to read this piece. There is a much bigger body of people out there whose children will probably never get as far as reading the first 10 letters of the English alphabet. Patriotic politicians will jump in and tell them that the home language is the best language to do your early study in  and that would be fine, if their listeners didnt know that those same patriotic politicians have their kids in English-medium institutions.																								Theres another lot out there telling us that the marginalised kid now has a great chance of catching up in a local centre financed wholly by some benevolent altruist. Theyll only have to come to that centre  usually the local sports club  and theyll learn it all. Its a smashing-looking plan, where the teacher, from the para itself, works with them through a five-hour day, and then works with the para folk to get them interested in their childrens progress. These young teachers are even trained to do all this. Brilliant?																								I have to admit, I thought so  until I saw that the teachers were being paid less than the rickshawwallah, less than the thela-gari wallah, less than any government sweeper. Now I ask you, how are such teachers expected to keep up this eight-hour teaching day in extremely difficult conditions, when their counterparts in the government school are getting more than 10 times as much  and for a mere five-hour day?																								Hands up all the parents who find this the ideal set-up for their children. Of course theyre merely the poor. Theyre merely half the child population of our country, of our city. Theyre merely dispensable, disposable, dismissable. After all, some of them actually steal food, and even pick pockets. How dreadful. Wouldnt it be much more respectable to do things properly and have a good-sized scam? I mean, it isnt as if they dont have role models way up that holy mountain!																								So then. You do have your difficulties. Big ones. You do feel fretful, angry even. Dear adults, go easy on your kids. By and large, theyll do their best, theyre doing it. Yes, the thing is they have to do even better than that. I know. But lifes a long business, and perhaps has more important issues than marks, job, security.																								Like happiness. Dont get me wrong: it isnt a smarty-pants word. You are quite right to say, Look, where is my kids chance of happiness if she/he gets low marks, bad college, no sources out in the market-place? Thats a solid question, but still.																								Two short stories. One is about a Delhi kid who followed his school friend a couple of years after theyd graduated out of a front-line school there. The first guy got a big job, and when the second came along, his old friend took him on board. This was New York. A few years later, the first guy returned to meet his teacher in Delhi, and the conversation inevitably turned to this friend. Bottomline: the friend was in the midst of divorce to his first wife, who was carrying his child, and was squiring around the current dazzler in upper-crust circles, while working his way up after his first million dollars. All true. Isnt it great? Well, judge for yourself: every week he would come into this other chaps office, close the door, sit, and cry and cry and cry. Then, back to the faade of the Made-It-Man. Marks? Market? Dream-success. But  and heres the point: his value system was a lie. But it was probably what he picked up both in school and at home. Everyone meant well, but when it came to the real crunch																								There was my own ex-student who won accolades in post-graduate physics all over the country, culminating in a very big job. He phoned me, listed those impressive successes, and when I congratulated him he said, dismissively, Oh brother, this isnt why I called. I called to ask, is this all?																								Times are hard. It is difficult to keep your focus clear, your love for your children in place, and your recognition of basic realities properly balanced. It is difficult to realise that your anger with the education powers that be, is fairly founded, needs expression at least on behalf of other children at whatever level. Perhaps there is some consolation to be found in knowing that there are thousands more in exactly that position. Perhaps youd like to write to them  or to this paper  or to us  about all this? Do so: youll feel better. So will we, hearing your support, as we struggle to bring about that elusive change for the better of our children.

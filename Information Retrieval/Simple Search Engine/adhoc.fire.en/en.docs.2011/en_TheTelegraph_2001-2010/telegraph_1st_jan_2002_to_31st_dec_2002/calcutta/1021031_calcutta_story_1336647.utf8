																								Robbery or theft has been a part since the very beginning of civilisation. Going by-the-book definition, theft means the act or instance of stealing or dishonest appropriation of anothers property with intent to deprive him or her of it permanently. Perhaps the commonest of all crimes, theft has also undergone transformation over the ages. Initially, in the beginning of civilisation, the primitive man scouted for the basic requirement: food. But it was always the right of the might. The deprived ones looked for devious ways to cheat and steal foodstuff. In the social structure of thieves, this group belongs to the very base level. Gradually, primitive men settled down to domesticity and societies came into being. The concept of personal wealth and property developed. Thieves who robbed at this level were naturally qualitatively superior. Gradually the concept of national property developed and gained prime importance in the lives of millions of people. National wealth amounting to billions is collected from the masses, for the masses by the government, constituted by the masses. This wealth is meant for the welfare of the masses. Misappropriating this wealth naturally requires sophistication, a certain style and perfection in the art of stealing. Over the years, thieves have upgraded and honed their heisting skills to unimaginable degree of perfection. Based on this concept, the comedy has been written and directed by Kunal Mukhopadhyay.

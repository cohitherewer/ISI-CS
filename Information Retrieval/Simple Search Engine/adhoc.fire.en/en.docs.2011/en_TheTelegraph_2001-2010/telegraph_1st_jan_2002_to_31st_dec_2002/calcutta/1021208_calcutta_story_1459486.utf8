 Sunday, December 08, 2002 				 Rehab call by canal squatters
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With just two days to go before the proposed eviction along the Circular Canal in Beleghata, agitated settlers on Saturday refused to shift unless they were rehabilitated adequately. The squatters have sought the intervention of the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco) in the matter.																								According to mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the settlers will have to vacate the area on Tuesday. We can even provide them with a shifting fee but rehabilitation is out of question, he said.																								The eviction drive will cover the banks of the Circular Canal till RG Kar Medical College, covering a four-and-half-kilometre stretch. We will seek Hudcos intervention for rehabilitating the settlers, said Shaktiman Ghosh, convenor of Uchchhed Birodhi Jukta Mancha, one of the organisations protesting the eviction.																								On Saturday, at least 1,500 settlers, including 500 women, blocked Aurobindo Setu for nearly 30 minutes. Later, they organised a sit-in at the RG Kar-Raja Dinendra Street and the BT Road-Manmatha Dutta Street crossings.																								Rajdhani diverted																								The Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express was diverted through Burdwan main line following derailment of a goods train near Janai Road station on Burdwan chordline on Saturday afternoon. 																								Five coaches of the goods train derailed, disrupting train movement for about five hours. Senior railway officials rushed to the spot and the line was not cleared till night. A large number of people protested the late running of trains at Janai Road and Begampur stations.

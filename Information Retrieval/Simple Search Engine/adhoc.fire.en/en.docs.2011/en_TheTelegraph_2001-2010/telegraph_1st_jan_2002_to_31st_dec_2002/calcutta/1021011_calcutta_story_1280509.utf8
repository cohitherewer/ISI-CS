 Friday, October 11, 2002 				 Tryst with nature
																								The influence of nature is perhaps best realised in the creative mind. From time immemorial, poets, writers, artists and musicians have regularly drawn inspiration from nature for their creative work. Nature often plays the bridge between the inner soul and the outer world. Nature endows us with a sense to perceive the outer world. The beauty of nature leads artists to romanticise it in a way that ordinary sense of enjoyment is transformed into mystical experiences. To an artist, nature provides the elixir of life. Anita Dutta, whose exhibition of paintings is currently on, is no exception. She, too, is inspired by natures romanticism. Her tryst with nature is evident in her work. She has infused life to the colours on canvas and the paintings are at once transformed into vibrant and spontaneous objects of art.

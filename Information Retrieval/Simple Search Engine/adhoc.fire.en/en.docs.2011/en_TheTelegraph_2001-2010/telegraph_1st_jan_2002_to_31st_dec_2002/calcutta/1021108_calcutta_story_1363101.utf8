The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, November 08, 2002 					 					 It's Your Birthday So...You have a scientific approach to life. Refrain from vindictiveness. You are steady but can be obstinate. You take advice with a pinch of salt. You are ambitious and persevering, but with a controversial personality. Love life is on a roller-coaster.  Kusum Bhandari

																									Have nothing to do with the fact that Sabya here is currently on a Kenyan safari. In fact, the N word has nothing to do with the Bhubaneswar sanctuary, either. That was just the name of the kindergarten the wildlife enthusiast used to go to!																									gu Are not likely to throw Gull (as his family knows him) off stride. Hes faced scarier audiences before. The first-year postgraduate student was recently summoned by JU authorities to make a presentation to honchos from the Tokyo Foundation, a funding agency. On a recce of five top Indian varsities, at stake was an endowment fund of $1 million, and the economics student was the only undergrad to be chosen for the task. He has just found out they were successful, too. Was chosen to represent the economics department when the National Accreditation Commission came to assess his Univ, which eventually got a five-star distinction.																									Was present when our 21-year-old gave a presentation two years ago at the Technology Fair. He and four others spoke about the hazards of carbon emission in front of the Bengal CM himself. Was selected as a speaker, while in second year, for the National Seminar on Urban Transport Pricing and Planning, where he held forth on the Applicability of New Age Technologies for an Efficient Transport System. He is now upgrading the paper for publication. Has conducted a research on water quality demand in town, too.																									Was what he made as a TV anchor, after being spotted by a senior at a Univ freshers welcome that he emceed. That was not his first tryst with the performing arts  throughout school at Don Bosco Park Circus, he took the stage for various productions, even bagging a best actor award or two.																									Was the man who aspires to join the World Bank or IMF, when his batch participated in the Young Europe Meets Asia student exchange programme with final-year undergrads from the University of Bolzano, Italy. He was named student leader for the Indian squad, and welcomed them with a speech, with the Consul General of Italy to India, Dominico Bennincassa, in attendance, besides students and JU officials.

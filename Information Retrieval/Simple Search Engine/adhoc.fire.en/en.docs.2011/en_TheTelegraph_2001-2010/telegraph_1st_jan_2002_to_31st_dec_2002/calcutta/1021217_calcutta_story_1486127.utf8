 Ipshita Sinha Had put her best foot forward at two-and-a-half.  By the time she was six, she had jumped in with both feet,  already vying for a place amongst her seniors. This month,  at age 11, Ipshita Sinha became the youngest performer  at Spicmacays Virasat 2002 that boasted dance veterans  like  Sonal Mansingh, Priti Patel and several others.																									Has impressed senior Odissi dancers like Aloka Kanungo, Sutapa Talukdar and Sharmila Biswas. They have all seen her on stage, vouched for her talent and tipped her as the girl to watch out for. For her part, Mammam (thats what they call her at home) can take centrestage and hold the audience captive for three hours at a go. As for her taaleem, she can carry on for hours without a break.																									She feels, and so dance is not her only form of expression. Ippu, as classmates at Carmel High School call her, finds elocution a passion to nurture. Having come sixth at a national competition organised by Sri Vivekananda Cultural Centre, she is cultivating a heady combination of rhythm and rhyme.																	nReading is refreshing																									Believes the Class VI student. Her favourite character is, without a doubt, Feluda, while Tom and Jerry top her toon charts. She is partial towards Enid Blyton, R.L. Stevenson and Charles Dickens, but at the moment it is Harry Potter who is taking up most of her storybook reading moments. Pillow fights with elder brother Jishanu is a regular feature at home, and a favourite pass time. But big bros presence at her recitals is a must for Mammam.																	nMedicine woman																									Is what the dancing delight finally aims to be. Que Sera Sera is just not her thing. So, the self-proclaimed committed girl wants to end up studying and practising medicine.																									Is to give the stage her best shot and see where it takes her. Quite literally, in fact. For, this travel freak loves to pack her bag and hit the trail. Around the world over a few years is one of her dreams, and it helps that her work takes her here and there.

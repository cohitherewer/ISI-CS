				 																																										lJustice Maharaja Sinha of Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the West Bengal Higher Secondary Council to produce the answer-scripts of the first and second papers of mathematics and chemistry of Soumya Shankar Moulik of Siliguri Boys School within two weeks. Soumyas counsel Rabi Shankar Chatterjee told the court that the student had cleared the Joint Examination Examinations conducted by the state government for admission to the engineering degree course and also gained admission in the medical course run by the Karnataka government. But he scored zero in the HS mathematics second paper and 25 in the first. He got 17 and 25 in the two chemistry papers.				 																																										The body of a newborn was found at Birati, on the citys outskirts, early on Tuesday. A resident first noticed the body in a roadside vat during his morning walk. He, and some other residents of the area, alerted the North Dum Dum municipality. The local councillor reached the spot. A doctor confirmed that the baby had died a few hours earlier. The municipalitys conservancy department later removed the body. 				 																																										The sudden withdrawal of the day-long countrywide ceasework by lawyers has created confusion among the advocates of the state. While the secretary of Calcutta High Court Bar Association had called off the ceasework, other city courts and subordinate courts throughout the state are yet to take any decision as there was no clear notice from the State Bar Council in this regard. The Council had requested its members not to attend court on September 18 to protest the recent amendments in Civil Procedure Code (CPC). The ceasework was called following a decision of the Bar Council of India to launch a nation-wide protest. On Tuesday afternoon, a fax reached the office of the State Bar Council from its parent body asking it to withdraw the strike, as Union law minister Jena Krishnamurthy had assured them that their grievances would be looked into. 				 																																										A 40-year-old cart-puller died when a Matador knocked him down on Strand Road on Tuesday afternoon. Police said the accident occurred when the killer vehicle was overtaking a private bus and hit Sheikh Azad. The victim was pronounced brought dead when he was rushed to SSKM Hospital. The driver of the Matador managed to flee. The police later impounded the vehicle.				 																																										Six dacoits, who attempted to rob a jewellery shop in Shibpur, were arrested on Tuesday from different hideouts in Howrah district. The shop employees caught one of the dacoits who led the police to the others.				 																																										The body of Farida Khatun, 5, was found in a room on Raicharan Pal Lane, in Topsia, on Tuesday afternoon, 24 hours after she was last seen. Police have registered a murder case, but the motive is yet to be ascertained.

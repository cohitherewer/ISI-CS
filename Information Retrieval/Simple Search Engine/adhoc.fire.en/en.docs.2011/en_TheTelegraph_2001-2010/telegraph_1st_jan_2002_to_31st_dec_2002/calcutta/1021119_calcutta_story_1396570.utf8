 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Repair drive on city hub pavements
 A STAFF REPORTER																								For the first time after taking charge of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) two years ago, the Trinamul Congressled civic board has decided to repair pavements in the city core area. I have already sanctioned Rs 2.5 lakh to each councillor in the city proper (wards 1 to 100) to take up pavement repair work during the winter months, said member, mayor- in-council (roads), Anup Chatterjee, on Monday.																								According to the civic roads departments estimate, more than 700 km of pavements are in an extremely bad condition.																								Engineers in the roads department say the condition of pavements is worse than that of the roads this year as no maintenance work could be undertaken over the past two years. Besides, pavements are worse off this time because a private company laid optical-fibre cables, and because flyovers are being constructed at Gariahat, AJC Bose Road and Park Street.																								The civil engineering department in the CMC estimates that the road network adds up to 1,650 km and pavements together are 2,000 km (1,000 km on either side of major thoroughfares). 																								According to chief engineer (civil) D.N. Rakshit, the CMC has set a target of repairing 500 km of pavements on each side of major roads. This will cost Rs 119 per square metre. But only badly damaged stretches will be given this treatment.

				 																																									The railway authorities have helped several commuters by extending the Circular Railway from Dum Dum to Barrackpore. Those who want to go to Barrackpore from Dalhousie can now take a direct train either from Prinsep Ghat or Fairlie Place, avoiding the complicated route via Sealdah.				 																																									B.L. Chandak,				 																																									Salkia.				 																																									Natunbazar post office, in Budge Budge, covers a space of only 12 ft by 10 ft, as a result of which hundreds of customers have to elbow each other to buy what they need. Pensioners are the worst sufferers as they have to squat on the passageway and wait for their turn at the counter.				 																																									Govinda Bakshi,				 																																									Budge Budge.

 Thursday, October 24, 2002 				 Postmaster in savings scam net
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The postmaster of Behala sub-post office, where residents of the area had invested and lost more than Rs 3 crore, was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Tuesday night. The scam came to light only after the scamsters reported death in Gomukh.																								Golap Jhas arrest occurred within 12 hours of the CID taking charge of the investigation. CID inspector-general P.N. Saha said his department took charge of the case on Tuesday after one of the duped investors complained that he was cheated of Rs 9 lakh by the post office. 																								Apparently, the postmaster was directly involved in the scam. We have enough evidence against him, Saha said.																								About 35 investors deposited more than Rs 3 crore through Asish Dutta, alias Tapan, the local agent employed by the post office. One of the investors, N.G. Karmakar, however, denied on Wednesday that he had levelled charges against the postmaster.																								Last week, Duttas family said that he died at Gomukh following a cardiac arrest earlier this month. Apparently, Duttas death certificate, produced by his family, is genuine. We are contacting the authorities concerned to get the details, Saha said. On Jhas role, the inspector-general said: We became suspicious because he went to the house of some depositors to return their monthly interest. quot;																								Two postal scams  one at Jadavpur and another at Baguiati  had come to light earlier, but only the agents were involved in both cases, Saha said.

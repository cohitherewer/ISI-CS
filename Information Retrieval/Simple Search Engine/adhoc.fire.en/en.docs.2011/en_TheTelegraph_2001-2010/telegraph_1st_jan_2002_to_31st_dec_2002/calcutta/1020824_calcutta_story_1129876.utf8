 Saturday, August 24, 2002 				 Wake-up call for Tiger force
 AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR																								With the crime rate going up and the Pujas fast approaching, city police chief Sujoy Chakraborty on Friday read the Riot Act to his men in Tiger mobile vehicles. During a meeting at Lalbazar, Chakraborty read out a long list of complaints, accusing mobile duty officers of cutting corners and falling asleep at the slightest opportunity.																								The police chief admitted that petty crime has increased in pockets and warned that the situation might worsen in September, a month before the Pujas. Chakraborty, however, told his officers not to reveal excerpts of the meeting to the media. 																								There are 70 mobile Tigers stationed in sensitive areas and important intersections. On Friday, an hour after Chakraborty told his men to spruce up their act, a peek at the Park Street-AJC Bose Road intersection revealed two policemen taking an afternoon nap. The scene was repeated at Chetla and New Alipores Block A, near Majerhat bridge. Despite traffic snarls on Elgin Road, officials in the Tiger mobile were reading newspapers and sipping tea. 																								Chakraborty said that Tiger mobile officers have been given a charter of duties. They are supposed to help traffic police take adequate anti-crime measures and note down public complaints, Chakraborty said. 																								The police chief added that his mobile force has complained of damaged vehicles hampering work, and funds have been allotted to repair them.																								He claimed that there would be a major improvement in security measures in the first week of October. Deputy commissioner of police, wireless, P. Ravi, admitted that some of the Tiger mobile policemen do resort to indiscipline. Senior police officers do go out on surprise checks. I have suspended 25 mobile officers in the past six months, he said. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

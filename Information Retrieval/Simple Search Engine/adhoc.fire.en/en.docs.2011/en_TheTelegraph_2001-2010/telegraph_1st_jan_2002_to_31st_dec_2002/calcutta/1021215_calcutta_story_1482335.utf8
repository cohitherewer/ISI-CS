 A STAFF REPORTER																								Schoolbuses in the city will soon have identical colours like taxis to help traffic police identify them and help them move safely on the streets. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) M.K. Singh said bus-owners would be informed about the colour schemes.																								We plan to introduce a single colour for the roof of the bus and another for the rest of the vehicle, Singh said while addressing a safety awareness campaign organised by the West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners and Operators Association on Saturday.																								Singh added that the traffic department would organise a training camp for school bus-drivers on driving skills and handling schoolchildren. Also present at the programme was special inspector-general of police (traffic) S.K. Mandal.																								Singh said the police would soon issue notices to schoolbus owners about a Supreme Court directive on plying of such vehicles. We will initiate action if we find them violating any of the 10 directives passed by the apex court, he added.

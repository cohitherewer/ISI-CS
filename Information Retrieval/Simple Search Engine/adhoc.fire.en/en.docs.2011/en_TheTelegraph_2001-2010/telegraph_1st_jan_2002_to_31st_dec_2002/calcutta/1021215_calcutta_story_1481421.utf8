 Sunday, December 15, 2002 				 City group of colleges to reopen
 OUR BUREAU																								The city group of colleges Rammohan College (morning), City College (day) and Anandamohan College (evening)  will reopen on December 23. It was closed since December 4, following clashes between rival groups of students.																								The decision was taken at a meeting on Saturday by office-bearers of the Brahmo Samaj Education Society which controls the management of the colleges.																								Society secretary Asit Das said the governing body would shortly issue a notification asking students to resume classes from December 23. The college office will start functioning from December 19, he added.																								Officials said the college authorities would suspend the rival students unions, belonging to the Trinamul Congress and the SFI respectively, for damaging college property worth several lakhs of rupees during the clash. We may later derecognise the two unions, they added.																								Besides, students will have to pay a punitive levy of Rs 25 each. We shall also take over the students union funds to foot the repair bill, said a society member.																								The college authorities also decided to close down two common rooms and introduce identity cards for students.																								nSteel plant strike: All three major trade unions of Durgapur Steel Plant have called a days strike on December 27 to protest the cut in salaries every month. A DSP spokesperson said a payment was made during the Pujas as an advance and not given as an ex gratia. Hence it was being deducted from the salaries.

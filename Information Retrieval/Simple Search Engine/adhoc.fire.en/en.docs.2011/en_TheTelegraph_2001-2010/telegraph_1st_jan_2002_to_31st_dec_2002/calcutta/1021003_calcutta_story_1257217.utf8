 Thursday, October 03, 2002 				 Malaria scan on club, hotel pools
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The civic health department has decided to carry out inspections of swimming pools in star hotels and clubs of the city.																								On Wednesday, member, mayors council (health), Javed Ahmed Khan, said: The decision was taken following detection of mosquito larvae in water samples collected from the pools of a hotel and a club in the city.																								The civic authorities have directed the hotels and clubs to drain out the water in the pools at least once every five days to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. 																								Member, mayors council, (drainage and sewerage), Rajib Deb said steps had been taken to clean the College Square pool with help from the Hrishikesh Park drainage pumping station.																								The civic authorities are, meanwhile, planning to slap fees on pools managed by clubs in the city. The civic accounts department recently pointed out to mayor Subrata Mukherjee that swimming clubs had been charging high entrance fees from their members, without sharing the income with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). Officials said the CMC had to spend more than Rs 50 lakh from its coffers annually to maintain the swimming clubs.																								The CMC maintains seven swimming pools at Tallah, Shyambazar (Deshbandhu Park), Hatibagan (Hedua), College Street, Puddapukur on Lansdowne Road, Kidderpores Padmapukur and Watgunge.

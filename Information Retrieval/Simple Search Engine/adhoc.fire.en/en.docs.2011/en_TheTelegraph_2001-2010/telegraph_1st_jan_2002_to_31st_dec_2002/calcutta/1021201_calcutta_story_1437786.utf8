 Sunday, December 01, 2002 				 Civic tax assault on stadium
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In another strike on state transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys territory, the CPM-run Salt Lake municipality, controlled by Chakrabortys detractors, has decided to impose property tax on Yuba Bharati Krirangan.																								The decision, aimed apparently to boost the cash-strapped civic bodys coffers, was taken at its monthly board meeting on Saturday.																								We provide services to the stadium, like drainage, sewerage and car parking. So are we are within our rights to claim property or service tax, Dilip Gupta, chairman of Salt Lake municipality, said. A tax bill has already being sent to the Sports Authority of India, he added.																								But Chakraborty said he would seek legal advice on the issue. This is the first time that a tax has been imposed on a stadium in the state, he said.

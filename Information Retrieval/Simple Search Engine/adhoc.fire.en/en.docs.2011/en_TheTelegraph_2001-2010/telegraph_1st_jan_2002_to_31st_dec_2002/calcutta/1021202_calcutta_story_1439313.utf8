The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, December 02, 2002 				 Busy street, wayward traffic
								Arup Mukherjee: I am a resident of Bansdroni. Here, we face traffic jams throughout the day because of various problems, such as buses being parked on the road, auto-rickshaws and buses stopping everywhere to pick up passengers. Some policemen are present but they are not adequate to tackle the problem.																																																													You have rightly pointed out the problem. Since Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road has become one of the busiest thoroughfares, more attention needs to be paid. Moreover, the terminus of buses on route 205 needs to relocated. I shall talk to the police superintendent.

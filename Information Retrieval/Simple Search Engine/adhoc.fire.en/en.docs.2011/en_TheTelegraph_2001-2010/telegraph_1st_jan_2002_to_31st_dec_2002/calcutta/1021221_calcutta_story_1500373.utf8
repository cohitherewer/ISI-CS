																								Cardiac surgeon Dr Shubhnakar Karmakar runs his own hospital. He is honoured with the Padma Vibhushan, and becomes the state minister for health. He is choosy and attends to only those patients who are sure to survive a surgery. Hence, those who are denied the operation die. The death of these hapless people is considered to be a boon for the reputation of the hospital. Dr Choudhury, an associate and secretary of Dr Karmakar, maintans this secrecy. But Mahasin, an engineer, escapes this fatal list and is operated in Delhi by Dr Karmakars senior, Dr Chatterjee. He survives and his life creates a hindrance to the brutal practices of the hospital. Anirban Majumdar, a young journalist, unravels this mystery. But he is not allowed to probe too far into this as all newspapers are now shut on his face. He is frustrated and becomes a wreck. Dr Choudhury finds this to be justified as he feels this was necessary for the interests of the hospital. Five years hence when Dr Karmakar expects a full ministership, he faces a stranger who comes with Bina, a broken woman. This man tells him, Please resign your ministership. This Nandikar production, being staged as part of its 19th National Theatre Festival, is directed by Rudraprasad Sengupta.																								When: Tomorrow at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

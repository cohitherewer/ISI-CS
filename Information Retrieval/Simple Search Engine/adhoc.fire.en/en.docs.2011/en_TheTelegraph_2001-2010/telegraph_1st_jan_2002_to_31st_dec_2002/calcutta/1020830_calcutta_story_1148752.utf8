				 																																									Whenever people get off taxis or private cars at Howrah station, a group of porters immediately surrounds them and coaxes them for permission to carry the luggage. The porters do not pay heed to any objections from the passengers and charge exorbitant rates, often snatching the luggage away forcibly. This is a routine affair on the station premises. The rates for carrying luggage should be fixed, and policemen can be posted to ensure that porters follow the rule.				 																																									B.N. Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.				 																																									The fare charts for buses on route 46A show the rates from Jheel Mill to Esplanade, via Karunamoyee, Kankurgachhi, Maniktala and Bowbazar. But the buses dont start from Jheel Mill. Instead, they run from Karunamoyee to Esplanade, and vice versa. The fare structure is not in tandem with that announced by the government. The Bengal Transport Authority should revise it, as passengers are paying more than they ought to.

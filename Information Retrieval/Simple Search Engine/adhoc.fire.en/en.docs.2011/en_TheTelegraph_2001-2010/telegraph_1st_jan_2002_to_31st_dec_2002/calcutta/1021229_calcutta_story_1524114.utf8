 Sunday, December 29, 2002 				 Six injured in bomb explosion
 OUR CORRESPONDENT IN CHINSURAH																								Six persons, including three policemen and two employees of the State Electricity Board (SEB), were injured when a bomb exploded inside an electricity meter box at the Kuliapara rice mill site, near Chinsurah, on Friday night. 																								The injured included officer-in-charge of Balagarh police station Debarshi Sinha and station superintendent of Balagarh SEB Subhas Sinha. Sources said the injured were admitted to Chinsurah Sadar Hospital where the condition of one Maqbal Alam was stated to be critical.																								According to police, Madhab Pramanik, owner of a rice mill in Kuliapara, lodged a diary with the Balagarh police on December 18, stating that his electricity meter had been stolen. Following the complaint, station superintendent of Balagarh SEB, Subhas Sinha, went for an on-the-spot check along with some officials of the Balagarh police station around 10 pm on Friday. 																								While inspecting the main box, the men found the commercial meter missing. A search for it led the team to a mysterious black box just beside the main fuse box. When the men tried to open the box, it suddenly exploded, injuring those standing nearby. Several pencil batteries were recovered from the spot. Experts from the state forensic department will visit the site on Sunday to collect samples. 																								Preliminary investigation suggests that someone might have planted a crude bomb inside the meter box, said Balagarh OC Debarshi Sinha. As the news of explosion spread, hundreds of people gathered at the site. The area was cordoned off and a police picket was posted.																								nSuicide: A 41-year-old sex worker, Monica Ghosh, committed suicide by hanging herself at her Nabin Chandra Boral Street residence on Friday night. She had been suffering from depression for the past few months, police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 Seal the street, see kids smile
 A STAFF REPORTER																								THE Charges: Sanjay Bakshi, chief patron of 7 Pally Sarbojanin Puja Committee, has blocked Madan Chatterjee Lane, off Chittaranjan Avenue, to erect the pandal. A large number of loudspeakers have been installed around the pandal in the congested area, causing inconvenience to residents.																								6Nandan Chatterjee Road, opposite Ram Mandir, has been sealed. Vehicles will have to take a detour for Rabindra Sarani or its adjoining areas. In case of a blaze, firemen will not be able to reach the spot. Nor will an ambulance be able to get to a critical patient																								6The road is an important thoroughfare connecting Chittaranjan Avenue with Rabindra Sarani, and commuters will find it difficult to reach their destinations																								6Nearly three-fourths of Muktaram Babu Street, off Chittaranjan Avenue, has also been blocked by the pandal																								6The two pandals and a display of banners have blocked light and fresh air in a number of buildings																								Bakshis defence : First of all, I wish to clarify that Durga puja is a festival that unites people cutting across religion, caste, language and politics. It breaks the barrier between the rich and poor. 																								So, Durga puja, in my opinion, is a social occasion that strengthens national unity while it builds communal harmony. Thats why I dont mind flouting a few rules to organise this kind of function.																								Those who are crying themselves hoarse over the blocking of roads and pavements or playing music on loudspeakers or trimming trees care little for unity and communal harmony. They are against the social and cultural heritage of Bengal. 																								To strengthen national unity and integrity and maintain our cultural heritage, I shall not, if necessary, hesitate to block a few more roads and urge people to organise such festivals.																								I know very well that blocking roads is illegal. Despite this, I do not mind flouting rules time and again, as it brings a smile to the faces of lakhs of children. 																								As it is the oldest and most congested area in the city, with hardly any open space, there is no option but to block roads or pavements to hold a puja. 																								May I ask those who are objecting to us blocking roads, where shall the people of this area hold their puja? Why will they be deprived of the festival?																								And, also, I must say that lights and microphones are an integral part of the Pujas. Without these, how do we celebrate the festival? It is true that playing loudspeakers will inconvenience some people. But what can we do? Some enjoy the sound and the music; others find it unbearable. We cannot please everybody. We have to go by what the majority of the people want. There are some people who are concerned only about themselves.

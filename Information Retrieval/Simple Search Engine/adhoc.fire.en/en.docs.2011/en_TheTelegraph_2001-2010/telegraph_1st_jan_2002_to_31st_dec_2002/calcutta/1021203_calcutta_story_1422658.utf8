The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, December 03, 2002 				 Foot the bill for a cool look
				 				 																															Here is the last edition of our debate on whether cellphones are a luxury or necessity for students. Due to a deluge of letters, we have had to leave some out. Our apologies. The earliest entries will be taken from next month.				 				 																															lCellphones for students are more a luxury then a necessity. We spend most of the day in school or at tutorials. There are phones everywhere. Studies should be more important that fussing over a cellphone.				 				 																															Anushree Basu				 				 																															Ist Year				 				 																															lCellphones are gradually becoming more of a necessity than a luxury, with students spending most of their time at college, tuition or libraries. It helps them keep in touch with parents.				 				 																															Sadia Sitwat				 				 																															lMobiles are meant for professionals who have to be on call all the time. It is pure ostentation, and can destroy the environment in academic institutions.				 				 																															Rimli				 				 																															lWhy shouldnt students be loyal to these contraptions? It buys them all the attention they want.				 				 																															Enakshi Biswas				 				 																															IInd year, Presidency College				 				 																															lIt is shocking to see students with cellphones on campus. They put the phone to no good use and the parents foot the bill!				 				 																															Udita Sen,				 				 																															Gokhale College				 				 																															lStudents are not professionals that they would need cellphones. At most, they use the telephone to speak to friends or family, for which a landline is enough.				 				 																															Suyash Jaiswal				 				 																															Class X, St Xaviers Collegiate School				 				 																															lOur parents may have the disposable income to provide us with a cellphone, but we dont need them. Cellphones will be used to gossip with friends. Our studies may suffer as a result.				 				 																															Rituja Chowdhury				 				 																															Class XI, CA School				 				 																															lCellphones have become a craze. Parents are largely responsible for this, as students use them more for fun.				 				 																															Nandini Dasgupta				 				 																															Bhawanipur Education Society College				 				 																															lCellphones are in vogue, so they seem indispensable. But they are useless for students and are a threat to their studies.				 				 																															Amrita Sethia				 				 																															Ist year, Shri Shikshayatan College				 				 																															lCellphones have become indispensable, yet I feel that for students it is more of a luxury, a fashion statement, than a necessity. Those who disagree may consider this: what matters more, having a cellphone or how hot the model is?				 				 																															Anagh Pal,				 				 																															St Xaviers College				 				 																															lNecessity creeps in from luxury. So what people thought was luxury has become a necessity for many. Though students in general dont require a cellphone, it can be helpful in times of distress and emergency.				 				 																															Aakash Kamal Misra				 				 																															RCC, Calcutta				 				 																															lCellphones for students are an absolute luxury. They are misused by many, and can even affect studies.				 				 																															Vineeta Nair,				 				 																															Class XII, Modern High School				 				 																															lCellphones are not helpful in studies, nor do they aid physical or mental growth. So how can they be necessary?				 				 																															Swagata Gupta,				 				 																															Basanti Devi College				 				 																															lStudents love to show the world that they have it all. They forget their age, status and what their real needs are. Parents are also to be blamed for providing all the luxuries their children ask for.				 				 																															Kamalika Chaudhuri				 				 																															Class XI, Arts, Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan				 				 																															lNo smile, no style, not even a mobile... Words from a recent Hindi serial. Cellphones may have been a luxury in the past, but not so today. One simply cannot miss out on funky SMS.				 				 																															Anna Rozario,				 				 																															J.D. Birla				 				 																															lIn the information age, a mobile isnt a status symbol. But using a cellphone in class or in an examination hall should not be tolerated.				 				 																															Sayan Ghosh				 				 																															lBefore cellphones became popular, students managed without them. It is just a fad that is catching on rather than a means of sending important messages. In case of an emergency, a student can be contacted in school or college.				 				 																															Piali Dasgupta,				 				 																															Class XII, Patha Bhavan				 				 																															lFor students who live away from home, cellphones help to keep in touch with family. Moreover, when a student is appearing for interviews, prospective employers can also get in touch with them more easily.

	 Mysteries of Nature				 				 																															Last weekend, students of Loreto Entally staged a musical dance drama named Adhara Madhuri at the Don Bosco auditorium. The first half of the drama, Esho he sundara, captured Natures omnipotence, while the second, Atma Suddhi, touched upon mythology, legend and mystery, the innocence, the experience, packing in sound, light and motion. The Loreto choir followed with a rendition of Hand in hand				 				 																															The lights, props and costumes were chosen with care, and the music was a high point. The show ended with Vande Mataram and the Tricolour waving aloft.				 				 																															At the core of this show lies a musical fire, giving a feeling of a little force with no beginning and no end, said Allan Perris, choreographer. The participants  all 1,150 of them  put the show together with only two months of practice.				 				 																															 Anisha Baksi				 				 																															Jadavpur University				 				 																
	 Musically alive				 				 																															The boys at St James promised a musical extravaganza, and that is what audiences got, Wednesday through Saturday evening. Oliver, a musical extravaganza in jazz, was a big production in every sense of the term.				 				 																															The Jacobian family got into the act for the annual production, with most roles being filled by the boys, and a few by teachers and friends of the school. Directed by Katy Lai Roy, the orchestra was led by music director Maurice Menezes, with Carlton Kitto providing a touch of jazz. The students did justice to Karen Braganzas choreography. But the high point was the stunning use of lighting and good-looking, efficient sets, put together by Tom Lai.				 				 																															The performances went down well, with the tiniest of the workhouse boys drawing everyones attention, without having a single line.				 				 																
	 Gendering Gujarat				 				 																															On Saturday, the womens cell of St Xaviers conducted a seminar on Senses of Gender and Communalism, with speakers Philip Peacock, Bishops College, and Kavita Punjabi of Jadavpur University.				 				 																															The connection between women and communalism was the central issue of discussion. As Peacock pointed out: Violence occurred in Gujarat but it actually took place in a womans body. He explained the structural politics in play, including the politics of sexuality, of rape, of power and control. Rape, as both speakers pointed out, is not an act of sex but of control and power over women. Sex is used as a medium to subjugate in order to establish power and control, said Punjabi.				 				 																															Some facts about the recent carnage in Gujarat came up for discussion. The gendering of violence with respect to ethnic genocide and the psychosexual paranoia was also broached. Why is it that in wars and riots, men are killed and women get raped? If in a murder, the murderer is blamed, then why is it that the woman is shamed in a case of rape? This was followed by three short films  The Black Rider, In Dark Times and Hey Ram.

	 Prized moments				 				 																															Lakshmipat Singhania Academy celebrated its 7th Founders Day at Kala Mandir on November 24. Following talks by school functionaries, a prize distribution was held for students, who have successfully represented the school locally, at the state level and internationally.				 				 																															Love and unity were the themes for the dance-drama, Insaan Hai Hum. It highlighted the communal friction and hatred that exists in everyday life. Through the play, a screen flashed events, graphics and quotes that complemented the theme. The message: To restore the bonds of brotherhood, barriers must be broken and borders must disappear.				 				 																															lMarch against AIDS : On Sunday, the National Service Scheme volunteers of St Xaviers held a rally to commemorate World AIDS Day. Led by Santosh Jaiswal, NSS president, around 85 students, along with the director of social work A.K. Khan, walked down Short Street and Moira Street. Everyone was wearing the red AIDS ribbon, and were carrying banners on the threat and prevention of AIDS.				 				 																															 Raution Jaiswal amp; Sandip Kundu,				 				 																															IInd year, B.Com, St Xaviers College 				 				 																															lDebut donors: On November 23, St Augustines Day School held its first ever blood donation camp. Organised by the nature club in association with the Indian Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Association of Blood Cancer and Allied Diseases (IABCAD), the event was inaugurated by singer-actor Anjan Dutta.

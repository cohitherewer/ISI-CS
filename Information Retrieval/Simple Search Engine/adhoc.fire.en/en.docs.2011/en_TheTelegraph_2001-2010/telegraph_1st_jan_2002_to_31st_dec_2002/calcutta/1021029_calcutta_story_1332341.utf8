																									But that is only because she is a master of disguise. Last seen, she was as convincing as convincing can be, dressed to get the laughs as a Chinese waitress. The play was 2 into 1, staged by Limelight earlier this month. Her remarkable performance caught everyones eye.																									Is sure to be back for more onstage action. The Oriental act wasnt her first either. The gal who has been acting since her school days, entered the big, bad world of pro theatre with Red Curtains Harlequinade. She was working on costumes, and then slipped on stage for a brief role, bandaging the hand of a clumsy carpenter.																									For the 20-year-old student of St Xaviers College. She had royal aspirations in her first play, Princess on the Road, when she was nine and discovered her true love. Acted in three shows for her school, South Point, two of which won the first prize at the Smarak Kosh One-Act Play Competition. Tried her hand at direction, as well, but that aint quite her thing, as she found out. As a member of the Xaverian Theatrical Society, she acted in Rebirth. Then, she and her friends scripted and directed Love Life And Death In 15 Minutes, which bagged the first prize at the Shri Shikshayatan fest last year. At play readings, she is a regular, with her English batch being the first to organise such events. 																									For this talent, besides acting. Roshni holds a degree in classical music from Bengal Music College. School competitions saw the songstress in action for the western music rounds, too. 																									Is not always under the arclights. The former cadet (and mind, she can use a gun!) was a winner at badminton competitions, carrying away the trophy at an inter-Birla-school sports meet when she was in Class V and VI. But Sourav and his boys are the ones she likes to watch the most. In a more mellow mood, she would go down to the local orphanages and old-age homes, or to the Maidan to take care of the horses.

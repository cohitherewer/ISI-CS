 Tuesday, December 24, 2002 				 Hotel staff set deadline for Nov. pay
 BARUN GHOSH																								Denied last months salaries, 500-odd employees of the state-run- Great Eastern Hotel headed for a showdown with the management. They served a 48-hour ultimatum on Monday, asking the management either to pay up forthwith or face the eventuality. 																								Enough is enough. The hotels employees are yet to get their salaries for November, though barely a week is left for the current months end, said Ramen Pandey, general secretary of the Intuc-affiliated Great Eastern Hotel Staff and Workers Association. 																								Intuc controls the maximum number of the hotels employees. Members from the Citu, too, are learnt to have joined forces with the Intuc activists to protest the managements gesture. 																								Pandey warned that the staff would go on a relay sit-in at the hotel, apart from major roads, to highlight their plight if the management failed to pay the salaries within the deadline. 																								We may even cease work to pressure the government, Pandey said, adding that a protest meeting had been lined up for Thursday. 																								Alarmed over Intucs threats, hotel member-secretary Jagannath Bag rushed to Writers Buildings on Monday and met tourism secretary R.K. Tripathy in a last-ditch bid to end the impasse. We are yet to get any positive response from the government, though two months have elapsed since we asked for a grant of Rs 3 crore to pay the salaries, he added.

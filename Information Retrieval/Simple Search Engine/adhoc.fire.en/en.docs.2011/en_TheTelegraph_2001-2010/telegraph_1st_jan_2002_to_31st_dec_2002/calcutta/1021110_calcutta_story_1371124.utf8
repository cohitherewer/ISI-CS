The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, November 10, 2002 				 Civic body shuts cinema
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on Saturday locked the main gate of Society cinema in central Calcutta claiming control of the hall. Later, the hall employees held a demonstration in front of the CMC building on S.N. Banerjee Road in protest. 																								Last year, the CMC had locked the main gate after it was discovered that the halls lease term had lapsed and the civic body had sole right on the property. We locked the gate when the owner refused to hand over possession of the building to us. But before the Pujas, he, along with the employees, broke open the lock and started screening films, said a CMC official. The employees, however, claimed they had the interim order of the high court to run the cinema.																								Society was one of the venues for the Kolkata Film Festival. The screening has been shifted to Hind cinema following the raid.

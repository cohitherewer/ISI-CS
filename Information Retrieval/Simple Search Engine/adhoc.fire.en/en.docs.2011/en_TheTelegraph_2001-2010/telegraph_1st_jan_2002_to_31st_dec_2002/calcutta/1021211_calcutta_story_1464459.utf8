The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 Life through their lenses
					 This is the portrait of our locality in  old Calcutta. A minstrel is singing in praise of Goddess  Shitala. Some children have gathered around him   Photograph taken by 14-year-old Sunita Sen of Bowbazar  area 																								Innocent eyes mesmerised by the sight of a strange equipment  the camera. For them it was a magic box. And then one day, when two photographers, Suvendu Chatterjee and Kushal Ray, approached them and asked them if they were willing to learn and handle the box, the kids were overjoyed. That was October 2001. With the help of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee and UNICEF, a project was undertaken to empower sex workers children through photography. The project (ensuing child rights of the sex workers children through creative expression) helped them be educated in a new medium and thereby realise their self-worth by judging the world around them. The camera has kindled their urge to know and understand their world.

				 																																										In yet another case, marks of a student were increased after the Calcutta High Court ordered the West Bengal Higher Secondary Council to produce her answer-scripts. Payel Sen, a candidate who scored 681 in the Higher Secondary examination, managed only 21 in her Bengali first paper. She was not happy with her marks in history either. The student of Bankura Mission Girls School then moved court. Justice Barin Ghosh later directed the Council to produce her answer-scripts for both Bengali Paper-I and history. On Thursday, the advocate on behalf of the Council informed the court that after reviewing the papers it was found that Payel had scored six and three marks more in Bengali and history respectively. This is the sixth time the marks of HS students have been increased after the courts intervention.				 																																										Jilted in love, Sivani Kirtania, 22, took her life in north Calcutta on Thursday. Sivani worked as a domestic help in the Northern Avenue apartment of a retired bank manager. Sivani stayed in an adjoining servants quarter. On Thursday morning, when she did not report for work, her employer went to look for her. Sivani was found hanging from the ceiling of the room, officer-in-charge of Chitpur police station S.P. Roy said. Investigations revealed that Sivani had an affair with a man from Rajarhat. They were supposed to get married but Sivani came to know last month that the man was cheating on her, Roy added. Last week, a friend showed her his wedding card. Police do not suspect any foul play and the body has been sent for post-mortem. 				 																																										Vishal Garments, a city-based readymade garments manufacturing and retail chain, has reopened its Park Street showroom and has relocated its Chowringhee showroom to Gariahat. Vishal had to shut down its four showrooms in Calcutta in August due to unwarranted trade union militancy, allegedly fomented by a splinter group from within the workers. On Thursday, Vineet Jain, Vishals chief executive officer, said such militancy among a section of workers was a conspiracy to acquire the company showrooms and damage its public image. Such militancy, Jain alleged, was provoked by Vishals competitors. The CEO, however, expressed his confidence in both Citu and the state government, and stressed on the upbeat mood of private enterprise in West Bengal since the recent facelift of the administration. Another Vishal showroom has been opened at Sodepur. 				 																																										Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has created the post of executive director (ADB projects) to look after the Rs 1,245-crore development projects funded by the Asian Development Bank in Cossipore, Behala, Garden Reach, Jadavpur and the Topsia-Tiljala belt of east Calcutta. This is the third post for the IAS cadre in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) after the municipal commissioner and the joint municipal commissioner.				 																																										For the first time, two posts for chartered accountants have been created in the CMC. According to the mayor, the audit of the civic accounts for the financial year 2001-02 has been completed and sent to the state government on Thursday. The audit of the civic accounts during the period of the CPM-led board, however, could be updated only till 1995 for want of documents.				 																																										Over 15,000 encroachers along the eight-km stretch of the Keshtopur and Beleghata canals will be evicted in November. This was decided after a meeting attended by irrigation minister Amalendra Roy, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and minister of state for irrigation Ganesh Mondal on Thursday. CMCs mayor-in-council in charge of drainage, Rajib Deb, was also present. A Rs 150-crore project taken up in 2000 to clear the citys waterways has been delayed because of the encroachments. Costs have now escalated to Rs 200 crore. Desilting, dredging and excavation work on and along the canals have not been possible. Now we are determined to remove the squatters, those who attended the meeting concluded.

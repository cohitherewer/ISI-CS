 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 10 years on, killer cop sacked
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sirazul Sardar, a constable with the anti-crime section of Bally police station, who had evaded action against him for 10 years, has finally been brought to book. 																								Sources said Sardar, charged with murder, could no longer use his connections to bail him out. 																								On Monday, Howrah superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar said he had signed the order dismissing Sardar from service.																								Earlier, the constable had been booked under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code for shooting truck-driver Ramduri Yadav on February 20, 1992, near Bally police station.																								Investigations revealed that Sardar had shot Yadav after the latter refused to pay him hafta. Sardar was promptly charge-sheeted by the Bally police, said inspector-general of police, south Bengal, N.R. Das. The constable was subsequently suspended from service, pending disposal of the case in court. He, however, managed to obtain bail. 																								According to Kumar, a suspended policeman cannot resume duty until he is cleared of the charges against him. 																								During the 10 years of his suspension, Sardar drew half his salary, sitting at home. Sources said Sardar is still on bail and is lodged in his Ghutiarisharif house, in South 24-Parganas.																								They added that the constable, once an important functionary of the CPM-controlled Non-Gazetted Police Karmachari Samity in Howrah, had used his connections to stall investigations and stay out of jail. We find it surprising that a murder case on trial could get delayed for such a long time, said a senior officer.																								According to investigations, Sardar had stopped a goods-laden lorry (BHC 7545) on Delhi Road and demanded money from driver Yadav. The truck was ferrying goods to Delhi from Calcutta and there were two others, apart from Yadav, in the cabin. When Yadav refused to pay, an argument erupted. An angry Sardar whipped out his service revolver and opened fire, killing Yadav on the spot, Kumar said.																								According to records available with Bally police station, it was Sardars day-off and he had gone to the spot on his own. 																								Sardar, however, reported to the police station a day after the incident and explained to his superiors that he was trying to track down a criminal.																								During the course of investigations, police said they traced the bullet to Sardars revolver. Yadavs associates in the truck identified him as the killer.																								The Howrah police said Sardar, on earlier occasions, had submitted forged letters from the court to escape dismissal from service.

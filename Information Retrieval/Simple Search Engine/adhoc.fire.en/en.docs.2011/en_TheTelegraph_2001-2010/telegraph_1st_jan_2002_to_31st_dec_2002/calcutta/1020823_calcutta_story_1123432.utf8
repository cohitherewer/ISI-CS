 Friday, August 23, 2002 				 Govt mantle for quack with snakebite antidote
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								A recommendation by senior government officials to give a patient hearing to a bogus doctor of alternative medicine has stumped the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital (CNMCH) authorities.																								The person, who had supposedly created a liquid antidote to cure snakebite, was exposed by the hospital authorities, who interviewed him for over an hour last week and also analysed the liquid. 																								The incident has also revealed the lack of screening on the part of the state government, which allows quacks and bogus doctors to take advantage of ignorant health department officials.																								Later, speaking to Metro, joint director of medical education Basanta Khan admitted that the government does not have any process to screen the credentials of such people. The man claimed that the antidote was made from an insect, which the mongoose, the snakes sworn enemy, loves to eat. He claimed that the liquid, extracted from crushing the particular insect, could provide a permanent cure for snakebites, and he had successfully tried it on his pet cat. 																								The quack failed to answer every single query we raised and had no clue about the composition of the liquid. He was definitely bogus, said senior pharmacologist and CNMCH teacher S. Jana.																								Earlier, Khan had referred the person to the director of the School of Tropical Medicine (STM). In a letter sent to the applicant, who wanted to regularly supply the medicine for treatment at all city hospitals, Khan wrote: Please meet the director of STM and Drug Control Directorate (DCD) Pijush Kanti Sarkar for advice and guidance.																								The matter was then referred to the department of pharmacology of medical colleges and hospitals for necessary action. The applicant desires to introduce/manufacture an indigenous alternative medicine against snakebite... You may give him a hearing and help the applicant, if possible, Sarkar wrote in his referral to the heads of department of pharmacology. 																								On August 13, the man showed up at the CNMCH with a test-tube containing the liquid. The man reportedly could not handle the usual questions on his year of graduation, composition of medicine, etc. 																								After a while, he left, promising to return with the papers. He failed to answer a single question. We still asked him to furnish his curriculum vitae, since we would refer his case to the ethics committee. The man, however, did not turn up, said Jana.																								He added that this was not an isolated case, as in the recent past, the CNMCH had received cases of treatment for rabies and anaemia. All these turned out to be fraudulent, but posed difficulties for us, as the people had strong referrals. We wish the government did a preliminary screening before sending such bogus doctors to us, said a senior official. copy;  Copyrights 2002. All Rights Reserved. The Telegraph.  Conceptualised

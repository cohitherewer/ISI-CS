 A STAFF REPORTER																								Teachers of Madhyamik and Higher Secondary schools drew flak from Left Front chairman Biman Bose for poor work culture. Bose was speaking at a seminar organised by Sanskriti Parishad on Saturday. 																								While admitting that the educational infrastructure in West Bengal was not perfect, Bose said teachers should be more committed to their profession. Although teachers cannot always remain unaffected by consumerism, careers in education and health are different from other options as they involve the sense of a mission, he said.																								Bose, who was in London recently, pointed out that British school teachers have to constantly upgrade themselves. This concept, he said, is missing in West Bengal. He suggested that the punctuality of teachers be monitored by their colleagues.																								The state governments ban on private tuition, too, came up for discussion. Students participating in the seminar stressed that they required tuitions as the syllabus cannot be completed in class and teachers cannot attend to each student individually.																								nMan run over: A cigarette-trader was killed when his cycle was knocked down by a bus at Shantinagar, in the airport police station area, around 2 pm on Saturday. The driver has been arrested. Locals later blocked the road for more than two hours.

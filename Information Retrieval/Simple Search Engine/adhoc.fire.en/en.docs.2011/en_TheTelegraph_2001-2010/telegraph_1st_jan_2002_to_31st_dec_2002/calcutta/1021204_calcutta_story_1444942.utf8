 Wednesday, December 04, 2002 					 					 You share your birthday with...Ajit Agarkar. A year for progress and change. Do not force your opinions on others. People born on 2, 6, 7, 11, 15, 20, 24, 25 and 29 will enter your life. Mondays and Fridays are good. Be less weight-conscious.  Kusum Bhandari

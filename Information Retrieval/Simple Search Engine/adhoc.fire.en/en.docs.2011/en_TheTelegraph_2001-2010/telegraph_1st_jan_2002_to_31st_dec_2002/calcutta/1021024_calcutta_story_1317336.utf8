The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, October 24, 2002 				 Three wheels amp; a walk of discord
 															- Asims yank-off-auto drive revs up resentment in Subhas lobby SUNANDO SARKAR AND SANJAY MANDAL																								Guess whose toes Asim Dasgupta has stepped on after hitting the streets of Salt Lake for his evening walk? Cabinet colleague Subhas Chakrabortys, of course.																								More than a decade ago, the finance minister  after getting temporary charge of the transport department because of Chakrabortys absence  got down to some serious (and high- profile) traffic-management near Lalbazar. Chakraborty was not amused and, immediately on rejoining office, said such an active minister could only create more problems rather than solve them.																								Dasgupta has hit the road once again, with health, and not traffic-management, uppermost on his mind. But the fallout  if the rumblings within the transport ministers lobby in the public vehicles department, Bidhannagar Municipality and the North 24-Parganas are anything to go by  is very similar.																								The finance minister has asked law-enforcers to ensure that the unruly auto-rickshaws stay off Salt Lakes Broadway, the stretch in front of Charnock City. This diktat came in late September when Dasgupta, on his now-customary evening walk back home, found some autos blocking the Bypass.																								We have told auto-drivers not to enter Broadway, confirmed Bidhannagar (South) inspector-in-charge Biplab Bagchi. They are a menace to cars and pedestrians. Though he officially denied any link between the finance minister and the no-entry-for-autos rule, Bagchi could not explain why the three-wheelers had suddenly been pulled off Salt Lakes streets.																								The transport lobby and some CPM leaders close to Chakraborty see in the police move a conspiracy to undermine the transport ministers authority. A North 24-Parganas CPM functionary said: The way in which officials acted in yanking autos off the road without bothering to consult the transport minister is unprecedented. Why cant the finance minister use the Salt Lake stadium for his evening walk and leave the road to autos?																								All this has put the police in an uncomfortable position  caught in a power tussle between two heavyweight ministers. The auto union has shown our officials permits issued by the public vehicles department to some of these vehicles plying on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, a senior officer said. We seem to be caught in a crossfire. Dasgupta, however, refused to read too much into the episode and maintained that most residents of Salt Lake felt that autos were a real menace.

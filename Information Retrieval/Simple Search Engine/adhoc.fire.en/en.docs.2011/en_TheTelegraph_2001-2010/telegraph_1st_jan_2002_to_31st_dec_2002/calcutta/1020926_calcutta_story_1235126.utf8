 Thursday, September 26, 2002 				 Gobra scare
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Tuesdays terror attack on Akshardham temple sparked panic at a place of worship in Topsia on Wednesday. Two youths, taking photographs of a Shiva temple, were beaten up by local residents, suspicious that the two were out to create trouble. Police, who intervened after the youths were thrashed and locked up in a club, said the residents of Gobra may have over-reacted.																								Later, a crowd gathered, holding a sit-in and disrupting traffic. The area was cordoned off and deputy commissioner of police, eastern suburban division, Sanjoy Mukherjee, arrived with a squad to defuse the tension. A picket was posted in the area. The youths, who suffered a few bruises, have been detained for interrogation.

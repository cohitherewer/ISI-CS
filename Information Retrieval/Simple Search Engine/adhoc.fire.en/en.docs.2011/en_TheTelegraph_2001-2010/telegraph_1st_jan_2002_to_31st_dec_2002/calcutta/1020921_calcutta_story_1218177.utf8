 Saturday, September 21, 2002 				 Arrests bust arms racket
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Police busted an inter-state gang of arms dealers with the arrest of three persons in the city and its neighbourhood on Friday. About 175 rounds of cartridges and three revolvers, some cartridge-chargers and Rs 15,000 were recovered from them. The gang supplied arms to criminals like Jishu Jain, Bhola and Khatal Bapi. Police are now looking for more people involved.																								Deputy superintendent of police (town) Subhankar Chatterjee said the police knew that Volcun, alias Khokan, alias Jagabandhu Pal, a criminal from the Kabardanga area of Nepalgunge, in Thakurpukur, dealt in arms.																								After being tipped off, a team from Thakurpukur police station went to Pals house around 4.30 am, posing as customers. The policemen said they were from Nadia and intended to buy revolvers and cartridges. As soon as Pal brought out the revolvers and cartridges, the plainclothesmen arrested him. He used to keep the arms and ammunition in a special cabinet in his prayer-room (thakurghar). His son Bejoy, 18, too, was picked up. All the cartridges and revolvers bore the Madras Ordnance Factory stamp, said Chatterjee.																								After interrogating him, police found out that Bikash Das, a resident of Samar Sarani, in Cossipore, was the man who supplied arms in bulk to different dealers. Chatterjee said another person, apart from Das, was probably involved in the racket, but he had given the cops the slip. 																								Additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas, R.K. Singh, said this was probably the largest arms haul in the recent past. He said the Chennai government will be contacted as early as possible.

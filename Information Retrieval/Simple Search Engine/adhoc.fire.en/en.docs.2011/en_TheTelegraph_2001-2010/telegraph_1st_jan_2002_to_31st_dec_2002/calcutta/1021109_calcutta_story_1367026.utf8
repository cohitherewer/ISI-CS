 Saturday, November 09, 2002 				 Minister walks in traffic snarl
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A series of traffic snarls in the citys business hub on Friday afternoon forced Union minister of state for commerce and industries Rajiv Pratap Rudy to get out of his convoy car and walk a few hundred metres to keep a delayed date with entrepreneurs at the Indian Chamber of Commerce.																								Rudy, however, took it in his stride. I am sorry for being late by almost an hour, but I really couldnt help it. I finally decided there was no point in waiting and so walked the last stretch But thats no big deal. Police later said there was trouble on Council House Street after a cabbie was pulled up for reckless driving.

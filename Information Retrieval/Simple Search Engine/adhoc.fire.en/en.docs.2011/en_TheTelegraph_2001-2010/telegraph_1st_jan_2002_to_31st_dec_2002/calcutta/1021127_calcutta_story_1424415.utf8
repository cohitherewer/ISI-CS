				 																																										lA hoax call to a police control room sent officials of five police stations and the Air Force into a tizzy on Monday. An anonymous call was made to the Doltala police control room in North 24-Parganas on Monday evening. Two persons are plotting to blow up the Air Force base in Barrackpore if the government does not release Aufan Ukil in two hours, the caller said. Ukil, an Air Force employee, was arrested on espionage charges from Pune and brought to the city for interrogation. The caller gave the names and address of two people. The Doltala control room personnel contacted the Barrackpore and the Noapara police stations, where officers alerted the Alipore police. Squadron leader Sanjay Srivastava, regional chief of Air Force Police, contacted the Alipore police at night. We have beefed up security at Barrackpore and other bases, he said. The police picked up the two who were supposed to blow up the air base. But interrogation revealed that they knew nothing about such a plot. They were released after it was established that they were innocent. It was a prank, an officer said.

Khalid asked the shop-owner if somebody could accompany them to the hotel where he would pay for the goods purchased. Accordingly, two employees were sent with the trio. After arriving at the hotel, Khalid offered the employees tea laced with sedatives and knocked them out.

				 																																										lThe organisers of Bosepukur Sitala Mandir Durga Puja met fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee on Monday and produced a sample of chemically-treated crushed sugarcane with which they would make the pandal. General secretary of the puja committee Samir Roychowdhury claimed that the crushed sugarcane, chemically treated by a scientist, was fire-proof and sought to demonstrate that before the minister. Chatterjee, however, did not allow a demonstration and told them that fire services officials would visit the pandal for an inspection. Chatterjee said the government would not stop any puja, but if inspections revealed the pandal to be a fire hazard, the organisers could face arrest and a fine of up to Rs 3,000 a day. The scientist who has chemically treated the crushed sugarcane will have to give us an undertaking that the material is fire-proof, the fire services minister added.

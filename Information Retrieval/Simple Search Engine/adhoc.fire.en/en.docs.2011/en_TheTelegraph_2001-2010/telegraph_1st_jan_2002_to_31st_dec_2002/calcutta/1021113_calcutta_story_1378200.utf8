The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, November 13, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									A few days ago, we boarded a pre-paid taxi from Howrah. The taxi driver insisted that we give him Rs 15 as additional charges. As we were very tired and did not want a fight, we gave in to his demand. Why dont the authorities modify the rate chart and bring them at par with taxis that run on meters. It would save us a lot of harassment.				 																																									T.R. Anand,				 																																									Budge Budge Trunk Road.				 																																									I went to buy a khadi chaddar at the Chitta Ranjan Avenue bhandar. Though the salesman promptly made out the cash memo and the cashier accepted the payment, there was nobody at the delivery counter. Everyone shouted in vain for the absent staff member. But nobody bothered to give me the parcel although it was already packed. This carried on for the next couple of minutes till a man appeared from nowhere and actually took the trouble of delivering the goods. He even reprimanded the other staff members for not having done so so long. Does this happen all the time at the khadi bhandar?				 																																									Soumitra Das, 				 																																									Bentinck Street.

 Wednesday, November 13, 2002 				 Protest against right-wing violence
																								At the beginning of and during the course of the 1990s a small minority of right-wing German youngsters began attacking foreigners in Germany. The experiences were frightful for the victims and embarrassing for all Germans. Photographs of the venomous mob and martial parades of fanatic skin-heads had a devastating effect on the image of a united Germany. Once again, fears came to the fore that the German Republic could again drift to the right or that the past would return as the Fourth Reich. It was necessary to build resistance against violence and Attacks on right-wing violence  a nation-wide poster competition at universities and academies was initiated. The result was mind-boggling. The posters,currently on view in the city, are born of rage, shame and despair and attack those who look the other way as violence escalates and those who have a tendency to flee into the private sphere in view of undesirable circumstances and to leave resistance to others. The current show is hosted by Max Mueller Bhavan Goethe-Institut Inter Nationes, Calcutta.																								When: Till November 23 (except Sundays); 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Max Mueller Bhavan, 8 Pramathesh Barua Sarani (Ballygunge Circular Road)

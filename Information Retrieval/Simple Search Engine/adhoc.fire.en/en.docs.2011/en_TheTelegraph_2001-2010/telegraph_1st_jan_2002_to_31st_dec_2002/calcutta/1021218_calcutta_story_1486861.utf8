The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 Winkle Twinkle
																								It was a cold January morning in 1976. Sabyasachi Sen, a political prisoner under custody, vanished into thin air as it were from a park in Calcutta. Frantic search yielded no result. However, like the fable character, Rip Van Winkle, Sen reappeared in the same park after 26 years. Everything around him had transformed, except him. A total misfit now, Sen gropes in the dark for a place under the sun. Indra, Sens now grown-up son, has also followed in his fathers footsteps and chosen a political career for himself. He, however, treads a different path and his ideals and beliefs are stark opposite his fathers. Sens daughter, Indrani, is a carefree, happy-go-lucky girl, oblivious of her surroundings. Sens wife, Rajlakshmi, well past her prime now, has nothing to look forward to and intends spending the rest of her days amid memories of her past. Sens sudden reappearance shocks them all and the equilibrium of daily existence is suddenly put off-balance. The fantasy and contradictions that confront both Sen and his family members explore the dialectics of reality. Based on Bratya Basus play, this Sansriti production is directed by Debesh Chattopadhyay. The play is being staged as part of Nandikars 14th National Theatre Festival.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

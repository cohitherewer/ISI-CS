The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, December 25, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									Roads in Garden Reach, Circular Garden Reach and Metiabruz have greatly deteriorated over the years. Mishaps have now become a routine affair during the monsoon as vehicles hit large craters submerged in stagnant water. Pedestrians find it difficult to negotiate the roads even in the dry seasons. Last year, a private bus had turned turtle after stumbling on a pothole, killing two people on Sick Lane. The authorities should immediately undertake repairs on that road and the stretch from Brooke Lane to Kamal Talkies.				 																																									Javed Hossain,				 																																									Garden Reach.				 																																									Roadside shacks selling tea and snacks do not follow the basic norms of hygiene. Cups and saucers are usually dumped into a bucketful of water for washing. Besides, the water used for making tea is also not potable. Health officers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation should frequently inspect these shops. The number of such eateries is growing by the day.

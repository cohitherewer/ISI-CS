				 																																																																				 It is shameful and unfortunate that despite being aware of the medical examination report of a four-year-old girl which proved that she had not been raped, the Regent Park police rounded up 11-year-old Sonu Thakur and filed a chargesheet against him (Rights panel rush to review rape frame-up, Metro, July 11). He was confined in a juvenile home with hardcore criminals and his plea for justice was turned down by the West Bengal Human Rights Commission (WBHRC). The police are probably prey to a common prejudice against a rape accused. It is a pity that only after Uday Kant Thakur decided to file a writ petition against the WBHRC for refusing his application and the case was publicised in the media (Rights panel shuns boy framed for rape, Metro, July 5) did the commission take an informal decision to conduct an investigation. Thakurs tenacity, despite his mental agony, in his crusade for justice should serve as a boost to other victims of injustice. 				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				I am bewildered at the idea of how a student, who has performed admirably in JEE and CET, can fail to secure a single mark in one of the maths papers in the HS examination (Letter in Madhyamik, nought for HS maths, Metro, July 31). It is hoped that justice, though delayed, will be done to Soumya. If such inconsistencies continue in the results, people will lose faith in the examination system. 				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																													lSoumya Shankar Mauliks case is yet another example of the irresponsibility of the Higher Secondary Board. The government promises to make the evaluation of answerscripts error-free but nothing seems to change.				 																																													Saadia Sitwat,				 																																													Linton Street.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Two tourists beaten up, pushed into cable pit (Metro, July 30), it is quite shameful that tourists are so unsafe around Victoria Memorial. How could the scoundrels dare to do this despite there being a police outpost nearby? To make the city more tourist-friendly, the police need to pull up their socks.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				The report Rs 2-cr drug haul in The City Diary (Metro, August 1) about a police raid indicates that a big gang is involved in smuggling heroin, hashish, cannabis and other narcotic substances. These drugs ruin our youth. The arrested drug lord should be interrogated so that the the evil can be rooted out once and for all. People should come forward to help the cops. 				 																																													B.N. Bose,				 																																													Dum Dum.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Salt Lake lights up to perils of tobacco (Metro, July 31) kudos to Bidhannagar Municipality for its earnest efforts to curb smoking in public places. 				 																																													Sunil Banerjee,				 																																													VIP Road.				 																																																																				The report Hazards of a neglected highrise, (Metro, July 26), should ring an alarm bell for the authorities concerned. The ill-maintained Chatterjee International Centre should be immediately repaired to ensure the safety of thousands who use the building or pass by it.				 																																													Somnath Lahiri,				 																																													Motijheel.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Teens take fast track to trauma (Metro, July 23), it is really painful to note that so many adolescents are in need of psychological help. As the matter has assumed serious proportions, a clinic has been set up at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. However, this will serve little purpose unless the guardians constantly keep an eye on the ways of their wards.				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																													Lake Town.				 																																													lParental pressure has traumatised children. The cost of education has increased so much that parents cannot think beyond their childrens text books, robbing them of the time to enjoy themselves. 				 																																													Subhamoy Ghosh,				 																																													Salt Lake City.				 																																																																				Dr Amit Ghose of the Oxford Stone Clinic is no longer attached to Wockhardt or Kothari medical centres, as mentioned in Shock waves for kidney stones (Metro, August 6).

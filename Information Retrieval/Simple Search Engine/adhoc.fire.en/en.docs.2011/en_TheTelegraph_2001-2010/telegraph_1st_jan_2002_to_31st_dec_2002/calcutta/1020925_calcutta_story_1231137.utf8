The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, September 25, 2002 				 Met office dispels wet fears
 A STAFF REPORTER																								For Puja shoppers forced to stay indoors by the nagging rain over the past two days, there is some good news emanating from the weather office.																								By Thursday, the rain clouds will disappear and bright sunshine will greet Calcuttans, insists the Alipore Meteorological Office.																								A Met office spokesman told Metro that Tuesdays continuous rain was sparked by a well-marked low-pressure zone over the northwest Bay and the adjoining areas of North Orissa (Baripada) and West Bengal (Midnapore).																								The spokesman said that under the influence of the low-pressure zone, a few spells of rain and thundershowers are expected in the city over the next 24 hours. Although the forecast is for isolated heavy rainfall in other parts of the state till Friday, there is no need to panic, he added. It is not a depression, and we have not issued any warning to fishermen in the coastal areas. However, such low-pressure areas could occur again, according to the Met office spokesperson.																								Tuesdays persistent rain compelled most people to drop plans for Puja shopping. Gariahat and New Market were deserted for the greater part of the day, as business was hit hard. 																								Every day is vital during this final lead-up to the Pujas, and unless the weather improves soon, we will be left with huge unsold stocks, said a small trader of saris on Gariahat.																								Some shoppers who braved the inclement weather and ventured out were badly inconvenienced, as vehicles stood bumper-to-bumper on waterlogged streets. With political parties bringing out rallies in the afternoon, traffic was disrupted on J.L. Nehru Road, Lenin Sarani and S.N. Banerjee Road, and police had their task cut out.

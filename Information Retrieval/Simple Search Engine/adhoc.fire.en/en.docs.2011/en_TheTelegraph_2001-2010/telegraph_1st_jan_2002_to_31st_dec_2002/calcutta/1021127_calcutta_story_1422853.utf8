 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 At Red amp; Black, the exhibition at St Xaviers. Picture by Aranya Sen																								That a talent for the fine arts is not restricted to students of the subject was amply demonstrated at Red amp; Black. In what will hopefully be the first in a line of exhibitions organised by the department of English and the Fine Arts Society of St Xaviers College, students of over 10 city colleges showed off almost 200 creations on Tuesday.																								Canvases and craftwork by fine arts students, including those from Government College of Arts and Crafts, College of Visual Arts and Rabindra Bharati University, shared space at the college auditorium with the efforts of students from various streams of colleges including Loreto House, Rani Birla, Bethune, Scottish Church, Gokhale as well as the hosts. Filmmaker Goutam Ghosh attended the inauguration.																								A diverse range of paintings, from life-like portraits to landscapes, were on display. A stirring piece, with one clown whispering into anothers ear, a pencil sketch of Princess Diana and a mixed-media work in blue and green capturing two owls were just a few of the striking efforts, some on sale, while others were meant for display alone. Garments and accessories, junk jewellery, showpieces in ceramic and clay were also showcased at the inter-disciplinary exhibition.																								Organised by professors and students, Red amp; Black has been in the making for the past few months. There are a lot of students in our college who are very talented This has been a very good platform for them, explain professors Chandrani Biswas of the English department and Moitrayee Chakraborty of sociology.																								A handful of paintings by professionals, including Sanatan Dinda and Eleena Banik, were also on display. Wasim Kapoor and Niranjan Pradhan were the judges for the amateur works at the exposition, divided into categories, including oil and water paintings, fusion (mixed media), glass painting, ceramics and pottery.																								There were live events as well in the college parlour. The day was divided into T-shirt painting, portraits, mask-making and fusion. Almost all the T-shirts were sold by the end of the day, when Tanushree Shankar gave away cash prizes to students in a number of categories, to students from a range of colleges.																								We have had at least 185 entries from 12 colleges, with many spot entries too. Over 50 students have registered for the on-spot events, says Srijit Bhattacharya, third-year student of English and secretary of the organising committee.																								There are more events coming up at Xaviers, including a literary quiz and debate and a short story-writing competition.

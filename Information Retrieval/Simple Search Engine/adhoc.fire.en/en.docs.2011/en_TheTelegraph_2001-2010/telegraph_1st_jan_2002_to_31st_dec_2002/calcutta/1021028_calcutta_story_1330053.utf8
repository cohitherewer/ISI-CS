								Jayanta Nath Saha: Salt Lake residents are worried about a spurt in petty crime. We have formed resistance groups. But the shanties along the canal are creating problems. Is it possible to clear them?																																																													We are also worried about petty crime and action must be taken. No one supports the shanties, but there is a human angle to the problem. So, before eviction, we have to ensure the safety of the dwellers. Actually, eviction is not conducted by the police. For this, meetings should be held among the development authorities, police and the political parties.

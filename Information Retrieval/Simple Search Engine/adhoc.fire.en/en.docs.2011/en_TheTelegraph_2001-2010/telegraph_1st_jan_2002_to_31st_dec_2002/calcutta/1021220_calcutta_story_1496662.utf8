	Mini-buses in our city are so jerky, that commuters can  get easily injured, especially when the vehicles stop  or start-up for passengers. Those standing are the worst  sufferers. The private buses are comparitively better,  because of their dimensions, but most of them have protruding  rods on either side of the foot-boards, which injure passengers  while getting on or off. The authorities should check  for customer comfort while issuing/renewing certificates  to buses. 
	 Md. Moinuddin, Ballygunge.  
	Nowadays, most school authorities run two or three shifts,  but with little care for hygiene in the classrooms. The  Behala unit of a well-known school is one such callous  institution. After the morning session, the afternoon  students find the desks and chairs covered with morsels  of food and chewing gum. The kids have to tolerate this,  due to the indifference of the caretakers. And they are  taught that cleanliness is next to godliness.  
	Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge.

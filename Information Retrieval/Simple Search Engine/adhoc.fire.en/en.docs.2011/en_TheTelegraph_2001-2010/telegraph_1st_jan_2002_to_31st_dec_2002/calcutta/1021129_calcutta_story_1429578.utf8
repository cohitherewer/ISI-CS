 Friday, November 29, 2002 				 Now, a commando in Kalighat
 															- Sandbag security shield in temple, strict vigil in neighbourhood AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR				 	 A view of the Kalighat temple: Bunkers beside the pilgrims																								Jaba phool, batasha, dhup kathi and sandbags. Adding an alien ingredient to the piety platter at Kalighat temple soon will be a security shield.																								In the wake of the attack on Gujarats Akshardham and the more recent one on Jammus Raghunath temple, the police have decided to set up bunkers manned by commandos at Kalighat.																								A hundred sandbags have already been ordered. They will be placed strategically around the temple complex. Sources said two commandos would be deputed in the bunker, with a radio flying squad (RFS) vehicle overseeing security.																								Deputy commissioner of police, south, Kuldeep Singh, said on Thursday that the modalities are being worked out in consultation with the Kalighat mandir committee. Singh held a meeting with officers-in-charge in his Park Street office during the day where he lay down a 10-point things-to-do security list.																								Singh has directed all OCs to check on new tenants entering the locality, develop a rapport with local NGOs and clubs, keep a watch on cyber-cafes, public call offices, petrol pumps, hotels, guest houses and car-rental centres. I have directed them to have officers checking such spots regularly. The threat from terrorists is real and we must be on our guard, he added.																								Singh later said terrorism is an immediate concern for the city police. We are worried about reports on the influx of foreign nationals into the city and their local contacts, he added.

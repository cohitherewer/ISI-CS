 Friday, November 08, 2002 				 Patient leaps to death
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Tarak Chandra Ghosh, 78, leapt to his death from the third-floor balcony of Ruby General Hospital early on Thursday. He had been admitted to hospital on October 26 with urological problems and was advised discharge on Wednesday after a successful surgery.																								Preliminary investigations conducted by the police revealed that Ghoshs family members failed to take him home on Wednesday. They promised to do so on Thursday. Ghosh, upset over this, did not give them the chance. All outstanding bills had been cleared by the family, hospital officials confirmed. But the resident of Tribeni, in Hooghly, had chosen never to return home.																								Tapas Mukherjee, chief manager of Ruby General Hospital, said Ghosh had undergone a routine check-up by the nursing staff on Thursday morning, after which he expressed a desire to go to the balcony for a walk. Although it was around 5.55 am, we thought Ghosh needed some fresh air, so we allowed him out on the verandah. We could never have imagined that he would jump to his death, said a nurse.																								Ghosh was picked up and rushed to the ITU by the ward boys. The battle to revive him raged for a few hours, but it was lost at around 8.30 am.																								It is difficult to say what exactly happened but it is unlikely that he fell off the balcony by accident, as the railings are quite high, said Mukherjee. Ghosh usually kept to himself and spoke little He might have been suffering from depression, after his family members failed to take him home on Wednesday, added Mukherjee.																								The police have, at the moment, ruled out foul play or accident as the cause of death. Additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Kumar Singh said Ghoshs son would visit his father regularly. He might have been confused about when exactly the doctors would release his father. They might also have been busy with bhai phonta, surmised Singh.																								Hospital officials, however, clarified that Ghoshs family members had failed to arrange for transport to take him back home on Wednesday. Ghoshs son, who works with a corporate major, reached the hospital during visiting hours on Thursday to learn about his fathers death. We never imagined he would take such a drastic step, he told the police.

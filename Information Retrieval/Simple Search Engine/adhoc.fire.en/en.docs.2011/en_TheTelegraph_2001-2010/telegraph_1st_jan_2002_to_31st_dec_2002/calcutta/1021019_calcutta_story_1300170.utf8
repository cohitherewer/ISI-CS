																								Based on Euripides (416 BC) tragedy, The Trojan Women, the play is set in the period after the defeat of Troy by the Greeks. It focuses on the effect of war on the innocent Trojan women. The Greeks, led by King Agamemnon, have won the war by unfair means, killing King Priam, his gallant son Hector and thousands of Trojan soldiers, leaving behind an indelible trail of blood and wailing Trojan women, including the widowed Queen Hecabe, the innocent Polyxena and the seer priestess Cassandra. They all await their lot stoically in the hands of the Greeks. These women, who had led a peaceful lifeaway from the glare of war and all its evils, following the moral tenets of society, managing their homes and hearths become the actual victims of war by a strange twist of fate. But the victorious Greeks, swelling with pride, commit various outrages. Retribution descends on them as their collective hubris enrages the gods, Poseidon and Athene. In a strife-torn world, this play highlights the helplessness of human beings in the face of destiny. Translated by Salil Bandyopadhyay and directed by Saswati Biswas, the cast of this Theatron production includes Ashim Sen, Jagari Bandopadhyay, Alokananda Bhattacharya, Tania Banerjee, Senjuti Roy Mukherjee, Dhrubajyoti Das, Saswati Biswas, Bishnupriya Basak, Soma Kar and Arundhati Chakraborty.

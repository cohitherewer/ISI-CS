		 Monday, December 30, 2002 				 Damages secured for passenger injury
					 The jagged tin edges  of a public vehicle pose a risk to passengers. Pictures  by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 										 			Dipa Bose: Some private and government buses are in such a bad state that they can cause injury to the passengers. The rusted corrugated sheets can cause tetanus. Is there any way that the bus-owner or the government can be made to compensate for injury if the commission intervenes?																																																													Yes, you can move the commission with medical papers. You will also have to produce the route number of the bus, date, place and time of the accident and fill proper papers supplied by the commission. However, it should be remembered that it takes a long time to get compensation from the government or from private bus-owners. Of course, the commission will always try its best to help the complainant so that compensation is secured without much delay or harassment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, November 11, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									While watching the recent Test series at Eden Gardens, nostalgic thoughts flashed through my mind. Much of the grounds picturesque setting has altered with time. Old trees on the eastern and western sides have been felled to make way for a gallery. The garden has also been blocked from all sides. Despite the renovations, the ground has lost much of its charm.				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Nayapatty Road.				 																																									Bankim Setu, starting off Howrah Maidan, is in bad shape. The entire stretch, right up to Dobson Road, is potholed and driving along this path is extremely dangerous, especially during peak hours.				 																																									Naren Sen,				 																																									Santragachhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, September 05, 2002 				 Cops held for trader kidnap
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Three constables of the anti-crime section were arrested for abducting a trader on Tuesday and robbing him of Rs 2 lakh.																								Additional superintendent of police, Howrah, Rajeev Mishra, said the mastermind, Ramapada Mondol, of Lake police station, was picked up from the Baranagar area on Tuesday afternoon, while the other two  Sasanka Chakraborty, of the wireless section, and Sukhdev Nandi, of Beniapukur police station  were arrested on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.																								On Tuesday morning, the three cops had hired a car from a central Calcutta agency. They picked up two goons from the Golabari area and parked the car on Muktaram Kanoria Road, near Howrah bridge. 																								They were tipped off that Mohammad Kohinoor, the trader, would be walking down the road around 7 am with the cash, Mishra said.																								As soon as Kohinoor appeared, the group bundled him into the car and sped off towards south Calcutta. They put Kohinoor in the rear seat, with Nandi and Mondol, an officer said. 																								Sources claimed that the cops moved around the city for a while, coaxing the trader to part with the money.																								But Kohinoor was adamant about not handing over the money. Finally, the group drove down to Vidyasagar Setu and pushed Kohinoor out of the vehicle, before fleeing with the money, Mishra said.																								Passersby took the injured Kohinoor to a clinic in Shibpur. Later, he lodged a complaint with Golabari police station. 																								We informed the Calcutta Police and their counterparts in the districts about the incident and asked them to locate an Ambassador with five men, Mishra said.																								On Tuesday afternoon, the Baranagar police located one of the constables while he was sharing the booty behind a temple. The constable turned out to be Mondol. He was arrested promptly, Mishra said.																								During interrogation, Mondol broke down and confessed that he and the other two had abducted the trader. Mondol told us he had planned the operation. He also provided leads on the other two, Mishra added. 																								The Howrah police claimed that they had recovered around Rs 1 lakh.																								On Wednesday evening, deputy commissioner of police, wireless, P. Ravi, said Chakraborty would be suspended. I am waiting for the Howrah Police to send the suspension papers to my office, he said.

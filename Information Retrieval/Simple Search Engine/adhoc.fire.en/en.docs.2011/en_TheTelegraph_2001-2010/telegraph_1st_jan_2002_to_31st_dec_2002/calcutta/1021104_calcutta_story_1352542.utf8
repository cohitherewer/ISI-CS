				 																																										A three-year-old boy was run over by a Matador near the Gariahat flyover on Sunday evening. The childs parents are pavement-dwellers. The Matador was impounded and the driver detained at Gariahat police station. Later, local residents held a demonstration protesting the incident. 				 																																										The Congress in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has started preparations for bringing a no-confidence motion against mayor Subrata Mukherjee. According to Congress leader Sailen Dasgupta, the move has been necessitated as the party was disgusted with the mayors nepotism and autocracy. At least 30 Trinamul Congress councillors have already expressed their desire to join the Congress, Dasgupta claimed. 				 																																										Malaria has claimed 53 lives in the city so far this year. The total number of malaria-related deaths in 2001 was 42. Officer-on-special-duty (health) Atanu Mukherjee, however, said death certificates, even if issued by qualified medical practitioners, could not be accepted in the malarial death-count unless supported by etiological findings. 				 																																										A CMC team on Saturday sprayed chemicals inside the Shyambazar police station after two policemen were reported to have been afflicted with malaria. 				 																																										ATN Kolkata has organised the Dweep Shiropa contest in Calcutta, Howrah and North 24-Parganas to identify and felicitate Kali puja organisers who follow the pollution control norms. Judges include Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, footballer Prasun Banerjee and Sudip Banerjee, head of the department of environmental studies, CU.

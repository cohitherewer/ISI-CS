The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, December 27, 2002 				 Computer constructs
				 An exhibit by Charlotte  Hodes				 				 				Paul Coldwell and his wife Charlotte Hodes are teachers at the Camberwell College of Arts. Both are painters and printmakers using traditional techniques. They integrate the computer and traditional practice to generate their multi-layered prints. The computer for them is an alternative studio which allows them boundless creative freedom since in a computer every element can be changed. They control technology to meet their ends. Hodes tries out her new concept of creating collage although here she displays only her paintings. These are a colourful cacophony with their profusion of patterns. Unlike her husbands prints Hodes paintings are feminine from their concept to the strong and pretty colours she uses. Coldwell uses photographs and a layer of pixalated dots to produce works that look coldly detached. Sometimes he takes out a laser print and works on it using traditional methods. The exhibition is a must-see for those wary of new technology. 																								When: Till December 28; 3 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Galerie 88

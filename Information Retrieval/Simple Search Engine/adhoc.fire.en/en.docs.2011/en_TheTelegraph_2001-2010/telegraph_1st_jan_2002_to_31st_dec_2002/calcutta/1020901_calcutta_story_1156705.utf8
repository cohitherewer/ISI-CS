 Sunday, September 01, 2002 				 Family rift behind trader murder
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In what seems to be the work of the local underworld, Dipak Ghosh, 30, was murdered in Madhyamgram on Saturday morning. Ghoshs body, bearing a bullet injury, was found on the terrace of an under-construction house. No arrests have been made so far.																								Sources said Ghosh, a grocery shop owner, did not figure in the police records. But we have information that he was involved with the local mafia, said Rahul Srivastav, additional superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas. His second marriage had also created a rift in his family. Police are verifying the family dispute angle. Of late, Ghosh had been involved with a woman and married her without divorcing his first wife. We are investigating if this had triggered the killing, said an official. 																								A few years ago, Ghosh and his first wife had arrived from Nabadwip, in Nadia, and settled at Vivekananda Nagar, in Madhyamgram. After he remarried, Ghosh moved to nearby Srinagar.																								According to sources, Ghosh left his Srinagar residence on Friday night for an outing with his associates. The group camped on the terrace of an under-construction house and went on a drinking binge. The merry-making went on till the early hours of Saturday. Ghosh was killed sometime that night, sources added. 																								Police said the victim was shot from point-blank range. The bullet mark on Ghoshs chest proves that, said an officer. The pistol, however, could not be retrieved. We are also probing why his grocery remained shut for the past few days, he added.

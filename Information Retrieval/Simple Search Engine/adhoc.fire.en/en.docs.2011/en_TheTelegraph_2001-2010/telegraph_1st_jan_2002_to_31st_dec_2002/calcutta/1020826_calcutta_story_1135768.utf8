				 																																									The state government might have made it mandatory for private buses and minibuses to reserve two front seats for the handicapped, but very few vehicle operators follow the norm. In most private buses, seats are reserved in the rear, which defeats the aim, as people have to bear with the jerks. The motor vehicles department should take action.				 																																									Chandrima Ghosh,				 																																									Salt Lake.				 																																									The stretch from Chowdhurypara Lane to Brajonath Lahiri Lane, in ward 44 of the Howrah Municipal Corporation, needs immediate repairs. The uneven surface is causing immense trouble to pedestrians, especially schoolchildren and old people. It is also decreasing the longevity of vehicles. One cant rule out chances of a major accident during office hours.				 																																									Naren Sen,				 																																									Howrah.

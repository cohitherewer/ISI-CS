 Sunday, October 27, 2002 				 Murder twist to death on tracks
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The dismembered body of a woman, who had eloped two months ago to get married, was found on the tracks near Belur station on Friday. On Saturday, her husband was rounded up on charges of murder.																								According to the railway police, Munmun Sarkar, a 23-year-old resident of Belur Housing Estate in Howrah district, was involved in an affair with Chandan Pandey over the past one year. The womans family was not ready to accept their relationship. So, on the day of Viswakarma puja they left home, said an official.																								When Munmuns body was found on Friday, the Howrah railway police took it to be a case of suicide. But later, they changed the line of investigation as circumstantial evidences indicated foul play.																								On reaching the spot, we failed to track down a single witness to the incident. Besides, the position of the two severed parts of the victims body did not point to a simple runover case. So, we picked up Chandan for interrogation, the official added.																								Chandan broke down during interrogation and confessed that he had strangled his wife. After killing her, I carried the body and left it on the railway tracks to pass off the death as a suicide, Chandan said.																								Police, however, are still not sure about the motive behind the killing. We are continuing our investigation, said an official probing the case.																								nHeld for molestation: Kartik Shau, a 32-year-old businessman, was arrested at Phoolbagan on charges of molesting a girl on the night of Lakshmi puja, police said.

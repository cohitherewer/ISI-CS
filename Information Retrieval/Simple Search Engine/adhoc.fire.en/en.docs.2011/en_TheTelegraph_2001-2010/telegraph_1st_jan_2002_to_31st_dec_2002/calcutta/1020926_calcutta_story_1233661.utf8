																								Very few Calcuttans have possibly heard of Anandlok, a residential welfare centre for the mentally disadvantaged, located on the outskirts of the city at Madhyamgram. The mammoth project requires a constant and steady flow of funds. In an effort to help fructify the project, Spandan Art Gallery and The Oberoi Grand are jointly hosting an art exhibition showcasing the works of several established and upcoming artists. The exhibition provides a platform for aspiring artists to share space with established names. The artists works reflect their constant search for individual styles as they break existing forms and recreate to express themselves. The show is notable for its variety in terms of subject, medium and style. Participants include Avijit Dutta, Rohita Bhaskaran, Partha Bhattacharjee, Ananda Das, Sukanta Das, Samir Pal, Sanjeeb Saha, Devashis Das, Kanchanmala Ghosh, Gopa Ray and Vandana. 																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: The Tea Lounge at The Oberoi Grand

				 																																																																				 Thanks to Metro for focussing on Tehmina Khatuns struggle against an educational institution for its decision not to admit her to the B.Ed course (College doors open, jobs shut, August 20).				 																																													Hats off to Tehmina for her tenacity and fighting spirit. In spite of doing fairly well in the written examination, she was eliminated by the Gandhi Centenary Memorial College authorities on the pretext of her not using her husbands surname. Though the institution bears the name of the most secular person in our country, its attitude is not in conformity with his outlook. It is really astonishing that an educational institution is creating pressure upon a student to use the surname of her spouse, though it has been said conspicuously in the Hindu Marriage Act that the bride has the liberty to use the surname of the groom or retain her fathers surname. The obduracy of the college authority has robbed Tehminas career of valuable years. The high court verdict has forced the college authorities to open their gates to her. 				 																																													Due to their whims, Tehmina has lost the chance of getting a government job, as she has already crossed the upper-age limit.				 																																													The government should relax the restrictions by two to three years as a special concession to her so that she may appear in the competitive examinations after completion of her B.Ed course.				 																																													Arindam Basu,				 																																													Saptagram.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Zero to pass by grace of law (Metro, August 22), had Bashirul Shah not moved court, the Higher Secondary Council would not have acted on its own. We have heard of examiners resorting to average marking but this is the pits. I feel sorry for Budhadebbabu, who keeps harping on reforms. 				 																																													Sunita Wadhwani,				 																																													S.R. Das Road.				 																																													lMy daughter was victimised in a similar fashion in 1999. But unfortunately, I didnt have the money to get the grace of law. My daughter, who secured 65 per cent marks in ICSE, was awarded such low marks in her HS exams that she could not get admission to an honours course in any college. She completed the B.Sc (pass) exam with 66 per cent marks from Calcutta University. But without honours, she cannot pursue an M.Sc.				 																																													Rita Gangopadhyay,				 																																													Sodepur.				 																																													lApropos the report Board faces damages suit over marks error (Metro, August 29), with more cases of mistakes in results of Madhyamik 2002 surfacing, the Board officials have become desperate to cover their misdeeds by luring the candidates into out-of-court settlements. It is good to note that there are people like Feroze who can resist the temptation so that the matter can be pursued in court and the truth can come to light. 				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee, 				 																																													Lake Town.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Hostel hotbed in campus conflict (Metro, August 23), it is distressing to note that politics has infiltrated education in such a manner that an institution as reputed as Presidency College had to be closed down. As the matter is assuming serious proportions, it is high time that the ruling Reds ponder over this issue. 				 																																													Rabindranath Kar,				 																																													Sankar Ghosh Lane.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Return of sunshine shadow (Metro, August 27), it is heartening to note that the CMC is planning to evict hawkers from areas untouched by Operation Sunshine.				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																																																				The suspension sentence on three cops charged with rape was ridiculous (Suspended for rape, Metro, August 17). This comes after the division bench of Calcutta High Court slammed the Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrates act of granting bail to them (HC slams bail in deaf-mute rape, Metro, August 2 ). Is this the maximum sentence for an assault by law-keepers on a challenged girl?				 																																													Mohanlal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				awyer finds backers (Metro, August 21), it is unfortunate that a section of the citys legal fraternity rallied behind a colleague accused of eve-teasing. Police harassment is not uncommon but that does not exonerate the accused lawyer, who has reportedly even threatened the girl to withdraw the complaint against him. So the legal fraternitys show of unity for an apparently wrong cause will not enhance the prestige of the legal profession. 				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.

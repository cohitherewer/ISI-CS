The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, September 17, 2002 				 Road rage over runover fatality
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police battled a mob for close to an hour on Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, in north Calcutta, after violence erupted following the death an 18-year-old engineering student in a road accident. The accident occurred in front of Khanna cinema on Monday.																								Shovan Chakraborty, a first-year student of Garpar Engineering College, on B.T. Road, was run over when two buses on route 234 were trying to race each other, witnesses said. It appears the second driver had not noticed Shovan in the crowd and ran him over while he was trying to overtake the first bus, said Shibaji Ghosh, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.																								Popular in the neighbourhood as a sports buff and social worker, Shovans death sparked violence, with the mob stoning buses and blocking the Khanna junction, causing a severe traffic snarl at peak morning hour in north Calcutta. 																								Several auto-rickshaw drivers managed to stop the killer vehicle but the driver fled the spot. The 500-strong mob then stoned the bus and tried to torch a few passing vehicles. 																								A force from Shyampukur police reached the spot, impounded the bus and brought the situation under control.																								Shovans father reached the bus stop a few minutes after the accident. Bystanders helped him take Shovan to R.G. Kar Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. Neighbours said the Chakrabortys had lined up a small celebration for the evening, since they had recently bought a small flat at Barasat, but the death of their only child has shattered their world.

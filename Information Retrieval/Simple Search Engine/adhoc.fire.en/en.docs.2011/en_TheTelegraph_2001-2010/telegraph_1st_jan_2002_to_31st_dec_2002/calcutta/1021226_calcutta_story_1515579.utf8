 Thursday, December 26, 2002 				 Blaze building found unsafe
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Civic engineers who on Wednesday visited the Ludhiana Hosiery Building and Kesoram Katra, on Mahatma Gandhi Road, found that a major portion of both buildings would have to be demolished as the Saturday blaze had rendered them structurally unsafe.																								There was tension at 171A, M.G. Road, in the morning, when word spread that the civic demolition squad was pulling down portions of the building. Work was stopped till the team assured tenants that only the unsafe bits were being pulled down from the top floor. 																								The tenants have asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for a relaxation in building rules so they can rebuild the market, citing the instance of Manohardas Katra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, September 30, 2002 				 To market, to market, to add to the mess
								Rajesh Dugar: Howrahs Mangla hat (weekly market) is a nightmare. It takes almost an hour to cross the stretch of road where the wares are displayed. 																																																													The problem becomes even more acute if any political party holds a meeting on the market day. However, the problem will be solved soon. We plan to shift the market to the 80-acre plot near Duke Road and for that, we are in talks with the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners . The new marketplace will also have a restaurant, a childrens park and other facilities.

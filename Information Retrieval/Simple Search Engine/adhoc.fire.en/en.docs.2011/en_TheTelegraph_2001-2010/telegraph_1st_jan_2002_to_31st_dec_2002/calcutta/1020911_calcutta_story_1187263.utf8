The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, September 11, 2002 				 																				uttam majumdar								Executive chairman, West Bengal Bar Council																																							Out-of-court settlements are a new legal concept in India, though these have been popular abroad for a long time. But in our country, there is a risk of political interference in such cases. The government is encouraging this move. Verdicts of Lok Adalats have been granted legal sanctity this year. There is talk of launching pre-trial courts in the state. I support out-of-court settlements only when a member of the judiciary is involved. Otherwise, the verdict may contain legal loopholes.

																								Bijoyesh Goswami is an eminent singer (Kirtaniya) of devotional music. Steeped in tradition, this elderly singer belongs to the old school of music who prefers to stick to his school rigidly and hates any deviation or experimentation outside the existing tenets of the gharana. His eldest son, Proloy, disagrees and defies his father. He renders his brand of fusion Kirtan, amalgamating elements of trendy, contemporary music with traditional Kirtan. Goswamis youngest son, Parimal, aspires to be a star footballer and his singular determination blinds him to the pressing necessities of his family. Goswamis daughter, Rakhi, however, is very serious about her studies. She intends to complete her education, take up a job and eradicate her familys poverty. Goswami is most hurt by his eldest sons defiance. Their titanic clash of belief forms the crux of this play, written and directed by Arijit Mukherjee. This Naba-Ajantik production is being staged on the occasion of its sixth anniversary.																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: Rabindra Sadan

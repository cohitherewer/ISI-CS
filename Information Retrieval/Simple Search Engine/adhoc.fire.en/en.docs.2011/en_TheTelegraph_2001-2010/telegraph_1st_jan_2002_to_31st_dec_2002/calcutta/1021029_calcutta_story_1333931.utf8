 Tuesday, October 29, 2002 				 Huge haul of high-decibel crackers 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police on Monday busted a racket in the transportation of banned high-decibel crackers from the city to various districts, from Jorasanko.																								Deputy commissioner of police, central, Zulfiquar Hasan, said 368 kg of banned crackers were seized and two persons arrested. On Sunday night, Jorasanko police got a tip-off that a huge quantity of banned crackers was being brought into the city from the fringe areas of South 24-Parganas and Howrah. The crackers were to be stored in godowns in central Calcutta.																								The informer told us that with the crackdown on the sale of banned crackers, the miscreants had decided to take the consignment to the districts. He said a lorry would carry one such consignment of crackers on Monday morning, a senior officer of Jorasanko police station said.																								Accordingly, a police team in plainclothes waited in the Jorasanko area. We saw a lorry come out of a narrow lane. Its luggage hold was covered. Our men intercepted it and directed the driver and his help to take off the cover. We found a huge quantity of banned crackers hidden in boxes, wrapped in tarpaulin sheets, an officer added.																								Hasan said the crackers were produced at a small fireworks factory in Barasat. Jorasanko police have got in touch with their North 24-Parganas counterparts to check the licence of the factory and take action against the owner. The lorry has been impounded. The crackers, too, were impounded and will be destroyed later, police said.																								nWater demand: Residents of Bondel Road, in south Calcutta, blocked the road on Monday for about an hour from 8 am, protesting against poor supply of drinking water in the area.

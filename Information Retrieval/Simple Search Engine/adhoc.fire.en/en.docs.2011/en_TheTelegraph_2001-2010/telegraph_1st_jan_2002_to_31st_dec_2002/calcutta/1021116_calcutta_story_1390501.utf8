				 																																										lThe marks of 2,077 examinees of Higher Secondary 2002, who had applied for a scrutiny of their results, have increased. In all, 19,891 candidates had applied for post-publication scrutiny (PPS) of their results this year. The West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education announced the PPS results on Friday. The examinees had applied for the scrutiny four months ago. The results of HS examinations were declared in July. The upward revisions that have taken place in the marks suggest that only 10 per cent of the candidates who applied for scrutiny had been awarded less marks in their original results. Jyotirmoy Mukherjee, Council president, however, said even though the marks of 2,077 examinees have changed after scrutiny, there had been a change in the provisional merit list published by the Council at the time of publishing the results. The results of 203 examinees were scrutinised on the basis of court directives.

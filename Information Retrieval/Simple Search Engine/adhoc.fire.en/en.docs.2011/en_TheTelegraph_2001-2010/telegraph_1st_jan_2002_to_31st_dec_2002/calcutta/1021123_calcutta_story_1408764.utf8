 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 Vets get set to treat pets better
 															- Awareness, infrastructure boost for canine docs, dog-owners SUBHRO SAHA																								Fretting over the balanced diet for your pet dog? Desperate to track down a diagnostic lab to get the blood profile done? Pushing the panic button to get to your nearest vet? Soon, all this could be either a click or a call away.																								Royal Pet, the pet food division of Venkys (India) Ltd, has stepped forward to improve the lot of the seven-lakh-odd canine pet population of Calcutta. We have identified two grey areas that plague pet healthcare in this city  lack of awareness and dedicated infrastructure  and our double-pronged initiative will address both the issues, says O.P. Singh, general manager, Royal Pet.																								As a first step, the company has launched the Royal Pet Club, a platform for veterinary practitioners, as well as dog-owners, to transact information on the emerging trends in pet nutrition and nutraceuticals, immune-management systems, etc.																								In Calcutta, the company has already formed a practitioners club with a databank comprising addresses and numbers of 140-odd vets, and plans to launch dedicated pathological labs for pets as well as franchisee clinics all across the city. Any vet with a minimum of two-and-a-half years of practical experience and having at least 200 sq ft of space at his disposal, qualifies to set up such clinics with Royal Pet. We will help with start-up equipment and our panel of experts will hold regular technical symposiums and practical workshops to help in continuous upgradation of knowledge and infrastructure, says Singh.																								The clubs website (royalpet amp;vhl.com) will offer e-education and medication advice through a centralised e-moderator based in Pune, from a dedicated panel of vets based in India and abroad. Venkys, a group company of Venkateshwara Hatcheries Ltd, has tied up with two firms from Sydney  Australian Feedrite and Natures Gift  to create a comprehensive database catering to nutritional requirements of pets based on age, agility, exercise pattern and atmospheric congeniality.																								Vets in the city have welcomed the initiative. Dog-owners these days watch satellite channels like Animal Planet and often seek information on treatment procedures practised overseas. This corporate push should give us access to useful information we can share with pet-owners. observes Sanjiwan Ray, a senior veterinary surgeon. Subhas Sarkar, another canine practitioner, feels the club would benefit both vets and pet-owners.																								Royal Pet Club also proposes to set up a nutrition research centre on the Bengal Veterinary Science Colleges Belgachhia campus.

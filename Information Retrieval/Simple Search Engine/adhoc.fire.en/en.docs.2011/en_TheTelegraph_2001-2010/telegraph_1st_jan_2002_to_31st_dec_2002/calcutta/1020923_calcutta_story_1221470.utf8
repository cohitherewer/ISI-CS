It offers updated metamorphic presentation needed for todays reader. The various authors articles display tremendous erudition and the vast amount of academic research involved is, staggering, to say the least. One of the most appealing charms of the book is the democratic range of dance it captures. The latest annual: Uday Shankar and Choreography Special  is dedicated to this great son of the soil who was born a 100 years ago, even if he and his memory had been dead for over 23 years (since 1977) . Coupled with rare photographs and sketches, renowned experts have contributed on the various aspects of Shankars dance form and style. Also, special write-ups on Choreography, which, according to Ashish Mohan Khokar, has suddenly caught everyones attention. And 2001 was dominated and dotted by seminars, shows and even showdowns centred on this question (What is choreography?) The issue showcases choreography and examples of choreographic genius...The artistes featured are: Uday Shankar, Ram Gopal, Uttara Asha Coorlawala, Astad Deboo, Chandralekha, Birju Maharaj, Kumudini Lakhia and Daksha Seth.

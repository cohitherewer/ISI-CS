The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 Its not funny, Mr Advani
 OUR BUREAU																								Whats an Indians attitude towards America? Its where the devil lives, but please take me there.																								Whats a Calcuttans attitude towards Calcutta? Its a great place, but please get me out of here.																								Some politicians and proud Calcuttans erupted in anger at Lal Krishna Advanis swipe: Im impressed by the Metro, but not so much by the city. 																								But one man summed up the average Calcuttans feeling about the Advani-attacked city  we know a lot of things are wrong, but dont dare tell us.																								Somen Mitra, Congress MLA, said: The city has lost its lustre, aristocracy and national status, but any adverse comment about it does not fail to hurt me.																								Usually, its more than just hurt Calcuttans  or, at times, the residents of Bengal.																								Rajiv Gandhis Its a dying city brought all of Calcutta and most of Bengal so much alive that the then Prime Minister had a mini-mutiny on his hands.																								Some people had taken Rajivs words very seriously  if unwittingly  though. On Calcuttas 300th birthday, the chambers of commerce thought of making the city a gift. And what did they hit upon? A crematorium. That idea was buried when it was pointed out that the dying city had just had a bypass (EM) and all it now needed was a funeral.																								The bypass may or may not have been there when Advani had a taste of the traffic  not that again!  getting stuck in one of the blocked arteries. He had to spend hours while on his way to a party meeting at Chitpur when he was not the red-light-flashing deputy Prime Minister.																								If that provoked Tuesdays comment, some Calcuttans are in agreement with him. Painter Paritosh Sen said: Lets face it, the traffic in the city is completely chaotic.																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, at least, wasnt about to take Advani on about what is up his street: traffic. He was reminding the deputy PM about the citys distinct sense of culture. Chakraborty is known for his association with Mithun Chakraborty.																								Paritosh Sen does not expect Advani to soak in the glory of this culture while driving through cowdung-filled (consult Nobel-winning writer Gunter Grass) Chitpur. How can you expect him to look beyond the squalor and see the citys soul we are all supposedly so proud of?																								Calcutta may not wear its soul on its soiled sleeve, what it does wear, though, is Nehrus  that, incidentally, was the first calumny  city of processions. Dont be surprised if a procession is out on the roads on Thursday  and you are stuck, where else but, in the traffic  burning Advanis effigy.																								To his political opponents, the deputy PM has offered an opportunity. Anil Biswas, CPM state secretary, said: If Advani does not like Calcutta, people here have every right to reject him.																								True. When actress Gwyneth Paltrow recently threw British men in the rejects box as bad dates, British men rejected her as unattractive.																								Neither was looking at the humorous side. Here, too, its all very serious. As it has always been: when writer Khushwant Singh called the city a heap of something or the other, Grass a pile of something very specific and Singh again made some not very flattering remarks about Tagore  that one actually had the entire Bengali diaspora baying for his blood. 																								It was not funny. And its still not funny, insists actor Victor Banerjee. Calcuttans can never have a sense of humour as long as Advani professes to be a follower of Shyama Prasad Mukerjee, while he sports a terrible version of an Ashutosh Mukherjee moustache.																								In short, if you are like that, we are like this only.																								Ask chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. He said: I like Calcutta.

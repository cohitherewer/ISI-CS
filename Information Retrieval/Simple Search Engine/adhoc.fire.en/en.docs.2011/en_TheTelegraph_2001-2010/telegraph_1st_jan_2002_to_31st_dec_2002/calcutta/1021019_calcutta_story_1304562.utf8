A man was arrested for assaulting his wife at their Netaji Nagar residence, in Belur, on Friday. The accused, Narayan Sarkar, 35, was caught by neighbours while beating up his wife.

Trouble broke out at the Shyambazar five-point crossing after a group of men argued with policemen over the use of loudspeakers for a pedestrian traffic guidance programme.

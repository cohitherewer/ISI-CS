Wasim is mentally unstable and undergoing psychiatric treatment, said deputy commissioner of police, central, P. Ravi. Wasim admitted that he had hit his mother with a hammer while she was asleep at about 3 am.

Bowbazar police took Saleha to National Medical College and Hospital, where doctors declared her dead.

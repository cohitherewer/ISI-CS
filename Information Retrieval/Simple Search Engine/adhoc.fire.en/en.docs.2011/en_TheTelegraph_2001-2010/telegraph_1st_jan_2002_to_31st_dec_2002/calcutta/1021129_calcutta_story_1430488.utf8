The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, November 29, 2002 				 Bust yields 700 mobiles
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police on Thursday busted a racket in stolen cellphones, with changed identification numbers, that led the cops on a wild goose chase through shops. 																								Deputy commissioner of police, special cell, Piyush Pandey, said the three culprits  Kishore Choithramani, Satish Choithramani and Manoj Saugandh  were rounded up and nearly 700 handsets recovered from three shops in central Calcutta.																								According to Pandey, as the identification numbers of the handsets are changed, it will not be possible for the police to trace the original owners. Kishore and Satish run a cellular repairing shop on Moti Sil Street, adjacent to S.N. Banerjee Road, while Manojs shop is on British Indian Street, Pandey said.																								The three have sophisticated floppies, which they would attach to computers and cellular handsets to change the international mobile equipment (IME) number. It is essential for all mobile phone-users to note down the IME numbers in a diary. If the IME number is tampered with, it is not possible for the detectives to trace the owner, Pandey said. 																								On Wednesday, the detectives were tipped off that Manoj, Kishore and Satish stock cellphones in their shops. We raided the shops and seized the phones. The trio confessed to their role in the racket, Pandey said. They have been remanded in police custody.

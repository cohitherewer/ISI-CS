				 																																										Factory partner Sharda Prasad Gupta and works manager N.D. Betal were arrested on Sunday for beating to death factory hand Gopal Shaw. Gupta and Betal, of Kwality Iron Works, in the Golabari police station area, suspected that Gopal had stolen material from the factory and had detained him in their office on September 21. Initial investigations revealed that five workmen had been in the factory when the theft had occurred, but suspicion fell on Gopal, because he fumbled while replying to Gupta and Betal. He was beaten up with iron rods and left on the floor, bleeding profusely. Gopal was later shifted to Howrah General Hospital, where he died on Saturday evening. Gupta and Betal fled the spot. The factory hands staged a protest and union leaders demanded that Gupta and Betal be arrested. 				 																																										A rubber godown in Tangra was gutted on Sunday morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, November 21, 2002  Letters
				 																																																																				 Apropos the report Cash pinch hits campus posts published in Metro on October 21, it is a matter of concern that Calcutta University has postponed recruitment of 200 teachers due to chronic shortage of funds and the posts are lying vacant for a considerable period of time. It is pertinent to point out that due to such shortages cropping up in the infrastructure, students are being affected. If the government feels that it is not in a position to provide teachers to government-aided educational institutions, in the days ahead it should consider the feasibility of handing over the reins to private concerns. This may usher in a new era as quality education will be provided at prices decided by the market. The government may also consider hiking the fees in order to bridge the deficit. As some of the state-aided institutions are functioning in a lacklustre manner, the government should not jeopardise the career prospects of students.				 																																													Ranu Mukherjee,				 																																													Bagbazar.				 																																																																				Your report Tax the people to host test (Metro, October 24) was indeed disturbing. Cricket is the most popular game in the country, earning the organisers and players crores of rupees through advertising revenue alone. The Cricket Association of Bengal is naturally the most cash-rich sports body in the state, having the capacity to pay off state departments like the police, the Corporation and the PWD. The idea of the general public being taxed to see their heroes in action is sheer cruelty. While no one expects the state authorities to subsidise services eternally, they should also not go overboard while drawing up the bill for the CAB. 				 																																													Name and address not given.				 																																																																				The report Passengers trapped in burning bus at Taratala (Metro, October 22) was disturbing. It was lucky that the trapped passengers were saved. Recently, there was a report in Metro that the government plans to introduce Euro-compliant buses to save fuel and check emission of gases. Will our chief minister take the initiative to speed up the process?				 																																													T.R. Anand,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Defiant steps powered by will to live (Metro, October 24), the positive attitude of Jahnavi Goswami, an HIV-positive patient who contracted the disease from her husband, is commendable. Her job as counsellor for the Assam state AIDS control society will go a long way in creating awareness about the menace of AIDS in the minds of people.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																													lThe story about Jahnavi Goswami once again shows the hypocrisy and backwardness of Indian society. Although we talk about progress, in reality we are still in the dark. It is high time that we started fighting the disease instead of the patients.				 																																													Kalyan Ghosh,				 																																													Park Street.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Free beds for a price in state hospitals (Metro, October 22), it is sad that middlemen are arranging for fake certificates at a price. Some MLAs are also issuing documents to accommodate patients without the knowledge of their actual income. Although the government has formulated the free medical treatment scheme for the poor, the aim is frustrated as people are taking advantage of the loopholes. The need of the hour is hold the people who issue the certificates resposible for their actions. 				 																																													Deba Prasad Mukherjee,				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																																																				Thanks to Metro for the attractive front page photograph of Nelanjana Bhowmick preparing for Laxmi puja on October 21.				 																																													Chandrani Dutta,				 																																													New Alipore.

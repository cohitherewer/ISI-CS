 Monday, September 02, 2002 				 Cop probe into missing gun
 A STAFF REPORTER																								High drama unfolded at Buroshibtala outpost, in Behala, after a bag containing a loaded revolver and spare cartridges went missing on Saturday. On Sunday, the police started a probe into the case. A constable of Behala police station, based at the outpost, claimed he had lost the bag at a local grocers shop.																								The grocer was given a severe tongue-lashing by the constable. The altercation drew residents to the outpost, who backed the grocer and roughed up the constable. An inquiry, however, revealed that the constable was not on duty and was not carrying the revolver as he claimed. There are anomalies in his statement, but we will get to the bottom of the case, said additional superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) Rajesh Kumar Singh.

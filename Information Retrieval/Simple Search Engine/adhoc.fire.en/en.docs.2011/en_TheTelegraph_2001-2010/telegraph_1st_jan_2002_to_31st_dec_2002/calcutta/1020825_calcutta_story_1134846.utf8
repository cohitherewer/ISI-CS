 Sunday, August 25, 2002 				 Action pledge reopens doors of Presidency
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Independent Consolidation (IC) on Friday night withdrew the relay hungerstrike following an assurance from the principal of Presidency College that action will be taken against SFI activist Ankush Sarkar, who had reportedly assaulted an IC supporter.																								Principal Amitava Chatterjee told IC supporters that the hostel disciplinary committee would be called during the meeting to decide on Sarkars punishment.																								Earlier, Chatterjee assured the IC representatives that if they called off the agitation, he would recommend that Ankush be asked to apologise and face a fortnights suspension.																								The agitating IC representatives then withdrew their strike at around 9.30 pm on Friday. Sources said Chatterjee and members of the disciplinary committee will visit the Hindu Hostel within a week to set up a committee to probe the reported assault on the IC supporter. The committee will also recommend what action is to be taken against Sarkar.																								The probe committee will comprise principals of Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration, Maulana Azad College and Sanskrit College, the hostel superintendent and assistant superintendent, the teachers council secretary and senior teachers of Presidency College, besides the principal. The committee is expected to furnish the report within seven days.																								The general secretary and the vice-president of the hostel committee, who are the students representatives, will also attend the meeting on Tuesday. 																								The college authorities on Friday night took the decision to invite the representatives at the meeting.																								Meanwhile, the IC on Saturday criticised the college authorities for imposing an unofficial ban on gherao and other agitating methods on the college premises. A spokesperson for the organisation said a deputation would be submitted to the college authorities to protest the decision.																								The Presidency teachers had gone on a three-week strike a few years ago. Neither the college authorities nor the state government had taken exception to that. Suddenly, the college authorities are trying to put a ban on such movements with tacit support from the state government. We want an end to such double standards, the spokesperson said.																								On Saturday, Chatterjee and teachers council representatives demanded that the IC leadership apologise for the nightlong gherao.																								The question does not arise at all. We will wait for the probe committee findings and see whether the college authorities initiate any action against the SFI activist. If the authorities fail to take action, we will intensify our agitation, said the IC spokesperson said.																								nRally: The state Congress will organise a march to Writers Buildings on Monday to protest the apathy of the Left Front government to release funds in the Congress-run municipalities.

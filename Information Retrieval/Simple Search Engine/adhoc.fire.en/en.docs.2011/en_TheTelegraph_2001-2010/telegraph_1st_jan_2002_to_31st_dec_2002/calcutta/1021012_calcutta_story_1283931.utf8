 Saturday, October 12, 2002 				 Bail plea for Taiwanese 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Wong Ye, the Taiwanese national languishing in Presidency jail for more than seven years, after being sentenced for just 153 days, will have to spend yet another Puja behind bars, following aspersions that he could be insane and hence, a threat to national security.																								An application was moved on Friday before the second bench of the city civil and sessions court for bail and/or a direction upon the jail superintendent to release Ye. However, the public prosecutor opposed bail, submitting that a report should be sought from the jail authorities on the present mental condition of Ye. Otherwise, any release of an insane person will cause trouble to a nation like India as a whole, warned the public prosecutor.																								The judge refused bail to the 70-year-old Taiwanese and directed the jail superintendent to submit a report on his mental state by November 8. We are proposing to move a habeas corpus in the high court under a writ jurisdiction, said David Mantosh and Juthi Banerjee, advocates for Ye and the Brothers of the Missionaries of Charity. The Brothers are trying to free Ye  jailed in November, 1994 for not possessing a valid passport and visa  and rehabilitate him in their Kanchrapara home for non-criminal lunatics.

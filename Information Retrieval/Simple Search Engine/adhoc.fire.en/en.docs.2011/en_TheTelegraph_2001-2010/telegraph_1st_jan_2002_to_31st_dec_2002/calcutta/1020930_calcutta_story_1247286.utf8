 Monday, September 30, 2002 				 Security alert to airlines
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Alarmed at growing incidents of passengers carrying banned items like Swiss knives and blades, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has urged all airlines to sensitise passengers about security dos and donts.																								With the list of such seizures growing daily, the CISF top-brass, in a recent security co-ordination meeting at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, asked representatives from all the airlines to step up vigil and help bring the violation-count down. 																								People must be stopped from trying to smuggle in small blades, knives and kripans, said a senior CISF officer on Sunday. He added that the CISF had just posted 126 more men, specially trained, at several key points of the airport.

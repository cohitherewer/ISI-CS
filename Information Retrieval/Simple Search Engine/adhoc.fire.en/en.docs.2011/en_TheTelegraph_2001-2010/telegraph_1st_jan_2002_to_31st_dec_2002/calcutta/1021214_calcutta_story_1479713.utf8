				 																																										lCalcutta High Court on Friday instructed the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) to initiate legal action against the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) which was making no effort to disinfect the clinical waste discharged by hospitals and nursing homes in Howrah. 				 																																										Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity, Howrah, has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the high court, alleging that the HMC was inactive in forcing the hospitals and nursing homes to disinfect the waste before discharging it in the Hooghly. The WBPCB on Friday placed a report before the high court and admitted that the Corporation was not initiating measures against the errant medical units.				 																																										Traffic on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass was disrupted for about an hour on Friday afternoon after a youth was run over by an unidentified vehicle near Baishnabghata-Patuli. The youth died on the spot. The driver of the killer vehicle fled the spot after the incident. Agitated over the killing, local residents blocked the Bypass near Patuli till 4 pm. The blockade was lifted after senior officers of the South 24-Parganas police intervened. 				 																																										The airport police on Friday arrested a passenger, Sambhunath Sau, from the international terminal of Indira Gandhi International Airport for attempting to smuggle in four bottles of imported whisky.

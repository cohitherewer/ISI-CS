 Saturday, October 19, 2002 				 Patient death sparks trouble
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Trouble broke out at Aurobinda Seva Kendra in Jodhpur Park on Friday after relatives of a patient, who had died earlier in the day, smashed glass panes and furniture, alleging negligence.																								Deputy commissioner of police, south, Kuldip Singh said Niharika Mullick, a 67-year-old resident of Kasba, had suffered a heart attack and was admitted to the nursing home on October 16. She was put in the intensive care unit (ICU). As her condition improved, she was shifted to a general cabin the next day.																								On Friday morning, she wanted to go to the toilet. The nurse on duty was busy and asked her to wait. Mullick began to cough and bent down to spit into a spittoon near the bed. She failed to keep her balance and fell off the bed. Doctors said she had suffered a minor heart attack and was shifted back to the ICU. A little later, she died.																								In the afternoon, Mullicks relatives turned their ire on the nursing home. But Singh said neither Mullicks relatives nor the nursing home authorities had lodged any complaint. They settled the dispute among themselves, he added.																								According to Dr Saibal Rakshit of Aurobinda Seva Kendra, who was treating Mullick, she had died of a heart attack and there was nothing unnatural about it.

 Thursday, August 29, 2002 				 Disney at matinee, Governor for company
 															- Raj Bhavan opens doors for periodic screenings of cartoons for children A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A still from Lilo and Stitch, a Disney animation film, that will be screened for under-privileged children at Raj Bhavan																								An audience, an auditorium and a film premiere, all with a difference. This Saturday will see around 250 under-privileged kids at Raj Bhavans Brown Dining Room for Lilo and Stitch with the Governor.																								This weekends show will be the first in a line of periodical screenings for challenged and under-privileged kids at Raj Bhavan, so far scheduled throughout 2003. The screenings are being organised in conjunction with Sony Pictures and Priya Entertainment Ltd.																								When I met the Governor a couple of months ago, he spoke about how much he loved doing things for the citys kids. With the large collection of childrens films from Disney we have at our disposal, this project came into being, explains Arijit Dutta, owner of Priya and Globe and distributor, Columbia Tristar.																								Governor Viren J. Shah will also watch the film with the kids  this time, from the Childrens Welfare Association  and is also to hand out the give-aways. 																								Different childrens organisations will be invited for each of the shows. On Saturday, Disney is providing dolls of the leading characters of Lilo and Stitch for a few lucky-dip winners. We want to make this something the kids can look forward to, adds Dutta.																								The film chosen for this Saturdays 4 pm show is the latest from Disneys animated stable and is slated for all-India release this October. Lilo is a rock-and-roll-loving Hawaiian girl, while Stitch is her pet dog, actually an inter-galactic thief in disguise.																								The future selection has not yet been made, as age group and profile of the audience will be taken into consideration while choosing the film. During the winter, the screenings will be shifted to the tea lawn to accommodate up to 1,000 children.

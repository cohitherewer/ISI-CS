																								Music, when soft voices die/ Vibrates in the memory  Pandit Jnan Prakash Ghoshs name is synonymous with tabla and his musical magic reverbates in the memories of connoisseurs of Indian classical music. His departure left a vast void and even to this day, music lovers pay misty-eyed tributes to this great guru of percussion music. He had a wide following and his pupils, now established names in the music circuit, are full of reverence for their teacher. Shib Shankar Roy, one of his disciples now residing in London, is also the founder-member of Guru Jnan Prakash Ghosh Memorial Foundation. He has organised an evening of Indian classical music dedicated to his guru. The evening begins with a prize distribution ceremony, followed by a vocal recital by Kaushiki Chakrabarty. Daughter of Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty, this minehouse of talent has a mellifluous voice. Constant riyaz has helped her perfect her diction and gain control over her gayaki. She will be accompanied on tabla by Shubhasis Bhattacharya and Rupashree Bhattacharya on harmonium. Also, a solo tabla recital by young Anubrata Chatterjee is on the cards. The show concludes with Pandit Anindo Chatterjees tabla recital, with Pandit Ramesh Mishra on sarangi.																								When: Today at 5.30 pm																								Where: Kala Mandir

				 																																									The banks of the Hooghly are no longer fit for a stroll. Heaps of garbage are dumped on the path, which are strewn all over by stray dogs and birds. The mounds also serve as breeding grounds for flies. Morning-walkers or those availing of the Circular Rail suffer the most.				 																																									Anushree Goenka,				 																																									Bagbazar.				 																																									Recently, a bamboo bridge on Kestopur canal, connecting Dum Dum Park and AE block of Salt Lake, was demolished by the municipal authorities on the pretext that it was aiding criminals to get into Salt Lake. But the authorities have overlooked the fact that they can also use the other bridges on the canal.Those who have been the worst hit by this move are police personnel, government employees, domestic helps and the residents of Salt Lake. All of them now have to walk two kilometres more, either up to the Lake Town footbridge or a bamboo bridge located far away. The authorities should think of more people-friendly security measures.				 																																									Tuneer Banerjee,				 																																									Salt Lake.

 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 Mishra stress on preventive medicare
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Over 400 endocrinologists from the country and abroad, in a series of brain-storming sessions over three days, discussed various health issues plaguing the city and rest of the country at the 32nd conference of the Endocrine Society of India (ESI).																								Health issues, including thyroid diseases, hormone replacement therapies for women, short stature and the growing incidence of diabetes cases, were discussed. Interaction sessions between endocrinologists of the world and the city were held, too.																								Earlier, addressing a gathering during the three-day conference, state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said societies such as the ESI, along with representatives of other branches of medicine, should come forward and educate the masses on various aspects of preventive and promotive healthcare.																								He said the government was committed to boost preventive healthcare. It has become more and more difficult to make investments at the tertiary level, given the limited resources on hand. But, if a well-planned approach is made, then various diseases can be avoided, Mishra said.																								Representatives of societies like the ESI should use seminars and conferences to educate doctors as well as the people, the minister added. Simple things, like a diet chart in a vernacular language and local issues, will be of great benefit, said Mishra.																								Particularly concerned at the fact that lifestyle diseases like diabetes and cardio-vascular problems will take centrestage in the next decade, minister Mishra said efforts have to be made to control them. I believe these diseases can be prevented to a large extent if the doctors remain committed, said Mishra.																								It was disturbing to read reports about the booming pharmaceutical industry, Mishra said. I dont want pharmaceutical companies to record such growth rates. Instead, we should lay more emphasis on how to prevent the diseases, he added.																								The endocrinologists conference is being held in the city after 12 years. This conference is unique in the sense that experts from the US, Canada, Australia, the UK and Japan are in attendance, said city endocrinologist Sudip Chatterjee. Several critical aspects of endocrinology were discussed at the conference, that concluded on Tuesday.

																									Little gemstone, is Roshnee Jains motto. Sparkle is what she calls the organisation she started to bring real jewellery and diamonds closer to the people. The gal with a diploma in diamond identification from the Institute of Gemology and Designing, New Delhi is conducting her first workshop at the Cosmopolitan Club, from September 9 to 13.																									You could call her, because her love for the precious rock started when she was just a kid, going to jewellery shops with her mother. That was when she realised the trouble buyers went through to ensure they werent duped while buying a piece of jewellery. Now Rosh, armed with a diploma in diamond grading, jewellery designing, and gemstones from the Sindhar Institute of Gemology, decided to conduct a workshop to teach those who buy diamond jewellery on a regular basis the finer points of the trade.																									Theyll all fall for her line, she hopes, when she launches Sparkle, elegant creations at the right price. She has tasted the market, too, during her training at Ramesh Chandra Parekh Jewellers as a diamond assorter. She has worked on her artistic flair since she was in school at Mayo College Girls School, Ajmer, where inter-school craft and modelling were her things. Kathak and folk dance, too, found the 22-year-old joining in.																									According to her is the dolphin, which is what inspired her to take to water. Their speed and intelligence made her decide to take the plunge by age 10, when she started trying out her strokes. She first tasted success with swimming when she triumphed over classmates, before progressing to the inter-school level. Thanks to Mayo College, she was chosen to represent Rajasthan in 1996, but had to bail out due to medical reasons.																									Is what this graduate from J.D. Birla College strives to bring to the residents of the St Josephs old age home. A little TLC is all she can give, so she drops by whenever she can. Lifes only as good as you make it believes Reshu, a firm admirer of Shiv Khera, Barkha Dutt and her granddad.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Guess who can write Hare Rama Hare Krishna at least a thousand times at one go, other than a devotee of Lord Krishna? An examinee of Calcutta University, who did not know the right answers to his BA exam questions.																								The Calcutta University (CU) authorities on Monday showed the answer-script to the media, which had nothing written on it but a repetition of the four words.																								The script was one among the 600 papers to get a zero, that were displayed while announcing the results of this years BA and B.Sc Part I honours and general examinations.																								After a hue and cry about the recent marksheet scandal in this years Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations, the CU authorities, for the first time in the universitys 146-year-old history, showed some of the scripts that had been awarded a zero.																								Another examinee wrote love poems, describing his experiences. He, too, did not answer a single question. One student filled up the entire answer-script with obscene language, while another copied the questions over and over again. Neither of them attempted to answer even a single question.																								Showing the scripts, Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor, academic, said: We cannot give such candidates more than a zero. Students are not going to be allowed to fool examiners in this way. The university has to function amid a lot of difficulties. An examiner cannot waste his time going through such rubbish. We expect a student, appearing for his graduation, to act sensibly, quot; said Das.																								The controversy-stung university, according to Das, has decided to take stern action against all those who have been found writing crank answers in the BA and B.Sc Part I examinations, the results of which were declared on Monday. We have also decided to pull up the students who write such rubbish in future. Punishment meted out can be quite severe, warned Das.																								Sources said the university took the step to display answer-scripts to fob off allegations by guardians that students cannot score zero or low marks, unless they are mistakenly awarded them by the examiners.

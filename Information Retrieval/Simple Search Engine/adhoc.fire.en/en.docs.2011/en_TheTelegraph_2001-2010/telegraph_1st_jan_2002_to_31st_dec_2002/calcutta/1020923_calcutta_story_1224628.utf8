 Monday, September 23, 2002 				 Out-of-syllabus texts review
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Competition among publishers of Madhyamik texts is proving to be cumbersome for students, who complain of unnecessary inclusion of facts.																								Following allegations by teachers and guardians against this, the association of school inspectors  Paschimbanga Vidyalaya Paridarshak Samity  had reviewed a few Class IX and X textbooks. The Samity found that in a number of textbooks of physical science, geography and life science, unnecessary information had been provided, beyond the requirements of the syllabi. 																								The Samity will ask education minister Kanti Biswas and the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education to fix a page limit and the font size for such textbooks.

 Saturday, October 05, 2002 				 Road mishaps spark cop alert
 A STAFF REPORTER																								One person died and two were injured in separate accidents on Friday. This took the casualty count on city streets to six in the past three days, forcing police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty to summon an emergency meeting.																								Chakraborty is learnt to have urged the force to step up the drive against rash driving and directed deputy commissioner (traffic) M.K. Singh to take stern action against errant drivers. 																								On Friday evening, an unidentified middle-aged cyclist was run over by a speeding minibus on AJC Bose Road. He was taken to NRS Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Earlier in the day, a private bus on route 42A mounted the pavement at Paharpur Road, in Garden Reach, and knocked down two youth, who were taken to a hospital nearby for treatment.

 Thursday, October 10, 2002 				 Puja reprieve signal for Taiwanese
 															- Jailed for 153 days, foreigner spends seven years in prison SUBHRO SAHA																								He has been languishing behind bars for more than seven years, though he was sentenced to only 153 days. Now, as the city readies to celebrate the Pujas, 70-year-old Wong Ye is about to get a new lease of life, thanks to the Brothers of the Missionaries of Charity, and may be able to join in the festivities.																								This is the tale of a Taiwanese national who has had to spend the past seven years of his life in a claustrophobic cell of Presidency jail. He could not be deported because India doesnt have diplomatic relations with Taiwan and he didnt have a ticket to fly back once he had served his term.																								Ye was picked up by the city police on November 16, 1994, and charged under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act, for not possessing a valid passport and visa. He was produced in court from jail custody on April 17, 1995, where he pleaded guilty after being examined through an interpreter. The verdict of the metropolitan magistrate, 16th court, was simple imprisonment for 153 days (the period of detention to be set off from the day he was arrested, ending in April 17, 1995), and a fine of Rs 20, or an extended sentence of another two days. The jail superintendent was instructed to push the convict back through the border line within the territory of Taiwan on the expiry of the sentence. However, since Taiwan has no border with India and there is no Taiwanese embassy in this country, Ye could not be deported, nor his passport and visa organised for the plane ticket. Thus began his seven-year jail ordeal, which has resulted in a loss of orientation due to trauma.																								Yes woes could have dragged on further, had the Brothers of the Missionaries of Charity not stepped forward to his rescue. They wanted to get him out of captivity and rehabilitate him at their Kanchrapara home for non-criminal lunatics, says David Mantosh, who, along with colleague Juthi Banerjee, is representing the Brothers and the accused.																								An application for condoning the delay was moved in the city civil and sessions court, which was heard on October 4. Acting chief judge Subir Guha condoned the delay in filing the appeal, admitted the appeal and stayed the order of deportation. The accused will be released in a few days on deposit of security money, to be paid by the Missionaries of Charity.																								He doesnt remember where he came from or where his folks are, since the long and stressful period of captivity has dimmed his memory. We sincerely hope he can be part of the celebrations this festive season, and that might heal his scars a touch, says Brother Subhash of the Missionaries of Charity.

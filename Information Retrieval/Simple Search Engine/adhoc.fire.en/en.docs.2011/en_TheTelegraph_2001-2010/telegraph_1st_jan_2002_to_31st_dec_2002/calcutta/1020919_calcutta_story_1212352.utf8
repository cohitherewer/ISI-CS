 Thursday, September 19, 2002 				 Another suicide on Metro track
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Barely 18 hours after a woman committed suicide in the Metro Railway tunnel between Rabindra Sarobar and Tollygunge stations, a middle-aged woman ended her life on Wednesday evening by jumping on to the tracks at Jatin Das Park.																								According to station superintendent B.K. Talapatra, the unidentified woman, aged about 30, was standing at one end of the platform. At 4.45 pm, when the Dum Dum-bound TD-121 train was pulling into the platform, the woman jumped. The driver slammed the brakes, but it was too late. The body of the woman had been cut into four pieces. It took around 30 minutes to clear the tracks. Services were disrupted for about an hour.																								We have found nothing to ascertain the victims identity. The woman was wearing a salwar-kameez and was not carrying a bag. The body has been sent to the morgue, Talapatra said.																								In July, a railway employee had committed suicide by jumping on to the tracks at Jatin Das Park station. At the same station last week, an elderly man had failed in his bid to end his life when the driver of a train managed to apply the emergency brakes in the nick of time.																								Concerned over the rise in suicide attempts at the stations, the Metro authorities have taken several measures to try and arrest the trend. But nothing seems to be working yet. We have drawn a line at the edge of the platform and announced a penalty of Rs 250 to be slapped on any passenger who touches or crosses it. But what can we do if people are desperate to end their lives like this? a Metro official asked.

 Tuesday, December 24, 2002 				 Dawn gunbattle nets goons
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After a night-long gunbattle, the police rounded up two criminals from Falta, in South 24-Parganas, early on Monday. Firearms and ammunition were recovered from them. 																								The criminals, identified as Bablu Mondal and Bhaskar Sen, were wanted in a number of cases, including the recent murder of a trader in Behala.																								Sub-divisional police officer (town) Subhankar Chatterjee said that on a tip-off, a force, led by Subhash Sen, officer-in-charge, Behala police station, proceeded to Falta where the two criminals had gone to meet their associates. But the alert goons, sensing trouble, started to fire indiscriminately from their revolvers when the posse surrounded them. 																								While their associates escaped in the darkness, Bablu and Bhaskar were caught and taken to their hideouts in Behala and Thakurpukur. 																								Chatterjee said the duo was wanted for the killing of Pintu Bera of Behala. Bera was murdered in August this year. The duo was also wanted in connection with the murder of another businessman in Metiabruz two months ago. Investigations are on to prove their involvement in the murder of Atul Patel, a Behala-based businessman, in December 2000. 																								Nearly three years ago, Bablu was arrested while attempting to murder Jhantu, a small-time hotelier of Behala but was released on bail later. Since then, he had been spreading terror among residents of Behala and Thakurpukur. 																								Bablu drew Bhaskar into his circle of crime. After the murder of Bera in August, the duo fled the area but was involved in petty cases. 																								Only a month ago, the Bishnupur police, on a tip-off, raided a spot where the duo was holed up but the goons escaped by jumping into a pond. Since then, we have been on their trail. Our officers combed several hideouts to locate them but every time, they fled. Ultimately, on Sunday night, we trailed the two and netted them, Chatterjee said. The duo has already confessed to Beras murder. We hope to pick up their associates soon, Chatterjee said.

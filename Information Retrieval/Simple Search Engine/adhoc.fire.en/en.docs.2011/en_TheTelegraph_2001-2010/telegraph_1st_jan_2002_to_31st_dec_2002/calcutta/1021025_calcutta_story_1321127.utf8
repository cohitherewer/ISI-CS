The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 25, 2002 				 Of myriad moods
																								A group of talented and trained artists, all women, was keen to reach out and interact with the masses. They wanted to share their views and sensibilities with art lovers and formed a group. That was two decades ago. The artists: Santosh Rohatgi, Shyamasree Basu, Anjali Sengupta. Sefali Mukherjee, Ballari Mukherjee, Tapati Mukhopadhyay, Anita Dutta, Sudeshna Das, Arati Das and sculptor Uma Roychoudhury, had differing approaches to their art but in their variegated methodology, they formed a commonality of spirit. Since then, they have been working continuously and re-inventing themselves. They have all been experimenting with form and medium, and each one of them has dared to revisit their own styles in order to bring a refreshing set of techniques to bear on their works. Rohatgi gives her realism a new dimension with her vibrant acrylics. Basus abstractions highlight her strong social concern, Ballari Mukherjee assimilates and transforms her feelings into her abstract works. Sengupta remains rooted in mythological tribal magic. Sudeshna Das is a flawless graphic artist. Uma Roychoudhurys bronze sculptures are impressive.																								When: Till October 26; 2 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

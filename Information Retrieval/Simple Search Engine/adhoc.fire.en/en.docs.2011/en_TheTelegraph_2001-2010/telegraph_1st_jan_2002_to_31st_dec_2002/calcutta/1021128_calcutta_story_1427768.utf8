 Thursday, November 28, 2002 				 Lawyer held for stamp paper fake
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An advocate and his muhuri were arrested in Baranagar on Wednesday on the charge of selling fake court stamp papers. The police seized a bunch of stamp papers and false rubber stamps from them. Both were remanded in police custody till December 2, when they will be produced in court.																								In the course of investigations, the sleuths found that Baranagar police had arrested advocate Gopal Mandal, 52, on a charge of abetment to commit suicide last September. A 22-year-old fish vendor committed suicide by hanging himself when Mandal blamed him of peeping into a ladies hostel owned by him. Allegedly led by Mandal, women boarders had beaten up the youth. Unable to bear the humiliation, he killed himself.																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said the arrest was made after receiving a complaint from the district sub-registrars office at Cossipore. 																								Initially, the registrars office lodged a complaint with Cossipore police station when they found that stamp papers valued at Rs 23,000 produced by a couple Somenath and Sashwati Biswas were fake. The local police failed to make any breakthrough, so we took up the case, said Mitra.																								First, we traced the couples lawyer, Sandip Saha. Sandip had no idea that the stamp papers were forged. We tracked down Mandal, from whom Saha had collected the papers, added Mitra.																								Acting on a tip-off, the sleuths raided Mandals house on Maharaj Nandakumar Road and arrested him. We found blank forged stamp papers kept in an almirah in Mandals house. False rubber stamps, too, were found, said Mitra.																								After interrogating Mandal, the investigators came to know of his 42-year-old muhuri, Arup Kumar Das. We then picked up Das. Another bunch of false stamp papers and rubber stamps were seized from him, said Mitra.

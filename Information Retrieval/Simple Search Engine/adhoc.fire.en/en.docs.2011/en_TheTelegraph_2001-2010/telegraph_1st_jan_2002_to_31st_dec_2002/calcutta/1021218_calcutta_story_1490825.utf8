 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 Friends killer in cop net
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rajiv Dey, alias Mota Pintu, was rounded up from a house in Market Street by New Market police on Monday night. Thakurpukur police had been on the look-out for him for the past four weeks, after he killed his friend-turned-foe, Manab, in November-end. Rajiv was involved with Manabs wife, Kajol, which led to his falling out with his friend. 																								Deputy commissioner of police (central) Zulfiquar Hasan said the force had information that Rajiv, on the run since the murder, would visit a house in Market Street and stay there for few days. Rajiv had, in fact, been in the house for the past few days. But the cops delayed their operation because they wanted to get the right man.																								He is not from our area and we didnt even know what he looks like. We got a photograph of his and made sure from our source that it was the same person, a police officer said. Once the identity was confirmed, the cops decided to step in.																								Our source told us on Monday evening that Rajiv and two associates would be in the house that night, the officer said. Policemen surrounded the house, in a narrow lane behind New Market, and stormed the house to arrest Rajiv. His associates were detained for interrogation. We have booked him under the Arms Act, after a revolver and several rounds of ammunition were recovered from him, Hasan said.																								In the course of interrogation, Rajiv claimed that Manab, a promoter, used to torture wife Kajol.																								Investigations revealed that Rajivs brother lived in the New Market area a decade ago and had maintained his links with his former neighbours, who were shielding Rajiv.

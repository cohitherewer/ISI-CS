																								Goddess Durga, as we get to know from our ancient texts, was created by the joint cosmic forces of Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar to counter Mahishasur, the evil incarnate, who was wrecking havoc everywhere. She has in her, the traits of all the three gods  she is the creator, protector and destroyer  all forces combined in her. According to Tantra Shastra, Devi Durga is manifestation of Dashamahavidya, 10 forms of knowledge, or paths to self-realisation. Again, elsewhere, she is Shivas divine consort. Shiva and Shakti are not separate forces, rather, they are complimentary and make one single whole. According to the Puranas, Lord Shiva assumed the dual form of Ardhanarishwar  half-man and half-woman  at a time when procreation was necessary. This form, the combination of Shiva and Shakti, made possible the preservation of universe. Ardhanarishwar personifies knowledge in Shiva or Purush and action in Shakti or Prakriti. On the auspicious Mahalaya fortnight that heralds the Goddess journey to earth, Indian Museum hosts a special dance programme: Nritya-Durga. The programme features Matrika, in Manipuri dance style by Bimbavati Devi of Manipuri Natanalaya, Shiva-Shakti by Samskritiki Shreyaskar, directed and performed by Rani Karnaa in Kathak style and Mahishasuramardini, by members of Shilpee performed in Sambalpuri folk dance and music style.

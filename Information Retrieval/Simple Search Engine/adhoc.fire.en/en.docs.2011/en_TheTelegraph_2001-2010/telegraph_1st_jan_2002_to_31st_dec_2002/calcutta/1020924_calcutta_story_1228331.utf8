 Tuesday, September 24, 2002 				 Route curbs for autos
 A STAFF REPORTER																								To ensure free passage for pandal-hoppers during the Pujas in October, the police are set to impose restrictions on auto-rickshaw movement in the city. 																								Following an order from the office of the Regional Transport Authorities (RTA), the traffic police will keep important thoroughfares free for visitors to puja pandals.																								Unlike previous years, this time we have planned things in advance. We have already started issuing directives to the auto-rickshaw unions. The restrictions will be effective from October 10 to October 17 and again on Lakshmi Puja, on October 21, said M.K. Singh, deputy commissioner of police, traffic, on Monday.																								Singh said autos will not be allowed to move towards the west along Arabinda Sarani, beyond the APC Road-Arabinda Sarani crossing. They will not be allowed to ply north of Jadavpur police station. Similarly, the entire stretch of the Rashbehari connector  from Ruby Hospital to Bijon Setu  will be out of bounds for them, he added.																								Autos plying from Chetla along Rashbehari Avenue will not be allowed to run beyond the S.P. Mukherjee Road-Rashbehari Avenue crossing, while those on the Topsia-Park Circus route will terminated at the No 4 Bridge. Autos plying from Esplanade to Park Circus will not be allowed to proceed beyond the Elliot Road-AJC Bose Road crossing, said Singh. The directives are being issued much before the Pujas, so that auto drivers and their unions are aware of the schedule. If they violate the instructions, they will be booked, he warned.

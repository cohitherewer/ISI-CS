 Monday, December 30, 2002 Sara raat Rabindranath
																								Rabindranath Tagore and theatre are both integral parts of modern Bengali psyche. Tagore not only enriched the literary world with his plays  highly experimental in nature, but also opened a floodgate of possibilities for theatre directors. It became a challenge  a kind of intense cerebral exercise for them to stage his plays. As the year 2002 completes its journey and is relegated to the annals of history, it is time to look back and recapitulate the symbiotic relationship that Tagore and the Bengali stage share. Natyaswapnakalpo- 2002, a night-long programme organised by Anya Theatre, begins with an inaugural lecture on Rabindranath by poet Sankha Ghosh. Young dancer-choreographer Madhuboni Chatterjee presents her ballet, Anya Aami, based on Tagores Chitrangada. The second half, beginning at Rabindra Sadan, titled Sara Raat Rabindranath, features a collage of Tagore plays and story session by theatre personalities. Finally, Srabani Sens rendition of Rabindrasangeet ushers in New Year.																								When amp; Where: Tomorrow at 6 pm at Academy of Fine Arts amp; from 10 pm at Rabindra Sadan

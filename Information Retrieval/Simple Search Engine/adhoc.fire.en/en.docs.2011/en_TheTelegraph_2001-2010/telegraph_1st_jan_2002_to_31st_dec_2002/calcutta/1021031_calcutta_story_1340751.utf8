The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, October 31, 2002  Letters
				 																																																																				 Many thanks for the article Budding heart doctor beats the odds (Metro, June 25) which I came across recently. It was 1992 when my father accidentally got acquainted with Dr. A.K. Maity at Medical College. Though my name was not there on the merit list, Dr. Maity encouraged me to appear again in the Joint Entrance Examination. He coached me and many others without charging us any fees. Moreover, sometimes he provided us money from his own pocket for our meals. He used to say: You become a doctor; that will be my reward. Dr. Maity silently and successfully trained many of his students to reach their goal like Bappaditya, the son of the handicapped railway hawker. There was a time when he and his companions used to teach the poor boys in Tangra slums free of cost. Many of his students are well-established doctors working in big cities. Having become a doctor today, I feel grateful to think that people like Dr. Maity still exist in this self-seeking society. 				 																																													We are also happy that Metro is coming to the aid of helpless students like Bappaditya, who find it tough to fund their higher studies. Hope you will continue with such encouraging efforts.				 																																													Dr. Prasanta Majumder,				 																																													Creek Row.				 																																																																				Reuben Thangarajans feat is commendable indeed (Never a break from books, Metro, Oct. 2). I know a student, Tumpa Das, coming from an economically weak family, who passed Madhyamik and Higher Secondary exams without missing a single class at Taki House Multipurpose Girls High School. Tumpas father used to talk about how she made him take her to school on his bicycle even when she had high fever. Printing such stories of sincerity, perseverance and love for studies will surely encourage students. 				 																																													B.K. Ghosh,				 																																													Maniktala Main Road.				 																																													lIt is true that most students, in their primary school days, fake stomach aches or other ailments to avoid school. But Reuben Thangarajan cannot be the only student to achieve 100 per cent attendance record in school. In the late 50s, I studied in Hare School, located a stones throw away from my residence. I would attend school regularly on foot, ignoring hartal and waterlogging, for four-five years consecutively till the completion of my school education. The durwan used to rebuke me for my adventure. However, I used to get regular attendance prize every year.				 																																													Diptimoy Ghosh,				 																																													Salt Lake City.				 																																																																				The state governments traffic reform report (Old cars: Gas it or be gone, Metro, Sept 30) is praiseworthy and would go a long way in controlling pollution in the city. It would be good if some gadget is now available to save individuals from breathing polluted air. But something less clumsy than masks, please.				 																																													N.S. Ramakrishnan,				 																																													E.M. Bypass.				 																																																																				The joint venture by a voluntary organisation and doctors of Nilratan Sirkar Medical College and Hospital to treat snake-bite patients in the remote villages of South 24-Parganas is laudable (Voices at war with venom, Metro, Oct 3). It is a matter of disgrace that such patients have to travel all the way to the city hospitals.				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge				 																																																																				This is with regard to a report HC tower order (Metro, October 23), concerning the application filed by Reliance Infocomm Ltd. challenging the decision of the Munsif of the Barasat court. We are representing Reliance Infocomm Ltd. The petitioner before Calcutta High Court was Reliance Infocomm Ltd. and not Reliance Telecommunication Company. The application was heard by Justice D.K. Seth and not by a division bench comprising Justice Seth and Justice Banerjee as mentioned in the report. 				 																																													Our client filed an application under Article 227 of the Constitution before Calcutta High Court challenging the interim orders passed by the Munsif at Barasat. As it would appear from the order, the high court was pleased to direct the Munsif to peremptorily hear the main application for injunction without granting adjournment on any ground whatsoever on November 11, 2002, on merit and in accordance with law, thereby preponing the date of hearing which was initially fixed on November 15 for hearing of the application for extension of the interim order. 				 																																													Pijush Kanti Ray,				 																																													Advocate.

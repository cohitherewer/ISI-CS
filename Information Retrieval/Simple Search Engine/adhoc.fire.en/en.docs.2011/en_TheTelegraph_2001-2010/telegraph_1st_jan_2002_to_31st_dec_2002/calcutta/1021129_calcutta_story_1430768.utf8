We made a success out of a liability, knocking on the doors of all major retailers, without any ego issues. Initially, we found it virtually impossible to sell anything outside South Delhi, but eventually, the message went through and we have also kept our post-disposal commitments, which all state authorities should ensure to inspire confidence among retailers, Roy told the audience. DDA is now developing a 10-lakh-sq-ft mall in Saket to house the cream of the countrys retail.

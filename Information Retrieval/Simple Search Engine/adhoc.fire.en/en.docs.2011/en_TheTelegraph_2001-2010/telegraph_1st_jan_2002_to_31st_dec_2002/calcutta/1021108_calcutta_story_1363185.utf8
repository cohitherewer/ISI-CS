The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, November 08, 2002  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The motor vehicles department and the city police, despite their best efforts, have failed to check errant auto-rickshaws. The drivers scarcely bother to follow the routes demarcated for autos. Many autos line up near the Bright Street-New Park Street crossing, leaving no space for pedestrians. They also block the letter-box installed on the pavement and play loud music in their vehicles. 				 																																									Name and address withheld.				 																																									A few days ago, on our way back from Salt Lake around 8.30 pm, some youths stopped us near the stadium and tried to snatch our belongings. They smashed the windscreen of our car, but luckily none of us was injured. Our driver took a bylane and managed to escape. After returning home, we had to pay a sum of Rs 1,000 to the owner of the car. If such is the state of security in the citys high-profile satellite township, one would simply have to stop visiting friends and acquaintances living there. Will the police please restore law and order in that part of the metropolis?				 																																									T.R. Anand,				 																																									Budge Budge.

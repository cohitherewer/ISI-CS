Police sources said miscreants looted Rs 2 lakh and jewellery in three separate incidents across the city. 				 																																										Criminals scaled the wall and broke a toilet window to enter the second-floor apartment of Deepak Goenka on P-20, CIT Road. The flat was locked, as the Goenkas had gone to Rajasthan a fortnight earlier. Their relatives stay in two adjoining apartments in the same building. The keys of the apartment are with the relatives, who open the flat in the morning to offer prayers to the household deities. On Sunday morning, when they opened the apartment, they found the room ransacked and the almirahs broken. Cash and ornaments were missing.

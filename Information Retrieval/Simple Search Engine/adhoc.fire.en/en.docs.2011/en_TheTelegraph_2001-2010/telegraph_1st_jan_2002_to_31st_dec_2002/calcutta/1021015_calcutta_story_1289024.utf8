The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, October 15, 2002 				 Fast track to districts, suburbs
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								The government has taken up a project aimed at strengthening the links between Calcutta and the districts of North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas and East Midnapore to boost moves to industrialise the region.																								The plan includes constructing a flyover near the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, widening the links between Calcutta and the important suburban townships to four-lane roads and building a bridge over the Hooghly to connect South 24-Parganas and East Midnapore.																								Our aim is to develop a network of roads designed at facilitating communication between places being projected as future centres of growth, said Sudhansu Sil, Assembly transport sub-committee member, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority central tender committee chairman and CPM MLA.																								Four phases of the seven-phase Barrackpore-Dum Dum Expressway are already complete, say officers. When complete, traffic will move faster along Barrackpore Trunk Road, they claim.																								In the pipeline and in that order are a series of roads linking Calcutta and the townships surrounding it. When this phase of work is complete, shuttling between Calcutta and Sonarpur, Rajarhat or Baruipur is likely to take much less time, said chairman of Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality Kamal Ganguly.																								The existing road linking Calcutta and Baruipur, via Sonarpur, will be widened into a four-lane expressway, bringing South 24-Parganas closer to Calcutta. Another road between Bhangor, in South 24-Parganas, and Rajarhat, in North 24-Parganas, will get the same treatment, indirectly bringing Bhangor closer to Calcutta. Rajarhat already enjoys several links with the city via VIP Road, and will have one more via the EM Bypass, say officers.																								Kulpi and Raichak (both in South 24-Parganas) will be connected similarly, said CPM leader and member of the South 24-Parganas district planning board member Sujan Chakraborty. A bridge will be constructed on the Hooghly between Raichak on its eastern bank and Kukrahati, near Haldia, in East Midnapore, on its western bank.																								Besides, road conditions around these arterial routes will be improved, making far-flung areas like Mathurapur, Canning, Kakdwip and Diamond Harbour more easily accessible.																								A flyover, costing around Rs 15 crore, starting from near Science City on the EM Bypass and terminating near Nicco Park, will be built. These projects should be ready by early 2003.

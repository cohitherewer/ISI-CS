The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, December 31, 2002 				 Goon shot dead, killer beaten up
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Aftab Ahmed, 32, said to be one of the gangsters active in south Calcutta, was gunned down on Garden Reach Road on Monday, when one of his rivals, in a premeditated attack, shot him from point-blank range. The bullet pierced Ahmeds lung and he died on the spot.																								As Ahmed slumped on the road, his younger brother, Shahnawaz Khan, who was accompanying him, chased the assassin and with the help of local people, managed to pin him down and beat him up severely. 																								Later, officers from the local police station reached the spot and rescued the killer, who became unconscious after the severe beating. He was admitted to Shambhunath Pandit Hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical. The injured assailant was arrested but he could not be identified, as he was in no position to be questioned.																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner (I) of police, detective department, said the attack, apparently, was a fall-out of gang rivalry. We arrested Ahmed in 2000 on a charge of attempted murder. But after two months, he obtained bail and returned to his business, Mitra said.																								According to the police, Ahmed, better known as Sheru, was attacked at around 1.45 pm in front of Jilani Garage, while he was returning home on his motorcycle, with brother Shahnawaz riding pillion. The gunman standing in front of the garage stopped Ahmed and asked for directions.																								Shahnawaz told the police: The youth was a stranger. He suddenly took out a country-made revolver and fired at my brother.

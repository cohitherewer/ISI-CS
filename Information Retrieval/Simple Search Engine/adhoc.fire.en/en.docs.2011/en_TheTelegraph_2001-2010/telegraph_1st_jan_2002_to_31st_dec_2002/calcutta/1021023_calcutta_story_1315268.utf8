The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, October 23, 2002 				 At battle with beans in brew bazaar
 															- New-entrant Caf Coffee Day, with seven outlets by year-end, stirs up competition SUBHRO SAHA																								Pick your beans  Caf Borgia from Barista, Crunchin Java from Aqua Java, Iced Black Forest from Coffee Pai or Kenyan Safari from Caf Coffee Day. The last-mentioned, a division of Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Co. Ltd, is the newest flavour in the brew bazaar, as the coffee war gathers steam in Calcutta.																								We are here to provide a complete coffee experience at an affordable price, says Naresh Malhotra, director, Caf Coffee Day. The chain, with a strong presence in Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Pune and Chandigarh, is kicking off its Calcutta operations with a 25-seater music caf inside the MusicWorld store on Park Street next month and plans to open at least seven big outlets by the year-end, spanning Southern Avenue to Salt Lake.																								The cafes, occupying around 1,000 sq ft each, will seat 50 to 60 We hope to open 20 such cafes in Calcutta by next Diwali, declares Malhotra, on a reconnoitre of proposed business sites. The coffee chain, which is also into exports, retailing and vending machines, hopes to become a dominant player in Calcutta, through its competitive pricing policy and lively ambience. We are 40-50 per cent cheaper than Barista and in Calcutta, our coffee will start from around Rs 10. Each Caf Coffee Day outlet should do business of around Rs 20,000 per day on an average.																								Barista, which has three stops at the moment and recently introduced a whole new range of flavours in town, is confident its Cappucino and Vanila Frappe can hold its own against all comers. We hope to open three more outlets soon and introduce in-store events, in keeping with Calcuttas passion for arts and music, says Sandeep Vyas, executive vice-president, Barista.																								Saket Agarwal of Aqua Java, who had given Calcutta 83 flavours of coffee to choose from, feels the new entrant will further expand the market and cultivate taste for the brew. I think the next five years will be vital and will identify the coffee chain leader in the city. We have always laid store by regional tastes and recently introduced the Flavours of Asia range, which suits our palate better than the European flavours, he adds. Aqua Java, which has eight outlets now, is opening its ninth in Salt Lake. Its a food court brand called Masala Planet, which will have an Aqua Java kiosk. A tie-up with the Oberoi Group will see coffee chain outlets at the airport and inside the Grand too, while another kiosk is coming up inside Landmark.																								Naveen Pai of Coffee Pai, which has become a favourite hangout on Camac Street for coffee-freaks from seven to 70, acknowledges he cant afford to rest on his oars any more. We can match Caf Coffee Day in pricing and range of food, since we serve a whole spread, from parathas to pastas. Nevertheless, they are an organised chain and will bring along cutting-edge professionalism. Others must grow and reinvent to keep pace. Pai, on his part, is planning three more cafes, besides more express counters to stay in the beverage race.																								With Caf Coffee Day even looking at in-store discos and 24-hour coffee shops in town, coffee combat in Calcutta is piping hot.

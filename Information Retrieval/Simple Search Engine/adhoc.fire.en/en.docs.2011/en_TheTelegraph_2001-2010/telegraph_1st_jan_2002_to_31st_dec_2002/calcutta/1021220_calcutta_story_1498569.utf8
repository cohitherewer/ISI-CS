 Friday, December 20, 2002 				 Brothers in net for stolen goods
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a late night swoop on Wednesday, police recovered stolen goods worth more than Rs 3 lakh from a shop in Howrah.																								Two traders, Bijoy Sau and Bhola Sau, were arrested on charges of stocking stolen goods.																								The Howrah police claimed a major breakthrough. Superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar said they had specific information that the Sau brothers were linked with several criminals of Howrah and Calcutta.																								Bhola and Bijoy Sau were running a grocery and utensils shop on Arabinda Road in Howrah. They ran the shop during the day and worked with criminals at night, Kumar said.																								A source initially tipped off the Howrah police about the Sau brothers. Our men, posing as thieves, met them on Wednesday afternoon and set up an appointment at night, an officer said.																								The Sau brothers were waiting when police officers reached around 11 pm with ornaments.																								We haggled over the prices. The Sau brothers mentioned that they are regular buyers of stolen goods. They even showed us a place in their backyard where they stocked the goods, Kumar said.																								When the officers were sure that they had come to the right place, they identified themselves and took the Sau brothers into custody. 																								We have seized the stolen goods. The two are being interrogated and we hope to get information on some criminals currently on the run, Kumar said.

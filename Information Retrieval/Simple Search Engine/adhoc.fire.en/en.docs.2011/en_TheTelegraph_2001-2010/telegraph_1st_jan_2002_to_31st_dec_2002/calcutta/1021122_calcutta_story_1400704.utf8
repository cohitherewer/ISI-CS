The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, November 22, 2002 				 Oh No! Not Again!
																								It is a glamorous production which pans everybody and everything through hilarious spoofs on divorce celebrations and bride selection in the new millennium, a musical look at Mumbais current monsters, airline hijacks and a pulsating 15-minute political song-and-dance extravaganza in the grand finale  Political hotch-potch, Antakshari, comedy advertisement jingles, interspersed with dances, spoofy English musical hits and Hindi film songs. From Caliphs to non-playing cricketers, from Taliban terrorists to Shabana Azmis Water crisis, from George Bush to Jayalalithaa and Veerappan, nobody is spared by Dhabolkar in this flamboyant satire. Written and directed by Dhabolkar and produced by Ashvin Gidwani, the cast includes Dhabolkar himself along with Vijoo Khote, Vihang Nayak, Kishore Pradhan, Bhavna Balsaver, Atul Parchure, Dimple Inamdar, Aamir Dalvi, Ananya Dutt, Atul Kale and Afsana Shivdasani.

 OUR BUREAU																								The government and the party spoke in one voice on Monday when it came to tanners following the Supreme Court directive to shift to Bantala. But that did not stifle the scepticism in both quarters about state industry minister Nirupam Sens claims that everything was in place at the new leather complex.																								Left Front chairman Biman Bose tried to gloss over Sens claims, made last week, by referring to them as coming from a different perspective, while urging both partners in the joint-venture project  the state government and M.L. Dalmiya and Co.  to complete every aspect of the complex. The state government should also think about the smaller tanneries that have not got plots there, he added.																								Sens departmental secretary Jawhar Sircar all but admitted that Bantala was not all ready when he said the government was trying to improve the infrastructure there and meet the leather lobbys demands.																								After meeting representatives of 14 tanners associations on Monday, he said: I do understand that they are worried about lack of power, water and good roads there. Sircar added that the government was speaking to various banks on behalf of the tanners to help them get the necessary finances.																								There was every indication that not everyone within the Front was happy with the governments handling of the tannery trouble, when CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta failed to see anything wrong in party member and minister Nandagopal Bhattacharyas participation in traffic-stopping demonstrations, protesting government tactics to force the tanners to shift out of Tangra-Tiljala-Topsia.																								But both the Left Front and the CPM reiterated on Monday that there was no option for the tanners but to heed the apex court directive and move out of the Tangra belt. I think they, too, realise that now, Sircar said.

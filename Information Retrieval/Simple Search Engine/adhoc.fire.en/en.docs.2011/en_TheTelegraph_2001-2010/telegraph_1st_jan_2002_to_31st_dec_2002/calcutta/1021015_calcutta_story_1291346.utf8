The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, October 15, 2002 				 Expressive use of colours
																								Bikash Bhattacharjee has a very disciplined approach to his art as is evident in the current exhibition showcasing his early works  oils, water colours, drawings and lithos  done in the mid-Sixties, when he was an art college student. Looking at his paintings, one is reminded of the 19th century French master, Degas. Like Degas, Bhattacharjee handles his subjects with a similar ardour and sensuousness. He has worked wonders with the live model studies. His expressive use of colours in most intricate and radiant range of complementary shades enlivens his paintings. Unlike the crusty daubs that Degas masterly hand employed for shaping sensuous nudity, Bhattacharjees dense or delicate strokes are laid to an added impact. Smudged often into smooth waxy finish or laid in patches forming a field of varying tones and textures, his pastel strokes have a transforming effect on each of his subjects naked body. Bhattacharjees subjects have an uncanny glow, tempering the fleshy sensuousness with an aesthetic brilliance.

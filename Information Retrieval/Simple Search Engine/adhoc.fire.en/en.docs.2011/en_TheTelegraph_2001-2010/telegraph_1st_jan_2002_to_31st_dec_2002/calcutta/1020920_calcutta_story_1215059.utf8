				 																																									The civic body has a callous attitude towards reducing mishaps in the city. Whenever an accident occurs on a busy thoroughfare, shards of glass are strewn all over the place. The municipal corporation is supposed to clean up the place immediately, but one has to wait for the conservancy men till the next day. The broken pieces of glass only aggravate chances of another mishap, as vehicles run the risk of skidding. Pedestrians may be injured while crossing the road as well. The Corporation officials can attend to such matters, instead of making vacuous statements about upgrading civic amenities.				 																																									Sumant Poddar,				 																																									Kyd Street.				 																																									The new bus fare charts have several anomalies that need to be rectified. Surprisingly, the fare stages are not the same for all private buses plying along a particular stretch. For instance, the charge for travelling between Howrah station to Esplanade varies according to the bus route. The motor vehicles department should address these faults. 				 																																									Jagdish Kumar,				 																																									Chittaranjan Avenue.

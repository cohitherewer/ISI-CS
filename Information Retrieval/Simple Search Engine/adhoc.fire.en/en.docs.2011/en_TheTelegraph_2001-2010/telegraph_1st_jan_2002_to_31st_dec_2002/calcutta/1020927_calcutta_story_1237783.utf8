				 																																									Cycle-rickshaws aggravate traffic problems in Salt Lake. If the municipality issues additional licences, there would not be any space left for walking, as most of the pavements are fenced. Rickshaw-pullers neither instal lamps, nor blow horns. Besides, their rash driving has also caused several mishaps. Protests from commuters have never yielded any results due to strong political backing of the rickshaw-pullers. The municipality can consider introducing more buses instead. 				 																																									Chandrima Ghosh,				 																																									Salt Lake.				 																																									While on a shopping spree at Gariahat, we had stationed our car in the parking lot beneath the flyover. Strangely, agents appointed by the Corporation charged us Rs 8 instead of Rs 5. The Rs 5-receipt bore the Corporation stamp, too. Has the Corporation hiked the charge? 				 																																									Govinda Bakshi,				 																																									Budge Budge.

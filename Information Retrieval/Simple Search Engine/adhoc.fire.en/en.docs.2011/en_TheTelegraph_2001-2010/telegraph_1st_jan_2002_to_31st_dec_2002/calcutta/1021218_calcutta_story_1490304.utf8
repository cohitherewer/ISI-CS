 Wednesday, December 18, 2002 				 Man arrested from runway
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Jawans of the CISF arrested an intruder near the runway of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport while he was headed towards the radar hold around midnight on Monday. The man, who had scaled the perimeter wall, was spotted lurking near the runway, close to the radars, by an officer of a patrol party.																								After a brief scuffle, the man was overpowered and the CISF personnel grilled him for details. He identified himself as Brindaban Das, a resident of Murshidabad. His statements were incoherent and he could not give us any satisfactory explanation of why he tried to enter the protected zone, said a CISF officer.																								Das told his interrogators he was employed with a construction firm in Bhowanipore. My life is in danger, so I was fleeing. I did not realise that I had jumped over the airports boundary wall, he said. He, however, failed to provide any clues about his enemies identity. Das was handed over to the airport police.

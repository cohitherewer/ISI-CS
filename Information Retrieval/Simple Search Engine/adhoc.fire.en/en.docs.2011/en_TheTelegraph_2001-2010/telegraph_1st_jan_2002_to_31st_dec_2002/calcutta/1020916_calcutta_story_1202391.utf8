 Monday, September 16, 2002 				 Rain spoils pre-Puja sales
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Heavy afternoon showers and waterlogged streets played spoilsport for Puja shoppers and shopkeepers on Sunday.																								Various parts of the city were submerged as the Alipore weather office recorded 23.6 mm of rain. Burrabazar, Netaji Subhas Road, Bowbazar, Amherst Street, Hatibagan, Paikpara, Sealdah, Free School Street, Theatre Road, Camac Street, Elgin Road, Dover Lane, Southern Avenue and Picnic Garden were among the hardest hit. 																								And it left traders from Burrabazar to Gariahat, Hatibagan to New Market, lamenting the loss of one vital pre-Puja Sunday.																								Some city civic officials blamed the waterlogging on the clogged manholes and gully-pits, with both mayor-in-council (drainage and sewerage) Rajiv Deb and chief engineer (drainage) Dilip Sanyal out of station.

Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Bikram Dasgupta, chairman and CEO of city-based IT major Globsyn Technologies, announced the launch of Globsyn Entertainment and Media Management School (GEMS) on Thursday. Billed as the first such institute in this part of the country, the finishing school aims to churn out managers who will effect a change in the functioning of the media and entertainment industry in the country. 																								There is a need for people who can manage various complex issues of the entertainment and media industry. We expect to bridge the gap in the industry by providing structured content through our programmes. Our courses will have a perfect blend of technical and management issues, said Dasgupta at the launch.																								From two-year, full time diploma programmes to shorter-duration, part-time certificate courses on computer graphics and animation, media management, television direction and production and television camera techniques, GEMS will offer a host of programmes. 																								Though Dasgupta declined to comment on the specifics of the fee-structure for the five programmes, he promised a market-linked pricing for the courses. The two-year, full-time programme on entertainment and media management will start in June 2004, while the part-time courses will kick off in a couple of months. 																								Actor Victor Banerjee, who has joined the GEMS Board as chairman of the governing council, was present at the meet. He said: As the industry matures, issues like return on investment, cash flow and borrowing rates will become very important. We need qualified people, who know both the technical aspects of film-making and can also manage these issues, to make things transparent in the industry. 																								Globsyn plans to invest around Rs 3 crore to set up the necessary infrastructure to offer state-of-the-art facilities at the institute in Salt Lakes Sector V. It is also tying up with various production houses and government agencies to facilitate the learning process of the students.

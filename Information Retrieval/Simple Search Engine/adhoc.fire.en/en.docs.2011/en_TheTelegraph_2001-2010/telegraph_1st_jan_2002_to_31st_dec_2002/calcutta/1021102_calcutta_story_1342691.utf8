The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, November 02, 2002 				 Water, water everywhere...
																								No, this is no ancient mariner pining for a gulp of fresh water in the midst of a never-ending ocean. Waterish is an exquisite exhibition of paintings by a young and immensely talented youth  Jiaur Rahman. He is a skilled watercolourist who has delineated various facets of the rain-soaked city as well as rural Bengal during monsoons. The fluid moments are brilliantly captured by the artist. His paintings are enveloped in a misty film, creating a strange magical effect and the grimy familiar everyday world is suddenly elevated to a beautiful, romantic plane. Rahmans youthful exuberance and his wide-eyed optimism reflect in his paintings. This BVA final year student from Murshidabad is sure to go places if he pursues his chosen medium seriously.																								When: Till November 3; 4 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Birla Academy of Art and Culture

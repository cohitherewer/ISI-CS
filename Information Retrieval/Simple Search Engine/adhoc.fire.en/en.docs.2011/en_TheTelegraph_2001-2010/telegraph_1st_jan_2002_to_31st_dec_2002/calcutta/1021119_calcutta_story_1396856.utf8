 Tuesday, November 19, 2002 				 Wanted man in cop net after 8 years
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After eight years, the city police managed to round up Kalwan Singh, 27, an associate of gangster Gopal Tiwari, from Rabindra Sarani, late on Sunday. A loaded firearm and a packet of heroin were recovered from him.																								Zulfiquar Hasan, deputy commissioner of police (central division), said Singh had been arrested in 1994 by the Jorasanko police station on charges of dacoity. Later, he managed to obtain bail and had been absconding ever since. Around 15 cases, including that of murder, dacoity and extortion, are pending against him, Hasan said.																								On a tip-off, the officers of Jorasanko police station had laid a trap for Singh on Sunday. Six plainclothesmen were waiting for him at Rabindra Sarani, said Hasan, adding: As soon as Singh showed up, the policemen surrounded him, blocking all escape routes.																								Singh hails from Punjab and came to the city about 10 years ago. Within two years of his arrival, he developed links with the underworld. When he became Tiwaris associate, he started extorting money from Burrabazar and Posta traders, Hasan said. Initially, the city police had no clue about Singhs whereabouts. By a sheer stroke of luck, we managed to locate him when he hurled a bomb at a lawyers residence recently. The lawyer had promised to bail out one of his associates, but failed to do so. In protest against the bombing, the lawyers of Bankshal Court had even observed a day-long strike, said Hasan. 																								Singh reportedly settled down in the Maniktala area and had taken a single-storeyed house on rent. His arrest will help us track down the rest of his gang members. Extensive raids are being carried out at different hideouts, based on the information provided by Singh, said Hasan.

				 																																																																				 Bravo to the state home department for its upgraded security arrangements for the American Center. Despite the presence of commandos and reserve forces, plainclothes policemen, armed with 9 mm pistols, have been deployed for round-the-clock surveillance there (Shadow alert at terror target, Metro, October 10). While common people are deprived of minimum safety and the pitiable condition of law and order prevailing in the state, crores of rupees are being spent on security arrangements for VVIPs on the presumption of fresh terrorist attacks. 				 																																													Did someone say Asim Dasguptas coffers were empty?				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar, 				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Thanks for publishing the reports Cops turn thugs in city tech hub (Metro, September 28) and Hunt on for rogue cops in Salt Lake (Metro, October 2). The incident once again exposes not only the level of corruption among a section of policemen but also the impunity and courage with which they misuse state-vested powers. Is the salary they get so meagre? 				 																																													Somnath Lahiri,				 																																													S.H.K.B Sarani.				 																																																																				The report Buses burnt in boy death wake (Metro, October 2) where a five-year-old boy was run over is an addition to a series of accidents on the same spot  the crossing of SN Banerjee Road and Rani Rashmoni Road. The private buses try to make up for the time lost in waiting for passengers mid-way by speeding up from the intersection of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and SN Banerjee Road so that they reach their destination on time. 				 																																													Diptimoy Ghosh, 				 																																													Salt Lake City.				 																																																																				It is heartening to note that the government is thinking of holding a common admission test for entrance into all government colleges (Common test for college entry, Metro, October 1). Holding separate tests in different colleges is a time-consuming process and a waste of money and labour for both the authorities and the students.				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																													Lake Town.				 																																																																				According to the report BA questions inspire poetry on Part I exams (Metro, October 8), one examinee wrote love poems, another filled up the answer-script with obscene language, some others copied the questions over and over again. The unseemly gestures reflect how the educated youth give vent to their frustration through reckless behaviour imitated from our bankrupt leaders and immoral teachers.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi, 				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				As an elderly Calcuttan, I was delighted to know that equipment from all over the world and trained nurses from Kerala will be brought over for a new institute (Single-roof cancer care, Metro, October 7). While living in Jamshedpur, I was admitted to Tata Main Hospital and I have seen the dedication and sincerity of nurses from Kerala. I think the state produces the best nurses in the country.				 																																													B.N. Bose, 				 																																													Dum Dum Park.				 																																																																				Apropos the report CU bares the have-naughts (Metro, October 8), the step has been taken to boost the image of a university being taken to court by every other student. But as the opportunity is available only to those scoring very low marks, will the step yield the desired results? What about the ones who miss distinction by a whisker?				 																																													Rabindranath Kar,				 																																													Shankar Ghosh Lane.				 																																																																				 It is good to learn that the state government has instructed the civic health department to step up its anti-malaria drive in the city (Govt prod for civic body over malaria, Metro, October 4). Since cases of malaria and malignant malaria are on the upswing in and around the city, the health authorities should spray DDT in the affected areas. Besides, the people living in slum areas should be advised to use mosquito nets at night. 				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala, 				 																																													Majdia, Nadia.

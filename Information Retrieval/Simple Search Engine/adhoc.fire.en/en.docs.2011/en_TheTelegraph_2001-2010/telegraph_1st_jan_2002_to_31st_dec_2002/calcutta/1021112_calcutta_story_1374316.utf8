 Tuesday, November 12, 2002 				 Clean chit to SSKM super
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The recent imbroglio at SSKM Hospital, in which mayor Subrata Mukherjee pulled up surgeon superintendent Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay for delaying a patients admission, is baseless, according to a report submitted by director of health services Provakar Chatterjee to the principal secretary (health) Asim Barman on Monday. 																								The death of a patient is always unfortunate, in whatever condition he may have been received by the hospital. Dipesh Roys admission, however, was never delayed. After he was admitted in a terminally-ill condition, a medical board was immediately formed for his treatment at the hospital, said Chatterjee. 																								Officers and doctors in the state health department are of the opinion that Mukherjee is raising a storm to cover his own misdeeds.																								mukherjees claim: The patient (Roy) was harassed for seven days even after principal secretary Barman asked the SSKM surgeon superintendent to admit him immediately.																								Chatterjees report: On a request from the mayor, Barman had directed the SSKM head to make arrangements for Roys admission. Barman reportedly asked the mayors office to keep in touch with Chattopadhyay.																								mukherjees claim: On October 29, when the terminally-ill Roy met Chattopadhyay, he was made to wait for five hours.																								Chatterjees report: Roy was released from Capitol Nursing Home at about 10.15 am and admitted in the Mackenzie ward of SSKM around 12.20 pm on October 29.																								mukherjees claim: The First Citizens request to admit a seriously-ill patient was not honoured and he (the mayor) had to personally visit the hospital to ensure the admission. 																								Chatterjees report: The patient was admitted much before Mukherjee stormed into the office of the surgeon superintendent, without prior permission. An important meeting was in progress at the time with the director of health services.																								mukherjees claim: Mackenzie ward is not the proper ward to admit a cancer patient, suffering from neurological complications. It was negligence on the part of the surgeon superintendent.																								Chatterjees report: Since beds were available at the Mackenzie ward, Roy was admitted there. Moreover, a medical board was constituted immediately for his treatment.																								mukherjees claim: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) clears garbage and bio-medical waste from the SSKM twice a month. Hence, non-clearance of garbage for a day or two does not pose any environmental hazard. Besides, the date for clearing the hospital vats was not due when we allegedly ceased work in retaliation.																								Chatterjees report: SSKMs garbage and bio-medical waste is supposed to be cleared daily by the CMC.																								mukherjees claim: Chattopadhyay has committed a serious offence by his casual approach. He must be sacked immediately. 																								Chatterjees report: There was nothing wrong in the action taken by surgeon superintendent Chattopadhyay. Hence, the question of action against him does not arise at all.

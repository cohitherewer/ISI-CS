 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 Teenager found in bush with throat slit
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Narendra Sau, 14, was found murdered at Barrackpore, in the citys northern fringes, early on Wednesday. Police suspect Sau was a victim of a failed romance.																								The police also said after examining his wounds that at least three people had attacked the boy. Saus body was found with his throat slit. The weapon could not be located. The murder seems to be the handiwork of professionals. No arrests have been made in this connection, said an official of the Jagaddal police station on Wednesday.																								Kanad Mukherjee, sub-divisional officer of Barrackpore, said Sau was missing since Monday. He left home in the evening, telling his parents he was off to Chandernagore for Jagaddhatri Puja, said Mukherjee. When Sau did not return till late on Tuesday, his father lodged a complaint with the local police station. On Wednesday, residents noticed the body in a bush and informed the police. 																								The murder seems to have taken place on Monday night. The body, however, did not rot because of a drop in the temperature, added Mukherjee.																								Elaborating on the motive, an officer of Jagaddal thana said: Sau used to work in a barley-manufacturing unit in Barrackpore. Of late, he was involved with a girl, whose identity is not being disclosed for the sake of investigations. A few days ago, a group of youths had threatened Sau with dire consequences while he was on his way to the factory. They told him to put an end to the affair, but Sau continued meeting the girl.																								Police interrogated a number of Saus acquaintances on Wednesday. We are also examining the girls statement, said a sleuth.We have got leads on some miscreants, who may have played an active role in the murder. Sau could also have been bumped off by a jealous lover.																								The local police have alerted their counterparts in Hooghly and Howrah districts. We are combing several hideouts in the locality to round up the killers. A breakthrough is expected within a few days, added the officer.																								nAlumni meet: Aptech Limited, the infotech training major with over 2,400 centres in 52 countries, is celebrating its foundation week in the city from November 8 to 16, 2002.

 															- Bengals first blind woman lawyer-to-be sets sights on Everest MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 Kanchan: To the pinnacle. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								When in Class III, she woke up one morning and couldnt see a thing. Today, on the last lap to becoming the first blind lady lawyer in Bengal, Kanchan Gaba is also taking her first steps towards Mount Everest.																								High hopes has Kanchan, dreams of going all the way to the top. Having scaled 14,000 ft at Dzongri, Everest should not be too hard to conquer. The 26-year-old has a series of firsts to her name. Now all she is waiting for is a group adventurous enough to venture to the highest peak in the world. 																								I have started contacting groups abroad, because the local expedition teams are usually nervous about frostbite and things like that, feels Kanchan, currently pursuing her Ll.M in Burdwan after figuring among the toppers in the Calcutta University BA (Ll.B).																								Losing her sight to glaucoma when she was eight didnt slow her down one bit. I just woke up one morning and couldnt see a thing, recalls the straight-talking Kanchan. But the doctors assured us that it was treatable and I would get my vision back, so I guess the initial depression wasnt there.																								Even when she did realise she would never see again, her spirits never flagged. Most parents of children with disability are either over-protective or neglectful. Mine treated me just like they did my other two sisters, she explains. But the true grit clearly comes from within. I have always believed in the survival of the fittest. I knew that only if I take great risks can I actually gain something, she asserts.																								Kanchan, now an active counsellor for the blind, first enrolled at the Calcutta Blind School and soon joined the girl scouts. She went for her first camp in Kanchrapara when she was in Class V.																								She attended a national meet 																								in 1993 and received the Rashtra																								pati Award from Shankar Dayal 																								Sharma - the picture hangs 																								proudly in the Gabas 																								Sintheemore living room.																								When her CV got around, Kan																								chan was the only disabled person 																								invited to Sussex for an interna																								tional Scouts and Guides meet in 																								1997, attended by 700 girls. For her 																								success in 11 challenges, includ																								ing rock-climbing, abseiling and 																								kayaking, the Punjabi girl won a 																								special award. Jungle treks, Tiger 																								Hill, Sandakphu prepared her for 																								Dzongri, at the base of Kanchen																								junga, quot;harder than Everest to 																								climb quot;, for which she has made it 																								to the Limca Book of Records.																								Mountains to climb Kanchan 																								will always have, but her profes																								sional interest lies in human 																								rights, especially the rights of 																								the challenged. quot;I have managed 																								to break out of my shackles, but 																								it hasnt been easy, quot; she admits.

				 																																									The Coffee House on College Street is frequently increasing the prices of food and beverage. A large section of its clientele comprises students, apart from the teachers and intellectuals, and its not possible for all of them to shell out the enhanced rates. The place is a favourite haunt of youths for adda sessions and the management should reconsider the hike.				 																																									Debal Kumar Chakravarti,				 																																									Lake Gardens.				 																																									I had become a member of the State Central Library on CIT Road, in Kankurgachhi, in May 2000 by paying a refundable caution deposit of Rs 500. Soon after, I found that the collection of books did not meet my requirements. I applied to the authorities for withdrawing my membership in September 2000. But despite several verbal and written reminders, nothing was done. I also met the deputy director of the Directorate of Library Services at Bikash Bhawan, Salt Lake, but I am yet to receive the caution money.

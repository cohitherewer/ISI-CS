 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two persons were killed and two seriously injured when a Maruti and a truck collided on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass early on Tuesday. 																								The accident took place around 5.30 am in the Mathpukur area, on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Park Circus and Ballygunge connectors. Sources said the four occupants of the Maruti were heading towards Howrah station when a speeding lorry, loaded with logs, collided with it. Poor visibility was cited as the initial reason of the mishap. The truck has been impounded.																								Residents, on hearing the crash, rushed to the spot and extricated the occupants from the badly-mangled Maruti. Additional superintendent of police, industrial, Rajesh Kumar Singh, said the deceased were later identified as Amit Kumar Bose, 25, and Dulal Biswas, 32, driver of the Maruti. Both were residents of Beleghata. 																								The injured have been identified as Surajit Bhaduri and Mousumi Ganguly, who were later admitted to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition. The driver of the truck fled the spot.																								Traffic was diverted following the accident. Later, an irate mob tried to put up a roadblock on the Bypass but the Tiljala police, which had rushed to the spot, prevented them from doing so. Sources said the patch near the two connectors has seen a spurt in road accidents, despite Tiljala police station being located nearby. We have often requested the authorities for a morning patrol in the area but nothing has been done about it. Accidents like this are on the rise in the area because of such apathy, complained a resident.																								 Additional superintendent Singh, however, was of the opinion that bad light was responsible for the collision. Visibility remains extremely poor during winter mornings on the Bypass. The early morning fog makes driving quite hazardous. Drivers should be more careful during this time of the day, he added.																								nBook fair: A book fair in Sonarpur, inaugurated by film personality Soumitra Chatterjee, will continue till December 8. There are more than 70 stalls in the fair. Organisers Sonarpur Club Thana Samannay Sammilani claimed the fair has evoked a good response.

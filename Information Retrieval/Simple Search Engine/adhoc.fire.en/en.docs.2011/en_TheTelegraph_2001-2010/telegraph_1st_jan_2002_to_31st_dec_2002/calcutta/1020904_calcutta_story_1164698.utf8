 Wednesday, September 04, 2002 				 Youth held for bank fraud
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A doctor lost his chequebook in Chitpore, north Calcutta, on November 22, 2001. Nine months later, the wife of an NRI found herself behind bars when she deposited a cheque from the stolen book at a bank in Behala. On Monday, a former teacher of a well-known school was arrested when she went to the same bank to withdraw money, using another cheque from the same book.																								After preliminary investigations, the police are convinced that the women are innocent and were actually conned by a youth, Avijit Das. He was tracked down at Liluah on Tuesday and rounded up.																								Das admitted to stealing the chequebook from the doctor and duping people of thousands, additional superintendent of police, Rajesh Singh, said on Tuesday. 																								In his FIR at the Behala police station, Samir Bose, senior manager of the bank on Brahmo Samaj Road, said that on August 14 a middle-aged woman deposited a cheque for Rs 1,06,000 for withdrawal. Bose immediately notified the police and the woman was detained.																								During interrogation, the woman told the sleuths that a friend had recently introduced her to Das, who runs a private firm and lends money to women, at a negotiable rate of interest. 																								When the woman approached Das, he asked for a processing fee and an initial deposit of Rs 10,000 following which he disbursed a cheque for Rs 1,06,000. While writing out the cheque, Das forged the doctors signature. When the woman deposited the cheque, the bank manager became suspicious and informed us, said an officer of Behala police station. The woman is presently out on bail.

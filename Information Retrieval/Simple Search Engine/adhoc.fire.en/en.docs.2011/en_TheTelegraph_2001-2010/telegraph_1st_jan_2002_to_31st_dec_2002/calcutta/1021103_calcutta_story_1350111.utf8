The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, November 03, 2002 				 Travel agent held for fraud
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A proprietor of a travel agency was arrested from her BBD Bag office on Saturday on charges of duping a group of tourists. She was produced in court and remanded in police custody.																								Zulfiquar Hasan, deputy commissioner of police, central division, said the travel agency had advertised in various newspapers just before the Pujas about a trip to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands for Rs 5,000. According to the advertisement, the package included the travel fare and charges for food and accommodation.																								Sixteen people registered for the tour and paid the full amount before leaving the city on October 24. Tilak Moitra, a tour co-ordinator, was sent with them, Hasan said.																								On reaching their destination on October 28, the tourists found that there were no arrangements for either lodging or food. The travellers were not in a position to return. They booked a hotel to stay on till their relatives sent them money, he added.																								Moitra rang up his Calcutta residence and narrated the incident to his wife Shampa. She lodged a complaint with the Hare Street police station. On the basis of the complaint, we picked up a woman from her BBD Bag office. Now we are looking for another person who may have played a role in organising the tour, added Hasan.																								nMalnutrition report: All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health has prepared a document on malnutrition, especially among children and pregnant women. The document will be released by Union health minister Shatrughan Sinha on November 8.

 Saturday, December 07, 2002 				 Risky roof for civic staff
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), quick to issue notices asking residents to vacate unsafe buildings, has housed more than 200 of its employees in a structure that is a stones throw from the civic headquarters but could crumble down any time.																								Marxist councillor Provakar Mondol met mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Thursday and urged him to take steps for the safety of the employees allotted quarters in the building. Either the mayor should repair the structure immediately or allot them quarters elsewhere, Mondol said. 																								According to assistant director of conservancy Swapan Mahapatra, about 170 sweepers posted in New Market have been allotted quarters in the dilapidated building. Admitting that the building was not fit for habitation, Mahapatra said the former CPM-led board had once taken an estimate but backed out as the repairs called for an investment of more than a crore. 																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee had directed the conservancy chief engineer Arun Sarkar to search for alternative accommodation for the employees living on the Korabardan campus, between Free School Street and New Market. The conservancy department said the quarters could be shifted to the new buildings in the Entally workshop or on Galiff Street, constructed to rehabilitate hawkers evicted from the Hatibagan-Shyambazar belt during Operation Sunshine.

 SANJAY MANDAL																								With Salt Lakes Sukantanagar colony continuing to suffer due to lack of civic amenities, the residents blame the urban development (UD) department for their plight. And after a series of letters to the UD officials from the local councillor failing to evoke any response from the authorities, the residents are now planning to approach the urban development minister.																								We want either the department or Bidhannagar Municipality to take up development of Sukantanagar, asserted Ramesh Bar, CPM councillor of ward 22. More than 20,000 people live in the area, located on the Salt Lake Bypass. They were originally residents of Duttabad but were rehabilitated here after their land was acquired by the government for the Salt Lake stadium. Lutheran World Service was given the contract for building houses on the one-and-a-half cottah plot in Sukantanagar under the rehabilitation scheme. On 11 November 1979, the residents were handed over the plot. Although the municipality took over Salt Lake in 1995, Sukantanagar remained with the UD department.																								The civic body, on its part, want to take over the colony but it wants the UD department to finish the infrastructure jobs. The department has requested us to take over the roads and other infrastructure of Sukantanagar. But we have urged them in turn to complete the necessary repairs and other works. We will take over Sukantanagar only after that, said Dilip Gupta, Salt Lake municipality chairman.

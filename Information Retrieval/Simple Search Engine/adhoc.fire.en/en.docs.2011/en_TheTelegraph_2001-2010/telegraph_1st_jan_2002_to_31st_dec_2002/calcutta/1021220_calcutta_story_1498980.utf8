				 																																										lTwo waitlisted passengers were arrested at the city airport for falsely claiming to have confirmed tickets and then making their way to the check-in counter of Indian Airlines. Apparently, they had stuck little pieces of paper, similar to the stickers that are put on air tickets, with the word ok written on them. This fooled the securitymen on duty at the main entrance to the airport building and they allowed the two passengers to make their way to the check-in counter. While they were waiting at the counter, a few security personnel became suspicious and got their tickets verified by airlines officials, who confirmed that they were waitlisted.

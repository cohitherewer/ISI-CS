 A STAFF REPORTER																								Students and teachers of the visual arts faculty of Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) will hold an art fair on their B.T. Road campus to raise funds for the departments poor and meritorious students.																								This is the first time that the fair, named Aban Mela, will be held on the BT Road campus. Earlier, the organisers would hold the fair on the Jorasanko campus (Thakurbari), in central Calcutta. 																								Since the faculty of visual arts is housed on the BT Road campus, the two-day fair will be held there from December 19.																								Last year, the fair organisers had earned a profit of Rs 1.5 lakh and the money was deposited in the Students Aid Fund (SAD) for poor and meritorious students. 																								This time, too, we plan to hand over the money we will earn to SAD, said Anindya Pandit, one of the organisers and a teacher of the painting department.																								The organisers take a loan of Rs 20,000 from the university for holding the fair and repay it with interest after its completion. 																								The organisers are very sincere in repaying the loan they take every year for holding the fair, said a senior finance department official of the university.																								Different types of terracota figurines, glass-work, lampshades, dolls made of paper pulp and greetings cards made by students of the visual arts faculty are among the items to be sold at the fair over the two days. 																								We want to interact with the common people and we feel this fair will help us reach out to them through our works, said organiser Pandit.																								However, some members of the visual arts faculty feel that the fair this year may not attract as large an audience as earlier because of the shift in venue. 																								Many people would visit the fair when it was being organised at the Jorasanko Thakurbari, which is a major tourist spot. But we fear we may not get the same volume of spectators as in the previous years as the venue is a little out of the way from central Calcutta, said a faculty official.

 Thursday, November 14, 2002 				 Twin heists by day rock trade hub
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Armed goons stormed two offices in the business hub of Burrabazar on Wednesday afternoon and decamped with Rs 1.6 lakh. No arrests had been made till late on Wednesday.																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said four youths first raided the Armenian Street office of a courier service company around 3.45 pm. Three of the goons entered the parcel room on the first floor, while another stood guard, said Mitra.																								The three snatched the key of the cash-box from the manager and looted Rs 50,000. They warned the employees not to raise an alarm.																								The gangsters then targeted the office of a jute supplier on the same floor. Three youths, brandishing country-made revolvers, entered the cash section. They locked the employees in a room and directed the cashier to open the locker, where they found Rs 1.10 lakh, said Mitra.																								They stuffed the cash into a gunny bag and bolted the main door from outside before fleeing the spot. The employees of both the offices then started shouting for help. Residents of neighbouring buildings and policemen patrolling the area rushed to the spot. Burrabazar police station was alerted. Later, officials from the detective department reached the site to probe the twin heists.																								The gangsters appear to have had specific information about the money, that had been withdrawn from the bank at both the offices. It is yet to be verified whether any of the employees had tipped off the goons. They are being interrogated to check that angle, said Mitra.

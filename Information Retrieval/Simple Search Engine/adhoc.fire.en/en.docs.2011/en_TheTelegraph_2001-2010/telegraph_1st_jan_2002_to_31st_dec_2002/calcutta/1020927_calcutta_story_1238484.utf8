 Friday, September 27, 2002 				 Ornament haul in forest dump
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sleuths from the city had to travel deep into a forest in Orissa to locate a box of ornaments, worth more than Rs 3 lakh. Officials probing the case finally found the booty, hidden in a pit in the forest on Thursday. Two people were picked up and remanded in custody.																								According to the police, on August 6, gold merchant Biswanath Ghosh had gone to a workshop on B.B. Ganguly Street, near Sealdah, and handed over a few ornaments to a worker, Vidyadhar Das, for polishing. The next day, when Ghosh went to get the jewellery back, Das was missing, said Timir Bhattacharya, officer-in-charge, Muchipara police station.																								On the basis of Ghoshs complaint, the police interrogated Das colleagues. We sent a team to Das ancestral home at Ghushuri, in the Bhadrak district. But the officers could not locate him there, said Bhattacharya, adding: Before leaving the village, we planted an informer to keep a lookout for Das. We would keep in touch with the informer regularly.																								The Muchipara police got the first lead when the informer sent a message that Das had links with a local youth, called Brinda Sau. Soon, we went to Ghushuri and picked up Sau for questioning. In course of the interrogation, Sau broke down and disclosed that Das was holed up in a place near Bhubaneswar, added Bhattacharya.																								Officers Niladri Roy and B.C. Kar went to Bhubaneswar and managed to locate Das. He was sleeping on the pavement, clad in rags, impersonating a tramp. Initially, he refused to admit that he had stolen the ornaments. Later, he confessed that he kept the booty in the nearby Bramhanipara forest, from where we retrieved the ornaments, said Bhattacharya. 																								Das had even sold a few ornaments. We are trying to locate the shops and customers who bought the stolen booty from him, added Bhattacharya.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, December 18, 2002  Calcutta Column
 
	Winter is the season for migratory birds of all feathers  to flock to Calcutta. But they are at risk from some  unscrupulous and greedy people who regularly fly kites  around the Alipore zoo. Their flying lines have fish  hooks attached which entangles or hurts the birds in  flight. Some others use catapole to take aim at these  creatures while they fly in beautiful formations at  low altitudes just before settling down in the zoo lake.  Unless this cruel practice is put an end to, the migratory  birds will stop coming to Calcutta Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum.  
	The other day, I went to a concert of Jagjit Singh at  Nazrul Manch and was appalled by a two-km long queue at  the gate. The programme was sheduled to start at 6 pm.  Nazrul Manch has five entry gates but only one small gate  was opened at 5.30 pm for the 5,000-strong audience, comprising  mostly aged persons. The queue moved at a snails  pace for about an hour. This reflects sheer mismanagement. Babulal Chandak, Salkia, Howrah.

 Tuesday, September 24, 2002 				 Introducing Meena
																								Meena of Unicef came into being in 1991. Since then she has been perkily travelling to different parts of South-East Asia, meeting people and solving their problems amicably. Meena is now recognised as a mascot for the girl child who is ever busy promoting girls development, education, health and more broadly, childrens right and social developments. Prayasam, a city-based NGO will celebrate Meena Day today by introducing Meena to the underprivileged children of Rishi Aurobindo Colony (RAC), Ultadanga, Prayasams operational area. Most importantly, Meena now joins forces with the group of children who have already been working as Area Health Minders in RAC and adjoining areas. An action plan was chalked to observe Meena Day in a very special and effective way. Accordingly, a three-day edutainment programme for children began on September 20. Around 400 participants were divided into four blocks and each block presented Meena sessions (workshops) through skits, story-making sessions, impromptu role-plays, flash-card demonstrations and Meena video sessions. The programme culminates today with role plays. muppet shows on the existing burning issues of RAC, discrimination against girl child, ill effects of early marriage, dowry problems, eve teasing, ignorance of hygiene issues, substance abuse etc, Meena quiz and finally an annual activity profile to control the problems.

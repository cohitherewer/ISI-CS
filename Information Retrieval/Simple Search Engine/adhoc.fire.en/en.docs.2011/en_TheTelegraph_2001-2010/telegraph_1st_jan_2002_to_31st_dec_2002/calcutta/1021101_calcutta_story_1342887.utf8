				 																																									The horns of two-wheelers, cars and other commercial vehicles produce high-decibel sound. Honking, if one is exposed to it for long, can cause partial deafness, breathing problems and aggravate heart ailments. The government must take immediate steps to check this menace. The ideal move would be a ban on the production and use of loud horns. A standard decibel limit must be set for all automobile companies and any flouting of the rule should draw a penalty. 				 																																									Manish Agarwal,				 																																									New Alipore.				 																																									The intersection of APC Road and Arabinda Sarani, near Khanna cinema, has become an extremely accident-prone zone. Traffic from all directions converges in front of the hall creating utter confusion for the pedestrians. With the rise in the number of vehicles and hawkers occupying a large portion of the pavements, one may be dragged into a mishap while negotiating the incessant traffic flow.				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Lake Town.

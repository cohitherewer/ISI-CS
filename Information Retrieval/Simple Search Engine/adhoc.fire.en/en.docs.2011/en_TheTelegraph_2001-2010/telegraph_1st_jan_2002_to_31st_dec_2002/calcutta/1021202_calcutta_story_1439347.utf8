The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, December 02, 2002 				 Flyovers mired in land mess
				 	 ALAPAN BANDYOPADHYAY, district magistrate, South 24-Parganas, met readers of The Telegraph at the Zilla Parishad conference hall. Participants included Sanjit Roychowdhury, Subrata Ghosh, Sukumar Debnath, Deepak Bhattacharya, Sunil Kumar Pal, Joydeb Ghosh, Arup Ratan Mukherjee, Probir Biswas, Arup Mukherjee, Dilip Ganguly, Kalyan Sengupta, Lalit Mohan Tyagi, Subha Pramanik, Bejoy Mukherjee, Chhatradhar Das, Jitendranath Sapui, Sudip Kumar Khanna, Karun De and Priyabrata De				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Arup Ratan Mukherjee: What is the status of the Lake Gardens and Bondel Gate flyovers? 																																																			In both cases, land acquisition is complete. To expedite the projects, local MLAs and political leaders are working round the clock. It is expected that both will be ready in a few years.																																																									

Probir Biswas: How far has the proposal for a flyover at Taratala advanced?																																																			The project is under serious consideration of the government. However, unlike the other two at Lake Gardens and Bondel Gate, there is no land-acquisition problem.																																																	

Sanjit Roychowdhury: A stretch of Diamond Harbour Road, near the Behala tram depot, remains choked with auto-rickshaws. The footpaths and bus-stop sheds are occupied by hawkers. As a result, vehicles and pedestrians can hardly move.																																																			There is no denying that traffic in Behala and Thakurpukur has increased manifold after the expansion of Diamond Harbour Road. To bring discipline in the movement of traffic, there should be unanimity between the public and political parties. In addition to that, traffic policing in the suburbs needs to be improved. Recently, I and the superintendent of police held a meeting with the sub-divisional officer and public works department officials to look for a solution. Some ideas did evolve, but most of them were expensive. We are trying to work out a solution as early as possible. 																																																									

Deepak Bhattacharya: I am a resident of Jayshree Park, in Behala. We have no streetlights.																																																			Every road should be lit after evening. It is looked after by the local authorities. I shall see if the problem can be rectified. 																																																									

Sunil Kumar Pal: A number of anti-social activities are rampant on Prince Anwar Shah Road. Also, congestion at the intersection slows down traffic.																																																			Regarding anti-social activities, I shall talk to the superintendent of police so that policing can be increased. 																																																											To speed up traffic on Prince Anwar Shah Road, we have acquired some land that will be handed over to the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority for the necessary construction work. We hope work will start within a year or two.																																																									

Joydeb Ghosh: Garden Reach state general hospital is languishing though a large number of people are dependent on it. 																																																			Facilities are poor in a few state general hospitals. The government is working on a revamp. 																																																									

Joydeb Ghosh: A large portion of Prince Anwar Shah Road is occupied by hawkers. Is there any solution to the problem?																																																			Evicting hawkers requires not only government effort but also public awareness. I shall see what can be done.																																																									

Subrata Ghosh: In Bansdroni, in the Regent Park area, there is no medicine shop that remains open round the clock.																																																			A round-the-clock medicine shop is an absolute necessity. I shall see if an arrangement can be made.																																																									

Dilip Ganguly: What happened to the project for widening the road between Bagha Jatin to Garia and Tollygunge to Garia? 																																																			The project is on our agenda. Work will be taken up only after a proper survey.																																																									

Sukumar Debnath: The drainage system in Thakurpukur and Behala is abysmal.																																																			The drainage system of these areas were neglected for a long time. Improvements are in progress. The problem will ease after funds arrive from the Asian Development Bank.

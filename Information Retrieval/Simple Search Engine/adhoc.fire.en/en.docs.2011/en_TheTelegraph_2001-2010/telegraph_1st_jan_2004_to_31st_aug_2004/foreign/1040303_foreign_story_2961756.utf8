 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 US invite to HK leader angers China
																								Hong Kong, March 2 (Reuters): China warned the US today against meddling in its affairs after learning the US Senate had invited a leading Hong Kong Opposition politician to report on the fight for more democracy in the city.																								The Hong Kong issue is Chinas internal affairs. China firmly opposes interference by any foreign country, foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told a news briefing in Beijing in response to a question about a visit to the US by veteran Hong Kong democracy activist Martin Lee.																								Lees planned visit comes amid Beijings increasingly harsh campaign to silence demands for more voting rights in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.																								China fears that such demands could spread to the mainland or loosen its grip on Hong Kong. Lee and other pro-democracy politicians have in the past been accused of being unpatriotic by going overseas to talk about Hong Kongs democratic aspirations.My biggest ambition is not to go to the USA or to Europe, but to Beijing. And if invited, I would immediately forget about this trip and go to Beijing first, Lee, who has for years been denied a China visa, told a news conference today. It is important for them to understand that nobody in Hong Kong wants independence, absolutely none, and that there is nothing to fear even if the Democratic Party and our allies were to win the next election, said Lee.

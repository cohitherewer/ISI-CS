(Reuters,AFP)																								Panyola (Pakistan), June 28 (Reuters): The distraught mother of a Pakistani man kidnapped in Iraq and threatened with execution begged his captors today to release him, saying he had done nothing wrong.																								Fighting back tears, Saeeda Jehan said she did not own a television, and only found out about Amjad Hafeezs capture when relatives informed her and showed her the video footage broadcast by Pakistani channels.																								Hell descended on me when I heard the news, she said at her sisters house in the scenic, mountain village of Panyola, located in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, 70 km northeast of the capital Islamabad.																								I could not think straight.																								Wearing a salwar kameez and a dupatta over her head, the 45-year-old appealed to Hafeezs captors to set him free.																								I appeal to the captors to release him in the name of humanity, she cried, as male relatives sought to comfort her by saying her son would be freed.																								They are Muslims and we are also Muslims, she said, speaking in Pahari, a dialect of Punjabi spoken by people in eastern Pakistan.They have mothers too; they should feel the pain and agony of a mother and release him.																								Al Arabiya television aired footage of Hafeez and his captors yesterday. Four masked men stood behind the crouching Pakistani, who displayed an identity card from American firm Kellogg, Brown and Root, which works with the US military.																								The kidnappers said they would behead the captive if Iraqi prisoners being held in jails, including Baghdads Abu Ghraib, were not released.																								The hostage also made a plea to Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in the US war on terror, to shut down the Pakistani embassy in Iraq.																								Hafeezs uncle, Mohammad Razzaq Khan, said Hafeez was divorced and had three sisters and a brother. 																								He is the eldest son and the sole breadwinner for his family, Khan said in Rawalpindi.																								Pakistan said it would not bow to the demands of the captors, who said they seized Hafeez in Balad, north of Baghdad. 																								US Marine abducted																								Al Jazeera television said a group calling itself the Islamic Response Movement, the security wing of the 1920 Revolution Brigades, had kidnapped a US Marine after luring him from an American base.																								Yesterdays brief video showed a blindfolded man dressed in camouflage sitting in a chair with a hand holding a sword above his head.																								 A Marine Corps identity card named him as Wassef Ali Hassoun.

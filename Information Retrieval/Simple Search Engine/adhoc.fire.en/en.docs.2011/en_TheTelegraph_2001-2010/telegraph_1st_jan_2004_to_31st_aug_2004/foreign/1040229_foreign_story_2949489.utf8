 Sunday, February 29, 2004 				 Rings fever reaches climax
				 	 Charlize Theron during rehearsals for the 76th annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles. (AP)																								Los Angeles, Feb. 28 (Reuters): With the Oscars a day away, the talk in Hollywood today turned away from whether front-runner film Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King would win best picture to whether it would sweep the board and capture every category in which it is nominated.																								Even before nominations for the US film industrys top honours were announced on January 27, the third film in the trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkiens novels about a war for control of a mythic Middle-Earth was the favourite to win the best picture Oscar. Nothing has happened in five weeks to change that notion.																								Return of the King earned 11 Oscar nominations from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, more than any other film, topping the 10 received for seafaring tale Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.																								Both movies figure prominently in categories like art direction, costume design, film editing and other technical award groups, but they were shut out of acting categories.																								Oscar historian Robert Osborne said once every few years a movie comes along that overwhelms Oscar voters with its combination of popularity and filmmaking prowess.																								The last time that happened was the 1997 blockbuster Titanic, a winner of 11 Oscars that, not coincidentally, earned most of its nominations in technical categories. In the old days, movies didnt sweep because there were so many great movies out there, but now it seems theres only a handful each year, said Osborne, author of 75 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards. 																								The first clues as to whether Rings can win big tomorrow will come early in technical categories. But if director Peter Jackson takes the best director statuette, the movie about the all-powerful ONE ring will likely capture the ONE Oscar that rules the film business for the next year  best picture. FASHION PARADE																								Security at the Kodak Theater in downtown Hollywood, where the 76th Annual Academy Awards take place, was tightened even further with police on every corner shielding the red carpet where stars like Nicole Kidman, Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jude Law will parade into the show.																								At Beverly Hills hotels like the Peninsula and the Four Seasons, celebrities were being outfitted for the gala event with designer tuxedos, couture gowns and diamonds galore.																								Last year, with the war in Iraq under way, fashion was played down and the red carpet affair was canceled. This year, Oscar glitz is back in style with top designers Vera Wang, Giorgio Armani and Prada all dressing the stars.																								One question remaining is what will Billy Crystal do onstage as master of ceremonies. In recent years, Crystal has been one of Oscars most popular hosts with his razor sharp wit. But this year, Crystal and Oscar producer Joe Roth have stayed mum about their plans for the show.																								Normally, Oscar watchers would expect a political outburst or two among the acceptance speeches, like documentary director Michael Moores (Bowling for Columbines) diatribe against the Bush administration last year. But the talk may be curtailed by a 5-second delay on the live telecast, which will be used for the first time.																								Oscar organizers have promised not to use the delay to edit acceptance speeches, but will do so only in case something like obscene language slips out, or perhaps, a breast.																								Hey, it happened at the 46th Annual Academy Awards when a streaker ran across the Oscar stage behind David Niven.																								And you thought you were a trendsetter, Janet Jackson. Oscar had seen it all, before.

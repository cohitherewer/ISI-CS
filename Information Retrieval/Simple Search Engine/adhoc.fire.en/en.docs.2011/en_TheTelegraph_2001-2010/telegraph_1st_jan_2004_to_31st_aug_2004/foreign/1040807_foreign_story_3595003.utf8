The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 To cure diarrhoea, take pills and eat
																								Washington, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Doctors offered a small crumb of comfort today to travellers suffering from diarrhoea  they do not have to forgo the buffet or other tempting treats while taking medicine.																								They found people who ate normally while taking antibiotics recovered from the diarrhoea as well as those who restricted their diet to broth and bland foods. The thought is that simple carbohydrates are easier to absorb during diarrhea and would be less likely to ... worsen diarrhoea, and such a diet might speed the repair of the gut, said Dr Charles Ericsson, head of Clinical Infectious Diseases at University of Texas, Houston Medical School.																								But, writing in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, Ericsson and colleagues said the best way to treat travellers diarrhoea was to take antibiotics to kill off whatever bacteria was causing the symptoms, and keep eating.																								The intestinal tract has been injured, he said in a statement. It needs to grow back and needs to be provided with calories. And that means go ahead and enjoy the local foods, he said. It is more important to accept some risk of diarrhoea rather than starve, he said.

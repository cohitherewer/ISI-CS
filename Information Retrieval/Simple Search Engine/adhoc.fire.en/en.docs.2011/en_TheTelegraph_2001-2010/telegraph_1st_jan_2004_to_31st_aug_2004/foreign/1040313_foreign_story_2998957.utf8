 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Sumo war in real estate
																								London, March 12: British estate agents have coined a new name for an increasingly common type of customer  Sumos (people who are Splitting Up and Moving Out).																								Agents say the trend is good for business, but deals can be wrecked by rows between the people splitting up.																								Latest figures show that Scotland has one of the highest divorce rates in the European Union, with 36 per cent of all marriages failing.																								This is forcing more Sumos to find their own home, and is having a significant effect on the property market.																								One estate agent, who refused to be named, said: The term is a trade term and not meant for the publics ears as it is obviously insulting. Estate agents do not have the best reputations and calling clients Sumos could be taken the wrong way.																								A total of 10,286 Scots couples divorced in 2002  195 more than the previous year.																								Rising property prices and long working hours have been blamed for the relationship crisis, which estate agents claim is becoming a major headache.																								Robin Simpson, chairman of the Edinburgh Solicitors and Property Centre said: Acting as agents we try to insist that the warring parties have reached a firm agreement on a course of action before we get involved.																								Its potentially such a minefield that we insist on written agreement from both parties that they both want to sell. Without that agreement things can go spectacularly wrong, with properties being taken off the market only to be subsequently remarketed down the line.																								In those situations, canny viewers, scenting a problem, can often profit from offering significantly lower bids. But Craig Scott, a financial adviser with the Murray Agency in Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, said broken-down relationships remained good for business, with some couples forced to pay out more than 13,000 in assorted legal fees to break up.																								He said: Whether youre an estate agent, surveyor, lawyer or financial adviser, unfortunately divorces are great for business. Divorces may be lucrative, but we take no pleasure in them. Its risky, unpleasant work and its heartbreaking to see years of financial planning go up in smoke.																								Relate, a counselling service, warned couples who set up home together just to move up the property ladder that it could all end in tears. A spokesman said: Higher mortgages require longer working hours and the more people work the less time they spend speaking to one another.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

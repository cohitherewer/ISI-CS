 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Shift in balance of power
																								Brussels, March 15 (Reuters): The surprise election victory of Spains Opposition Socialists will alter the balance of power in Europe, robbing pro-US supporters of the Iraq war led by Britain of a key ally, EU diplomats said today.																								The result may make other European countries re-calculate their involvement in Iraq, and open the way for early compromise on a stalled EU constitution, blocked by outgoing conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to defend Spains voting power.																								Aznar radically changed Spanish foreign policy in his eight years in power, aligning Madrid with London and Washington in contrast to his Socialist predecessor, Felipe Gonzalez, who had mostly sailed in the slipstream of the Franco-German alliance. This is going be a major change for the foreign policy of the union, a senior Brussels official said. The axis of Blair-Berlusconi-Aznar is gone. Its a chance to recover more unity in Europe. Prime Minister-elect Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said he hoped to restore magnificent relations with France and Germany, which both opposed the Iraqi war, and put Spain back in the vanguard of European integration.																								With British Prime Minister Tony Blair on the defensive over his use of pre-war intelligence and legal advice, and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi beset by economic and legal problems at home, the pro-US coalition suddenly looks weaker.																								The new Europe was always based on shaky foundations and that has been exposed now, said foreign policy analyst Steven Everts of the Centre for European Reform. 																								Everts forecast Italy would be more cautious in extending its military engagement in Iraq as a result and noted the Dutch parliament was also reticent about its countrys commitment.

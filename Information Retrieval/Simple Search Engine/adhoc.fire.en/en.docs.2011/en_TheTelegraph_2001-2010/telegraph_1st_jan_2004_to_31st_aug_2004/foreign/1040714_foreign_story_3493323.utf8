																								Baghdad, July 13 (Reuters): Iraqi police seized more than 500 criminal suspects in raids in Baghdad today, an interior ministry source said.																								Till now the police have arrested 527 people in Rusafa, the source said, referring to a swathe of Baghdad on the east bank of the Tigris river. He said the raids had begun in the early hours and were still under way.																								The number (of detainees) is more than we expected, he said, adding that those held included suspected drug dealers and weapons traders.																								He said the raids would continue in the Rusafa area, and would be expanded to other areas of the capital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Suu Kyi to be freed soon, says party
				 	 Aung San Suu Kyi																								Yangon, April 19 (Reuters): Aung San Suu Kyi, the charismatic Opposition leader in military-ruled Myanmar, may be freed from house arrest in a day or two, her National League for Democracy (NLD) party said today.																								Speculation has been rife that the Nobel peace laureate will be freed after the junta allowed the NLD to re-open its Yangon headquarters on Saturday, nearly a year after it was shut and its leader detained.																								I think she will be released in a day or two, NLD chairman Aung Shwe said outside the partys ramshackle offices which officially reopened today.																								Aung Shwe, who was freed from house arrest last week, did not say why he was optimistic that Suu Kyis third major period of confinement would end soon. The government and state media have been silent.																								As NLD leaders met inside, dozens of supporters anxiously waited for news on the same street where jubilant crowds mobbed Suu Kyi after her last release from house arrest in May 2002.																								We hope she will be freed. This would be the best way to break the political deadlock, said one man. Some Yangon-based diplomats believe there have been contacts between the military and Suu Kyi on the juntas proposed road map to democracy, which includes multi-party constitutional talks due to start on May 17.																								But they said it was not certain Suu Kyi would be freed before the National Convention opens next month. I think it is unlikely they will release her before May 17. The government may be fully aware that she will not join the National Convention and she would be in a position to disrupt the whole process, one Asian diplomat said.																								The first convention was suspended in 1996 after the NLD walked out accusing the junta of manipulating the process.																								The NLD has refused to consider joining the talks until Suu Kyi and her vice-chairman Tin Oo are freed and meet the partys executive committee. They are the last senior NLD leaders still confined since a bloody clash between her followers and government supporters in May last year.																								We will decide this matter only when she comes out, said Aung Shwe, who led the partys delegation at the last conference.																								Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, emerged as a figurehead of the pro-democracy movement in 1988, and has faced years of harassment by the junta. She was held under house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and for 19 months until May, 2002. Her release then was greeted by jubilant crowds in Yangon amid hopes the countrys political deadlock would end with fresh negotiations. But the talks eventually collapsed and Suu Kyi was arrested along with other NLD leaders after clashes last May.

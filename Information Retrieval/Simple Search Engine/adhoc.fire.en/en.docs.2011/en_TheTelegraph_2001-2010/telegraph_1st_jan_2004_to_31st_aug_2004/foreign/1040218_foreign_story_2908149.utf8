 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Shias set price for slow polls
																								Baghdad, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Shias on Iraqs governing council are ready to back off from their demands for elections before a planned US transfer of sovereignty  but at a price.																								They would want an appointed transitional government that ensures their political dominance as Iraqs majority group.																								There are two choices: elections, or compromises that respect the existing balances, said Adel Abdel Mahdi, a senior official of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), the top party among Shias who form 60 per cent of the population and hold a like share of Council seats.																								There cant be any playing of the one issue against the other. If you refuse the elections, then you have to accept the balances.																								Washingtons original plan for handing power back to Iraqis on June 30 foresaw a complex system of caucuses to pick an interim body that would draft a constitution and see the country through to full elections next year.																								The insistence on elections by the top religious authority for Iraqs Shias  oppressed during the rule of Saddam Hussein that was overthrown by last years US-led invasion  cast that plan into disarray. It led Washington to invite a UN team to judge the feasibility of an early vote and explore alternatives.																								Last week, that team met Iraqi politicians  including Sunni Arabs fearful an early vote would hand power to Shias who have better political organisation as well as the numbers on their side  and all but ruled out a vote by June 30.																								Since the UN visit, Council members including Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani have proposed that the body assume sovereignty if there is no vote, calling that the best alternative to caucuses they say are all but dead and buried.																								The opposition of Sunnis on the U.S.-appointed Council compounds the dilemma of U.S. officials, who face a November presidential election and insist the June 30 date is not negotiable, even if details of a political exit from Iraq are.																								In theory, there is the option of an improved version of the caucuses, though this would need so much thrashing out that its probably the least viable alternative, said Samir al-Sumaidy, a Sunni Council member. Assigning sovereignty to the Council as it is is the easiest route at this point. This is the easiest to implement.

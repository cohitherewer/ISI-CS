 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Cruises mystery mission
				 	 Tom Cruise in Paris. (AFP) Paris, Aug. 30 (Reuters):  Tom Cruise took time out from a packed promotion schedule  for his film Collateral to sit down with French finance  minister Nicolas Sarkozy today, the ministry said.																								The hour-long meeting, held at the actors request, touched on issues including Franco-American relations, sources close to Sarkozy said.																								Ties between Paris and Washington were badly damaged last year by Frances vocal opposition to the US-led war in Iraq. 																								It was not clear why Cruise wanted to meet Sarkozy, who has made no secret of his presidential ambitions but is little known overseas.																								Cruise arrived at the riverside finance ministry in a launch. 																								The actor was due to attend the red-carpet French premiere of Collateral.

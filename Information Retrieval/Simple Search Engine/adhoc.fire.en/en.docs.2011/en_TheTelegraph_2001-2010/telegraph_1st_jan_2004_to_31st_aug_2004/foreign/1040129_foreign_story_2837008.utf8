The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Chairman quits sorry BBC
				 	 Gavyn Davies London, Jan. 28 (Reuters):  The chairman of the BBC resigned today and the broadcaster  apologised for some of its reporting on the buildup to the  war in Iraq after an inquiry by a senior judge lambasted  the corporation.																								The report by Lord Hutton criticised journalist Andrew Gilligan, the BBCs management and its supervisory board of governors, for a radio report saying the government sexed up intelligence in a dossier on Iraqi weapons. Hutton said the BBC report was unfounded.																								He said the BBCs editorial system was defective in allowing Gilligans report to air and the governors should have investigated it in the aftermath, during which Kelly was unmasked as Gilligans source and committed suicide.																								BBC News 24 said Gavyn Davies, chairman of the BBC board of governors, tendered his resignation after the publication of the Hutton report. He made no immediate comment.																								The BBC does accept that certain key allegations reported by Andrew Gilligan on the Today programme on May 29 last year were wrong and we apologise for them, BBC director general Greg Dyke said.																								Huttons findings will strengthen BBC critics who say the broadcaster should fall under the oversight of media regulator Ofcom. Conservative leader Michael Howard said the case for outside regulation of the BBC has never been stronger.																								The broadcasters feud with Prime Minister Tony Blairs government comes as the publicly-funded broadcaster is about to undergo a parliamentary review of its charter, and at a time when the mandatory licence fee that provides most of its funding is under fire from the private sector.																								Alastair Campbell, Tony Blairs former director of communications, who was at the centre of the dispute, said the BBC would have to decide what action to take now.

 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Council consolidates army hold on Pak politics
																								Islamabad, April 14 (Reuters): Pakistans upper house of parliament approved the creation of a National Security Council today, a move Opposition leaders said would cement the militarys role in politics.																								Pro-government members passed the bill by a simple majority in the 100-seat Senate while Opposition members of parliament were out of the chamber, having stormed out in protest against a separate issue.																								The pro-military government of Prime Minister Zarafullah Khan Jamali has said the security council would have only an advisory role in politics, and would include provincial governors, members of the opposition and senior military officers.																								But the Opposition says the council, to be headed by President Pervez Musharraf, will be used to run the country and override civilian leaders. 																								The President retains total control despite elections in October, 2002, that formally returned the country to civilian rule after Musharrafs bloodless coup in 1999.																								The Opposition charged that minister of state for law and parliamentary affairs Mohammad Raza Hayat Hiraj deliberately presented the bill in the Oppositions absence. In the event, it took just minutes to adopt.																								This is the worst incident in Pakistans history and the history of the Senate, said Raza Rabbani, a Senate member from the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party headed by self-exiled former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto. This bill was bulldozed in the absence of the Opposition.																								Raza Mohammad Raza, another opposition member of parliament, said: This is permanent martial law, and this country has become a military state. 																								The creation of the council was approved by the lower house last week. 																								The passage of the bill coincides with intense debate over a promise by Musharraf, an important ally in the US-led war on terror, to step down as head of the army by the end of the year.																								In an interview with the BBC, excerpts of which were aired yesterday, Musharraf declined to commit to stepping down, saying he was upset with the Oppositions refusal to participate in a vote of confidence in him and in last weeks lower house vote on the security council. 																								Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed later said Musharraf would stand by his decision to step down.																								Earlier this week, Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, the de facto leader of the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League party led by exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was sentenced to 23 years in prison for defaming the military and trying to incite a mutiny. Yesterday, the US called for transparency in handling the case.Tribe to hunt militants																								The Zali Kheil tribe whose members are accused of harbouring al Qaida militants agreed today to raise a militia of 1,500 men to hunt the militants and their Pakistani allies down.

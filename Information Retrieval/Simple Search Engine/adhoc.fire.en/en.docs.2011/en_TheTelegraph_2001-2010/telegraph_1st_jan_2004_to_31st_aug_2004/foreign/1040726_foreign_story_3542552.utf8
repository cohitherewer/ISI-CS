 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Britain plans do-it-yourself guide to tackle terror
																								London, July 25 (Reuters): The British government will issue a public information leaflet tomorrow designed to tell people what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.																								Home secretary David Blunkett said he did not want to raise unnecessary fears but the government wanted people to be alert not alarmed about possible terrorist threats.																								It (the leaflet) is all about helping you to do what you need to do and know what you need to know, he told BBC television today. This could be from a terrorism attack all the way through to a major fire, to a flood, to a situation where youre actually trying to help other people.																								Blunkett will launch the 22-page booklet at a news conference tomorrow.																								He said it had the backing of all Britains main political parties and had been modelled on a similar document produced by the Australian government for its citizens.																								A spokeswoman for the home office said 25 million copies of the leaflet would be printed and distributed to every household in the country. 																								They will be dropped though letterboxes across the country during August, she said.																								She stressed the booklet had not been produced because of any enhanced or specific threat but in response to research showing Britons wanted straightforward and easily accessible information about what to do in emergencies.																								Blunkett said the government could not guarantee 100 per cent safety from terrorism but Britains security services were always working to try to prevent attacks.																								Obviously we can pick up the pieces afterwards, but actually stopping them doing it ... is absolutely crucial, he said.

 RICHARD SPENCER 				 	 A pekinese: Problem of plenty																								Beijing, Aug. 8: At Beijings leading dog acupuncture clinic, Prof Lu Gang is tending a new patient.																								Tangtang, an unhappy-looking pekinese, is shaking uncontrollably, his fat belly wobbling. According to his owner, Tangtang (Sugar Sugar) has been in pain for days.																								Its a typical case, said Lu, as he inserts his needles. The overfed stomach has twisted the spine and the lower back is distorted. Tangtang is the latest victim of the threat hitting the Chinese capitals favourite breed of pet: obesity.																								According to Prof Lu, one of the countrys leading vets, the future of the pekinese in China is under threat because the dogs are being overpampered. A nation that once ate dogs is now killing them with kindness. The Chinese word for pet translates literally as spoiled animal.																								Many dogs are left paralysed, their spines damaged by the weight they are forced to bear. Indulged and overfed, meanwhile, pekinese bitches are increasingly too posh to push. They are often so fat that they are unable to give birth naturally, a condition known as dystocia. They are getting too fat, and the whole stock is deteriorating, said Prof Lu.																								The pekinese, known in Mandarin as jingba (capital pup), has been a symbol of China for centuries. They were the beloved animals of the notorious 19th-century Dowager Empress Ci Xi, occupying the same place in her affections as corgis do for Queen ELizabeth II.																								Recently, however, Chinas middle classes have prospered  to the detriment of their pets. Pekinese are a quiet breed. They do not like sports or running about, said one vet in Wangjing, a new middle-class suburb in Beijing.																								But as dogs, they like meat very much. These two facts have resulted in what we might call the too posh disease that they are now suffering. According to international standards, a dog is fat if it is 10-15 per cent overweight. Almost all of my patients are fat by this standard. 																								Prof Lu believes that people lavish love on their dogs because the new, urban China is more solitary than the old-fashioned, family-oriented society. Children move away from their parents, leaving them with no one to care for or care for them, he said.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Haiti rebels ask people to put pressure on America
				 	 A Haitian rebel gets his boots polished in Port-au-Prince. (Reuters)																								Port-au-Prince, March 2 (Reuters): Rebels sought to consolidate their position in Haiti today, urging people to demonstrate support for their army in the face of a power vacuum after the ouster of President Jean-Betrand Aristide.																								While US troop reinforcements were arriving to spearhead an international force and Washington worked on political plans for restoring order, rebel leader Guy Philippe, an ex-police chief, went on local radio to call for public backing. 																								We need the population to give us the mandate to provide them with security. Once we get the mandate we will assume our responsibility, declared Philippe, whose rag-tag backers took over the police headquarters yesterday.																								He called on Haitians to demonstrate outside the US-guarded national palace, the gleaming white presidential office in the middle of this peeling and impoverished city which was long a symbol of Aristides power. Many people returned to work and the streets were crowded with vehicles today, but there was still occasional shooting and some looting in the anarchic port area.																								In Washington defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld said:The situation clearly is more stable and quieter today. US forces were securing the airport, the palace area and the coast guard station. He added: The forces that were opposing Aristide seem to have made a conscious decision to behave and thats a good thing. That is a result of the presence of international and multinational forces.																								Philippe made clear his forces did not intend to melt away, despite his statement shortly after Aristide fled on Sunday that his forces would put down their weapons and stop fighting. The army was never disbanded, he said.																								Aristide disbanded the army in the 1990s after a series of military coups, leaving law and order to a poorly equipped police force which collapsed in the face of the rebels campaign in the last month.																								Hundreds of armed rebels, some in military fatigues with automatic weapons and others in T-shirts with Second World War rifles, have entered the capital. Haiti was convulsed by an uprising that began on February 5 when an armed gang took over the northwestern city of Gonaives and was later joined by former soldiers and paramilitaries.																								Aristide has charged from the Central African Republic that he was kidnapped in an American coup detat, an allegation US officials dismissed as baseless nonsense but which may give a political boost to Aristide supporters.																								Our vote was stolen. We elected Aristide for five years. His term was not completed so he is still our President, 19-year-old Patrick Sanon said in a poor district that was a centre of an Aristide state housing project.																								 Vice-President Dick Cheney said today Aristide had worn out his welcome as Haitis President but that the US did not force him to leave as he claims. He made the choice to leave. He resigned the office of his own free will and left on a civilian aircraft which we chartered for him. He left with his security detail. This was his decision to go, Cheney told the Fox News Channel.																								There were reports of more killings, despite the presence of US troops in the city who said barricades prevented them from entering the port. Colonel David Berger, commander of the international forces, said 300 Marines were in Haiti and more will be flowing in today.																								One mans body lay by a crossroads, a bullet hole in his head in an execution-style killing. Overnight there was sporadic gunfire, including outside the presidential palace. About 80 people have been killed in the month-long uprising.																								Hundreds of Marines and 100 French troops are camped out at the airport in the first stage of a UN-sanctioned effort to restore order. 																								The US force was to grow to 1,500 to 2,000 as part of an international force of some 5,000.																								Washington says it is trying to create a council of a dozen prominent Haitians to organize early elections and says its forces will work to disarm the rebels.																								Aristides constitutional successor, Chief Justice Boniface Alexandre, assumed the presidency on Sunday but has not appeared in public since.																								On Monday Aristides political foes and the rebels, whose armed campaign they did not back, met at a luxury hotel to discuss the future, surrounded by heavily armed guards and vigilantes. Neither side commented after the meeting.																								Aristides hard-core supporters, known aschimeres, melted back into the slums after rampaging in recent nights.																								Many Haitians fear a spate of revenge killings by rebels, led by Philippe and Louis Jodel Chamblain, the former head of a death squad blamed for thousands of killings.																								A shootout erupted at Aristides home in Tabarre on Monday after looting there. Vandals smashed vases and other belongings and dragged a piano into the driveway. And the home of Prime Minister Yvon Neptune was torched, witnesses said.																								Aristide, who was once a champion of Haitis fledgling democracy but was driven out by the revolt and foreign pressure after months of anti-government demonstrations, left for Africa early on Sunday in a hasty departure arranged by Washington.

 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Musharraf security revamp
																								Islamabad, Jan. 11 (PTI): Pakistan President Pervez Musharrafs personal security has been revamped on the lines of that provided to an American President in the wake of recent bids on his life.																								Musharrafs convoy would now comprise six identical limousines and the porch at his residence and office will be covered with thick curtains to prevent even his close security staff to see the vehicle he is getting in, The Nation reported. Further, the convoy will leave in two different and separate formations.																								As part of the stepped up security measures, a machine-gun-mounted military helicopter will provide security to his motorcade from the air and police will erect steel fences on both sides of the road in different road junctions to prevent attackers from driving their vehicles into the convoy, the report said.																								Musharraf has already been advised to move out from his army house residence to the more secure presidential palace in Islamabad.

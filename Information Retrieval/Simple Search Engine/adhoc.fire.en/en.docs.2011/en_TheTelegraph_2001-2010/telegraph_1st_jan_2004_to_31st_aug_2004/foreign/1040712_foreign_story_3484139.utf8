 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Madonna, bad for heart
 CHRIS HASTINGS AND ROYA NIKKHAH				 	 Madonna: Directors nightmareLondon, July 11: John Schlesinger, the Oscar-winning director of Billy Liar and Midnight Cowboy, blamed Madonnas outrageous behaviour on the set of a film they were making for contributing to his heart attack.																								His damning comments about the pop singer-turned-actor are contained in a collection of letters and production notes bequeathed to the British Film Institute by the veteran film-maker after his death in July 2003.																								The papers reveal that Schlesinger, who worked with Madonna in 1999 on his last film, The Next Best Thing (released in 2000), became enraged by her attempts to change numerous scenes. They also show that Madonna demanded that special effects be used to beautify her appearance. In the film, a comedy, Madonna plays a yoga instructor who becomes pregnant after a drunken one-night stand with her homosexual best friend, played by Rupert Everett.																								Shortly after completing what was one of the unhappiest shoots of his career, Schlesinger, then 73, collapsed on the doorstep of his London home. He was diagnosed with heart failure and underwent a quadruple heart bypass operation. In a letter written from the Royal Brompton Hospital on December 2, 1999, to Andrew Cannava, his agent, Schlesinger put some of the blame for his collapse on Madonnas collaboration with producer Tom Rosenberg, to change the film. His letters, along with production notes, complain Madonna tried to influence every aspect of the production, from the music to the final cut. 																								One unsigned memo suggests that the actor, then 41, wanted producers to beautify 34 shots of her with computer generated imagery, the special effects technique pioneered in fantasy epics such as Jurassic Park and Titanic. Surprisingly, the singer, who appeared naked in her controversial 1992 book Sex, also balked at the idea of appearing fully nude in the film. Later, Madonna lobbied for the removal of a pivotal scene she felt was too gay, much to the disgust of Schlesinger, himself homosexual. These constant demands infuriated the director, who had previously worked with such actors as Lord Olivier, Dustin Hoffman and Glenda Jackson. 																								In a letter to Rosenberg on November 30, 1999, dictated from his hospital bed, he wrote: I am outraged that Madonna is starting to express an opinion of what works and what doesnt and what is too gay when she wasnt even present at the previews. In any case, she is not the director; so far as I am concerned I want the scene to remain as it is.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

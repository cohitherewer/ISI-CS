 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Miracle rises from quake rubble
 Bam, Jan. 1 (Reuters):  At first they thought he was dead, but as they dug through  the ruins, the rescuers realised the young man lying alongside  six corpses was blinking and mumbling.																								He had been trapped under a wardrobe, which probably saved his life when the worlds most devastating earthquake in decades flattened his home town of Bam in southeast Iran six days ago.																								Yadollah Saadat, a 27-year-old shopkeeper, was rescued around 2030 GMT yesterday by Red Crescent workers who had all but given up hope of finding any more survivors in Bams mud-brick buildings, nearly all of which collapsed.																								They were taking out the corpses and they found him. They thought he was dead and then they realised he was alive, Saadats wife Fatimeh Asghari, 22, said as medics treated him for a broken hip in a Red Crescent truck at Bam airport. I cant express how happy I am, she said.																								An ambulance medic held the dazed mans face and asked if he could say his name. The man mumbled Yadollah several times in reply. His right leg appeared to be covered by a metal splint.																								You can call it a miracle or anything you like, said Red Crescent worker Ali Asghar Namdari. I;m just happy. At least we have saved one life. I have been in war and through many struggles and Ive never been so happy.																								Iran state radio said a nine-year-old girl covered with dust and dirt had also been rescued from the rubble of her familys flattened house today morning. She was described as in fragile condition but no further details were given.																								Many of the 30,000 killed in the pre-dawn quake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale were buried by collapsing ceilings and debris as they slept.																								Beside Saadat in his house in northern Bam were corpses of six relatives, including two brothers. Saadat was pinned beneath a toppled wardrobe, which apparently shielded him from the falling roof and other debris. He was first rushed to a field hospital. Today he was flown to Tehran for further treatment.

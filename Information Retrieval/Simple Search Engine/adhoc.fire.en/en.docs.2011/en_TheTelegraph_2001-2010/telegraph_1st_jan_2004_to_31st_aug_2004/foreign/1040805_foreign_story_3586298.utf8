 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Microsoft blog enters Japan
																								Tokyo, Aug. 4 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp. said today it was launching its first-ever web log service in Japan next week and aimed to have one million users in the first year, intensifying competition with Google Inc.																								Web logs, or blogs, have been around for several years, serving as online journals for Web-savvy disseminators of information, ranging from personal ramblings and product reviews to social commentary. 																								But blogging drew renewed attention after Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said in May that Web logs and the way they were distributed could be used as business communication tools, signalling Microsofts growing awareness of blogging as both a potential threat and a new business opportunity.																								Microsoft, the worlds largest software maker, plans to start a trial service on August 10 in cooperation with unlisted Japanese contents provider T..S Co. Ltd., followed by an official launch later this year. 																								It has yet to be decided when Microsoft will launch a blog service in the US, Europe and elsewhere.

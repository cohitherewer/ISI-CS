 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Ranil slams Chandrika poll move
																								Colombo, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratungas dissolution of parliament and call for snap elections were undemocratic and a threat to the ceasefire with Tamil Tiger rebels, the Prime Minister said today.																								Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his first public speech since the April 2 election was called 10 days ago, said the poll could jeopardise a two-year-old truce that has silenced the guns in a 20-year civil war in which 64,000 people have died.																								This action was against the mandate of the people. The government had the support of a majority in parliament when it was dispersed, he said in a recorded speech played on several private television channels.																								The President has jeopardised the ceasefire agreement. The economy got a severe blow. The country is once again unstable, Wickremesinghe said.

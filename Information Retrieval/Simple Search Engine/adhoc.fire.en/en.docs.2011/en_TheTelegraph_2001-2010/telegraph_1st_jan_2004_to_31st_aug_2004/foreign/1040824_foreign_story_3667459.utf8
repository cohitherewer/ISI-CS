The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Hasina refuses to meet Khaleda, Dhaka edgy
				 	 Awami League activists protest in Dhaka. (AFP)																								Dhaka, Aug. 23 (Agencies): Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Wajed, whose rally was attacked on Saturday killing 19 of her supporters, today refused to meet Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and instead called for the resignation of the four-party alliance.																								Khaledas office had contacted Hasinas aides to convey the Prime Ministers intention to meet the Awami chief. 																								However, Hasinas political adviser Saber Hossain Chowdhury criticised the Khaleda governments stand after the attack and said there was no reason for the Prime Minister to meet their leader.																								We dont see any reason for the Prime Minister to come and see the leader (Sheikh Hasina) at a time when we are being blamed for Saturdays grenade attacks as well as the governments refusal to give the bodies of our leaders and workers for mass prayers yesterday, Chowdhury said.																								The government should resign immediately as it has failed to provide security to the people, Hasina said and blamed the ruling party for Saturdays attack. 																								Thousands of Bangladesh Opposition activists holding banners reading: Why the bombings, why the bloodshed? protested today against the grenade attack as extra armed police stood by to quell violence.																								In Dhaka, more than 3,000 supporters of the main Opposition Awami League staged a peaceful but noisy protest over the attack. 																								We want answers and Down with (Prime Minister) Khaleda Zias government, long live Bangladesh, shouted the protesters, some holding black flags. Police armed with tear gas, riot shields and automatic rifles looked on.																								Mostly peaceful protests also took place in the northeastern town of Sylhet, the port city of Chittangong and other towns. But in Sherpur, a town 250 km northwest of Dhaka, a crude bomb was thrown at an Awami League protest, injuring one. 																								Yesterday, Awami supporters ransacked a railway station and set fire to a train in protest. At least 50 people were injured in clashes across the country as Awami members accused the government of inaction after the attack.																								A two-day national strike to protest over the grenade attacks starts tomorrow. The capital was edgy today, with many schools and colleges closed and offices reporting low attendance because of the fear of violence. The normally jammed streets were easy to negotiate. International concern at the situation in Bangladesh was rising. US secretary of state Colin Powell said in a statement issued in Washington: The perpetrators of this heinous act clearly intend to undermine democracy in Bangladesh.

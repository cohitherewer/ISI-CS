 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Drinkers believe alcohol is healthy
 CATRIONA DAVIESLondon, April 16: A growing number of people believe that drinking alcohol is good for their health, a study released today claimed.																								Twenty-six per cent of people questioned said that they drank because they believed it had health benefits, up from 19 per cent in a similar survey two years ago.																								Similarly, 21 per cent of men and 14 per cent of women said that alcohol was good for relieving stress. Less than 10 per cent of the 1,000 adults in the survey said they believed alcohol was bad for them.																								Studies have suggested that drinking red wine in moderation can have health benefits, particularly for older people who are at greater risk of coronary heart disease.																								However, todays survey by Mintel showed the view of alcohol as healthy was not restricted to red wine drinkers or those at risk from heart disease. Amanda Lintott, of Mintel, said: There could well be a number of people who believe that there are in fact health benefits from drinking alcohol of all kinds.Anne Jenkins, from Alcohol Concern, said: I have not seen anything to prove alcohol can relieve stress. Going to the pub in the company of friends is as relaxing as the alcohol itself.																								Meanwhile, two separate studies have emphasised health dangers of drinking. 																								Research by Massachusetts General Hospital among 47,000 men, reported in The Lancet medical journal, linked gout with a chemical in beer.																								A separate study by scientists from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and the University of California, San Franciso, found that heavy social drinkers suffer as much brain damage as chronic alcoholics who have been hospitalised.																								Gout is caused by deposits of crystals of a chemical called uric acid in joints. Alcohol consumption leads to hyperuricaemia  when the body produces too much uric acid.																								Wine, in moderation, was not a problem, however: two small glasses a day caused no increase in gout.																								That suggested that something other than the alcohol in the drinks was also playing a role, Dr Hyon K. Choi of the Massachusetts General Hospital said.																								He added that one suspect might be a chemical called purine, which is found in larger quantities in beer than in other alcoholic drinks and could augment the hyperuricaemic effect of alcohol itself.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Madrid-type bomb found on Spain rail track
																								Mocejon (Spain), April 2 (Reuters): A bomb was found on a Spanish high-speed rail track today and state radio reported it contained the same type of dynamite used in suspected al Qaida bombs that killed 191 people on Madrid trains last month.																								The discovery disrupted travel as millions of Spaniards prepared to leave cities for the Easter week holidays and came on the day a new session of Parliament opened following last months elections.																								The bomb and the discovery yesterday evening of three letter bombs addressed to media outlets kept nerves on edge in Spain after the shock caused by the March 11 train attacks.																								Interior minister Angel Acebes said the latest bomb was believed to contain between 10 and 12 kg of explosives, which were connected by a long cable to a detonator. He gave no information about who may have planted the bomb. State radio said a first examination indicated the dynamite used was Goma 2 Eco  the same kind used in the Madrid blasts.																								The bomb was found in a bag under the rails of the high-speed train line connecting Madrid and the southern city of Seville. It was spotted by a railway employee about 60 km south of Madrid, near the city of Toledo.																								Authorities were alerted and sent explosives experts who defused the device. A Reuters reporter at the scene said the bomb had been in a hole close to where the road crosses the track.																								Acebes and defence minister Federico Trillo were reported to be meeting and were due to hold a news conference later. Today marks the start of one of the busiest travel periods in the year in Spain. Millions of Spaniards leave cities for the Easter week holidays. Seville draws huge crowds for its Easter processions. 																								The AVE service whisks passengers from Madrid to Seville in a little over two hours and is one of the jewels of the Spanish rail network. Services on the line were halted while all the track was checked, Acebes said.																								On March 11, two of the trains exploded at or near Madrids Atocha station, which is also the terminus for AVE services to Seville.																								The Madrid attacks were the first in the West linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network since the September 11, 2001, strikes in US.																								Todays bomb was found as members of parliament elected in Spains March 14 election took their seats in Madrid. The Socialists ousted the ruling Popular Party in an election upset three days after the March 11 bombings. Last night, three letter bombs addressed to Spanish media organisations were intercepted at a mail distribution in Zaragoza, northern Spain. Police explosives experts defused two of the letter bombs and blew up a third.

 GEORGE JONES				 	 Cherie Blair: Wonder womanLondon, Aug. 13: Cherie Blair could earn up to 30,000 for giving three speeches in the US in October.																								One speaking agency said yesterday she could expect up to 11,000 per speech as the Prime Ministers wife.																								Both Downing Street and her legal chambers, Matrix Law, refused to comment yesterday on how much she was charging for the speeches or whether she would donate the money to charity.																								Matrix Law confirmed a report in The Daily Telegraphs Spy column that Cherie Blair was being promoted as a speaker in the US by one of the worlds leading speaking agencies.																								The Harry Walker Agency in New York already has Bill Clinton, the former US President, Hans Blix, the former UN weapons inspector, and William Hague, the former Conservative leader, on its books.																								Cherie is already speaking in the US in October, which has been in her diary for some time. She has accepted an invitation from this agency to speak while she is in the US on subjects which are within her professional expertise, a spokesman for Matrix Law said.																								The firms website describes her as a leading lawyer specialising in education and employment discrimination law. In her public law practice she advises local authorities and other public bodies, and individuals and companies. She lectures widely on human rights and advises on the implications of the Human Rights Act, it says.																								But a leaked e-mail from the Harry Walker Agency made clear that Cherie Blair was being marketed primarily as an international role model because of her position as the wife of Tony Blair.																								The e-mail sent out to the agencys clients said she was a fascinating speaker  a noted British attorney, human rights advocate and the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair.																								While Matrix uses her maiden name Booth, under which she practises law, the American e-mail referred to her as Cherie Blair, describing her as a trailblazer in her professional life and a dedicated wife and mother in her private life.																								It said the New York Times had described her as something of a wonderwoman for her ability to balance her high-powered professional life, high visibility public life and intensely consuming private life. When the press gallery at Westminster asked whether Bill Clinton would address a lunch, it was told his fee was 137,000 plus a first class round trip air fare for him and two aides.

 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Nuclear disquiet hits US please-Pak policy
 K.P. NAYAR 				 	 Abdul Qadeer Khan																								Washington, Feb. 27: For the first time since General Pervez Musharraf became an ally of President George W. Bush, the White House policy of appeasing Pakistan is facing a serious challenge on Capitol Hill, thanks to nuclear proliferator Abdul Qadeer Khan.																								Secretary of state Colin Powell, who testified before the Senate budget committee yesterday on the state departments budget request for fiscal year 2005, was harangued over Musharrafs pardon for Khan and Washingtons inability to do anything about it.																								The budget proposes an increase of $101 million in excess of what Bush had promised Musharraf when the two men met in Camp David last year. The raise, which takes assistance to Pakistan next year to a total of $701 million is obviously a reward for Musharrafs fresh efforts to find Osama bin Laden dead or alive before the US presidential elections in November.																								The Bush administrations efforts to handle Pakistan with kid gloves after Khans confessions did not, however, impress Senators on the budget committee. 																								Senator Pete Domenici, a Republican from New Mexico, told Powell: Weapons of mass destruction are moving around the world today like nothing we could have believed. We have a guy in Pakistan that, 10-years-ago, if you would have found him selling that stuff, you would have hung him in the marketplace  the worst proliferator ever is that fellow from Pakistan. Is that his name  Khan?																								Powell quietly replied: Khan, sir  Dr Khan.																								Domenici continued: I mean, can you imagine admitting that he put weapons of mass destruction in five countries and we are still running around saying, well, we dont know what to do about him?																								The committees chairman, Don Nickles, also a Republican, said: I dont see him (Khan) being punished... It looks like hes getting off scot-free.																								Powell replied that Khan is a national hero in Pakistan and occupies a special place in the life of the Pakistani people. President Musharraf is well aware of what Khan has been doing... and he got from Khan full acknowledgement of what he had done and a lot of information. And then President Musharraf felt it was in the best interests of his country and of his government and of the process of uncovering everything we could about this network, for him to give an conditional amnesty to Khan.																								Powell said Khan cooperated with Musharraf and that a lot of information was coming out as a result of the nuclear scientists openness. 																								It is important to note that the amnesty he was given was a conditional one... which means full and open disclosure. And we are learning a lot from that.																								He said the money proposed for Pakistan in the budget would be used to help advance security and economic cooperation and opportunity for Pakistans citizens, including a multi-year educational support programme.																								The strong remarks by Senators against Musharraf yesterday coincided with a determination by Bush that Pakistan is cooperating with the US in the global war on terrorism and his directions to Powell to report this determination to the Congress. 																								There has been criticism of Musharraf on Capitol Hill before, but these have largely been from members of House of Representatives, that too members of the Indian Caucus. 																								The strong words by Senators makes a significant change that may not bode well for Islamabad.

 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 UK prostitution review to make brothels legal
																								London, July 16: David Blunkett, the home secretary, has launched a major review of prostitution laws, which could include the decriminalisation of brothels.																								Blunkett, who previously labelled current laws outdated, confusing and ineffective, put forward a radical package of reform looking at whether a licensing scheme would help reduce the damage caused by prostitution to local communities.																								The document said: Licensing arrangements and other relevant regulations could be set up so that local authorities could control prostitution in their areas.																								The new plans could also lead to a register of sex workers and asked whether the government should allow tolerance zones for street prostitution. A previous suggestion that call girls under the age of 18 should no longer be treated as offenders was firmly ruled out by Blunkett.																								We believe there are compelling arguments for retaining this offence in respect of those under 18 to underline the message that prostitution involving children and young people is wholly unacceptable,said the paper.																								The home secretary has also hinted that brothels disguised as legitimate businesses, such as massage parlours, will no longer be tolerated.																								There is a growing trade in selling sexual services in premises licensed for other activity, including massage and also video and film, he said. 																								Prostitution must not be concealed behind the facade of legitimate business. The report added that there was already enthusiasm for creating managed zones for prostitution in several parts of the UK, including Doncaster and Liverpool. 																								Up to 80,000 women are thought to work in the sex trade in Britain  including up to 5,000 children. In London, the Metropolitan Police estimates 70 per cent of prostitutes are illegal immigrants working off debts to people traffickers.																								The International Prostitutes Collective lobby group is unconvinced about the plans. It notes that in the Netherlands, only 12 per cent of women work in managed safety zones as they prefer to stay anonymous. The organisation wants total decriminalisation. Targeting clients and extending antisocial behaviour orders will make women more vulnerable and if the government is serious about protecting women it should decriminalise prostitution altogether, said a spokeswoman for the Collective.

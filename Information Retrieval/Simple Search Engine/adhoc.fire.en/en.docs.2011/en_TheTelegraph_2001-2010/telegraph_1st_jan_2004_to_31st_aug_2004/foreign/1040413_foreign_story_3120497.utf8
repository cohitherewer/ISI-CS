The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Supporters of rebel Tiger leader defect
 Two LTTE fighters loyal to Karuna flee from the rebel camp near Batticaloa. (AFP)Colombo, April 12 (Reuters): Thousands of fighters loyal to a Sri Lankan breakaway rebel commander defected today, military officials said, after Tamil Tiger offensives that cast a cloud over efforts to end the islands 20-year civil war.																								Cadres loyal to Tamil Tiger eastern commander Karuna have been locked in a standoff with the northern-based Tigers since early March, when Karuna split from the group with about 6,000 of its 15,000 fighters, shattering the groups internal discipline.																								These people are all leaving the eastern command of Karuna. There is a mass exodus. People are leaving their arms to their homes. They say they are leaving the LTTE, one military official in the east said.																								The LTTE launched an offensive on Friday to retake control of territory held by Karuna  the nom de guerre for V. Muralitharan  and have reported major inroads, although they have been mostly bloodless since clashes overnight on Friday.																								The military official estimated that more than 2,000 of Karunas fighters had given up and were returning to their villages rather than rejoining the main Tiger group.																								The pro-rebel Tamilnet website said the Tigers had encountered no resistance when they moved into new areas of Karunas territory today and added that they had taken over the main newspaper he controlled.																								Several military units of the LTTE, which moved from different directions, took control... around Monday noon, the Tamilnet report said. Karunas faction could not be reached for comment. A second Tamilnet report said he had retreated to a jungle hideout and his main base camp was deserted.																								Military officials and truce monitors said there were unconfirmed reports that Karuna had given up the fight.																								But it seemed unlikely the Tigers would end their offensive without launching an attack on their main target after they vowed to get rid of Karuna from our soil and in the past have killed anyone who challenged their authority.

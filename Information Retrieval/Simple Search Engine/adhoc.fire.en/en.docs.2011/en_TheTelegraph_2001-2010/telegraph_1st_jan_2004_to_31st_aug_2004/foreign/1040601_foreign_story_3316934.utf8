Shield lossAddis Ababa (Reuters): A Scottish professor has returned to Ethiopia a silver-decorated shield stolen from Emperor Tewodros 136 years ago by British troops, who made off with it and other treasures on 15 elephants and 200 mules. Throughout my childhood the shield was hanging in the dining room of my parents house, Fiona Wilson said on Sunday at a ceremony in which she handed over the shield to the Institute of Ethiopian Studies of the Addis Ababa University. Wilson said her grandfather bought the shield in the 1890s from a dealer and everyone believed it was Scottish.

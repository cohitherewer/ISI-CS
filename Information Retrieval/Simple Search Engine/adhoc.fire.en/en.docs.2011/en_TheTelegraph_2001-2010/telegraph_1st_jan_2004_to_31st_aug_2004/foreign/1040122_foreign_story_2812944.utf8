 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Alliance angers Tigers
																								Colombo, Jan. 21 (Reuters): A political alliance between President Chandrika Kumaratungas party and a hardline Marxist party could lead Sri Lanka back into war, the Tamil Tiger rebels warned today.																								Although the new party  the United Peoples Freedom Alliance  said it would continue a peace bid with the Tigers if it came to power in elections that are expected soon, its rhetoric has upset the LTTE.																								This anti-peace political pact articulating an incoherent, confused and mutually contradictory position on a serious national issue might create objective conditions for the resumption of war, the rebels chief negotiator, Anton Balasingham, told the pro-rebel Tamilnet website.																								He said the new party signaled the re-emergence of Sinhala-Buddhist chauvinistic forces, adding it was opposed to peace and peaceful resolution of the ethnic conflict.																								The party was formed to take on the government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, raising the possibility of early elections.																								It alters the political landscape and comes as a peace process to end a 20-year separatist war by the LTTE in the north and east of the island has been frozen by a power struggle between Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe.																								The two are elected separately, but have huge differences over the peace process and Kumaratunga seized control of three ministries in November, saying Wickremesinghe was endangering Sri Lankas security by giving away too much to the LTTE.																								Wickremesinghe signed a Norwegian-brokered ceasefire that has stopped the bloodshed for the last two years.																								Balasingham also rejected a pact signed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the Marxist Peoples Liberation (JVP) that outlined the new partys position, including a reference to negotiating with groups other than the Tigers.																								We wish to state emphatically that our liberation organisation will not enter into negotiations with anyone who does not recognise the LTTE as the sole and authentic representative of the Tamil people, Balasingham said.																								Earlier today, alliance member and former foreign minister Lakshman Kadiragamar said the party wanted a negotiated settlement to the islands 20-year civil war. We are not on a path back to war. We are prepared to talk, he said.																								Other party members said the role of Norway would be reviewed, saying the peace mediator was biased even though the truce has been the longest since the war started in 1983.																								Norway was asked to help by Kumaratunga, who is also the only person who can call parliamentary elections.																								Kadiragamar said the alliance would negotiate with the rebels despite disagreeing with many of their proposals for an interim administration in the north and east.

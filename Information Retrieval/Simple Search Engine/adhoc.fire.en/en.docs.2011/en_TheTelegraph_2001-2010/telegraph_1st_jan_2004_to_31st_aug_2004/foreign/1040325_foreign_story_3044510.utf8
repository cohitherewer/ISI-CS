 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Osama or no Osama, 9/11 wouldve happened: US
																								Washington, March 24 (Reuters): Even if the US had killed or captured al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden before the September 11, 2001, attacks, it would not have prevented the hijacked plane attacks on America, defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld said yesterday.																								He and other top officials of the Bush and Clinton administrations told the national commission investigating the September 11 attacks that eliminating bin Laden, invading Afghanistan or bombing al Qaida training camps in the months leading up to the attacks would not have prevented them.																								Even if bin Laden had been captured or killed in the weeks before 9/11, no one I know believes it would have prevented 9/11, Rumsfeld told the commission at a hearing.																								The plot had already been set in motion and the attacks on New York and Washington that killed about 3,000 people would have been seen as retaliation for any US strikes, the officials said.																								Rumsfeld and his predecessor William Cohen as well as secretary of state Colin Powell and his predecessor Madeleine Albright, were questioned about why they had not taken more aggressive action against al Qaida in Afghanistan before September 11.																								There were at least four potential opportunities to try to kill bin Laden in Afghanistan from December 1998 to July 1999. Cruise missile strikes were prepared but never approved for fear of civilian casualties and because of doubts that bin Laden would still be there when a missile landed hours later.																								One of those opportunities came in February 1999 when intelligence reports pinpointed bin Laden near a hunting camp in the Helmand province of Afghanistan used by visitors from the United Arab Emirates.																								CIA officials told the commission that policymakers were concerned that a strike might kill an Emirati prince or other senior officials who might be with bin Laden or nearby. The commission staff report said one CIA official believes today that this was a lost opportunity to kill bin Laden before 9/11. 																								Cohen, who was defence secretary under President Clinton, reminded the commission that when that administration bombed a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in 1998 that it believed might help bin Laden acquire chemical weapons, it met a lot of public criticism that it was a mistake. He said he would do it again. Rumsfeld said before the attacks he knew of no intelligence that al Qaida was planning to hijack planes and crash them into buildings in the US.																								Powell told the hearing: Anything we might have done against al Qaida in this period or against Osama bin Laden may or may not have had any influence on these people who were already in this country, already had their instructions, were already burrowed in and were getting ready to commit the crimes that we saw on 9/11.

 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Carlos aide acquitted of France raids
																								Berlin, Aug. 23 (Reuters): A German court acquitted Johannes Weinrich, suspected right-hand man of international guerrilla Carlos the Jackal, today of charges that he took part in three bomb attacks in France more than 20 years ago.																								The court ruled there was not enough evidence that Weinrich, already serving a life sentence in Germany for bombing a French cultural centre in Berlin in 1983, participated in the three bomb attacks which killed six people in France.																								The meagre results of the investigation could not result in a conviction, said Judge Ralph Ehestaedt. The acquittal is an absolutely unsatisfactory result for the victims.																								The judge said his court had no choice as the French prosecution documents regarding Carlos were outdated and incomplete. However, the judge said there was no doubt that Weinrich had been a top member of the gang led by Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias Carlos, who is serving a life term in France.

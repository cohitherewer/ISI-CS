One Australian and six British men made it to the top of the 7,045-metre Tibetan peak Lhakpa Ri near Mount Everest carrying tables, chairs and white tie dinner suits earlier this month. Gales forced them back to 6,805 metres for the sumptuous meal.																						Great party, team leader Henry Shelford said by telephone after returning to Britain. Shame about the atmosphere.																																	The Guinness World Records said it was verifying the claim that the team, who did not have previous mountaineering experience, had broken the previous record of 6,768 metres for the highest formal dinner, set by Australian climbers in 1989.																																	Scotsman Robbie Aitken wore a kilt  but he broke with the tradition of wearing nothing underneath. He was not a true Scot, otherwise he would not have come back in one piece, Shelford said.

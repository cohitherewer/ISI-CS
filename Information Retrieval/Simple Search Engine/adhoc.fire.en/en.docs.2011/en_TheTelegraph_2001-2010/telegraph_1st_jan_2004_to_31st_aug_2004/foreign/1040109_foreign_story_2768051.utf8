 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Iran ready for US talks based on mutual respect
				 	 Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi. (Reuters)																								Tehran, Jan. 8 (Reuters): Irans foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi said Tehran was willing to resume dialogue with the US, provided the talks were based on mutual respect, state television reported today.																								Kharrazi added that Irans recent negotiations with European countries over its nuclear programme, which culminated in Iran agreeing to snap inspections of nuclear facilities, was an example to Washington of how outstanding problems can be solved.																								But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word on all state matters, said in a televised speech that deep-rooted problems between the two arch-foes remained and accused Washington of trying to exploit Irans recent earthquake for political gain.																								Speculation has mounted in recent days that the two countries may be edging towards some kind of rapprochement, after US officials spoke of a willingness to resume a limited dialogue on specific issues and Washington sent humanitarian aid to victims of the devastating December 26 earthquake in Bam. 																								Iran is ready to negotiate with all countries and America is no exception, Kharrazi told state television.																								If it (Washington) adopts a new approach to Iran and is ready to interact with us based on mutual respect and the principle of equality, the atmosphere will change remarkably.																								Washington cut ties with Iran shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution and has labelled it part of an axis of evil.																								Khamenei said US aid for Bam, which included waiving some banking restrictions to speed the flow of donations, does not mean that the long-standing, continuous, deep and rooted enmity of the arrogant American regime towards the Iranian nation will be forgotten.																								Khameneis comments reflected the long-standing split between Irans reformers and hardliners on how to deal with the superpower the conservatives call the Great Satan.																								In his speech, broadcast on state television, Khamenei said Washington had used the Bam quake as an opportunity... to pursue their political goals.																								They hide their iron fist in a silk glove, he said.																								Khamenei frequently undercuts efforts by reformist officials to improve ties with Washington and in the past has even forbidden any talk in Iran about restoring ties with the US, arguing it would be a betrayal of the Islamic revolution.																								Unlike the EU, which has held a policy of critical engagement with Iran for the last few years, Washington has largely shunned Iranian officials.																								But Kharrazi said Irans negotiations with Britain, France and Germany, which led to Tehrans agreement last October to cooperate fully with UN inspectors, was a better approach.																								Our recent experience with Europe on the nuclear issue proved that problems can be solved by negotiation, he said.																								While adopting a softer tone in recent days both Tehran and Washington have set pre-conditions for improving relations.																								Washington wants Tehran to hand over detained al Qaida suspects, abandon its nuclear programme and stop backing Palestinian militant groups that attack Israel.																								Iran has called on Washington to lift economic sanctions imposed in 1995, which among other things prevent US companies from investing in Opecs second largest oil producer or trading in Iranian oil.																								Tehran also wants Washington to hand over members of the armed Iranian Opposition group the Peoples Mujahideen being held by US forces in Iraq and to abandon efforts to weaken Irans clerical leadership.

 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 China hits growth brake to care for the poor

(AFP)																								Beijing, March 5 (Reuters): Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao vowed in his annual address to parliament today to rein in the economy after years of breakneck growth and to throw a lifeline to hundreds of millions of poor in the countryside.																								Wen outlined steps to cut taxes and increase subsidies in rural areas  home to 800 million of Chinas 1.3 billion people  that have lagged the wealthy cities and coastal regions.																								Solving the problems of agriculture, villages and farmers is one of the most crucial parts of our entire work, Wen told the opening of the National Peoples Congress as he stood under a huge red and gold national seal flanked by Chinas top leaders.																								The government fears a widening wealth gap, driven by blistering economic growth, could spark social unrest and undermine its authority over the countrys 1.3 billion people and Wen set a 2004 growth target of 7 per cent, compared with a rise in GDP of 9.1 per cent in 2003.																								He put forward a series of steps aimed at taming the economy, such as a clamp on credit and cutting state stimulus spending. He is trying to shepherd the economy through troubles caused by an ailing banking sector, inefficient state enterprises and a shaky legal system.																								Wen laid out a stark list of other challenges facing the worlds sixth largest economy  excessive and haphazard investment, redundant construction, strains between supply and demand in energy, transport and raw materials, a drop in grain production and illegal appropriation of farm land.																								Rural incomes have grown too slowly; the task of increasing employment and social security is arduous; development in different regions of the country is not balanced; the income gap is too wide among some members of society and pressure on resources and the environment is mounting, he said.																								The government will shoulder heavy responsibilities for years to come. We must remain sober-minded, become more aware of potential problems and enhance our sense of historical responsibility.																								Nearly 3,000 delegates packed into Beijings imposing Great Hall of the People. Police ringed the building and fanned out across the capital to trail dissidents and sweep out-of-town petitioners away from government offices. The annual parliament session, which ends on March 14, is widely regarded as a rubber stamp to Communist Party policy. 																								In his one-hour-50-minute speech, interrupted at times by polite applause, Wen said China would crack down on organised crime, terrorism and deepen the battle against cults, an apparent reference to the banned Falun Gong spiritual group.																								Wen called for a resumption of talks with rival Taiwan under the one-China principle, a renewed peace overture that the self-governed democratic island was likely to reject.																								He offered the first signs the new leadership may be ready to embrace political reform and renewed a pledge to cut 200,000 more jobs from the worlds largest army by the end of 2005.																								The report reflected the fact that Wens job is to chart the course of the worlds fastest-growing economy as it gobbles up resources and spits out a vast array of cheap exports.

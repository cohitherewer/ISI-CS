 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Israel Snow White amp; dwarf show
				 	 Zvi Mazel 																								Jerusalem, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Prime Minister Ariel Sharon praised Israels ambassador to Sweden today for wrecking a Stockholm art exhibit depicting a Palestinian suicide bomber and said the envoy had struck a blow against anti-Semitism.																								The expatriate Israeli artist who created Snow White and the Madness of Truth however called the envoy, Zvi Mazel, an intellectual dwarf.																								Mazel, attending the opening of an art exhibition on Friday linked to an anti-genocide conference, said he saw red on encountering Dror Feilers rectangular basin filled with red fluid.																								On the symbolic blood floated a boat, Snovit (Snow White in Swedish) written on its side, which carried a portrait of suicide bomber Hanadi Jaradat, who killed herself and 22 Israelis in a restaurant in northern Israel in October.																								Mazel disconnected the electrical cables of spotlights that surrounded the work, shoving one of the lights into the basin and Israel into a diplomatic spat with Sweden.																								Sharon devoted his public opening remarks at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting to defending Mazel, a veteran diplomat. I called the Israeli ambassador... and thanked him for his stand against the growing wave of anti-Semitism in the world, the Prime Minister said. I told him the government stands behind him.																								Mazels attack dominated the news in Israel, where many expressed outrage at the artworks use of a fairy tale theme in connection with suicide bombing.																								One right-wing legislator from Haifa, where the bombing took place, said he would lobby the city to change the name of its Sweden Street in protest.																								Defending his work against accusations that it glorified Jaradats attack, Feiler said: Im absolutely opposed to suicide bombers. I think it is horrible and it doesnt serve their cause.																								Feiler, who has lived in Sweden since 1973, is active in Jews for Israeli-Palestinian Peace, a Stockholm-based group opposed to Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.																								Swedens foreign ministry said Mazel had behaved improperly and that it would summon him for talks tomorrow to hear his side of the incident.																								The Israeli foreign ministry summoned the Swedish ambassador to lodge its own protest. 																								It provoked the Israeli ambassador very, very much. He went furious, said Kristian Berg, director of the Historical Museum where the artwork is on display.

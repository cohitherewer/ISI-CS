(AFP)																								Baghdad, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Iraqs Prime Minister announced a limited amnesty for Iraqi insurgents today and extended an olive branch to radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose loyalists have staged an uprising in several cities.																								Iyad Allawi said there was no need for emergency laws to stabilise Iraq, adding he was getting positive messages from Sadr, whose men have fought foreign and Iraqi forces over the past three days.																								But he cracked down on Arab satellite channel al Jazeera, banning it for a month for allegedly inciting violence. We do not feel that there is a need for emergency law, the situation is still under control despite what the media is trying to propagate, Allawi told a news conference.																								There are some elements from outside Iraq and there is a third kind of people who are involved in crimes against the stability and security in some provinces. The Iraqi forces and police forces up to now have been in control.																								A senior Iraqi official, appearing with Allawi, said the amnesty would last for 30 days. He said it would not apply to insurgents who have murdered, raped, looted or been involved in destroying government buildings. This law is directed towards individuals who have committed minor crimes and have not yet been apprehended or prosecuted, Allawi said.																								This order has been established to allow citizens to rejoin the civil society and participate in the reconstruction of their country instead of wasting their lives pointlessly towards a lost cause.																								The Prime Minister reiterated his commitment to Iraqs political transition, saying a national conference would go ahead on August 15 to choose a council to oversee the interim government, followed by elections in January.																								US Marines battled Shia militiamen in Najaf for a third day today as the death toll mounted in the worst bout of fighting in Iraq in four months. The Marines said they had killed 300 fighters of Sadrs Mehdi Army militia. But a militia spokesman said only 36 had died in several Iraqi cities from clashes.																								A militant group claiming links to al Qaida said today its cells in Italy were ready to strike if the country did not withdraw troops from Iraq before an August 15 deadline it set a week ago.

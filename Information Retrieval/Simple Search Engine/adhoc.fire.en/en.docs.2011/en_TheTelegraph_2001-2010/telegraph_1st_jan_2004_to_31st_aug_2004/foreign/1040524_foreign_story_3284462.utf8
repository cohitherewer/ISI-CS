Brussels, May 23 (Reuters): If they can bother to get off the couch, 60 million young people from a reunited Europe are eligible to vote in next months elections for European Parliament.																								Traditionally apolitical, if not apathetic, generation X rarely registers in the debate. Even less so when it comes to European politics.																								Briton Alison Goldsworthy, a 21-year-old student, bucks the trend and is standing as a candidate. It (European Parliament) is so irrelevant to people, she said at a cross-party event to launch young candidates under 35. She said she had never even received a letter from her local Member of European Parliament.																								Goldsworthy wants to inject some youthful verve into the EU assembly in contrast to the old men in suits.																								Standing for the pro-EU centrist Liberal Democrat party, she faces a battle to get elected in Britain, where voter turnout in the 1999 European Parliament elections hit an historic low of just 24 per cent, the lowest in the EU.																								Do not expect a flood of e-mails or text messages to get the technology savvy young wired up to vote from June 10-13.																								Though Britain conducted the first major electronic-voting experiment in local government polls in 2003, it has been shelved for this election.																								Stephen Coleman, visiting professor in e-Democracy at Oxford University, said e-mail, text messages and web casts would be useful tools for European deputies to target citizens because constituencies are normally very large and diverse.																								But communication had to be interactive so people could respond to wannabe politicians, he said, adding that technology was no quick fix to increasing turnout.																								British candidates have already missed the boat in hitting the information highway to sell themselves, Coleman said.																								They should have been thinking of it six months ago, he said, adding that collective hand-wringing about low turnout especially among young people would be too late.																								The expanded EU, now a 25-nation bloc with 450 million citizens, will send 732 deputies to European Parliament in the first pan-Europe ballot since enlargement on May 1.																								As the only directly elected EU body, the legislature is the voice of Europes citizens. Though a minnow in foreign policy, it has led the way in pushing tough environmental and food safety legislation and transparent financial regulation.																								Polish candidate Ania Skrzypek, 24, is eager to be part of the first wave of deputies from the 10 predominantly Central and Eastern Europeans countries who are now part of the club.																								She wants to change the negative stereotype of her country  the largest of the new member states  as a political bruiser, seeking to dominate proceedings from day one.																								The first task is to make people go and vote, said Skrzypek, a Socialist, adding that her main aim was to reduce youth unemployment of 42 per cent in her homeland.																								Fellow newcomer Jan Hamacek, 26, a Socialist candidate from the Czech Republic, highlighted the high rates of joblessness among young educated people.																								But he said telling university graduates about the benefits of EU membership was like preaching to the converted  the campaign had to be widened to young people working in factories.																								They think the EU will take their jobs away, he said. We have to tell them they can benefit from it.																								Hamacek welcomed the historic return to the European fold. Weve been separated for 50 years, he said, confiding his joy at now joining the EU queue at passport control in airports.																								For French Green candidate, Maud Lelievre, 28, the issues are more practical.																								She is already an elected politician, working in the town hall of a Paris suburb. While promoting an environmental agenda, she also wants to open her homeland, a founding member of the EU, to Europe by encouraging students to study abroad.																								Its impossible to spend a year in another country, she said, criticising the competitive French education system where students focus on getting into the best universities from an early age and resist going abroad to learn languages.																								The March 11 Madrid bombings changed everything for Spanish Green candidate Raul Romeva, 33. He said the youth vote was crucial in toppling the sitting government in the general elections held in the aftermath of the attack.

 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Killer flu strain returns to haunt Asia
																								Bangkok, July 7 (Reuters): The strain of bird flu which killed 24 people in Southeast Asia early this year has erupted again in Thailand and China, but authorities in both countries said today the outbreaks were under control.																								Thailand said it had confirmed outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of bird flu, which first emerged in Hong Kong in 1997, at two farms near towns north of Bangkok. China said the virus had struck a farm in central Anhui province, 300 km west of Shanghai. 																								Both governments were quick to add that the new outbreaks were being dealt with decisively and a repeat of the epidemic that swept across much of Asia earlier this year was unlikely. That outbreak killed 16 people in Vietnam and eight in Thailand. About 100 million fowl died or were culled, more than 40 million of them in Thailand.																								The outbreak has come under control in Anhui, the semi-official China News Service said of the latest scare on its website:www.chinanews.com.cn.																								Nevertheless, a provincial official said the family which owned the infected farm and those who had close contact with them had been isolated and were under observation. Officials ordered the culling of all poultry within a 3-km radius of the farm. Poultry within a 5-km radius was being vaccinated.																								Next we will strengthen quarantining of local agricultural product markets to prevent the spread of bird flu to human beings, the official said.

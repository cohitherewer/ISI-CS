 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Jerusalem bus bomber kills 8
																								Jerusalem, Feb. 22 (Reuters): A Palestinian suicide bomber killed eight people on a crowded Jerusalem bus today on the eve of World Court hearings into a controversial barrier Israel says will ensure its security against such attacks.																								Police said around 60 people were wounded in the blast, which turned the green number 14 bus into a charred skeleton at a busy intersection near the Inbal Hotel, where leaders of major US Jewish organisations were meeting.																								People were screaming mommy, daddy. There were body parts everywhere including some hands and feet scattered outside the bus, medic Reuven Pohl said.																								The World Court begins hearings in The Hague tomorrow on the legality of the West Bank barrier that Israel says keeps suicide bombers out, but which Palestinians call a land grab.																								The militant group al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, part of President Yasser Arafats Fatah faction, claimed responsibility for the bombing and released a farewell video showing the bomber seated in front of the groups flag. 																								Al-Aqsa named the bomber as Mohammed Zaal, a 23-year-old from Hussan village near the West Bank town of Bethlehem. 																								In a statement it called the barrier a Nazi wall which will not stop us attacking. It later issued a clarification denying involvement in the bombing, which it said only served Israeli propaganda interests. 																								It did not explain why it had issued the earlier statement or the video.																								Arafats office condemned the bombing and called the timing deliberate and harmful for the diplomatic campaign against the barrier. The top Palestinian security body vowed to bring those responsible to justice.																								When one Israeli minister suggested at todays cabinet meeting that the attack could be seen as a protest against the barrier, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said: We dont have to look for a reason why Jews are killed and they wont stop killing Jews ever.																								The bomber struck during the morning rush hour at the start of the Israeli work week. Police said the bomb was packed with metal shards to make it more deadly.																								The Palestinian murderers have again shown that Israel is not the aggressor, the Palestinians are, and that the fence was not meant for anything other than to save lives, justice minister Yosef Lapid said.																								I hope that the 15 justices in The Hague understand the message.... If there was a fence around Jerusalem there would not have been an attack today.

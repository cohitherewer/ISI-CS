 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Canada link to UK terror group
																								London, April 1 (Reuters): British police said today they are working with Canadian authorities after a software developer was charged in Ottawa with aiding a terrorist group in Britain and Canada.																								Mohammed Momin Khawaja, a 29-year-old Canadian with Pakistani parents, was arrested at work on Monday by Canadian police who accuse him of knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity in Ottawa and London.																								Details of his arrest and charge came as British police were given three more days to quiz eight men arrested during London and southeast England in dawn raids on Tuesday in Britains biggest anti-terror operation since the September 11 2001 attacks.																								Both Canadian police and British anti-terror officers were tight-lipped about whether Khawajas arrest was directly linked to the London swoop in which officers found half a tonne of ammonium nitrate fertiliser  prime bomb-making material.																								We are aware of the developments in Canada and are liaising with the Canadian authorities, a UK police spokeswoman said. 																								She declined to comment on whether British officers had flown to Canada to work with police there. Canadian justice minister Irwin Cotler said yesterday he had no details about the investigation. 																								The arrest of Khawaja, a computer expert, fuelled British newspaper speculation that the UK suspects had been using e-mails to communicate with al Qaida mentors abroad. Minister resigns																								British immigration minister Beverley Hughes resigned today after officials exposed lax controls which allowed migrants from Romania and Bulgaria to enter the country with forged papers.																								Hughes, 54, quit for unwittingly misleading parliament over the affair after days of media and political attacks.																								Immigration is set to be a key issue at the next election, expected next year, with Prime Minister Tony Blair keen to counter opposition claims that his government is too liberal in allowing asylum seekers and new immigrants into Britain.																								Hughes was replaced by Des Browne, a junior minister in the work and pensions department, indicating that any wider reshuffle will not spill over to major government figures.

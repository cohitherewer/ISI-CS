 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 US delaying talks: Iraqis
				 	 A wounded boy cries in a Baghdad hospital after the blast. (Reuters)																								Baghdad, May 31 (Reuters): Iraqi politicians said talks scheduled for today to decide posts in a new government had been delayed by one day at Americas behest and complained that Washington was meddling in the selection process.																								The Americans have asked for the meeting to be delayed until tomorrow, said Mahmoud Othman, a member of the US-appointed governing council.																								Iraqs US-led authorities are due to formally hand over to an interim Iraqi government on June 30. Iyad Allawi, who has worked with the CIA against Saddam Hussein, was last week named Prime Minister.																								US officials, a UN envoy and members of the governing council have been trying to agree on the composition of the new government, but council members and US officials are at odds over who should be the new President, council members say.																								The Iraqis have been pushing for Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar, a civil engineer who left Iraq in 1990, while US officials want the largely ceremonial position to go to Adnan Pachachi, a former Iraqi foreign minister.																								Theres quite a lot of interference. They should let the Iraqis decide for themselves. This is an Iraqi affair, Othman said. Pachachi has said the council does not have the power to select a President.																								A source close to the governing council said its members saw Yawar, a Sunni Arab in his mid-forties, as a unifying figure, who was on good terms with Iraqs main Sunni, Shia and Kurdish communities and all the councils members.																								By contrast, some council members saw 81-year-old Pachachi, also a Sunni Arab, as a supporter of Arab nationalism  a doctrine that was a central plank of Saddam Husseins ousted Baath Party, the source said. He was not on good terms with some Shia and Kurdish members of the council.																								Pachachis legitimacy was also limited because he was not seen to have played an active role in fighting Saddams regime from abroad, the source added.																								Jawad al-Boulani, an aide to council member Abdulkarim al-Muhammadawi of the Iraqi Hizbollah party, said UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and Paul Bremer, the top US official in Iraq, were marginalising council members in the talks and not consulting Iraqi groups outside the council.Baghdad blast																								A car bomb blew up on a busy Baghdad street today, killing four people and wounding 25, witnesses and US military officials said. The blast cut down pedestrians not far from the offices of Iraqs new Prime Minister-designate and the US administrative headquarters, but it was unclear where the bombers were heading when the car exploded on al-Kindi street.

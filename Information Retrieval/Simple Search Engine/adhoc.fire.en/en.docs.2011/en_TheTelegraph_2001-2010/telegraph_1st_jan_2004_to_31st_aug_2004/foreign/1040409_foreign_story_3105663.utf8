 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Dostum forces seize north city
																								Kabul, April 8 (Reuters): Forces of a renegade adviser to President Hamid Karzai overran the capital of a northern province today, creating a fresh security headache for Afghanistans western-backed government.																								General Abdul Rashid Dostums largely ethnic Uzbek militia invaded Faryab from neighbouring provinces yesterday, prompting the central government to send national troops there today in an attempt to maintain control.																								Dostum loyalists have entered Maimana city, interior minister Ali Ahmad Jalai said. This is an unconstitutional act of interference by General Dostum. 																								He said the commander of the Maimanas military forces General Mohammad Hashim Habibi had left the city with his men, while the governor, Anayatullah Anayat, was at the airport.																								Jalali said the first batch of a force of 750 national army troops had already arrived in Maimana. With the deployment of the national army, the situation will improve, he said.																								Presidential spokesman Jawed Ludin said an emergency National Security Council meeting chaired by Karzai had heard the city fell to irresponsible armed individuals from neighbouring provinces and areas around Maimana.																								They should withdraw from the area immediately, he said.																								UN spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said United Nations staff in Maimana had reported fighting there but he had no details.																								According to a spokeswoman for the British military, Flight Lieutentant Emma Matthews, members of a British civilian-military Provincial Reconstruction Team were in Maimana and would assist the Afghan authorities in stabilising the situation. There have been no injuries among coalition forces and we are not aware of any civilian injuries, she said. A soldier from Habibis provincial militia said the general was currently in Belcheragh, about 40 km east of Maimana. The government has defended Anayat as its legitimate representative in Faryab. General Dostum is an adviser to the President, Ludin said.However, that does not give him the right to deploy forces or get involved in any military operational issues.

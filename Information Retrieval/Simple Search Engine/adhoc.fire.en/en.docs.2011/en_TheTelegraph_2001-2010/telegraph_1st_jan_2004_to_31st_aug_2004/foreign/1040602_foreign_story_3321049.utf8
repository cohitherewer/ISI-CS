 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Saudi forces battle militants near Mecca
				 	 Saudi soldiers guard the entrance of the Oasis residential compound in the eastern city of Khobar. (AFP)																								Riyadh, June 1 (Reuters): Saudi police fought a gunbattle with suspected Islamic militants who opened fire on a check-point in western Saudi Arabia today, a government source said.																								The shootout occurred near the city of Taif, near Mecca, after gunmen fired on police manning the check-point in the mountainous region, the source said. There were no reports so far of casualties, he added.																								A local journalist told Al Jazeera television channel that police were hunting for the men in nearby mountains. Saudi Arabia has tightened security around western targets after a weekend rampage by Islamic militants on the opposite side of the vast country which killed 22 civilians in the eastern city of Khobar. Three of the attackers escaped. 																								It was not immediately clear if there was any link between todays gunbattle and the weekend violence. Saudi Arabia has been locked in battle in the past year with militants linked to Saudi-born Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network, which is trying to bring down the US-backed monarchy. 																								In Khobar, eastern Saudi Arabia, Grief gave way to anger today as many foreigners said the weekend massacre could have been averted if security had been tighter.																								My reaction on Saturday morning was shock. On Sunday morning it was grief and on Monday morning it was anger because some of this could have been prevented, said a senior American executive who declined to be named.																								This was a tragic event. I lost some friends. These killers were incited and they are murderers and cowards, he said, adding that at least four companies had ordered the evacuation of their employees dependents.																								Four militants killed 22 people, mainly westerners and Asians, in a shooting and hostage-taking spree on Saturday and Sunday that targeted foreign oil firms and housing compounds. Three of the men escaped a massive security sweep, raising fears of further attacks in the worlds largest oil exporter.																								Many foreigners directed their rage at security and compound officials who had failed to improve security. They said security forces arrived too late to limit the bloodbath.																								What can expats do more than were doing? asked Robert, an American oil company employee. We cant add anything more to our security. Our security is in the hands of our companies. We all live in compounds and look at what happened.																								Many foreigners were especially worried about the safety of their families and had sent them home earlier than usual for the summer vacation. 																								Weve been asking everyone to harden their security. The two places that were attacked had increased security checks for cars entering the complexes but not on people walking in, the US businessman explained. The interior ministry said the gunmen had walked into the headquarters of the oil firms.																								Foreigners form the bulk of the workforce in Saudi Arabias oil-producing eastern region. Most enjoy affluent lifestyles in a region of the ultra-conservative kingdom where Saudis are traditionally more accommodating of their customs. But many said their peace of mind vanished overnight after the Khobar assault, and that they were avoiding hotels, restaurants and other places frequented by westerners.

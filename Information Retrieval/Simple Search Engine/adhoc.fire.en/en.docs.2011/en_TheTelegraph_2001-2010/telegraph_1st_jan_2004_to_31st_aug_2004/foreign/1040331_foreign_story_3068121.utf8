The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Tiger split claims poll victim
				 	 A policeman keeps watch as Buddhist monks attend their final election campaign rally in Colombo. (AFP)																								Colombo, March 30 (Reuters): A Tamil candidate standing in Sri Lankas parliamentary elections this week was shot and killed today, apparently the victim of a split among the countrys Tiger rebels.																								The rift in the LTTE has overshadowed much of the run-up to Fridays parliamentary vote, raising questions on whether the winner will be able to quickly get stalled peace talks with them back on track.																								The killing of Rajan Sathiyamoorthy of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) by unidentified gunmen in Batticaloa town on the east coast was the third political shooting in three days. Police said Sathiyamoorthy was gunned down in his home along with a relative. Two others were wounded.																								We have intensified patrols and roadblocks and strengthened security, said Batticaloa senior superintendent of police Lasantha de Silva. 																								Election monitors condemned the killing, saying it was an attack on the islands democratic system.																								It would seem that forces outside this election are intent on influencing the outcome and subverting the democratic process. They must not be allowed to do so, said John Cushnahan, chief EU election observer. No one has claimed responsibility, but diplomats and a pro-rebel website (www.tamilnet.com) identified Sathiyamoorthy as close to Karuna, the eastern commander who broke with the rebel leadership earlier this month.																								Sathiyamoorthy has organised protests in the area for Karuna, who controls large areas of the east while the north is controlled by the main faction of the Tigers, who in the past have murdered opposing Tamil politicians.																								Although Sri Lankan army officials say there is no sign the two sides are getting ready to fight, if that happened it could drag in the military. The Tigers have been fighting the government dominated by the Sinhalese majority since 1983 for a separate state for Tamils in the north and east, but signed a ceasefire more than two years ago.																								Talks broke down last April, fuelling a feud between President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over how to handle peace efforts.

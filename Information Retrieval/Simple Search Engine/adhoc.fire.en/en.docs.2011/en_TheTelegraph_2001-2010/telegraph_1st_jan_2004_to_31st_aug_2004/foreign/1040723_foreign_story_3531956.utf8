 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Di ex-lover arrested on drug charges
 James Hewitt 																								London, July 22 (Reuters): James Hewitt, one-time lover of Britains late Princess Diana, has been freed on bail after being arrested overnight at a west London bar on suspicion of possessing illegal drugs, police said today.																								A 46-year-old man has been bailed to return to a London police station in September, a spokeswoman said when asked if Hewitt had been released after being held overnight. 																								An unnamed 37-year-old woman, arrested in the bar with Hewitt, was also freed on bail.																								Both were arrested late yesterday on suspicion of possessing illegal class A drugs  a category which includes cocaine and heroin.																								Hewitt was dubbed a rat and the vilest man in Britain by national newspapers after he sold the story of his secret love affair with Diana as her marriage to heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles publicly came apart. Diana, who was later divorced from Charles and who died in a Paris car crash in August 1997, was said to have been devastated at his public betrayal of their five-year affair. 																								Even Hewitts friends began referring to him as timeshare as he simultaneously declared his love of Diana, proposed to his girlfriend and had an affair with a Bosnian refugee.																								The former polo-playing officer in one of Britains premier army regiments, who was immediately ostracised by his fellow officers, is reported to have made a small fortune out of selling the couples secrets. After Dianas death, Hewitt also tried to sell intimate love letters from her but failed to find a buyer willing to pay the 10 million asking price.

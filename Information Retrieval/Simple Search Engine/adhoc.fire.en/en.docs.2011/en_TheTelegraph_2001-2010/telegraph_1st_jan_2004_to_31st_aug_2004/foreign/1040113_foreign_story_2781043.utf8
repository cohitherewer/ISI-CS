 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Tigers not happy with Lanka feud
																								Kilinochchi, Jan. 12 (Reuters): A feud between Sri Lankas President and Prime Minister was testing the patience of Tamil Tiger rebels in their bid to end 20 years of war but they would not break the islands truce, a rebel leader said.																								Rebel political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan said today the fate of the peace process was in the hands of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Chandrika Kumaratunga, whose power struggle has raised worries about whether the two-year-old ceasefire will hold.																								It all depends on the government and the military machine of the government to ensure that the Tamil people are not pushed towards such a situation to take up arms ever again, he said.																								But Thamilselvan added the patience of the Tamil people was wearing thin. 																								The anticipation is now beginning to dwindle and at a time when the people become restless, then the responsibility of the organisation is such that we have definitely to respond to the feelings of the people, Thamilselvan said.																								But he said the LTTE, accused of breaking four previous truces, would not be the first to break the current ceasefire, which silenced the guns after the war that killed 64,000 people.

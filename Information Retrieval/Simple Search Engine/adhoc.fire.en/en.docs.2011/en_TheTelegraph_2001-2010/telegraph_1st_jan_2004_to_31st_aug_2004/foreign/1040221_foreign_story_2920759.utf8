 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Kerry 28-letter defence: jobs
 LISA GETTER																								Washington (Massachusetts), Feb. 20: Senator John F. Kerry said yesterday that he was not swayed by campaign contributions when he sent 28 letters in support of a San Diego defence contractor who pleaded guilty last week to illegally funnelling him money.																								Responding to a report in the Los Angeles Times, Kerry said in a television interview on CNN that he fought for jobs in Massachusetts. 																								Every person in the US Senate and Congress fights for their state, and there are people who support them for those reasons, obviously, he said during an interview on CNNs Inside Politics.																								Between 1996 and 1999, Kerry sent the letters to fellow members of Congress and officials in the Pentagon, asking that they free up funds for a missile system that was being developed by Science and Applied Technology Inc., a San Diego firm run by Parthasarathi Majumder. 																								A Massachusetts firm, Millitech, also worked on the project.																								Majumder pleaded guilty last week to illegally reimbursing employees, friends and contractors for the money they contributed to Kerry. 																								Prosecutors said the lawmakers did not know the funds they received were tainted.																								Kerry, the current Democratic presidential front-runner, said he was never swayed by campaign money or special interests.																								They havent got anything for it, he said last month of lobbyists and groups that have contributed to his campaigns. 																								Majumder and his company, however, did get an assist with Kerrys letter-writing appeals. Former employees recalled yesterday that they were encouraged to attend a fundraiser for Kerry in Woodland Hills in December 1998.																								Of the roughly $25,000 received from Majumder and his employees, Kerry donated $13,000 to charity last week  the amount prosecutors could prove was tainted  two days before Majumder pleaded guilty.																								Kerry dismissed a suggestion that his lobbying effort for the guided missile programme was a quid pro quo for the contributions. 																								Ive gone out and raised money from individual Americans. And if you added up all the money in my lifetime thats been given to me by lobbyists, anybody whos lobbied for anything, its about one per cent of the total of everything Ive done, he told CNN.																								Kerry was also asked about his dealings with Majumder in a television interview on the PBS channel. He repeated his vow to curb the power of special interests in Washington. And when Im President, were going to get the big money out of American politics, he said. 					 LOS ANGELES TIMES- WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

				 	 Mark Thatchers wife Diane in Cape Town. (Reuters)																								Cape Town, Aug. 26 (Reuters): The son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was planning to leave South Africa before his arrest on suspicion of involvement in a coup attempt in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, police said today.																								Sipho Ngwema, spokesman for the FBI-style Scorpions unit which arrested Mark Thatcher yesterday, said the 51-year-old businessman had put his luxurious Cape Town house up for sale and was winding up other aspects of his life in the country.																								It looks as if he was planning to leave the country for good, Ngwema said.																								We did receive information that he was winding up (his affairs in Cape Town). But we are quite satisfied now with the conditions that are in place.																								A Cape Town court yesterday put Thatcher, who has protested his innocence, under what amounts to house arrest until he pays a two million rand ($300,000) bank guarantee. He was also required to surrender his passports and report in daily to police pending another court appearance on November 25.																								South African police said they believed Thatcher helped to bankroll what officials have called a mercenary plot to topple the President of Equatorial Guinea, sub-Saharan Africas third largest oil producer.

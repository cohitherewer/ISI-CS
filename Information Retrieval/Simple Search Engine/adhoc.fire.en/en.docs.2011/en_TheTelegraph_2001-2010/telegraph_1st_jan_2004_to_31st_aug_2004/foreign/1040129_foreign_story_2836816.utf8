 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 US loads Pak raid gun
																								Washington, Jan. 28 (Reuters): The US military is making plans for an offensive that would reach inside Pakistan in coming months to try to destroy operations of Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network, the Chicago Tribune reported today.																								The newspaper, in a report from Washington citing military sources, said the plans involved thousands of US troops, some of them already in neighbouring Afghanistan. The Pakistani government denied to Reuters that it would allow such an operation and the Pentagon declined to confirm that such a plan was being worked on. The Chicago Tribune said the plans were advanced but their execution would depend on events on the ground.																								This was not like a contingency plan for North Korea, something that sits on a shelf. This planning is like planning for Iraq. They want this plan to be executable  now, one source was quoted as saying. Such an intervention would be political dynamite for Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf, who has only allowed a very limited US military presence in his country. The newspaper said the US plans were driven partly by concerns over two assassination attempts last month against Musharraf, whose cooperation has been vital to US anti-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan. 																								The plans were also prompted by a resurgence of attacks by the Taliban, which governed Afghanistan and harboured al Qaida leaders until it was driven from power in a 1991 US-led invasion.																								A US defence official would not confirm the specific operation mentioned in the report, citing a policy against discussing future operations. The official did say that the attempts on Musharrafs life had raised concerns among US authorities.																								The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters US forces staged operations along the Afghan-Pakistan border all the time, and the American troops in Afghanistan had an ongoing offensive against al Qaida and Taliban remnants.																								The Chicago Tribune, quoting sources, said a team of military intelligence officers would go in to Pakistan ahead of time to prepare an operation which would involve Special Operations forces, Army Rangers and ground troops and an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.

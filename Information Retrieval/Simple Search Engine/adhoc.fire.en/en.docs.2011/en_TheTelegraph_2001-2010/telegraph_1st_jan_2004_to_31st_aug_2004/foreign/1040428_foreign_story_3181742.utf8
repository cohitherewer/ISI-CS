 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Clintons Life to be out in June
				 	 Bill ClintonNew York, April 27 (Reuters): Former President Bill Clintons highly anticipated memoirs about his political career and scandal-plagued presidency, entitled My Life, will go on sale in late June, publishing house Alfred A. Knopf announced yesterday.																								The book, for which Knopf reportedly paid between $10 million and $12 million, provides an account of Clintons life through the White House years, Sonny Mehta, president and editor-in-chief at Knopf, said in a statement.																								He talks with candour about his successes, as well as his setbacks, looking at both his career in public service and his life, Mehta said. It is the fullest and most nuanced account of a presidency ever written, and one of the most revealing and remarkable memoirs I have ever had the honour of publishing.																								Clintons critics and supporters have been anxious to read his account of some of the most tumultuous White House years in recent history, particularly the sex scandal involving intern Monica Lewinsky, the bitter investigation that followed and the Presidents historic impeachment.																								Some political analysts have suggested publication of Clintons memoirs this summer may have an impact on Democratic Senator John Kerrys campaign for the presidency, either by reminding voters about the troubles of the Clinton years or reminding them of accomplishments of the most recent Democratic President.																								Anything that reminds people about the enormous prosperity in this country under Bill Clintons leadership is a good thing for us, said Stephanie Cutter, a Kerry spokeswoman. Republican consultant Nelson Warfield argued Clintons book could hurt the Kerry campaign.																								Kerry wants to be the story, he needs to be the story and Clinton will hog the spotlight as only a Clinton can, said Warfield. Instead of talking about Kerrys challenge to Bush, people are going to be talking about what does Bill Clinton think about this.																								Independent pollster John Zogby disagreed, saying the impact would be positive for Kerry especially this year where its all about getting the base out. Nobody gets the base out like Bill and Hillary.																								If the book were coming out in October, it would be a different story, Zogby added.It would suck all the air out. June is a good time. Its aired, it gives a boost to Kerry and then hes not overshadowing him in October.																								Hillary Rodham Clintons memoirs,Living History, were greeted with huge media hype last year, although the first lady-turned-U.S. senator from New York was spare in revealing her private thoughts and emotions about her husband and her marriage.																								Publisher Simon amp; Schuster paid the former first lady $8 million for the enormously successful book.																								The former president will embark on a worldwide tour when his book is released, Knopf said.																								Clinton is slated to make his first promotional book appearance June 3 at the book industrys BookExpo America annual convention in Chicago, organisers said.																								Plans call for the book to go on sale nationwide in late June, with a first printing of 1.5 million copies.																								Knopf is the flagship imprint of the Knopf Publishing Group, which is a division of Random House Inc., whose parent company is Bertelsmann AG .

 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 France, US tussle over Nato role in Afghanistan
																								Istanbul, June 29 (Reuters): France has blocked a US bid to deploy Natos new strike force to safeguard Afghanistans elections, stoking tension between the two allies that fell out over the Iraq war, diplomats said today.																								France, and to a lesser extent others such as Spain, are suspicious about using the Nato Response Force (NRF), said one envoy at the alliance summit in Istanbul. It says the force is not ready for this kind of environment and should not be used simply as a sticking plaster for troop shortages on routine operations.																								Frances opposition to a proposal that could help resolve Natos problems finding troops to make the September polls safe exasperated US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who pushed the idea hard at a meeting of allied defence ministers.																								A senior US official said Rumsfeld had suggested that the alliance could sometimes use its Defence Planning Committee  on which France has no seat because it is not part of Natos integrated military structure  to authorise an NRF deployment.																								Such a decision would normally be taken in the North Atlantic Council, a decision-by-consensus body at which all 26 member nations of Nato are represented.																								Chirac said the NRF  set up last year with a heavy French contingent but not due to become fully operational until October 2006  should only be used when there is a serious security crisis, not for Afghan-style missions.																								The NRF is not designed for this. It shouldnt be used just for any old matter, he said. He has added that an overt Nato presence in Afghanistan could in itself exacerbate security problems during the elections.																								Chirac undermined efforts in Istanbul to portray the transatlantic alliance as united once more after the divisions sparked by last years US-led invasion of Iraq, of which Paris and Berlin were Europes fiercest critics.																								Shortly after the allies had agreed yesterday to help the new Baghdad government train security forces, Chirac said he still opposed a formal Nato presence in Iraq. He also criticised George W. Bushs support for Turkeys bid to join the EU, saying it was none of his business.																								The NRF is being set up to give Nato the military capability to do what it could not do after the September 11 attacks on US cities in 2001: strike back quickly and forcefully when an ally is attacked by a distant foe.																								A cutting-edge multinational force with warships, fighter planes and eventually over 20,000 troops, it will be lethal, agile and ready to be deployed to hotspots within five days.																								Nato plans to deploy a battalion of around 1,000 troops to Kabul during the elections and some 500 to its five military-backed reconstruction teams in northern provinces.																								Diplomats said allies had not yet committed all those forces. This means they will not be in place to help with voter registration, which has been dogged by Taliban militia attacks. One European official said the US-French tussle was more about procedure.

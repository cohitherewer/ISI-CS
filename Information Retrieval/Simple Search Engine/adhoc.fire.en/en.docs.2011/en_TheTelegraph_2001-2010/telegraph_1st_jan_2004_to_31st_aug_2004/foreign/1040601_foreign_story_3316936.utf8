 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Rocket attack in ministers hometown
																								Quetta, May 31 (Reuters): Nearly 20 rockets were fired into the home town of Pakistans education minister in the southwest of the country today, killing two people and wounding three.																								One of the rockets hit the home of a servant of education minister Zubaida Jalal, killing the servants 14-year-old son and wounding four people, said Jalal, who was in the capital Islamabad at the time of the attack.																								Later one of the injured died in a hospital in the town of Turbat nearby, a government official in Quetta said.																								Jalal, whose efforts to modernise Pakistans education system have angered conservative Islamists who say she and President Pervez Musharraf have a pro-western agenda, said the attackers wanted to intimidate her.																								This act of terrorism is a part of a campaign to hurt my resolve, Jalal said in a statement. I will not be unnerved by such cheap tactics. Jalal said 18 rockets were fired into the town of Mand, which is close to the border with Iran. A government official said the attack lasted for about half-an-hour and appeared to have come from different directions. Several of the rockets landed at a paramilitary camp though no one was hurt.

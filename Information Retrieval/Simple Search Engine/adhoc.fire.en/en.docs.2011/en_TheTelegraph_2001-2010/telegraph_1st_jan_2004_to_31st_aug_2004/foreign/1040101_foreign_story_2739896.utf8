 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Jail for China balloon brigade
 Beijing, Dec. 31 (Reuters):  A Chinese court sentenced an American and a New Zealander  to up to five years in jail today on charges of plotting  to explode balloons by remote control above Tiananmen Square  and scatter pro-democracy leaflets.																								The Beijing No 2 Intermediate Peoples Court handed a five-year prison sentence to Chinese-born New Zealand businessman Sun Gang, 44, and a three-and-a-half-year term to Taiwan-born US national Lan Yupeng, the official Xinhua news agency said.																								No comment was available from the US embassy or the New Zealand mission which were closed for the New Year holiday. The court ruled the men should be deported, Xinhua said, adding they were also fined unspecified amounts on charges of inciting subversion.																								It was unclear if the pair would be deported before or after serving their sentences.																								Sun and Lan used false names to rent a Beijing apartment in May where police found leaflets, a hacksaw and an airship, it said, adding they had colluded with an overseas organisation.																								They also plotted to kidnap a local person working for an unnamed company in the southern province of Hunan to extract ransom money, it said. The court also sentenced Chinese national Lin Yandong, 42, to 18 months in jail for involvement in the kidnapping plot.																								Lan and Sun were arrested as they assembled hot air balloons brought into China from the US, a US-based leader of the little-known China Federation Party said in May. The men had planned to explode the balloons by remote control above Tiananmen Square and Beijings international airport, sending into the air 2,000 leaflets espousing the partys pro-democracy platform.																								The staunchly anti-Communist party said it had set up a government in exile with the aim of fomenting revolution and overthrowing the Communists who have run China since 1949. Taiwan rap																								China condemned Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian today for saying he was waging a holy war against the mainland, calling him immoral and accusing him of fanning anti-Beijing sentiment to win votes.																								Newspapers in Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, quoted Chen as telling a campaign rally in southern Taiwan on Saturday the March presidential election was a holy war by the Taiwan people against the Chinese Communists.																								He unscrupulously fanned Taiwan compatriots anti-mainland sentiment for his own selfish interest and for the elections, Zhang Mingqing, spokesperson for Chinas policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, said. This goes against the will of Taiwan compatriots to seek peace, stability and development... This is extremely immoral. 																								Tension has been simmering since Taiwan passed a controversial bill in November allowing referendums, which China sees as a move towards independence. Beijing has threatened force if Taiwan drags its feet on reunification or declares statehood. We are resolutely opposed to any form of Taiwan independence, Chinese President Hu Jintao said.

(AFP)																								Najaf, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Iraqs interim government said Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr was negotiating to leave a shrine in Najaf today as thousands of protesters across southern Iraq condemned a US offensive in the holy city.																								Demonstrators gathered in five cities in Iraq to vent their anger at the assault on Sadrs forces launched by US Marines yesterday, amid conflicting reports over whether the firebrand cleric had been wounded during the fighting.																								Gunmen also kidnapped a British journalist in the southern city of Basra, threatening to execute him within 24 hours if US forces did not pull out of Najaf, but Sunday Telegraph reporter James Brandon was later released after Sadr intervened. A terrified Brandon had earlier been shown on a videotape.																								A Sadr spokesman said the cleric would pull his forces out of Najaf if US forces also withdrew and religious authorities agreed to administer the citys sacred Shia sites. Sheikh Ali Smeisim also said Sadr was demanding the release of his captive guerrillas and an amnesty for his fighters, who should be allowed to participate in Iraqs political process.																								Sayyed Moqtada will not be touched if he leaves the shrine peacefully, interior minister Falah al-Naqib said.																								The nine-day uprising in Najaf has killed hundreds and threatened to undermine the rule of interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, who is walking a tightrope trying to crush the radical Shia rebellion across southern Iraq that has hit oil exports.																								Speaking today after US Marines backed by aircraft and tanks launched an assault on Sadrs Mehdi fighters around the Imam Ali mosque and an ancient cemetery  both militia strongholds  Allawi urged the fighters to surrender. Sadr spokesman Ahmad al-Shinabi said the cleric was wounded at 0030 GMT in the cemetery today.																								He was in the cemetery at the time. He was wounded in the chest, arm and leg, Shinabi said in Najaf.																								Interior minister Naqib denied Sadr was wounded and said a truce had been in force since last night. He said the government was negotiating Sadrs departure from the revered Imam Ali shrine, where he has been holed up with his fighters.																								US planes bombed several targets in the Sunni city of Falluja, west of Baghdad, for the second day, killing four Iraqis including two children, witnesses and hospital officials said. 																								The US military said it had no information on the attacks on the city, a centre of anti-American resistance.

 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Castro meets Redford, discusses Che film
				 	 Robert Redford																								Havana, Jan. 27 (Reuters): Cuban President Fidel Castro, who has charmed some of Hollywoods biggest names, paid a call on actor Robert Redford at his Havana hotel yesterday and discussed his latest film, on revolutionary icon Che Guevara.																								Redford was in Cuba over the weekend wearing his producers hat for a private screening of The Motorcycle Diaries for the widow and children of the legendary Argentine guerrilla fighter, who was Castros comrade-in-arms.																								He came to me... He seemed in good health, good humour, good spirit, Redford said of the 77-year-old Cuban leader after their brief encounter at the Hotel Nacional. 																								Redford last saw Castro in 1988. The actor was said to have gone scuba-diving with the Cuban leader and was questioned by US officials on his return to the US. In the 1990 film Havana Redford played a high-rolling American gambler during the final days of the Batista dictatorship, when Cuba was a mobster playground.																								Castro has fascinated Hollywood stars. Jack Nicholson called him a genius and Oliver Stone said he was one of the Earths wisest people.																								I came to present the film that I produced on Che Guevara and I am very happy to be in Cuba, Redford said at Sundays screening of the film made by his company, Southfork Pictures.

 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Chandrika tilts towards partys choice for PM
 Outgoing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe  (AFP) Prime Minister -  designate Mahinda Rajapakse																								Colombo, April 5 (Agencies): Dumping her first choice as Prime Minister in the face of opposition from within her party, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga today appeared to be ready to name party stalwart Mahinda Rajapakse to the key post. 																								Sources close to 58-year old Rajapkse said he would be sworn in the island nations 13th Prime Minister tomorrow morning. Yes, it is true, Rajapakse said, declining to comment further.																								Kumaratunga, whose Freedom Alliance fell eight seats short of a majority in parliament, had earlier held back naming her first preference for Prime Ministership, 71-year-old former foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, following strong resistance from Rajapakse. 																								Rajapakse has been asked to reach the Presidents official residence tomorrow morning for the swearing-in ceremony, sources in his office said. 																								No date has been announced for the naming of the cabinet. 																								Kadirgamar is credited with getting the Tamil Tigers banned overseas but is not a grassroots politician. He entered parliament in 1994 as a nominated legislator.																								Rajapakse, on the other hand, had been a legislator since 1970 and enjoys wide support among the rank and file of the party. 																								 Some youngsters in the party today suggested a secret ballot to resolve the issue of the next Premier, but sources said Kumaratunga now appeared to be leaning more towards Rajapakse although it was still not a done deal.																								Kumaratungas party won 105 seats in the 225-member assembly and is set to form a minority government.																								Rajapakse will lead a government whose main task will be to put a stalled peace process with Tamil Tiger rebels back on track.																								But under Sri Lankas executive presidency system, it is expected that he will take a back seat to Kumaratunga.																								Kumaratunga has vast powers under the constitution and is expected to name herself defence minister and possibly finance minister when the cabinet is selected.																								Hes a very good man but it is likely he will be a figurehead under the President, said one diplomat. An official involved in the peace process to end the 20-year civil war that has killed 64,000 people described Rajapakse as a good choice.																								Rajapakse, who is married to a former beauty queen and has two sons, was first elected as the youngest member of parliament in 1970.																								From 1994 to later 2001, he served as minister of labour, then minister of fisheries and also ports minister.																								He was named Opposition leader after his party lost the December 2001 election to Ranil Wickremesinghes United National Party (UNP).																								In this election, Rajapakse won the most votes in the working-class Hambantota district in the southern part of the island. Rajapakse will be involved in trying to forge a coalition to avoid what Wickremesinghe called a stalemated parliament.																								Wickremesinghe said earlier today that the peace bid may be sidelined because the new government lacks a majority to push the process ahead.																								Everything is in trouble if you dont have a government with a majority, said Wickremesinghe, who signed a ceasefire with the rebels during his two years as Prime Minister.																								Political analysts also said the Freedom Alliance will have a tough time resuming talks with the Tamil Tigers after voters elected an ethnically divided parliament. The President still wants to take the peace process forward but shell have less room to manoeuvre, one Western diplomat said.																								Wickremesinghes United National Party (UNP) won 82 seats, down from 114 in the last election, a two-seat majority which was achieved through a coalition.

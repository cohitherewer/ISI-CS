 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Protests hit Prabhakaran
Colombo, March 7 (PTI): Unprecedented anti-Prabhakaran protests were today held in eastern Sri Lanka to express solidarity with sacked regional commander V. Muralitharan, better known as Karuna, residents said.																								About 3,000 people took part in a protest rally from Kiran to Chenkaladi in Batticaloa and burnt effigies of LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran and his intelligence chief Pottu Amman. The Batticaloa University, meanwhile, postponed all examinations indefinitely as all hostel students left fearing reprisal attacks.

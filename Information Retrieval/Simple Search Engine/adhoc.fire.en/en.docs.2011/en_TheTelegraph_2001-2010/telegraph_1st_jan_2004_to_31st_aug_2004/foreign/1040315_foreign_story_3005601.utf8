 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Exit poll shows Putin sweep
				 	 President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Sunday. (AP)																								Moscow, March 14 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin, who has pledged to deliver stability to Russia and end poverty, has swept back into the Kremlin according to an exit poll today that showed him with a huge lead in elections.																								The poll, published by the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM) shortly after voting in the worlds biggest country closed at 1800 GMT, said Putin had gathered 69 per cent of the vote.																								Putins victory genuinely reflects his high standing and had never been in doubt.																								But liberal critics say the autocratic style of the former KGB spy, the war in rebel Chechnya that goes largely unreported by Russian media and the promotion of state security officials to senior positions pose threats to the future of democracy.																								The Central Election Commission said four hours before polls closed after a colourless campaign that voter turnout had passed the 50 per cent level needed to make the election legal.																								Ruthless manoeuvring had put Putin, 51, beyond the reach of five rivals, handing him tsar-like powers to pull Russia out of the mire left after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.																								The only real threat to his re-election had been that less than 50 per cent of the 109 million-strong electorate would vote.																								The election seals Putins grip on power, giving him four years to push through promised reforms to bring a measure of wealth and stability to Russias masses, whose living standards plunged in the turmoil that followed the Soviet collapse.																								But even before polling ended in Moscow, the US voiced concern over the manner of Putins imminent victory. ...Youve got to let candidates have all access to the media that the President has, US secretary of state Colin Powell said on the Fox News Sunday programme. Its not entirely clear to me why they go out of their way to keep Opposition candidates from fully participating in the electoral process. Its not good but I dont think it signals the total demise of democracy in Russia, he said.

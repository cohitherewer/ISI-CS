The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Short a long thorn in Tonys side
				 	 Clare Short (Reuters)London, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Clare Short, the outspoken former British minister, has proved a perennial thorn in Tony Blairs side but her assertion that London spied at the UN before the Iraq war is her most damning allegation yet.																								Short, who resigned from the government last May in protest over the war, has continually inflamed the debate over the legality of the conflict and challenged its justification.																								Her claim today that Britain had conducted spying operations on UN secretary-general Kofi Annan in the run-up to the war is the latest in a spate of stinging remarks she has made about the governments conduct in relation to Iraq.																								Short, 58, was synonymous with controversy during six years at the top of government but the former international development secretary had always proved a great survivor.																								But her declaration last May that she would quit government if reckless Blair took Britain to war in Iraq without UN backing was too much for her disciplinarian boss to bear.																								Since her exit from government, she has spoken out in parliament and to the media, saying London and Washington were always determined to go to war, irrespective of the UN.																								Short has never shied away from controversy in a government that has made iron discipline and unity its watchwords after bitter division helped push Labour into 18 years of opposition.																								She openly attacked the Blair administrations fondness for media management at all costs, calling last year for an end to his governments obsession with spin.																								In the run-up to Labours landslide 1997 election win, she criticised dark forces, code for the media advisers surrounding Blair, and embarrassed him by calling for higher taxes as he sought to persuade Britons he would not hit them in the wallet. But she was always kept on by Blair, perhaps as a counter to accusations that he is a control freak.																								Short first came to public prominence in the 1980s when she launched a fierce campaign against the Sun newspapers regular Page Three pictures of topless models.																								She recently repeated her opposition to Page Three, earning her a battering in The Sun, which stuck her face on photos of topless women and sent models clad in miniscule red bikinis to hound her around London. 																								Short had already resigned twice from key Labour Party positions in the years before Blair returned the party to power  once over Northern Ireland policy, the other over the 1991 war against Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein.

 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Blair to quit if Hutton dubs him a liar
				 	 Tony Blair 																								London, Jan. 11 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair said today he would resign if an imminent report into the suicide of a government expert on Iraq finds that he lied about the incident.																								Senior Judge Lord Hutton is due to publish his report into the death of weapons expert David Kelly in coming weeks and is likely to apportion some blame to the government for Kellys death, which rocked Blairs premiership last year.																								Kelly killed himself in July after the government outed him as the source of a BBC report that claimed Blair had inflated the threat from Iraqs armament to justify the conflict. His death and the Hutton inquiry unleashed months of speculation about Blairs role in driving Kelly to kill himself and about the primary reason given for the US-led Iraq war  its alleged weapons of mass destruction.																								Asked if he stood by the principle that a minister should resign if found lying, Blair told BBC Television: Of course.																								These are very serious allegations that the Conservative Party and parts of the media are making against the prime minister, Blair said in an interview.																								He added he was enthusiastic about the chance to confront his opponents over the Hutton report. Blairs critics accuse him of lying over the Kelly affair.																								Ministry of defence official Kevin Tebbit told the Hutton inquiry that Blair had chaired a meeting where it was decided to make a statement clarifying the governments position  a move that led to Kellys exposure.																								Days after Kellys death, Blair emphatically denied authorising the leaking of the scientists name to the media.																								The Iraq war and Kellys suicide last year plunged Blair into the worst period of his premiership as his critics took him to task over the failure to find any banned weapons in Iraq. Blair said Huttons findings will be final and pledged that he would not hide away from a debate with his opponents on the report. What the judge finds will be of huge persuasive importance for the public, for parliament and I hope for the media, Blair said. Its final... I think speculation comes to an end with the report.																								Shia snub to US																								Iraqs most revered Shia leader insisted today that democratic elections be held within months, denting US hopes of winning his crucial backing for Washingtons plan for handing back sovereignty to Iraqis.																								Officials from the US-appointed governing council went to Najaf today to meet Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to try to persuade him to back the US plan.																								Under the plan, regional caucuses will select a transitional Iraqi assembly by the end of May, and the assembly will select an interim government that will take over sovereignty by the end of June. 																								Full elections and a constitution will follow in 2005. Sistani wants the transitional assembly to be directly elected, and refused to back down after meeting the council officials. 																								If he does not support the plan, many of Iraqs majority Shias may also refuse to accept it.

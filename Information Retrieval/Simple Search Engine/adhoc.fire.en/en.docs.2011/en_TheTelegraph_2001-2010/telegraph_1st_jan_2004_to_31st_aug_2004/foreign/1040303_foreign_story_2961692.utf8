 TOM LEONARD				 	 Russell Crowe in a scene from The Gladiator. (AFP)London, March 2: Roman gladiators were overweight vegetarians who lived on barley and beans, according to a scientific study of the largest gladiator graveyard discovered.																								Analysis of the bones of more than 70 gladiators recently found near Ephesus, the Roman capital of Asia Minor, puts paid to traditional Hollywood images of macho carnivores with the physique of boxers.																								The dietary findings of the scientists from the University of Vienna are detailed in a forthcoming documentary. They may give vegetarians a new, harder image.																								But the vegetarian stereotype is shattered by the finding that gladiators did not wear sandals but fought in bare feet.																								The mass autopsy at the graveyard site on the western coast of Turkey has challenged assumptions that gladiator training was almost as brutal as the contests.																								Ancient Roman mosaics depict gladiators as stocky, heavy men but historians have tended to assume this was a tribute to their macho image rather than a literal depiction of their size.																								Experts have been puzzled by contemporary references to gladiators as barley crunchers.																								Karl Grossschmidt, a forensic anthropologist at Vienna University, used chemical testing on the bones to reveal that gladiators stuck to a diet of barley and beans to bulk out.																								It was a boring diet, he admitted. They got enough of this food every day to make them very fat and strong, he said. 																								Hollywood Gladiator, starring Russell Crowe, romanticised the macho, hard image of the Roman gladiator.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

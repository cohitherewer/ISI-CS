The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Pak holds fire for talks on surrender
																								Wana (Pakistan), March 21 (Reuters): Pakistans army declared a ceasefire today with suspected al Qaida fighters near the Afghan border to allow tribal elders to try to negotiate the militants surrender.																								The army says hundreds of al Qaida suspects and their Pakistani tribal allies are surrounded in the desolate mountains but added fighting had subsided today after a week of clashes.																								The government has issued 22 passes to a group of tribal elders so that they can go inside the cordoned area, regional security chief Brigadier Mahmood Shah said.They will go there tomorrow with a white flag. An ambulance will also go along with them to collect the bodies.																								Shah said the elders would demand that any captured soldiers be released and the militants surrender.																								The local tribesmen, who are accused of harbouring foreign militants, must be handed over to the government immediately. And all foreign militants must surrender, there is no other option.																								Shah said there was a temporary ceasefire in operation, with no helicopter gunships or heavy artillery being used. Until they fire on us we will not fire on them, he said.																								The army has declined to give casualty figures although local officials have said around 30 soldiers and almost as many militants may have been killed since Tuesday.																								Officials said 13 civilians were killed yesterday when their vehicles were fired on by helicopter gunships, and two Chechen militants were killed today after trying to break through an army cordon.																								The battle, involving 5,000 troops, is the biggest Pakistan has ever waged in its semi-autonomous tribal border lands and is part of a major push to sweep foreign militants from the region and catch al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden.																								But anger is growing in the fiercely independent tribal region of South Waziristan, and 7,000 protesters gathered at a rally in one village today to demand troops be withdrawn.																								In Islamabad, 70 Muslim clerics denounced the raid as un-Islamic and issued a decree saying government soldiers killed in the operation had died as infidels. Even their funerals are not legitimate under Islamic law, Qazi Abdul Aziz, the chief cleric at the capitals Red Mosque told a news conference. Only those who killed in resistance against this operation are martyrs.																								In Afghanistan, US troops have also stepped up their hunt in what they describe as a hammer and anvil operation with Pakistan. A senior US official said he was pleased with Pakistans efforts to run those terrorist rascals out of their territory and into Afghanistan.																								We have believed for a long time that we really need to work along the border, acting army secretary Les Brownlee said on a visit to Afghanistan. That is where the centre of gravity is, we need to work both sides of it very hard and we need to do it together. 																								More than 100 suspected militants have been captured in South Waziristan since Tuesday and the army has thrown up a 60 km cordon to box in rebels still at large. Pakistani commanders say they suspect a Uzbek or Chechen militant leader is among those surrounded in a series of well-established and well-defended mud-walled compounds.																								Intelligence officials said there was a possibility they included Tahir Yuldashev, the leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.

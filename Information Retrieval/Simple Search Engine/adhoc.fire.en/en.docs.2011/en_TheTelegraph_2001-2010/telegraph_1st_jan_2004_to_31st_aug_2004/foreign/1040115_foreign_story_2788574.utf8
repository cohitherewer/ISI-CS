 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Blair warning
																								London, Jan. 14 (Reuters): Tony Blair, under the gun over a flagship education bill that has split his Labour Party, warned rebels today that a vote against the policy would be political suicide ahead of the next general election.																								Blair has put his authority on the line over the education bill but he risks his first defeat on a major policy issue since coming to power in 1997, despite a huge parliamentary majority. The knife-edge vote, due on January 27, comes at one of the most fraught moments of Blairs six-year premiership and could fall within days of a potentially damaging report into the suicide of a government expert on Iraqs weapons. In an orchestrated assault on rebels, Blair will make a key speech later defending his plans while his education secretary Charles Clarke warned a closed-door meeting of Labour members of parliament (MPs) that it was crunch time. 																								If we dont decide now, well have speculation running right up to polling day, Clarke said, according to a spokeswoman. The biggest disaster would be to go into the next election without deciding. The next general election is expected in 2005. Some Labour figures say Blair is no longer the guaranteed electoral asset he once was.

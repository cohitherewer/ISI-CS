 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Candidate seeks second term
				 	 Classic tale: Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep in The Manchurian Candidate (above) and co-producer Tina Sinatra. (Reuters)																								New York, July 27 (Reuters): The Manchurian Candidate is seeking re-election.																								The creepy, classic Cold War film about brainwashing and political assassination made in 1962 has been fast-forwarded in a fresh version directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep.																								One bridge between the original and the new Paramount release is the name Sinatra. Co-producer Tina Sinatra has seen her 10-year effort to remake the film of Richard Condons 1959 black comic novel come to fruition with Washington playing the role originated by her famous father, Frank Sinatra. 																								It cried to be updated, Sinatra said, adding that her father, who died in 1998, had supported her idea of a Manchurian remake.																								While the first movie was shelved for 25 years for hitting too close to home after the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy, those involved with the new version are excited about the topicality of a film on political deception and corporate conspiracies arising from the Gulf War. The political thrillers release during the current US presidential campaign is another touch of serendipity.																								I expected it to be provoking, producer Sinatra said. And when you have a political backdrop and youve got this particular climate, we knew it would support the film.																								And Fahrenheit 9/11 bumped it up another notch, Sinatra added, referring to Michael Moores controversial documentary attacking President Bush and the war in Iraq.																								The film has already stirred political buzz as unconfirmed reports circulated that Streep patterned her portrayal of a Machiavellian mom on Hillary Clinton. These are high-stakes games these people are playing, Streep said about one Internet story she saw that she felt was part of an insidious attack on the former first lady, now a Democratic US senator from New York.																								And I thought, Oh my God. So this is how they get Hillary, she said. This is so far from Hillary Clinton. She does say she patterned her role after someone  possibly a man  and is surprised that no one has so far guessed who it was.																								Washington said the picture came together at a perfect time. I think its good timing the way its coming out. I know Paramount probably thinks that.																								Washington plays an army major plagued by nightmares about his platoons ambush in Kuwait and the awarding of the Medal of Honour to his sergeant, Raymond Shaw, played by Liev Schreiber in the role originated by Laurence Harvey.																								Shaws mother, played with diabolical relish by Streep in the villainous role created on film by Angela Lansbury, is a US senator whose own thwarted ambition leads her to parlay her adored sons Gulf War heroics into a vice presidential bid for him as she schemes to pave his path to the Oval Office.																								There are new twists and turns that distinguish the updated treatment, including a nod to modern technology in the use of implanted chips to explain mind control and the introduction of a corporate villain  Manchurian Global  to replace the communist menace of the original post-Korean War story. Its about the length that youre willing to go to consolidate, fortify, preserve your power, said Streep.																								I would say there are people on both parties with ties of this sort, that are compromised in this way, beholden to big global interests because thats the way America works now. Demme, Oscar-winning director of the Silence of the Lambs said: This is a bipartisan complaint about the process. We hope this is offensive to all the parties. 																								Sinatra was pleased the politically minded film was ready for the run-up to Novembers US presidential election. 																								I think the American people are thrilled to have movies like this to go to, she said. I went to see Fahrenheit and people were talking to the screen and venting their feelings. I think its stimulating and healthy ... and were glad to be a part of it.																								Devotees of the original, however, might miss the black-humoured lampooning of the anti-communist McCarthyism of the 1950s, and creative touches such as the surreal handling of the brainwashing exhibition juxtaposing Russian and Chinese generals with genteel ladies at a gardening lecture.																								When that first film was made almost everything in it was shocking, and almost unthinkable, critic Leonard Maltin said. Today we live in a world where almost nothing is unthinkable.

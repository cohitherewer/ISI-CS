The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 Pak in gunsight of Democrats
																								New Delhi, Jan. 25 (PTI): Describing Pakistan as one of the most dangerous countries and charging it with having misled the world on its nuclear activities, almost all US presidential aspirants from the Democratic party want the American policy towards Islamabad to be tougher, a media report said.																								Most believe General (Pervez) Musharraf has not been an honest ally, the Saturday Tribune said in a special report which carried the transcript of a debate on Americas national public radio channel earlier this month. The participants in the debate included six Democrats who hope to challenge President George W. Bush in the upcoming presidential elections. They were governor Howard Dean (Vermont), congressman Dick Gephardt (Missouri), senator John Kerry (Massachussetts), congressman Dennis Kucinich (Ohio), senator Joe Lieberman (Connecticut) and former ambassador Carol Moseley Braun (Illinois).																								According to the transcript published by Saturday Tribune run by a Pakistani journalist, Kerry was quoted as saying Pakistan has, frankly, misled the US and the world with respect to its proliferation responsibilities for years ... I am convinced we can be tougher with Pakistan.																								The spectre of an Islamic radical state with nuclear weapons is unacceptable for the world and that is what is at risk in Pakistan today. .... There are steps that we could now take to deal with the northwest component, where Osama bin Laden is. We know hes up there. We have not pushed hard enough, Kerry was quoted as saying. 																								Braun was quoted in the transcript as saying: We have to work with the Pakistanis but (should) be very clear about the fact that our interests and their interests may not be coherent .... We have to be very clear about who it is were dealing with.																								Gephardt said Pakistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world. They have nuclear power. I think the (US) administration has failed a lot in doing something to stop the Saudi support for madarsas in especially Pakistan which are producing terrorists. You have now had two attacks on Musharraf.

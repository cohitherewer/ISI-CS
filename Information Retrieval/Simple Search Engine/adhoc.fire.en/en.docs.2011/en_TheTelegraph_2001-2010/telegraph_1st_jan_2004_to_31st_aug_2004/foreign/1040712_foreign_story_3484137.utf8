The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Pak couple flees persecution
				 	 Ghulam and Amnat Mustafa in Islamabad on Sunday. (Reuters) 																								Islamabad, July 11 (Reuters): Pakistani doctors Amnat and Ghulam Mustafa are on the run, in fear of their lives, for falling in love and getting married.																								Hundreds of women fall victim to so-called honour killing by male relatives every year in deeply conservative, rural Pakistan for marrying without their families consent, thereby being deemed to have brought disgrace on their families.																								My brothers have threatened to kill me and my husband, 44-year-old Amnat said in a recent interview in Islamabad.																								The main condition of my brothers is that I should get a divorce from my husband if I want to go home but I will never do that.																								The couples predicament highlights a major dilemma faced by Pakistan in reconciling centuries-old tribal traditions with modern-day values as President Pervez Musharraf tries to project the country as a moderate, progressive Muslim nation. 																								More than 4,000 people, the majority of them women, have been killed in the name of honour across Pakistan since 1998, according to government officials.																								Amnat and Ghulam have been on the run since they married in August 2002 and have recently come to Islamabad to seek government help.																								The doctors marriage enraged Amnats relatives in their conservative home town of Moro where almost every marriage is arranged.

 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Pig lard ploy to deter bombers
 Jerusalem, Feb. 12 (AFP):  Israeli police have come up with plans to place bags of  pig lard on buses in a bid to deter Palestinian militants  from carrying out suicide attacks, the Maariv daily  reported today.																								Rabbinical authorities have given the idea its approval on the grounds that it could be a life-saving measure even though pigs are also considered impure by Jews. Authorities believe that the move could discourage Palestinians from carrying out attacks as pieces of their exploded body could come into contact with the pig fat, prejudicing their chances of entering into paradise. 																								The paper said that the rabbinical dispensation could mean that security forces also hang bags of lard in shopping malls and schools. Public buses have been a favourite target for Palestinian suicide bombers since the start of the Intifada.

 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Blair aides may bear Iraq blow
				 	 Tony Blair: Under pressure																								London, July 11 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blairs spy chief and his closest aides are likely to bear the brunt of criticism in a report on intelligence failings in Britains case for invading Iraq, newspapers said today.																								Speculation about who will get the blame in the Butler report into the use of evidence about Iraqs banned weapons has been rife ahead of its release on Wednesday and the intelligence community has been quick to point the finger at Blair.																								Last week a scathing US Senate committee report said US spy agencies overstated the threat of Iraqi weapons, relied on dubious sources and ignored contrary evidence before the war. Any direct criticism of Blair could be highly damaging on the eve of two by-elections to vote in new lawmakers and ahead of an expected general election next year.																								In a BBC television programme, John Morrison, former deputy chief of defence intelligence, said: The Prime Minister was going way beyond anything any professional analyst would have agreed by saying Saddam Hussein posed a serious threat. His comments were released ahead of the broadcast.																								Brian Jones, former head of the ministry of defences intelligence branch, said he was confused when Blair told a previous inquiry into the suicide of an Iraq weapons expert that there was a lot of evidence about Saddams arms programmes. 																								Certainly, no one on my staff had any visibility of large quantities of evidence of that sort, he told the Panorama programme. Jones said he became suspicious when new intelligence came to light in time for compilation of a key dossier which was used to justify the war.																								The Sunday Times said the Butler report would reprimand John Scarlett, who was chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and took responsibility for a dossier which said Iraq could have fired weapons of mass destruction at 45 minutes notice. The claim has been discredited and Blair said last week biological and chemical weapons may never be found.																								The Sunday Telegraph, citing officials who had seen parts of the report, said Blairs chief of staff Jonathan Powell was due to be the main target because his role in presenting intelligence was wider than his post as an adviser justified. Going for Jonathan is the closest you can get to the Prime Minister without hitting him, an official was quoted as saying.

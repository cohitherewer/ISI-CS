(Reuters)																								Washington, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Top Pentagon officials and the military command in Iraq contributed to an environment in which prisoners were abused at Abu Ghraib prison, a high-level panel investigating the military detentions has concluded, a defence official said today.																								The independent four-member panel headed by former defence secretary James Schlesinger found that defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the joint chiefs of staff failed to exercise proper oversight over confusing detention policies at US prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, according to the defence official.																								The official, who asked not to be identified, said the panel, due to release its report later , did not find that Rumsfeld or military leaders directly ordered abuse such as stripping prisoners naked and sexually humiliating them.																								In addition, a separate army investigation headed by Major General George Fay faulted Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, at the time the top US commander in Iraq, for leadership failures for not addressing troubles at Abu Ghraib, a senior Army official said.																								The Fay report, to be released tomorrow, found Sanchez and his staff were preoccupied with combating an escalating insurgency and did not focus on the festering problems at Abu Ghraib, the army official said.																								The report also found that army military intelligence soldiers kept a number of prisoners, dubbed ghost detainees, off the books and hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the official added. It also found a small number of military police used dogs to menace teen-age Abu Ghraib detainees.																								Seven army reservists from the 372nd Military Police Company already have been charged with abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib.																								The Fay report implicates about two dozen more low-ranking soldiers, medics and civilian contractors in the Abu Ghraib abuse, and about half of them will be recommended for criminal proceedings, the army official said.																								These are illegal, unauthorised, mischievous, sadistic activities happening outside the purview of interrogations, the official said.

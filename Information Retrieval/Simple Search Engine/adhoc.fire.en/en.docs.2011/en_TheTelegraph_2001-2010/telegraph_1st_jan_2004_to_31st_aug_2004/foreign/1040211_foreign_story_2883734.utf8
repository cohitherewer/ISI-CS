 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 12 Indians die in Iran plane crash
 Sharjah, Feb. 10 (Reuters):  An Iranian plane carrying migrant workers crashed as it  came in to land at Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates today,  killing 43 of the 46 people on board including 12 Indians.																								The Kish Airline plane, a Dutch-made twin-engined Fokker-50, smashed into the desert, 3 km from the airport and between two residential areas, at 0700 GMT. Officials blamed a technical fault and said they had retrieved the planes black box. Witnesses saw a wobbling plane making strange engine noises which then nosedived.																								Forty three people died and three survived, civil aviation official Ahmad bu Kallah said. He said a Filipino, an Iranian and the one other survivor were in critical condition. The dead included at least 11 Iranian passengers and all six Iranian crew. A child was also killed. Sharjah airport officials said passengers were from India, Iran, UAE, Algeria, Egypt, Nepal, Syria, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Philippines, Sudan and Cameroon.																								Another civil aviation official, Ghanem al-Hajiri, said the plane had made contact with Sharjah airport before it crashed. It was the sixth crash involving Iranian planes since 2000. One witness said it had gone into a nose-dive. From the impact of the crash it overturned, split into two and then burst into flames, the witness added. Builders at a nearby site said they saw the plane wobbling as it descended and heard strange noises coming from the engine. 																								Rescue teams wearing face masks loaded charred bodies into a large refrigerated truck while others searched for more bodies, witnesses said. 																								Irans aviation authority said in a statement on Irans official news agency that the plane had asked for an emergency landing as it was coming into Sharjah, then deviated to the left and crashed. Kish Airline runs domestic and some short-haul international routes to and from Irans Kish Island in the Gulf. Kish, a free trade zone which Iran is promoting as a tourist destination, is popular with foreign workers in the UAE who need to leave the country to renew residence and work permits.

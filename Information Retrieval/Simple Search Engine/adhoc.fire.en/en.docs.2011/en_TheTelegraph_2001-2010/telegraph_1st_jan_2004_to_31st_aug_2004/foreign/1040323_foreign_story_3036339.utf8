 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Nepal forces search for bodies after bloody battle
																								Kathmandu, March 22 (Reuters): Nepali forces dug up bodies of Maoist rebels and searched for scores of missing police and soldiers today after what could be one of the bloodiest battles in the kingdoms brutal eight-year rebellion.																								The rebels elusive leader vowed to continue raids on government targets despite yesterdays 12-hour gunbattle in western Nepal in which the army says 500 guerrillas died and 17 police and soldiers were killed.																								The armed attacks will continue until a progressive political solution has been reached, Maoist chief Prachanda, who goes by the one name, said in a statement to local media.																								As buildings still smouldered a day after the attack, police and troops said they had found the bodies of 40 guerrillas. 																								Some bodies were found buried in the banks of the Kali river, interior ministry spokesperson Gopendra Bahadur Pandey said. The search is continuing.																								The Maoists, fighting to replace the Himalayan kingdoms constitutional monarchy with a one-party communist state, routinely carry their dead away from encounters, often burying them in the soft sand near rivers and dry river beds.																								Fifty-eight police and district officials are missing. It is not known if any soldiers are also missing. There was no independent confirmation of the official tally. Both sides routinely exaggerate enemy casualties and understate their own.																								Nepali newspapers quoted rebel sources saying they had killed 150 soldiers and police and lost less than 40 of their own.																								If the official toll is true, it would be the bloodiest single battle since the revolt began in the worlds only Hindu kingdom in 1996, devastating the tourism and farm dependent economy.																								More than 9,000 people, most of them rebels, have died so far.																								The battle began just before midnight on Saturday when rebels swooped down from surrounding hills and stormed a bank, a jail and government buildings in the town of Beni, about 280 km west of Kathmandu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Gunmen kill Karachi cops
 							 - Verse demand after station raid Karachi, April 4 (Reuters):  At least 10 gunmen stormed into a police station in the  southern Pakistan city of Karachi today, killing five policemen  and wounding one after demanding the officers recite Islamic  verses, police said.																								The attackers escaped by car after the dawn shoot-out about five km from the international airport in Karachi, Pakistans largest city and the scene of frequent religious violence. 																								Police said one of the gunmen may have died.																								The assault, one of the boldest on Karachis police in recent years, comes as tension is running high following a deadly raid by thousands of Pakistani troops on 400 to 500 suspected al Qaida and other Islamist fighters last month.																								The wounded policeman, Hasan Jatoi, said the clean-shaven assailants shot several of the officers in the head at close range after bursting into the small police post. 																								Its an act of terrorism, Karachi police chief Tariq Jameel said. The police are conducting operations against terrorists and this could be a reaction to the operation.																								It was unclear which group was behind the attack, he said. Police were investigating and tightening security at police stations across the port city of 14 million people. 																								Islamic militants have been blamed for a string of attacks in Pakistan since President Pervez Musharraf backed the US-led war on terror in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks.																								Jatoi said he was shot in the hand after firing on the attackers from a small mosque inside the police compound where he had been praying. Hundreds of bullets were fired in the station, he said.																								Two criminals held in the lock-up said the gunmen shouted they would not spare any policeman, said Abdul Khalaq Sheikh, a town police officer. We cannot rule out the involvement of militant groups, but nothing is certain at this stage, said Sheikh. 																								The gunmen retrieved a dead or wounded assailant before speeding off in several cars, police officials said. 																								The walls of the station, in the middle-class neighbourhood of Gulistan-e-Jauhar were riddled with bullet holes.

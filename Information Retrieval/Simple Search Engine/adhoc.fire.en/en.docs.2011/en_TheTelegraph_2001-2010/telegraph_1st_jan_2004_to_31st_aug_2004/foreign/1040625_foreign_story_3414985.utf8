 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Pak radical stays away from key panel meet
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, June 24: Pakistans National Security Council (NSC) convened for the first time today despite a boycott by the Opposition, which complained the body would further enhance the militarys dominant role in politics.																								President Pervez Musharraf, who chaired the meeting, dismissed the criticism and insisted it was a unique forum to discuss strategic issues of national interest.																								Musharraf had, in the past, claimed that the NSC would prevent the imposition of martial law which has often been blamed for the countrys political instability. 																								The NSC is not above the parliament It is a consultative body that will deliberate on national security issues, he said during the meeting.																								The NSC meeting was boycotted by the leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly and the secretary general of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman.																								The MMA had yesterday announced that Rehman would stay away from the NSC meeting to protest against Musharrafs role as army chief.																								Besides Musharraf and Rehman, the council consists of Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, key federal ministers, provincial governors and chief ministers, the speaker of the National Assembly, the chairman of the senate, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee and the chiefs of the army, navy and air force.																								The chief minister of MMA-ruled Northwestern Frontier province Akram Durrani also did not attend the meeting.																								Musharraf said he was clearly disappointed over Rehmans decision, adding that he had taken very strong exception of Durranis absence.

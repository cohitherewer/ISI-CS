Dawnette Knight, 32, in an undated letter addressed to the actor and her father-in-law, Kirk Douglas, said she wants to apologise for any distress I have caused you and your families. Knights lawyer, Richard Herman said he hopes his client will receive counselling and be able to put the matter behind her.

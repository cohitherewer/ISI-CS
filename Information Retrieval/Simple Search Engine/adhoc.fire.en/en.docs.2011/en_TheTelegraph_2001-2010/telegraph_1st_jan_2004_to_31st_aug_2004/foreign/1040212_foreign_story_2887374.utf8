 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Crash forces visa rule change
																								Dubai, Feb. 11 (Reuters): The United Arab Emirates said today it would cancel a rule requiring expatriates to leave the country to change their visas, after more than 30 workers on a visa change trip were killed in a plane crash.																								Under UAE regulations, expatriates, who make up 85 per cent of UAEs population of 3.8 million, need to briefly leave the Gulf Arab state to switch employers or change visit visas into residence permits.																								President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan told the council of ministers to issue the necessary regulations and directives and to cancel the exit requirement, the official WAM news agency said.																								The plane was flying from Irans Kish Island in the Gulf to the emirate of Sharjah when it crashed yesterday, killing 43 people  mostly migrant workers  of the 46 passengers and crew. 																								Kish, which Iran is promoting as a free trade zone and a holiday destination, is one of several destinations where foreign workers seeking to change visas travel.

 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Koiralas hard choices in battle of nerves
 PRANAY SHARMA																								Kathmandu, May 11: Five days after the resignation of the Surya Bahadur Thapa government, the Opposition alliance parties and King Gyanendra have been unable to break the political impasse in Nepal.																								Having spurned Gyanendras invitation for talks, the five-party alliance has stayed firm in not meeting the monarch till he gives an assurance of returning power to the democratic forces.																								Gyanendra, on the other hand, has indicated that while he wanted a political settlement through negotiations he was in no mood to wilt under pressure from the Opposition forces. 																								There are even strong signals that if the five-party alliance does not take the initiative of breaking the status quo, Gyanendra may go ahead and nominate his choice of candidate as the next Prime Minister of Nepal.																								As the battle of nerves continues between the two sides, pressure is mounting on the Nepali Congress to urgently initiate dialogue with Gyanendra. 																								But the Nepal Congress chief Girija Prasad Koirala cannot be seen breaking ranks with other partners of the alliance. This was evident after Koirala, despite his earlier arguments in favour of talks with the king, refused to meet Gyanendra individually. 																								Koirala cannot meet the king unless Gyanendra gives a public assurance that he would return sovereignty to the people. Anything short of this, will not only make the Nepali Congress leader look like a power hungry politician but also diminish his stature among his supporters and the partners of the five-party alliance.																								The other problem that Koirala faces is in getting the support of Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) Madhav Nepal on his candidature for Prime Ministership. Koirala has the support of the other three partnersthe Jan Morcha, the Nepal Mazdoor Kisan Party and Sadbhawna (Anand Devi faction ) for his candidature. 																								But Madhav Nepal, who was earlier the consensus candidate of the alliance for the Prime Ministers post, has neither given up his claim nor allow Koirala to put forward his name for the coveted post.																								However, if Koirala continues to dither, the king may select one of his supporters for the post. The names of the speaker of the last parliament Tarachand Bhat and at least three former chief justices of the Supreme Court are doing the rounds. Palace sources argued that if the impasse continues then Gyanendra may not only select a person of his choice but also announce the dates for the parliament elections.

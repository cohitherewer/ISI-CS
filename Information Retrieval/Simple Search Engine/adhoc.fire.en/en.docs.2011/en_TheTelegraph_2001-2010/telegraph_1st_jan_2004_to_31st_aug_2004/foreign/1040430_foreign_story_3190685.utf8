The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, April 30, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Bag byte Seattle, April 29 (Reuters): Insulting a President can be profitable, a Washington state bag maker has discovered, but it is best if the insult is written in French and tucked away on a tiny laundry label.																																	Labels on most of the backpacks, messenger and laptop bags made and sold by Tom Bihn have his companys contact information along with washing instructions in English and French along with a message reading: Nous sommes desoles que notre president soit un idiot. Nous avons pas vote pour lui. The translation reads: We are sorry that our president is an idiot. We did not vote for him.																																	Tom Bihn, who designs and makes bags for his eponymous company of 10 employees in Port Angeles, a seaside city 60 miles northwest of Seattle, claims he has no idea how the phrase got onto the label, but credits it with doubling bag sales. 																																	Asked if the message refers to President George W. Bush or French President Jacques Chirac, Bihn said he had no clue whom the insult referred to. Im going with the idea that it refers to me, the president of the company, he said. 																													 																Microwave London (Reuters): Microwave ovens should carry clear warnings about the dangers of exploding eggs, which can cause facial and eye injuries, doctors said. They issued the plea in a letter to the British Medical Journal after a nine-year-old girl suffered serious eye damage when a boiled egg reheated in a microwave blew up in her face. The doctors added that eggs with intact shells and yolks and even pierced eggs can explode when cooked in a microwave oven. 																													 																Safe shelterWarsaw (Reuters): A Polish shelter for retired circus animals is asking Warsaw storekeepers to donate wooden boards being used to barricade their shops during protests against this weeks economic summit. The Korabiewice home, which looks after 700 animals including six bears, said it would use the boards to improve accommodation at the shelter. The shelter isnt in the best financial shape, and the boards would be like a gift from heaven, Cezary Wyszynski of the Empatia animal-rights foundation said.

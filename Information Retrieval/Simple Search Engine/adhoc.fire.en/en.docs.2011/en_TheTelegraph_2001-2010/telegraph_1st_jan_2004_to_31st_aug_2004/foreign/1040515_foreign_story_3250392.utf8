 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 US calls for Lanka peace, not to lift Tiger ban
																								Colombo, May 14 (Reuters): The US called on Sri Lanka today to pursue efforts to make peace with Tamil Tiger rebels, but said it would not lift its long-standing ban on the guerrilla group until it renounced violence.																								We are calling on all parties in Sri Lanka to support the peace process and to move forward with the peace process because its only through peace this country can have any long-lasting stability and the prosperity that goes with it, said Christina Rocca, US assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs.																								Her remarks at a news conference followed comments from the Tigers that mediator Norway would announce details within days on when suspended peace talks might resume.																								US officials do not meet the Tamil Tigers, but Rocca met representatives of the rebel-backed Tamil National Alliance, who said the ban should be lifted to take the peace process forward.																								President Chandrika Kumaratungas United Peoples Freedom Alliance won power last month after a feud with the former government of Ranil Wickremesinghe  who signed a February 2002 truce with the Tigers  resulted in a snap election. 																								Kumaratungas party takes a harder line on the rebels.

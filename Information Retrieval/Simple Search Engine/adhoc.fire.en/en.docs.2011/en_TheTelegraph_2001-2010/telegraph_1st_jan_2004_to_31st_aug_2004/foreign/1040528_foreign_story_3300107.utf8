Washington, May 27 (Reuters): Nine months after Congress shut down a controversial Pentagon computer-surveillance programme, the US government continues to comb private records to sniff out suspicious activity, according to a congressional report obtained by Reuters.																								Privacy concerns prompted Congress to kill the Pentagons $54 million Total Information Awareness programme last September, but government computers are still scanning a vast array of databases for clues about criminal or terrorist activity, the General Accounting Office found. 																								Overall, 36 of the governments 199 data mining efforts collect personal information from the private sector, a move experts say could violate civil liberties if left unchecked. Several appear to be patterned after Total Information Awareness, which critics said could have led to an Orwellian surveillance state in which citizens have little privacy. I believe that Total Information Awareness is continuing under other names, and the (defence department) projects listed here might fit that bill, said Peter Swire, an Ohio State University law professor who served as the Clinton administrations top privacy official. Defence department officials did not respond to a request for comment.																								Data-mining software has been used by the government and private businesses for years to make sense of large piles of information. Banks use data-mining tools to sniff out possible credit-card fraud, for example. Most government data-mining projects aim to improve service or cut down on waste and fraud, the report said. The US navy tracks each ship part ordered since 1980 to see which ones fail most frequently, while the department of education checks its student loan records against those held by the social security administration to make sure it is not loaning money to dead people. Others projects raised red flags for privacy experts.																								The Pentagon agency that handled TIA is not working on any data-mining projects, but another agency is mining intelligence reports and Internet searches to identify foreign terrorists or US citizens connected to foreign terrorism activities, the report said.																								That description prompted Electronic Privacy Information Center general counsel David Sobel to file a Freedom of Information Act request to find out more about the project. Congress now needs to take a close look at ways to oversee and regulate the use of data-mining technology within the government, he said.

 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 UK smelly food plea irks Italians
				 	 The poster in the London Underground that offended some Italians. (Reuters)																								London, July 30 (Reuters): A poster campaign urging people not to eat smelly foods on Londons overcrowded and overheated underground system has sparked a diplomatic incident with Italy.																								The poster showing an overweight and Mediterranean-looking man lounging in an underground train carriage surrounded by hams, salamis and strings of garlic triggered a torrent of letters from angry Italians and even the Italian ambassador.																								We considered this poster to be very offensive to the Italian image, Italian products and the Italian company that is clearly identified, the Italian embassys economic counsellor Guido Cerboni said. It is a caricature of Italians.																								Under the avalanche of Italian outrage London Underground has apologised and agreed to withdraw the poster.																								We apologise for any offence this has caused the Italian community. It was meant to be a light-hearted attempt to stop travellers eating smelly food, a spokeswoman said. Cerboni said the embassy now considered the incident closed, but he expected the company whose label is visible in the poster to sue for damages.

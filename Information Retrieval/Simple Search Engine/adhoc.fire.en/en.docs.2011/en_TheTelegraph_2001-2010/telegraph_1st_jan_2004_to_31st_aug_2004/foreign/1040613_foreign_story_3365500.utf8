 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 Final farewell to Gipper
				 	 end of story: Nancy Reagan (centre) is comforted by her son Ron (left) and daughter Patti during the burial service for Ronald Reagan in Simi Valley, California. (Reuters) Simi Valley (California), June 12 (Reuters): Ronald Reagan was laid to rest in the rolling California hills that he loved yesterday in a sunset ceremony that ended a week of national mourning for the 40th President  the last chapter of what President George W. Bush calleda great American story.																								Hundreds of close friends and family paid a final farewell to Reagan, whose passing at age 93 stirred an outpouring of emotion from a nation nostalgic for his warmth, charm and optimism.																								At the burial ceremony at the Reagan Presidential library, a lone bagpiper played Amazing Grace, US navy jets flew overhead in what is called a Missing Man Formation and an honour guard presented widow Nancy Reagan with the flag that had draped his coffin for his last journey home.																								She dabbed her eyes, hugged the flag to her chest and then walked to the coffin, placed her cheek on the polished wood and began to weep as her children Ron and Patti comforted her. The frail 82-year-old widow placed a single kiss on the coffin and reluctantly allowed herself to be led away so that the burial service could be concluded. In contrast to the formal, state funeral service held earlier in the day in Washington, DC, where President Bush told an assembly of world leaders that a great American story had ended, Reagans burial was a family affair attended by some 700 close friends.																								In short but moving speeches, his three surviving children spoke lovingly of the man they knew as a father rather than a world leader and celebrated his humour and odd habits like pulling a strangers earlobe. He is home now. He is free. In his final letter to the American people, Dad wrote: I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. This evening he has arrived, his youngest son Ronald Prescott Reagan said, briefly touching his fathers flag draped coffin. History will record his worth as a leader. We here have long since measured his worth as a man, he added.																								Michael Reagan, the son he adopted during his first marriage to actress Jane Wyman, told the crowd his father once gave him marital advice: Youll never get in trouble if you tell her I love you once a day. I am sure that he told that to Nancy. Daughter Patti Davis told how her father, when she was a young girl, gave such a touching burial service for a pet goldfish that she offered to kill all the other fish in the tank and he had to spend a lot of time dissuading her.

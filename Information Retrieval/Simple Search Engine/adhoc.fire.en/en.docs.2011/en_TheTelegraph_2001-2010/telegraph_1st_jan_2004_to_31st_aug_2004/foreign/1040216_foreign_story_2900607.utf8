 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Flu toll rises to 20, leopard falls prey 
																								Bangkok, Feb. 15 (Reuters): A teenage boy died of bird flu in Thailand, taking Asias toll to at least 20 today, ahead of emergency regional talks on ways to battle the rampaging virus.																								Ekaphan Pongkhan, 13, succumbed after more than two weeks in hospital, the latest victim of the virulent H5N1 virus that has now killed six Thais and 14 Vietnamese.																								He died last night of respiratory failure, said Dr Charal Trinwuthipong, chief of the department of disease control.																								Ekaphan and the other Thai victims  four boys aged between six and seven and a 58-year-old woman  are thought to have caught the virus from direct contact with infected poultry.																								Fears persist that the virus could combine with a human flu virus to become a deadly disease that can spread among people. Now there are concerns it may have leapt to exotic animals.																								Tests showed a clouded leopard kept in a zoo near Bangkok died of bird flu last month, but it was not yet clear whether the H5N1 virus was responsible, environment minister Prapat Panyachatraksa said on Friday.																								The animal died on January 27 at Kaokiew Zoo, 60 km east of Bangkok, three days after suffering from respiratory problems.																								Two of three tests conducted on the animal showed positive for avian influenza, an environment ministry official said today. Experts will meet to discuss the test results tomorrow.																								Zoo officials have told the ministry the leopard, raised alone under a special breeding programme, was not exposed to chickens or fed chicken meat.																								If confirmed, experts say it could be the first case of avian influenza in such animals.																								If it is true, there have been no reports of these kinds of animals succumbing to bird flu, said Professor Malik Peiris, an avian influenza expert at the University of Hong Kong.																								Experts say the virus, which has forced the slaughter of some 80 million birds in the region, mostly in Vietnam and Thailand, is probably spread by migrating birds. The World Health Organisation says it expects more people to be infected by the virus beyond Vietnam and Thailand. 																								There are 22 suspected cases in Thailand, the latest a one-year-old girl added to the list yesterday.																								The UN has urged Asian countries not to relax in the war on bird flu because the epidemic is still spreading in Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Laos.																								The warning came as senior health and agricultural officials, including UN experts from Bangkok, were due to gather in New Delhi for an emergency summit of seven South Asian nations tomorrow to discuss joint efforts to fight the epidemic

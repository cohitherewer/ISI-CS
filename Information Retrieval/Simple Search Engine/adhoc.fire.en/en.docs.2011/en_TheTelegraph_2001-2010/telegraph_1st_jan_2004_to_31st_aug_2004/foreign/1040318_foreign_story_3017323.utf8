 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Tigers vow end to split
																								Colombo, March 17 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers vowed today to peacefully end a temporary split that endangers the islands peace process and said talks to end a 20-year civil war can still restart after next months general election.																								The Tigers, who expelled their top eastern commander Karuna nearly two weeks ago for acting traitorously to the Tamil people, also warned Sri Lankan military and political groups not to try to take advantage of the internal fight.																								We have our strategy to overcome the situation without armed violence and bloodshed. Karunas rebellion is a temporary aberration, which will pass away in time, Anton Balasingham, the chief negotiator for the LTTE, said without elaborating on the plans.																								The split shocked Sri Lanka amid an election campaign that is already being fought over how the government should pursue a peace bid with the LTTE to end the war that has killed 64,000.																								Karuna  the nom de guerre for V. Muralitharan  has shown no sign of backing down since accusing the LTTE leadership in the north of discriminating against Tamils in the east.																								Balasingham, in an interview with the pro-rebel Tamil Guardian newspaper, said the split would not undermine the peace process or the Tamil national struggle.																								The peace process will resume after the general elections between the LTTE and the new government elected by the Sinhala people with a mandate for peace and negotiated political settlement, he said.																								Balasingham also warned military and political groups in Colombo about making contact with Karuna. 																								We should let it be known to his contacts that they will cause irreparable damage to the peace process if they exploit Karunas dissent, he said.																								Efforts to restart peace talks stalled last April were already in turmoil due to a feud between President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that led to a parliamentary election being called.

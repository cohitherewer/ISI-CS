 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 US unleashes fresh Falluja fire

(Reuters)																								Falluja, April 28 (Reuters): US marines launched fresh air and ground attacks against guerrillas in Falluja today, and President George W. Bush warned his troops would take whatever action was necessary to secure the Iraqi city.																								Bush said there were pockets of resistance in the Sunni bastion, some 50 km west of Baghdad, but most of Falluja is returning to normal.																								Our military commanders will take whatever actions necessary to secure Falluja, Bush said.																								Black smoke rose above Fallujas palm-dotted Golan district from the fighting, as US commanders said they were holding back from an all-out storming of the city of 300,000 in hopes of guerrillas agreeing to hand over their heavy weapons. US forces, who have encircled Falluja for more than three weeks, are wary of causing civilian casualties because it could inflame public opinion across Iraq.																								A year after the fall of Saddam Hussein, who spent his 67th birthday in the custody of US forces today, American troops are trying to quell twin threats to the new order in Iraq  from the Falluja guerrillas and Shia rebels in the south.																								In the latest fighting in Falluja, just over two months before a planned US handover of power to Iraqis, US Cobra attack helicopters strafed the Golan district after shelling and fierce exchanges of gunfire broke out.																								Despite the UNs Iraq envoy Lakhdar Brahimi warning of bloody consequences should talks fail in Falluja, a heavy AC-130 gunship  first used in Vietnam  blasted Golan overnight in the fiercest display of firepower yet in the confrontation. The Marines stormed an area around a railway station and called in air strikes elsewhere after snipers fired on them, the US military said.																								Hospital staff said 10 local people had been wounded in the fighting. This attack shows the frustration in the ranks of American soldiers in Iraq and the American political defeat, said Falluja resident Ali Abdullah. We have uncovered the treachery and barbarity of the US army. Heavy fighting has flared frequently in Falluja this month despite truce efforts by Iraqi mediators and others.																								Local doctors say some 600 people have been killed and many more have fled Falluja since the Marines launched a crackdown after the killing and mutilation of four American security guards in the city.																								In Falluja a year ago, US soldiers killed and wounded dozens of demonstrators, angering Sunnis in a city that has become a byword for resistance to the US-led occupation. A fierce clash also occurred overnight in Khaldiya, west of Falluja, witnesses said, and US troops were out in force in other towns in the so-called Sunni triangle north and west of Baghdad, Saddams home region and his main stronghold.																								Some 115 US soldiers have been killed in combat in Iraq this month, compared with fewer than 100 in the three weeks it took to oust Saddam. At least 520 have been killed in combat since the US-led invasion of Iraq in March last year. At least three soldiers of the US-led occupying force died of combat wounds today in two incidents. US forces could face an even more delicate dilemma in the Najaf, where a radical cleric from Iraqs Shia majority, Moqtada al-Sadr, has taken refuge among the shrines with his several thousand strong Mehdi Army militia.																								US commanders near Najaf said an AC-130 attack on Monday, which they believed killed some 60 Shia fighters, appeared to have demoralised Sadrs supporters and was part of a strategy to persuade the cleric to give himself up.																								But Sadrs forces vowed to resist any American incursions.																								An aide to Sadr  wanted by an Iraqi judge in connection with the murder of another cleric  was quick to echo local accusations that many civilians died in Mondays attack near Kufa, outside the city, the heaviest in a three-week standoff.																								Qais al-Khazali said a US incursion into Najaf itself would transform the situation into a Shia confrontation with the Americans. Sadr has vowed suicide attacks if the Americans attempt to enter Najaf.

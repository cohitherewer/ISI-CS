 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Focus on Pak link to nuke trade after arrest
																								Washington, Jan. 16 (AP): The arrest this month of a businessman accused of smuggling nuclear bomb triggers to Pakistan is the latest indication that Islamabad remains a major player in the nuclear black market.																								Asher Karni, 50, is accused of being the middleman for a Pakistani companys purchase of dozens of triggered spark gaps  electronic devices that can be used to trigger nuclear weapons. Agents arrested Karni, who is an Israeli citizen, on January 2 in Denver.																								If the devices were indeed headed for Pakistans nuclear programme, the most likely explanation would be that Pakistan was planning to construct more nuclear bombs. Court documents in Karnis case offer a glimpse into the global nuclear black market.																								The deal involved triggered spark gaps, electronic devices which are used to break up kidney stones and triggering nuclear detonations. Anyone exporting spark gaps from the US to Pakistan must have a licence issued by the US government.																								Karni heads Top-Cape Technology in Cape Town, South Africa, which trades in military and aviation electronic gear. Karni used an elaborate scheme to get around US export restrictions to Pakistan, commerce department special agent James Brigham charged in a federal court affidavit.																								An anonymous source in South Africa tipped off US authorities and provided information, including detailed shipping schedules and Karnis e-mails, to help in tracking the electronic devices, the agent said.																								Karnis contact in Pakistan had asked the businessman to buy 100-400 spark gaps from an American manufacturer, Perkinelmer Optoelectronics, Brigham said in his affidavit. 																								A Perkinelmer representative in France wrote to Karni last summer that exporting spark gaps to Pakistan would require a US licence. Karni then contacted a company in New Jersey, which ordered 200 devices from Perkinelmer, Brigham said.																								At the request of federal agents, Perkinelmer disabled the 66 spark gaps in an initial shipment to the New Jersey company, Giza Technologies Inc. 																								Giza, which has not been charged in the case, shipped the devices to South Africa, listing them on shipping documents as electrical equipment for a hospital in Soweto. Karni repackaged the spark gaps and sent them to Pakistan via Dubai, Brigham said. Pakistani officials say the government is not involved in any illegal nuclear deals. But Pakistan has questioned three scientists based on information from the International Atomic Energy Agency.

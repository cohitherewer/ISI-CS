 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Arms dealer names Mark
																								 The idea is to replace Obiang, who has been in power since 1979 after executing the former ruler, who happened to be his uncle, with a more accommodating man, Severo Moto, an Opposition figure currently in exile in Spain  or so it is alleged. In return, Moto, once he is in power, will shower his benefactors with business concessions.																								It is claimed that a Briton, Simon Mann, an Old Etonian-turned-African mercenary, is the ringleader. In March, he was held in Zimbabwe, allegedly with a plane full of mercenaries on their way to overthrow the Equatorial Guinea government. 																								Mann is one of 70 defendants held in Zimbabwe while another 19 are on trial in the Equatorial Guinea capital, Malabo. 																								They include South African arms dealer Nick du Toit, another alleged key figure, who told the court today that he met Mark in the months before the alleged plot was foiled. Du Toit, who faces the death penalty for his alleged role, said Mark was interested only in purchasing hardware that was not involved in the alleged coup plot. He was interested only in buying military helicopters for a mining deal with Sudan, he said.																								British reports today did not paint too flattering a portrait of Obiang. That he is said to be a ruthless dictator is par for the course but he is also accused of having recently styled himself as God. He is even accused of eating his opponents testicles. He fits the western stereotype of the African dictator.																								Some would claim that Mark, who left Harrow (Nehrus and Churchills old school) in 1971 with three levels, is simply not bright enough to be involved in such a complicated conspiracy. On the other hand, he has been shrewd enough to make a fortune estimated at 60 million by Sunday Times, apparently by shamelessly using the line, Perhaps, you know my mum...																								While Marks twin sister Carol has made a life in journalism  she did not scream for her mothers help when Max Hastings, editor of The Daily Telegraph, fired her as a feature writer  Mark has always cut a sour figure.																								He is best known for getting lost in the desert in 1982, the year of the Falklands War. His mother wept when Mark, a would-be racing driver, went missing in the Sahara during the Paris-Dakar car rally. Not everyone in Britain shared the Prime Ministers joy when her son was spotted and rescued by a helicopter.																								During the 1987 general election, Mark asked Bernard Ingham, then Thatchers press secretary, how best he could help his mother win another term in office. 																								Ingham, a blunt Yorkshireman, reportedly replied: Leave the country.																								Mark eventually did that, settling in South Africa, with his wife, a Texan heiress called Diane Bergdof whom he married in 1987. 																								The couple, said to have had marriage problems, remains together and has a son and a daughter.																								Today at 7 am, at his home in the exclusive suburb of Constantia in Cape Town, Mark was arrested by police who had come equipped with search warrants. 																								They examined his records and his computer.																								Police spokesman Sipho Ngwema said Mark, if found guilty, he could face up to 15 years in prison  and a lot worse if extradited to Equatorial Guinea.																								The spokesman added: We have evidence, credible evidence, and information that he was involved in the attempted coup. We refuse that South Africa be a springboard for coups in Africa and elsewhere. We believe Mr Thatcher assisted in finance and logistics.																								Equatorial Guinea justice minister Ruben Mangue welcomed Marks arrest and told a BBC interview: We congratulate the South African police and the South African government for their efforts in the struggle against terrorism and mercenaries activities.																								He urged other foreign governments, including Britains, to take action against their nationals who, he said, were involved in the coup plot.																								There are American citizens, British citizens, Spanish citizens involved in the operation. We want their governments to follow the same example, Mangue said.																								He played down suggestions that Equatorial Guinea would now be seeking Marks extradition from South Africa.																								Lets first give an opportunity to the South African authorities and the South African legal system to handle the situation, the minister said.

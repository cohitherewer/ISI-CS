 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 US citizen tests to get tougher
																								Washington, July 13 (Reuters): The US government plans to introduce by late 2006 more rigorous testing in English language, US history and civics for immigrants hoping to become citizens, the programme director said today.																								Gerri Ratliff, director for the naturalisation redesign project at US Citizen and Immigration Services, told a press briefing that current tests for prospective new citizens varied widely from office to office.																								We want a test that is more meaningful, reliable and fair, focusing on concepts that will ensure that applicants will be able to function as new citizens, she said at the briefing organised by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think-tank that argues for a slowing of immigration to the US. Her office plans to run a pilot programme in several cities next year.

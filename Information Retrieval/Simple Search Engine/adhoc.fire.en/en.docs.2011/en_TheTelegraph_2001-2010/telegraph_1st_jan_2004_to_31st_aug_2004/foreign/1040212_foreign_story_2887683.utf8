 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Microsoft admits flaw in most Windows systems
 Seattle/San Francisco, Feb.  11 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp. said today a critical  flaw in most versions of its flagship Windows operating  system could allow hackers to break into personal computers  and snoop on sensitive data.																								Although no computers were reported to have been compromised, the worlds largest software maker warned that Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were at risk. Microsoft announced the flaw in its monthly security bulletin. The company offered software updates to fix the software flaw, which it assigned its most severe rating of critical.																								It does affect all (current) versions of Windows, said Stephen Toulouse, security programme manager for Microsofts Security Response Center. Were not aware of anyone affected by this at this time.																								Marc Maiffret, co-founder of eEye Digital Security, the company that discovered the flaw, criticised Microsoft for taking more than six months to come up with a patch to fix the problem.																								The flaw could allow a hacker to break into a computer running Microsofts Windows operating system in several ways and then use the compromised machine to run malicious programs and steal or delete key data, Maiffret and other experts said. Last year Microsoft adopted a new monthly patch release programme, which it said would let customers more easily apply software fixes for security bugs.																								We contacted Microsoft about these vulnerabilities 200 days ago, which is insane, he said. Even the most secure Windows networks are going to be vulnerable to this flaw, which is very unique.																								Microsofts Toulouse said the company needed time to make sure it got the fix right, especially given how pervasive the vulnerability is in the software. We wanted to make absolutely sure we were doing as broad an investigation as possible, he said. Windows users can download the patch for the vulnerability from http://www.microsoft.com/security.																								The obvious steps to take are to run Windows Update and install the patches to fix the vulnerabilities as soon as possible, said Craig Schmugar, a virus research manager at Network Associates Inc.s McAfee anti-virus unit. The latest fixes for Microsofts software are unrelated to the recent virus attacks called MyDoom and its variants, Schmugar said.																								Microsoft also released a critical update a week ago, ahead of yesterdays scheduled release, to fix a patch in its Explorer Web browser that could make PCs vulnerable to attackers.

 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Jew leaders slam Gibson Christ
																								Los Angeles, Jan. 24 (Reuters): Two prominent Jewish leaders played film critics yesterday and gave a resounding thumbs down to Mel Gibsons controversial film The Passion of the Christ, saying the movie blamed Jews for the death of Jesus and could cause tremendous harm.																								One leader, the Anti-Defamation Leagues chief Abraham Foxman, had to sneak in to see the film at a screening for Christian ministers, while the other, Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said he was shown the film by a friend who wished to remain anonymous.																								Gibson has shown the movie only to selected audiences so far although it will open in 2,000 theatres on February 25. The two versions were slightly different with Foxman saying the screening he saw contained the controversial passage from Matthew in which the Jewish high priest Caiaphas declares: His blood be on us and our children  a curse used for centuries to blame the Jews for deicide.																								A spokesman for Gibson, who has come under fire from some Jewish groups for his film, said that a final version of the movie has not yet been made. He also said that the two Jewish leaders had a right to their opinions and said Gibson had said it was never his intention to make an anti-Semitic film. 																								Rabbi Hier said: I can tell you this is a terrible film, a terrible portrayal of Jews and will cause tremendous harm and be a delight to all the enemies of the Jewish people. The Jews are not only contrasted badly against the new Jews, the Christians, but against the Roman hierarchy which with the exception of the four whippers of Christ appear as pleasing, thoughtful and sensitive, Hier said.

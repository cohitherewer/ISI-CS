 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Scribe backs Kerry on war
																								Pittsburgh, Aug. 21 (Reuters): An American journalist who commanded a boat alongside John Kerry in Vietnam broke a 35-year silence today and defended the Democratic presidential candidate against Republican critics of his military service.																								Weighing in on what has become the most bitterly divisive issue of the 2004 campaign for the White House, William Rood of the Chicago Tribune said the tales told by Kerrys detractors are untrue.																								There were three swift boats on the river that day in Vietnam more than 35 years ago  three officers and 15 crew members. Only two of those officers remain to talk about what happened on February 28, 1969, he wrote in a story that appeared on the newspapers website today.																								One is John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate who won a Silver Star for what happened on that date. I am the other.																								Before now, wanting to put memories of war and killing behind him, Rood had refused all requests for interviews on the subject, including from his own newspaper. But Kerrys critics, armed with stories I know to be untrue, have charged that the accounts of what happened were overblown. he wrote.																								The critics have taken pains to say theyre not trying to cast doubts on the merit of what others did, but their version of events has splashed doubt on all of us.																								Its gotten harder and harder for those of us who were there to listen to accounts we know to be untrue, especially when they come from people who were not there, he added.																								Kerry, a former Navy lieutenant, is a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, and his war service is essential to his ability to challenge President George W. Bush on issues of national security and leadership in the face of the Iraq war and terrorism threats.																								Increasingly, veterans opposed to Kerry and allied with Bush  led by a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  have tried to undermine Kerrys service record and credibility and the justification for his medals.																								In the face of a new CBS poll showing Kerrys support among veterans has slipped since the Democratic convention, the Massachusetts Senator has launched an aggressive counterattack.																								Yesterday, Kerry accused the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth of collaborating with the Bush campaign and asked the Federal Election Commission to force the group to withdraw ads challenging his Vietnam service.

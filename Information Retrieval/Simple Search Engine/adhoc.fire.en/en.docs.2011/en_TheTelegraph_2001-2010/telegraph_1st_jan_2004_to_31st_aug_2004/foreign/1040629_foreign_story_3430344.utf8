 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Good step forward but will wait and see: Arabs
																								Cairo, June 28 (Reuters): A transfer of authority to an Iraqi government today failed to impress Arab analysts, who predicted violence against US troops would continue and Arab governments would withhold full diplomatic recognition.																								An Arab diplomat said most Arab states would welcome the change as a good step forward but maintain their wait and see attitude until Iraqis choose a new government through elections. The Iraqi people are not easily duped. As long as the Iraqi people see foreign tanks in the streets, I dont think things will change, said Hassan Nafaa, an analyst in Cairo University.																								Its not really a genuine transfer, with this heavy American military and civilian presence and with a low requirement that American troops get authorisation before taking any military action, added Mustaya al-Sayyid, a professor of political science at the university. The US and the Iraqi government have portrayed the transfer as a decisive step towards putting Iraqis back in charge of their country after 14 months of occupation, in an attempt to persuade Iraqis that resistance is pointless.																								But Arabs outside Iraq, who mostly opposed the invasion of Iraq last year by the US and its allies, suspect that Washington now wants to retain its influence over Baghdad while giving the impression that Iraqis are fully in control. Under the new arrangements, more than 160,000 foreign troops, mostly from the US, will stay in the country. 																								The analysts said Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi would not be able to stop the violence because his opponents will not see any real change.																								Diaa Rashwan, an analyst at the al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, said the major challenge for Allawis government was the violence. 																								But the main reason for this violence is the presence of foreign occupation troops. Because they have a new government and the occupation is still there, I dont think they will stop the violence.

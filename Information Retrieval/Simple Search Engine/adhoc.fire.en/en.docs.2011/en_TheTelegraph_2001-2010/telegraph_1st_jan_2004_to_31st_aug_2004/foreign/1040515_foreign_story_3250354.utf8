 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Jewish ban on Indian wigs
																								Jerusalem, May 14 (Reuters): An ultraorthodox Jewish sage has issued a ritual ban against natural hair wigs from India, saying they may have been made from tresses shorn from women during Hindu ceremonies, Israeli newspapers reported today.																								Many Orthodox Jewish women, who adhere to rules of modesty by allowing only their husbands to see their natural hair, responded to the ruling by switching to synthetic wigs or hats, the Yedioth Ahronoth and Haaretz dailies reported.																								The edict, issued by the spiritual leader of an ultraorthodox sect, said some hair in wigs sold in Israel may have come from women who took part in Hindu haircutting ceremonies, which was tantamount to idol worship.																								Palestinian militants blew up two Israeli soldiers in an armoured jeep in southern Gaza today, witnesses said.

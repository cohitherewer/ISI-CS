 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Reuters journalist dies in attack
				 	 Snuffed out: Adlan Khasanov																								Moscow, May 9 (Reuters): Reuters journalist Adlan Khasanov was among at least 14 people killed in a bomb attack on Victory Day celebrations in the Chechen capital Grozny today, a member of his family said.																								He had been covering the annual event which commemorates Moscows victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. 																								There were no other immediate details.																								One of Khasanovs brothers, reached by telephone in Grozny, said in Moscow that the body had been brought back from a hospital to the family home and would be buried in Grozny.																								The blast killed at least 14 people and injured 20, Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Chechen interior ministry as saying.																								Khasanov, 33, began working with Reuters in the late 1990s, mostly in his native Chechnya. He worked as both a photographer and a television cameraman.																								We are shocked and dismayed at the news of Adlans death. He was a fine journalist working with dedication and great courage in often dangerous conditions. He was also a delightful man. Adlan will be greatly missed by his colleagues, Reuters editor-in-chief Geert Linnebank said.																								Khasanov is survived by three brothers and three sisters.

 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Blair grilled
																								London, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blair was grilled today over a late submission by his government to a potentially explosive inquiry into the death of a British scientist, which is due to report shortly.																								Blairs spokesman admitted the government had sent information to senior judge Lord Hutton after he concluded his investigation last autumn but denied it included new evidence.																								Opposition Conservatives demanded its publication and accused Blair of trying to pre-empt Huttons findings. But Hutton said there was nothing surprising about the submission. 																								Weapons expert David Kelly slashed his wrist last July after being exposed as the source behind a BBC reporters claim that Blair and his team inflated the threat posed by Iraq to justify a war which most Britons opposed.																								Speculation is rife that the Prime Ministers team wanted to put their slant on evidence given by Sir Kevin Tebbit, top civil servant at the ministry of defence. 																								At the last day of the inquiry, Tebbit said Blair had chaired a meeting where it was decided to make a statement publicly clarifying the governments position  a move which led to Kellys exposure.

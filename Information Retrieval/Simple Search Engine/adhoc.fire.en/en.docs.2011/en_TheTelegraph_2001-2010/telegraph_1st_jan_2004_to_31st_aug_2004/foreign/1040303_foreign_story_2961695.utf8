The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Britons queue up to be hired as Bonds cousins
				 	 The MI5 headquarters in London. (Reuters)																								London, March 2 (Reuters): Britains announcement last week that it would recruit more secret agents to fight terrorism has prompted a flood of applications, the government said today.																								A home office spokeswoman said nearly 4,000 people had applied to join MI5  the domestic intelligence service  since home secretary David Blunkett unveiled the recruitment drive.																								Only about one in a hundred of the new applicants could expect to make it through the rigorous recruitment process. The agency, which now employs about 1,900 people, is looking to recruit 300 per year.																								Starting salaries are only about 20,000 per year, less than qualified graduates might expect in the private sector, but the careers info page at MI5s website promises a friendly and informal environment with people just like you.																								The importance of our work, and the fact that we cannot talk about it publicly, creates a stimulating atmosphere of cooperation and mutual support, it boasts. There is a first-name culture throughout and a general willingness to socialise both inside and outside the office.																								It also promises air-conditioning, up-to-date workstations and a restaurant, shop, multi-gym and squash courts at its London riverside headquarters.																								MI5 is one of several secret agencies in Britain, along with the foreign spy agency MI6  James Bonds employer in the movies  and the eavesdropping headquarters GCHQ.																								Britains overseas spies have been much in the news lately over the failure to find banned weapons which they predicted would be discovered in Iraq  and over breaches in their vaunted culture of secrecy.																								Last week, prosecutors dropped charges against a former GCHQ translator who admitted leaking a secret document in what she called an attempt to stop the war in Iraq.																								Candidates must be British citizens, resident in Britain for 10 years. And they also need to know how to keep a secret.

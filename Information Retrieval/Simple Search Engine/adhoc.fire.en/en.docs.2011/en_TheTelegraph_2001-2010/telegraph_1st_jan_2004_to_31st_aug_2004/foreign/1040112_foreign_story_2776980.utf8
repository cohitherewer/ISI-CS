 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Pak intelligence officer held in Pervez probe
				 	 Pervez Musharraf																								Islamabad, Jan. 11 (PTI): Pakistan police have detained a local intelligence official for allegedly tipping off the two suicide bombers who tried to crash their explosive-laden vehicles into President Pervez Musharrafs convoy at Rawalpindi on Christmas day. 																								Muhammad Naeem, an official of the Islamabad special branch, reportedly tipped off the timing of the departure of the presidential convoy to the suicide bombers over his cellphone. Naeem was detailed for the security of Musharraf at the convention centre where he addressed a meeting on science and technology on December 25 here.																								Inspector general of police Islamabad Fiaz Ahmad Khan Toru said the intelligence operative was in touch with the suicide attackers over his phone, which made him a suspect. He must be interrogated about the controversial call, Toru was quoted as saying by the daily The News.																								Naeem was traced by investigators as they recovered the chip of the mobile phone used by one of the suicide bombers killed while attempting to ram his explosives-laden vehicle into Musharrafs convoy. 																								Naeem, who was detained on December 28, was in touch with the suicide attacker Jamil, the report said adding he had bought a new motorbike few days before the assassination attempt. 																								Investigators believe his detention may lead to clues about those who masterminded and executed the suicide attack on President Musharraf, the newspaper said. There is evidence which prove links between the first attempt on the Presidents life on December 14 at the Chaklala bridge near Ammar chowk and the second attempt at Jhanda Chichi chowk on December 25, an official said. 																								As many as 109 calls dialled to or from the suicide bombers, were detected during the investigation and all of them were being scrutinised. Significantly, the duration of all the calls was of three seconds except one of 12 seconds. We have made a headway to the network through these calls, the official said. 																								Based on the mobile calls, another suspect, Syed Ghulam Yasin Bokhari was reported to have been arrested from Bahawalpur. Investigators say he used to provide manpower and training to terrorists and is reported to be a member of a banned group.

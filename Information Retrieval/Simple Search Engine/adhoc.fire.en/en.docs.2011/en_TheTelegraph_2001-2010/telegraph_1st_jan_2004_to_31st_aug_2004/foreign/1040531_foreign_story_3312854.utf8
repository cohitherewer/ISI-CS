The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Saudi vows to pump in more oil 
 A scene from The Passion of the ChristKhobar (Saudi Arabia), May 30 (Reuters): Oil superpower Saudi Arabia today vowed to keep its crude supplies flowing smoothly to world markets after a deadly militant attack on the eastern oil city of Khobar.																								But pledges of secure supplies from state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco might not go far enough to soothe jittery world markets, where prices again were threatening to pierce the $40 a barrel mark.																								International markets have been on edge over the possibility of a militant strike in Saudi Arabia, the worlds top oil exporter now pumping more than nine million barrels daily in a bid to cool scorching prices.																								A purported statement from al Qaida boasted it had hit at American companies which specialised in oil and claimed the attack on Khobar that killed 17 foreigners will heighten dealers concern about supply security in West Asia.																								No Saudi Aramco facilities or personnel were affected by the incidents in al-Khobar on May 29, 2004, and normal operations continue at all of the companys installations, state-run Saudi Aramco said in a statement.																								...the company is committed to carrying out the Saudi Arabian governments policy of providing a reliable supply of oil to meet world energy demand.																								Suspected al Qaida militants killed some hostages after Saudi commandos stormed a building today to rescue some 50 foreigners in a Khobar housing compound. Hostage-taking is a new twist in the wave of militant violence sweeping the kingdom.																								The attack has some shock value for oil prices, but things may calm down again, said Peter Gignoux, senior oil adviser at New York-based GDP Associates.																								This was a terrible act of terrorism, but it hasnt had any impact on Saudi oil production or exports. 																								Saudi oil officials met senior Western executives at Aramco headquarters in nearby Dhahran to ease concerns over security after the Khobar attacks, a Western industry source said.																								The state oil companys top priority is to ensure the security of its employees, dependents, facilities and communities, by working closely with Saudi government authorities, the Aramco statement said.																								The kingdoms well protected energy infrastructure has yet to be struck by militants, but some dealers feared emboldened fighters might shift from soft targets and attack production and export facilities.																								Khobar has no production, export or refining facilities, but Western oil firms have offices and housing in the city 400 km northeast of the capital Riyadh.																								Despite the fresh weekend violence, Western oil majors said they were unlikely to pull out of the oil-rich kingdom.																								Executives from Royal Dutch/Shell, Total and Lukoil had lived at the Oasis compound, scene of the hostage ordeal. The three firms are working on projects to find and pump natural gas in the kingdom.																								I dont expect a mass exodus, but families will consider leaving, said a Western oil executive.																								Yesterdays attack in Khobar comes just days ahead of a meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in Beirut where the cartel is due to consider a big increase in output limits.																								Saudi Arabia, the only Opec member with any significant immediate spare capacity, has made clear it will pump real extra volumes of some 700,000 bpd, irrespective of quotas.

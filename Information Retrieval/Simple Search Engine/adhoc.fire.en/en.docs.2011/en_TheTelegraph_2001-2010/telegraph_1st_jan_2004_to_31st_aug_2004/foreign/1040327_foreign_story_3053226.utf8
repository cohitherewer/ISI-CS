 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Senate nod to rights of unborn child
																								Washington, March 26 (Reuters): The US Senate, after an emotional debate, easily passed legislation yesterday to make it a federal crime to harm or kill an unborn child, an issue that spilled into the battle over abortion rights.																								On a 61-38 vote, the Republican-led Senate sent the measure, earlier approved by the House of Representatives, to President George W. Bush. 																								Pregnant women who have been harmed by violence, and their families, know that there are two victims  the mother and the unborn child  and both victims should be protected by federal law, Bush said in a statement. 																								Earlier, the Senate rejected, by a 50-49 vote, an alternative proposal championed by California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which would have punished violence against pregnant women without treating an unborn child as a separate person.

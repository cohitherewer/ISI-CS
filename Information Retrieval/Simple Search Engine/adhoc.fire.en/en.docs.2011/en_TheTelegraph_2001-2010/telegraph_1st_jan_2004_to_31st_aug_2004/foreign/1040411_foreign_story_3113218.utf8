				 	 A protester shows a newspaper which carries pictures of the hostages in Tokyo. (AFP)																								Dubai, April 10 (Reuters): An Iraqi group which said it kidnapped three Japanese hostages has said it will release them within 24 hours, abandoning a threat to kill them, Arabic television station al Jazeera said today. 																								They will release them in 24 hours in response to a call from the Muslim Clerics Association, al Jazeera said, referring to a body of Iraqi religious scholars. 																								An al Jazeera spokesman said the Qatar-based channel received the information in a fax from the group called Saraya al-Mujahideen, which said on Thursday in a tape that it would kill the Japanese if Japan did not withdraw troops from Iraq by a deadline tomorrow. A foreign ministry spokesman said he was unaware of the report.																								However, Iraqi kidnappers said in a tape aired on al Jazeera today said they will kill a US hostage theyre holding unless US forces lift the siege of Falluja.																								Up to now your prisoner is being dealt with in the tolerant manner specified by Islamic law. Our one request is to break the siege of the city of the mosques (Falluja) during the 12 hours from six clock this evening, a voice on a tape said. 																								Japanese foreign minister Yoriko Kawaguchi appealed in a video message today for the release of the Japanese hostages in Iraq as protesters called for Tokyo to withdraw its troops to save the captives lives.																								Japan was stunned on Thursday when the unknown group released a video showing the hostages, blindfolded and with a gun to their heads.																								Earlier today, a group calling itself the Brigades of the Hero Martyr Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said they were holding 30 foreign hostages and threatened to decapitate them unless US forces lifted their blockade of Falluja. We have Japanese, Bulgarian, Israeli, American, Spanish and Korean hostages, a masked gunman said.

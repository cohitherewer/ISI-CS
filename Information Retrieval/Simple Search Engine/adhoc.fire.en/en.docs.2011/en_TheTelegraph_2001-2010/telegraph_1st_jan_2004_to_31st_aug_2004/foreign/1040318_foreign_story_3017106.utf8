 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Madrid decree blots UN record
 K.P. NAYAR				 	 Prime Minister-elect Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in Madrid. (AFP)																								New York, March 17: The UN Security Council, which stood up to the Americans on the issue of invading Iraq, has blotted its copybook following the terrorist bombings in Madrid.																								In an action without precedent, the 15-member council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the Basque separatist group, ETA, within hours of the bombings although council members had no independent confirmation that ETA was responsible for the outrage.																								Yesterday, the UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: I think there is a lesson here for everybody, including the council members.																								Annan made the remark after Spain, an elected member of the council, informed its other 14 members that the government in Madrid was mistaken about the identity of the perpetrators of the train bombings.																								A letter written by Spains permanent representative to the UN to the councils president said their government was under the firm conviction on the day of the terrorist attacks that ETA was responsible, based on available information and expert analysis. However, since then, investigations pointed to citizens from other countries.																								Diplomats at the UN said Russia was the only country to actively oppose naming ETA in the resolution during behind-the-scenes discussions before its adoption by the council.																								In one his last acts as Russias permanent representative to the UN, Sergey Lavrov, the new Russian foreign minister, pointed out to his fellow ambassadors here that there is no precedent in Security Council resolutions of naming organisations responsible for acts such as the Madrid bombings  especially when investigations were only beginning.																								On September 12, 2001, the council adopted a resolution on the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Centre in New York, but it did not even name al Qaida. But Russia decided against vetoing last weeks resolution because all the other 14 council members were willing to go along with the Spanish view.																								Annan acknowledged on record yesterday that the council members themselves have felt very uneasy about that.																								But it has come to light since then than Spanish foreign minister Ana Palacio cynically manipulated council members and other countries in her partys effort to use the Madrid tragedy for electoral gain for her party in Sundays polls in Spain. The effort boomeranged with the Spanish electorate.																								Even as the injured were transported from bombed out trains to hospitals, Palacio telephoned British foreign secretary Jack Straw to blame the ETA. Straw went on television, but hedged his statement by saying: It looks to be an ETA terrorist outrage, and that is the information we have received from Madrid.																								According to a secret cable sent out by the foreign ministry in Madrid to Spanish embassies around the world, a copy of which has been published by the newspaper El Pais, ambassadors and other diplomats were told that they should use any opportunity to confirm ETAs responsibility for these brutal attacks.																								Several Spanish newspapers have revealed that the outgoing Prime Minister and staunch US ally on Iraq, Jose Maria Aznar, personally rang up editors more than once urging them to pin the blame for the bombs on the Basque separatists.																								Meanwhile, the Americans were working closely with Spanish diplomats at the UN to push the Security Council resolution in words which suited Madrid. 																								Americas permanent representative to the UN, John Negroponte told reporters that the Bush administration was satisfied with the Aznar governments explanation.																								It is the judgment that these attacks were carried out by the ETA and we have no information to the contrary. The resolution, adopted unanimously, condemns in the strongest terms the bomb attacks in Madrid, Spain, perpetrated by the terrorist group ETA on 11 March 2004.																								In Annans attempt yesterday to salvage the prestige of the UN, he unusually commented on elections in Spain. The events in Spain need to be looked at very critically, he said.

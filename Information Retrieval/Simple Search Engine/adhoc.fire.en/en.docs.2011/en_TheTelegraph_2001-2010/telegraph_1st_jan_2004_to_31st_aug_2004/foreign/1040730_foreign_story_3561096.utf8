 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Moore film screened near Bush ranch
																								Crawford (Texas), July 29 (Reuters): Hundreds of people gathered in a rural parking lot near US President George W. Bushs Texas ranch today to watch Michael Moores anti-Bush documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11, although the filmmaker cancelled plans to attend.																								Sitting before a giant inflatable movie screen, filmgoers from across Texas booed and cheered as Moores record-setting anti-war film satirically recounted Bushs controversial 2000 election and lambasted the Presidents response to the September 11, 2001, attacks and his reasons for going to war in Iraq.																								Moore had pledged to come to the screening and even invited Bush to attend. 																								But the bespectacled Leftist gadfly abruptly pulled out yesterday, telling organisers he wanted his movie, not his differences with the Republican President, to be the evenings subject.																								But were all here tonight, said John Wolf, leader of a Texas network of peace activists that organised the screening and asked for an $8 donation as admission to benefit a local activist centre called the Crawford Peace House.																								Half a kilometre away, scores of Bush supporters gathered for a rally to show their support for the President.																								 Some were business owners from the Lone Star Parkway, Crawfords main street, which features several presidential souvenir shops. Bush is vacationing this week at his 650- hectare ranch.

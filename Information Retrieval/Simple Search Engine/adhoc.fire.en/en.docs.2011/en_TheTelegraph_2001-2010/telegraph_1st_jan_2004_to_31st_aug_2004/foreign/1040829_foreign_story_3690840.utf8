 Sunday, August 29, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Unseen Simpson																																	 Edinburgh, Aug. 28 (Reuters): She walks the streets unrecognised despite providing the voice of TVs most infamous animated rapscallion, but it seems a little bit of Bart Simpson has seeped into Nancy Cartwright.																																	I have the best burp on demand, the actor told an audience at Edinburghs Fringe Festival, where she is performing her one woman show My Life As a 10-year-old Boy. She proved it with a resounding belch.																																	Cartwright has been the voice of Bart for more than 330 episodes of The Simpsons. To the public she seems to be an average Homer or Marge  and thats how she wants it.																																	I love being a celebrity where nobody knows my face, she said.Cartwright also does the voices for Simpsons mainstays Nelson Smell ya later Muntz and Ralph My cats breath smells like cat food Wiggum, along with Rod and Todd Flanders For the infant member of the Simpson clan, Maggie, she provides the goo-goos and ga-gas.																																	The one-woman show, which recounts her childhood in Dayton, Ohio and rise to vocal stardom, has not been well-received in Edinburgh, despite the perverse thrill of hearing Bart swear and the live recitation of classic Simpsons lines like Ralph Wiggums Me fail English? Thats unpossible! 																													 																Phone prod London (Reuters): British mobile phone bosses face embarrassment after a London council dished out their phone numbers to the public on mock flyers for prostitutes services, aiming to prod them into action against rampant advertising by the sex trade. Westminster city council has stepped up its long-running campaign to rid phone booths of advertisements for call girls in its borough, which includes Soho, Londons red-light district. It handed out 20,000 cards to passers-by in central London with the names and business numbers of mobile phone company chiefs alongside pictures of scantily clad women, a councillor said.																													 																False fine																																	 London (Reuters): A British man accused by police of driving at 185 kmph in a Fiat Punto thought the accusation so ridiculous he enlisted an expert driver to help prove his new car was incapable of going that fast. Law student Steve Lucas, who risked a large fine and losing his driving licence if convicted of being so far over the limit, said his small Fiat hatchback was just too slow to have reached such a speed, British newspapers reported on Saturday. I was happy to put my hands up and admit that I was driving at 85 mph but the idea that my little Fiat Punto 1.2 litre could manage 115 mph was laughable, he said. 																													 																Party plan London (Reuters): The capitals colourful Notting Hill Carnival, one of the worlds biggest street parties, will get groovy on its 40th birthday this Sunday with a theme of Freedom and Justice. 																						Organisers say the theme will celebrate freedom through dance, music and masquerade.

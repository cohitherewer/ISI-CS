The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 France power workers in Robin Hood campaign
																								Paris, June 17 (Reuters): French power workers who cut off the electricity at the Eiffel Tower for a few minutes overnight pursued a commando-style battle against privatisation today by restoring supplies to homes with unpaid bills.																								Electricite de France, the state-owned utility slated for partial privatisation, said it was planning legal action after workers led by the CGT trade union briefly cut power supplies to shops and homes around the famous Champs Elysee avenue.																								CGT union officials said that the protest had cut EDFs overall power output by 6,000 megawatts, or roughly 6 per cent.																								An EDF spokeswoman said the output drop was less, at around 3,300 megawatts. Thats the figure we have, she said.																								Union officials said workers were worried for their jobs and the utilitys future in a country with a strong public service tradition. 																								They said they were expanding an operation to reconnect homes cut off by EDF for failing to pay bills.																								A spokeswoman at the Eiffel Tower, one of the worlds most visited tourist attractions, said business was unaffected by the brief power cut. 																								Similar cuts hit President Jacques Chiracs Elysee Palace yesterday before back-up generators kicked in, as at the Eiffel Tower.																								The CGT handed in a petition with some 500,000 signatures calling on the government to drop its plans for EDF.																								The union has vowed to implement a Robin Hood-style campaign, reconnecting 250,000 households that have been cut off for non-payment of bills.

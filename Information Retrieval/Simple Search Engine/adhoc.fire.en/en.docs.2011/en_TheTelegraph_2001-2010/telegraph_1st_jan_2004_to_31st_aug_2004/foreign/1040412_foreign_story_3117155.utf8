The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, April 12, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Pay for peeping																																	Little Rock (Arkansas), April 11 (Reuters): An apologetic Peeping Tom in northern Arkansas left a $20 bill and a note for his victim asking if she would not mind if he peered at her outside her window, police said.																																	The note and the cash were found at an apartment complex in Mountain Home, Arkansas. Police said the writer of the letter apologized for looking into the window. 																																	They said that the letter appeared to have been written on a personal computer.																						Police would not release the note because the case is under investigation.																																	Its kind of an odd case, said Mountain Home police sergeant Nevin Barnes.																													 																False alarm  Duesseldorf (Reuters): A Croatian woman was convicted of disturbing the peace for phoning a bomb threat to Duesseldorf airport to get out of a vacation with her boyfriend. The woman was given a suspended sentence after admitting in court that she called authorities and, in a hoax, made an al Qaida bomb threat because her parents disapproved of her boyfriend. I didnt know how I would be able to tell my parents about a holiday with him and I couldnt really say to him Listen, my parents wouldnt approve, the woman, 28, identified only as Marina B., told the Duesseldorf state court. Then I had the idea that if the trip could somehow be blocked by someone else, for example a bomb threat, then that would solve all the problems, she added. Her flight departed anyway, several hours late. The threat prompted authorities to shut down Germanys third busiest airport on a busy Sunday in September, stranding 64,000 people for hours, while police searched in vain for a bomb.																													 																Terror film																																	San Francisco (Reuters): The bestseller at the centre of a national debate on Americas security, Against All Enemies: Inside Americas War on Terror, may soon be hitting the silver screen. Sony Pictures has optioned the film rights to former counterterrorism official Richard Clarkes book, which questions the countrys readiness to address potential terrorist threats before the September 11, 2001, attacks. The project will be produced by John Calley, a veteran Hollywood executive who stepped down as the studios chief executive and chairman last year.

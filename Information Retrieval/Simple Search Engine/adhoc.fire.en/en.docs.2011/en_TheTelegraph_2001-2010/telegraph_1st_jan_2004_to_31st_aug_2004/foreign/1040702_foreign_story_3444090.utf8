(From top) Pervez Musharraf, Manmohan Singh and Shaukat Aziz 																								Islamabad, July 1 (PTI): Drawing a parallel with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf defended his choice of banker-turned-finance minister Shaukat Aziz as the countrys next premier. 																								When it is done in the neighbouring countries we talk big saying that it is good. It (India) is the biggest democracy in the world. Manmohan Singh is a member of the Rajya Sabha. He is also an economist and was the finance minister, Musharraf told reporters during an interaction last night. 																								He said Aziz too is a member of the Senate, the upper House, and has worked as the finance minister of the country since 1999. 																								Aziz is expected to replace caretaker Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein after two months following his election to the National Assembly as per the constitutional requirement. 																								If somebody is a member of senate and finance minister, what is the problem. They give an example saying that they have done in India and we have also done it... Then what is the problem. Ours is also a good democracy, Musharraf said.																								The Pakistan President added thatthere was no contradiction in Azizs nomination as he was a successful technocrat and a finance minister. 																								When asked whether the appointment of Aziz, a former vice -president of Citibank, New York, would lead to a roll back in Islamabads nuclear and missile programme, Musharraf said Pakistan would conduct a great missile test within two months. 																								Only a mad person could talk about roll back of nuclear or missile programme, he said angrily.

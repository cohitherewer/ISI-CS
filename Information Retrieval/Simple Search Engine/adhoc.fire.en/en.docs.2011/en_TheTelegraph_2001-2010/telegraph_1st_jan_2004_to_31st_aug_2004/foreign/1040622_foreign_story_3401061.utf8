 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Traders desperate cry shocks parents, Koreans
Seoul, June 21 (Reuters): Kim Sun-il recently told his mother not to worry about his safety. Now, militants in Iraq have threatened to behead the South Korean businessman.																								Today, his rasping, desperate cry of I dont want to die was being broadcast repeatedly on South Korean television stations, sending a chill through many people who already had reservations about the governments plan to send troops to Iraq. He should be released through negotiation. He should be saved, Kims father, Kim Jong-kyu, said through sobs on South Koreas YTN television. My life is over without him.																								The militants, in their demand shown on Arabic television station al Jazeera, said they wanted Seoul to reverse its troop decision within 24 hours from last night. The government said it would go ahead.																								The seventh of eight children, Kim had been working in Iraq as an interpreter for the past year, Yonhap news agency said. As a Christian, he mixed that work with evangelising, it said.																								Dont worry about me, mum. I feel comfortable, Kim told his mother when she asked about the danger he faced in Iraq during their last telephone conversation in April.																								Kim was born in September 1970 and graduated with a degree in Arabic from South Koreas top language school, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, in February 2003.																								Kim first studied English at a college that is now Youngsan University, graduating with a diploma in 1992, officials say. He then majored in theology at Kyungsung University, again in his hometown of Pusan, earning a degree in February 1994.																								He is introverted, kindhearted and studies hard, his mother said on YTN.																								Kim was planning to return to the southern port city in July to celebrate his fathers 70th birthday.																								He entered Iraq on June 15, 2003, said the South Korean foreign ministry, which has set up a task force and sent a delegation to the region to seek his release.																								Kim works for Gana General Trading, a firm with 12 employees in Iraq to supply goods to the US military commissary.																								He was kidnapped in Falluja on June 17 and his companys president initially sought to negotiate his release without involving the South Korean government, the ministry said.																								This is horrible, said Choi Myung-rye, 25-year-old woman office worker in Seoul. Although I was familiar with what has happened to hostages in Iraq, I never expected this would happen to us. Kims kidnapping is not the first involving South Koreans.																								Seven South Koreans, all evangelical church pastors, were seized by armed men in April but later freed unharmed.																								South Korea plans to send the 3,000 troops to Arbil in the northern Kurdish region of Iraq. The military say about half are combat troops trained to protect the rest as they help rebuild Iraq, distribute aid and train security forces.																								Some 670 South Korean military medics and engineers in southern Iraq since May last year will move to Arbil to join the main force. Seoul sees the deployment as a difficult but vital gesture to the US, an ally with 37,500 troops in the South to deter North Korea.

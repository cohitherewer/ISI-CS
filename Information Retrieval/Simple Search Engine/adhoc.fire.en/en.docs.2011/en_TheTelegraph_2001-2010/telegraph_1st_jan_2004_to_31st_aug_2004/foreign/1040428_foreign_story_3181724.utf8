 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 EU embraces Gaddafi
				 	 Muammar Gaddafi in Brussels. (AFP)																								Brussels, April 27 (Reuters): Cheered on by African drummers and dancing supporters, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi took another big step towards international respectability today when he visited European Union headquarters.																								European Commission President Romano Prodi broke with protocol to welcome Gaddafi personally at Brussels Zaventem airport, where the Libyan leader, dressed in a red fez hat and grey-green sweeping robe, descended the gangway followed by female guards in dappled blue camouflage uniforms.																								Waving portraits of Gaddafi, more than 200 singing, dancing supporters organised by an obscure Arab-African Immigrant Child Support Committee, staged a colourful pro-Libyan demonstration outside the European Commission building as the two leaders arrived in a white stretch Mercedes limousine.																								One over-enthusiastic Gaddafi supporter, dressed as a security man, caused a scare when he tried to present a letter as the Libyan leader and Prodi shook hands for the cameras inside the building. Belgian security guards hustled him away. A smaller group of about 50 Libyan exiles staged a human rights protest outside EU headquarters, chanting: Gaddafi terrorist and holding a banner proclaiming: Gaddafi is a wolf in sheeps clothing. 																								The landmark trip  Gaddafis first to Europe for 15 years  was a reward for Libyas agreement to pay compensation for the Lockerbie and UTA airline bombings and its spectacular renunciation of weapons of mass destruction.																								The Libyan leader was expected to submit an application to join the EUs Euro-Mediterranean partnership, a trade, aid and culture pact linking the wealthy European bloc with 11 southern and eastern Mediterranean neighbours, including Israel.																								Gaddafi was to hold talks and have lunch with Prodi and several members of the EU executive in a ground-breaking visit that follows his rapprochement with the US and Britain after more than a decade of international isolation.																								He and Prodi were to make statements to the press but not take questions, a Commission spokesperson said. Gaddafi will stay the night in a black Bedouin tent, complete with satellite dish, pitched in the grounds of a Belgian state residence. His turbulent arrival at EU headquarters, replete with flashes of the old militant waving a defiant fist to cheering supporters in the street, illustrated the ambivalent political theatre surrounding the event.

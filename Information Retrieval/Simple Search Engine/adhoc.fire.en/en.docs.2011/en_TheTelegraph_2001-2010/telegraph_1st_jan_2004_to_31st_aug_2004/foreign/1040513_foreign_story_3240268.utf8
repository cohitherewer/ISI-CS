 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 7 policemen die in Maoist raid
																								Kathmandu, May 12 (Reuters): Maoist rebels ambushed a security patrol in a remote forest in Nepal today killing seven policemen, as an anti-monarchy strike brought life to a halt across the Himalayan kingdom for a second straight day.																								An army official said about 200 Maoists attacked the patrol, triggering a gunbattle, in Dhading, some 80 km west of Kathmandu. At least 11 rebels were also killed.																								The new violence  the deadliest in more than a month  came as five leading political parties continued protests to press King Gyanendra to restore democracy and resolve a prolonged political crisis.																								Five key political parties had called the 48-hour strike yesterday after the monarch ignored weeks of sustained, often violent, street protests and calls for a multi-party government.																								The parties have been up in arms since King Gyanendra sacked an elected government in 2002 and replaced it with a loyalist cabinet because of a bloody Maoist rebellion. Streets in the temple-studded capital were deserted as taxis, public and private vehicles stayed off the roads, businesses downed shutters and schools stayed closed.

																								Colombo, Aug. 16 (Reuters): A Tamil politician opposed to Sri Lankas Tiger rebels was shot dead today in the latest in a string of political killings, as European peace brokers tried to break an impasse in efforts to end two decades of civil war. 																								Bala Nadarajah Iyer, a senior member of the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party and a political ally of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, was gunned down outside his home in southern Colombo, police said. A motorcyclist laid an ambush close by and opened fire as he came out of his house, the police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, June 05, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Nicole padding																																	 New York, June 4 (Reuters): Rail-thin Nicole Kidman will need a little help making the transformation to a buxom Swedish secretary for her next role with Matthew Broderick, in the film version of Mel Brooks stage hit The Producers.																																	Mel says well pad her, said Broderick. I think we should pad her, I guess. Broderick also stars with Kidman in the updated, dark-comedy version of Stepford Wives.																																	Kidmans slim, fashion-model frame is shown to advantage in her Stepford Wives role as Brodericks wife. For The Producers, she will play statuesque Swedish secretary Ulla, who inspired numerous jokes in the Brooks farce. Kidman said Broderick helped bring her into the project during their work together on the Stepford movie.

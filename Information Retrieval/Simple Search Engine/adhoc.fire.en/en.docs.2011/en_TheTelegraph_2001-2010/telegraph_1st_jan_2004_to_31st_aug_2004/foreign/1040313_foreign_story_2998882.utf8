 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 US expose tax
Washington, March 12 (PTI): Amid a public outcry over Janet Jacksons indecent exposure, the US House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved sharply higher fines for broadcasters and entertainers who break decency rules.																								The Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004, approved by 391 votes to 22, would give the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the authority to impose fines of up to half a million dollars per violation, up from the current $ 27,500. 																								With many shows syndicated and played on numerous stations around the country, fines could run for a single indecent show to the millions of dollars. Broadcasters could, under the bill, have their licences revoked after a third violation. The action is a response to the public outcry over Janets exposure during a nationally and internationally televised show at the football Super Bowl last month. 																								Last year, Bono, a singer, used an expletive during the Golden Globe awards show. The FCC ruled that the utterance did not violate its indecency standards but it is now reviewing that decision. 																								Faced with the prospect of heavy fines for airing smut or indecent shows, US broadcasters are expected to resort to the method of a five-second delay on programmes which they think might get them into trouble. ABC-TV is resorting to this method when Janet Jackson appears on one of its Good Morning America programmes later this month. 																								The five-second delay in will enable alert editors to prevent the airing of dirty words or explicit pictures.

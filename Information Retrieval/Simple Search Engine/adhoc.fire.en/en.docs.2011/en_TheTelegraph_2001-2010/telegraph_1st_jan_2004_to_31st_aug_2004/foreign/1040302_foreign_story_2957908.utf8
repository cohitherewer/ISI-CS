 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Tories end war probe support
				 	 Tony Blair																								London, March 1 (Reuters): Tony Blairs hopes of putting questions over Iraq behind him suffered a fresh setback today when Britains main Opposition party withdrew support for a probe into the intelligence that sent the country to war.																								Without support from the Opposition Conservative Party, the inquiry  set up last month to look into the quality of British intelligence on banned Iraqi weapons  will give Blair little ammunition to silence his critics. 																								A furious foreign secretary Jack Straw called the move shameless opportunism and said Conservative Party leader Michael Howard had abandoned all principle.																								For the Prime Minister, anxious to shift political debate back onto the domestic agenda that wins and loses elections, Iraq is the problem that appears never to go away.																								Blairs troubles worsened last week when prosecutors dropped a case against a spy services translator who leaked documents to try to stop the war, and when one of Blairs former cabinet members said Britain spied on UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.																								Today Blair rejected calls to publish the governments secret pre-war advice on whether the war was legal. Translator Katharine Gun, who admitted leaking documents, had said she planned to argue she was justified in breaking the law to prevent an illegal war, and would have demanded the government reveal its secret advice if her case went ahead.																								Prosecutors dropped the case, saying they did not have enough evidence although she admitted breaking the law. Critics said the authorities feared putting the case before a jury.																								The probe into intelligence about Iraq, led by former top civil servant Lord Butler, was seen as a late effort by Blair to clear the air over Iraq. The Conservatives, who supported the war, had agreed to play a part in the probe, although the other opposition party, the Liberal Democrats, opposed it.																								But Conservative leader Howard said in a letter to Blair he had decided to withdraw his backing for the probe because Butler had announced he would look only at structures, systems and processes and not at the actions of individuals.																								There is no basis in the terms of reference for that and I consider it a quite unjustifiable restriction of the committees approach, Howard wrote.																								Blairs officials were livid.																								Mr Howard called for an independent inquiry into intelligence. He got it, Straw said. Now, within two weeks, Mr Howard seeks to jump on a passing bandwagon and flirt with those opposed to the war in an attempt to win cheap political points, he said.

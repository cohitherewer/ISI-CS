 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Pak rules out handover of radical to US
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Islamabad, July 30: Pakistan today ruled out the possibility of handing over top al Qaida terrorist Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani to the US until the interrogation process is complete. 																								Arrested by Pakistani security forces on Sunday from Gujarat, 120 km east of Islamabad, with several accomplices including his Uzbek wife and two South Africans, Ghailani was on the FBIs list of 22 most-wanted terrorists with a bounty of $5 million. 																								Investigators are scouring a computer and several disks seized when they captured Ghailani and 13 others after a 14-hour gunbattle with security forces last weekend in Gujarat.																								Pakistans interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat said he was sure the African would prove a rich source of information on the al Qaida network. Ghailani, 30, a Tanzanian national who is wanted in the US for the August 1998 bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, is being questioned at an undisclosed location in Pakistan.

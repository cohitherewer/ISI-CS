 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Dublin wakes up to 100 years of Bloomsday
				 	 James Joyces three great grandnieces (from left) Chris, Nicole and Sabrina in Dublin. (AP)Dublin, June 16 (Reuters): Ireland staged its biggest-ever literary carnival today, drawing thousands on to Dublins streets for the centenary of Bloomsday  the day set in fictional stone by James Joyce in his epic novel Ulysses.																								Joyceans ate Gorgonzola sandwiches and sipped Burgundy wine in the sunshine in honour of the lunch enjoyed by the novels hero Leopold Bloom, midway through his momentous day.																								Devotees of the book, regarded by many as the greatest novel in the English language, started their day with pints of Guinness and hearty breakfasts in honour of the pork kidney, fried in sizzling butter sauce which Bloom eats for breakfast.																								Outside the James Joyce centre in the shabby Georgian splendour of north Dublin, crowds quaffed the foaming ebon ale as actors playing out scenes from the book.																								Men in boater hats and ladies in Edwardian dress complete with twirling parasols mingled with construction workers, tourists and people on stilts. Around 300 cyclists, many of them in old-fashioned costumes and perched on ramshackle bikes, cycled the route walked by Joyces fictional characters.																								Joyce set Ulysses on June 16, 1904  the day of his first date with the woman who later became his wife. 																								For those familiar with the book this is the ultimate pilgrimage, said Claire Sweeney, director of the centre. If youll forgive the irreverence, this is the Mecca for Joyceans, the culmination of all their dreams.																								What the hell are we doing, closing the citys streets to celebrate a fictitious day? Its a daft notion but it works. Its a great way of introducing people to Joyces work.																								On the coast outside the city, hundreds congregated at the stone watchtower where the book opens. There, with Joyces snotgreen...scrotumtightening sea spread before them, they listened to actors read from Ulysses. Were thrilled. Today is fantastic  the scenery, the weather, just look around you, said tourist Doug Guarnieri from California, gesturing at the sparkling sweep of Dublin Bay.																								The party is not confined to Ireland. Organisers say some 40 countries, from South Korea to Norway, are marking Bloomsday. In Germany, a Leftwing daily newspaper known for its humour banished conventional news from its pages entirely, turning the whole paper into a reworked version of the novel. In Hungary, the town of Szombathely was due to erect a statue of Joyce in honour of Blooms fictional parentage. Blooms father comes from the town.																								The irony of all this literary activity is that Ulysses is a book in which nothing much happens. Bloom treads the streets trying to forget his adulterous wife Molly and her lover Blazes Boylan, while Stephen Dedalus, the novels other main character, thinks a lot and gets drunk. But it is Joyces audaciously experimental prose and his vast, sympathetic portrayal of humankind going about its daily business which make Ulysses one of the worlds great books.

 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Buoyed Kerry blasts Bush shift
																								Richmond (Virginia), Feb. 9 (Reuters): Frontrunner John Kerry, buoyed by the endorsement of Virginias governor as Democratic presidential nominee, accused President George W. Bush yesterday of trying to revise his Iraq war rationale after the fact.																								At a news conference, Kerry challenged Bushs assertion during a televised morning talk show that the US went to war with Saddam Hussein because it knew he had the ability to make weapons of mass destruction.																								This is a far cry from what the President and his administration told the American people till 2002, Kerry said. Back then President Bush repeatedly told the American people that Saddam Hussein has got chemical weapons.																								They told us they could deploy these weapons within 45 minutes to injure our troops, the four-term senator from Massachusetts added. It was on that basis that he sent Americans sons and daughters off to war. No chemical or biological weapons have been found in Iraq since the invasion last March. US weapons hunter David Kay said last month we were almost all wrong to accuse Saddam of having stockpiles of these weapons.																								Kerry defended his own vote in Congress on the war. He said had voted in favour of a process that called for the President to build a global coalition, use the UN weapons inspection process and go to war as a matter of last resort.

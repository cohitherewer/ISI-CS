The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Nigeria adds fuel to Pak nuke fire
				 	 Shia mourners move a body for funeral in Quetta. (Reuters)																								Islamabad, March 4 (PTI): Islamabad to day rejected a Nigerian defence ministry claim that a top Pakistani general had offered to strengthen its military capability and acquire nuclear capability.																								This is such unadulterated rubbish. For a Pakistani general who is travelling these days to offer nuclear help, Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said while addressing a joint press conference with visiting British foreign secretary Jack Straw here.																								However, the Nigerian defence ministry later said that a typographical error was responsible for false reports that Pakistan would help Nigeria obtain nuclear power.																								Kasuri was reacting to a Nigerian defence ministry statement claiming that Pakistans chairman of the joint services committee, General Muhammad Aziz Khan, who visited Nigeria this week, had said that Pakistan is working out the dynamics of how they can assist Nigerias armed forces to strengthen its military capability and to acquire nuclear power.																								This tells you sometimes how the media picks up stories. Why would Pakistan do this, Kasuri said, adding if Pakistan wants Abujas help to regain the commonwealth membership, there were other ways to go about it. Surely there are other ways. We do not have to have seek support of this nature. 																								Pakistan is currently lobbying hard to be readmitted into the commonwealth. Kasuri said it was not in the interests of Pakistan to offer nuclear technology, that too when it faced so many problems on the nuclear front. 																								We are absolutely shocked that some wire services carried this story. After all the stories regarding nuclear proliferation, how can a Pakistani general be offering this to Nigeria yesterday. I cannot understand, Kasuri said. Straw, who was sitting by his side, jokingly said that nuclear technology did not appear to be on the priority list of Nigeria when he was there recently.																								When I was in Nigeria during Christmas, it did not seem to be on top of their agenda. They have lot of oil reserves, though, he said in a lighter vein. 																								General Aziz is third in the Pakistan army hierarchy after President Pervez Musharraf, who is the army chief and General Younus Khan.																								The Nigerian defence ministry statement comes at a time when Pakistan is trying to wriggle out of the international spotlight on its nuclear programme after the recent admission by Abdul Qadeer Khan that he transferred nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.

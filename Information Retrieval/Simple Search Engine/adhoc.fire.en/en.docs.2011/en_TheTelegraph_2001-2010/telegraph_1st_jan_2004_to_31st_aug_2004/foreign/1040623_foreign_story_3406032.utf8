 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Life for child ravager
																								Arlon (Belgium), June 22 (Reuters): Marc Dutroux, Belgiums most reviled man, was sentenced to life in prison today for kidnapping, raping and killing girls in a series of crimes that stunned the country nearly eight years ago.																								After more than an hour of deliberation, the court also sentenced co-defendant Michelle Martin, Dutrouxs ex-wife, to 30 years in prison; heroin addict Michel Lelievre to 25 years, and businessman Michel Nihoul to five years.																								Marc Dutroux, you have been condemned to the maximum sentence, Judge Stephane Goux told the countrys most hated criminal after reading out the sentences in this eastern Belgian town. I believe that you still come out of it better than most of the victims who are no longer among the living.																								Last week, Dutroux, 47, was found guilty of kidnapping and raping six girls, killing two of them and causing the death of two others. Martin and Lelievre were found guilty of playing a role in the girls kidnapping and deaths. Although Nihoul was acquitted of conspiracy and kidnapping, he was found guilty of drug trafficking and other crimes.																								The sentencing brings to a close a case that has haunted Belgians since Dutrouxs arrest in 1996.																								Many came to believe that he worked for a mysterious paedophile ring whose members included police, politicians and other influential members of society. Dutroux had been on parole for previous rapes when he kidnapped the six girls, aged between eight and 19 years.																								Police later bungled the search for the victims, some of whom had been missing for more than a year.																								Dutroux admitted kidnapping and raping some girls but denied killing any of them, blaming other defendants for their deaths.

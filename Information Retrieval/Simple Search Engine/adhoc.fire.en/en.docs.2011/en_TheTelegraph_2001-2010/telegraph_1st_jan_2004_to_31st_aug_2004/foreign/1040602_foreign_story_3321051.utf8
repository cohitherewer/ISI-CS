 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Afghan peek into treasure 
																								Kabul, June 1 (Reuters): The world could soon catch a glimpse of Afghanistans fabled Bactrian gold, as preparations get under way to exhibit some of the 20,000 or so pieces that make up the countrys most important ancient treasure trove.																								Dates and locations have yet to be finalised but the US, France, Germany, Japan and Greece, are among countries interested in hosting the 2,000-year-old haul that has miraculously remained intact despite years of war and upheaval.																								While other important archaeological sites are plundered or have been ruined by war, the Bactrian gold discovered by a Soviet team just before the Red Army invasion of 1979 has had a number of narrow escapes, adding to its allure and mystery.																								When the process of inventory is done, we will decide, said culture and information minister Sayed Makhdoom Raheen.																								We will sit down with the Americans, the Germans, French and Japanese and make a joint decision on arranging a tour, he said. The favourites to host the collection first are the Americans and French, and Raheen hopes interest in the treasure found near the northern town of Shiberghan will generate funds to build museums and combat looting.																								This ministry is in need of much, he said, rubbing weary eyes. I want to spend the money on new museums. We used to have museums in the provinces, and now we have none.																								Plans are underway to build a museum in Bamiyan, home to giant Buddhas cut into cliffs which were blown up by the Taliban in 2001. It was an act of destruction that shocked the world and exposed the hardline Islamic militias intolerance.																								A new museum may also be built in Kabul, where the Bactrian gold will eventually be kept.Raheen is aware that a series of exhibitions could be vital to supporting his ministry. An Afghan official who viewed the Bactrian gold recently in an underground vault in the heavily guarded presidential palace in Kabul described the pieces he saw, including an intricately designed belt and a gold broach, as priceless. 																								Retreating Soviet forces left behind the Bactrian treasure. So did the Taliban despite desperate efforts to access the vault as US bombers pounded Kabul on the eve of the regimes demise in November, 2001.																								Many assumed the gold had disappeared forever, but it was discovered intact after the vault was finally opened in August for the first time in 14 years. Raheen said there were 20,600 gold pieces in the collection. The trove was from a nomad burial site in what was once Bactria, lying between the Hindu Kush and the Amu Darya river

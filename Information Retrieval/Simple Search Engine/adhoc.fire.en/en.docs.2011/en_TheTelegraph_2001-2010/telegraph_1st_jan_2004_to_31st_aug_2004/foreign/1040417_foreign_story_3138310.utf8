The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Thorn in ANC crown
																								Johannesburg, April 16 (Reuters): The African National Congress (ANC) celebrated a huge victory today in South Africas elections, but failed to win outright control of KwaZulu-Natal province, one of the polls biggest prizes.																								Nationally the former liberation movement was assured a coveted two-thirds majority in parliament, taking 69 per cent of Wednesdays vote with almost all ballots counted  its biggest win since the fall of apartheid 10 years ago.																								The resounding vote endorsed President Thabo Mbekis pledge to extend economic power to the Black majority in Africas richest country, which 10 years after the end of White rule remains plagued by poverty, unemployment, AIDS and crime. We must celebrate our victory with all due humility. We must not allow the decisive mandate we have received from the people to encourage an attitude of arrogance, Mbeki said.

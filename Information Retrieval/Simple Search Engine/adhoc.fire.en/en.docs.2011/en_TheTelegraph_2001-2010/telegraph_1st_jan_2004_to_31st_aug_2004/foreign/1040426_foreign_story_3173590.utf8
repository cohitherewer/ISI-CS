The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Garner hopes to quell Fire
Jennifer Garner (top) and Denzel Washington 																								Los Angeles, April 25 (Reuters): After years of kicking guys butts on the television show Alias, Jennifer Garner takes on romance film 13 Going on 30, but make no mistake she is still looking to beat up on Denzel Washington and his drama Man on Fire in this weekends box office race.																								Garner, who plays spy Sydney Bristow on action drama Alias, has a large fan base among young women, which should well serve the PG-13-rated film and its distributors at Sony Pictures, as the movie opens in more than 3,400 theaters.																								Oscar winner Washingtons Man on Fire debuts in about 400 fewer theaters, and the R-rated movie will likely face stiff competition from last weekends box office champ, Kill Bill-Vol. 2.																								Both Garner and Washington are winning favorable reviews.																								The Los Angeles Times calls 13 Going on 30 an ingratiating comedy. Geeky, gawky 13 year-old Jenna Rink dreams of being 30, flirty and thriving like the women in her favorite fashion magazine, Poise. One day, after a cruel trick is played on her by the popular girls at school, Jenna gets her wish.																								She wakes up as the 30 year-old version of herself (played by Garner), but she learns that she has become just as mean and spiteful as the girls who tricked her. Jenna finds an old friend Matt Flamhaff (Mark Ruffalo), but before the sparks of their childhood affection can grow into flames of adult love, she must reclaim the sweet, innocent Jenna who was left behind 17 years ago.																								Budgeted at a modest $37 million, according to director Gary Winick the movie should have an easy time making its money back given Garners starpower and the lack of films in theatres aimed at young women. 																								Washington has long been one of Hollywoods leading actors and a top draw at box offices. He won his best actor Oscar portraying a bad cop for 2001s Training Day, and while not a bad guy in Man on Fire, he is, nevertheless, working with a gun in his hand.																								Washington portrays a hardened, ex-spy for the CIA, John Creasy, who is recruited to be a bodyguard for a nine-year-old girl in Mexico City named Pita Ramos (Dakota Fanning).																								Ramos has just begun to soften the ex-agents tough psyche when she is kidnapped by a gang. Despite being wounded badly, Creasy sets out to kill every one of her kidnappers in his quest to win the return of the young girl.

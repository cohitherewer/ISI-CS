(Reuters)																								New York, Jan. 1 (Reuters): The US began 2004 tranquilly, calmly accepting extremely tight security to thwart any terror attack on celebrations from New York to Las Vegas.																								The last big event of the US new year celebrations  the Rose Parade and football game in Pasadena, California  was protected by video surveillance cameras and two electronic sensors to detect biological agents in the Rose Bowl stadium, said Pasadena police department spokeswoman Janet Pope.																								In addition, every person entering the Rose Bowl and grandstand seating for the parade was to be searched and no large bags or coolers were permitted inside.																								Hundreds of thousands of people had been expected to pack the streets before the Rose Bowl game between the University of Michigan and the University of Southern California. More than a thousand police and federal officers, including many in plain clothes, were deployed to protect the event, said Pope.																								In New York, a crowd of about 750,000 turned out to watch the traditional ball drop at midnight in midtown Manhattan even though the US had raised its terror alert to the second highest level of orange, saying al Qaida could be planning an attack bigger than September 11, 2001. The US blames Osama bin Ladens al Qaida for the deaths of nearly 3,000 people in the September 11, 2001, attacks.																								New Yorks police department said there were no arrests made at the Times Square new years eve celebration and no injuries reported. Nobody was afraid, mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference today morning. They came out last night, maybe in record numbers. Everybody got along, everybody behaved. There were virtually no incidents.																								Security at Times Square included thousands of uniformed and undercover police. Snipers prowled rooftops. City landmarks, hotels, ferries, bridges and tunnels were also under watch.																								I was a little scared, but the security here is good, said New York reveller Patrycja Galanty, 18, of Brooklyn, wearing one of thousands of tall orange hats handed out in seeming defiance of the alert. I trust New York.																								Warplanes patrolled skies above New York and Las Vegas and flight restrictions were in place for Chicago and Washington.																								Nevada governor Kenny Guinn said yesterday the unprecedented security stemmed from concerns that six or seven US cities could be targeted for attack. America has certainly changed and the world has changed and we have to change with that, Guinn told CNN. More than 1,000 police and corrections officers lined the Strip.																								Meanwhile, a new years eve bomb attack on a Baghdad restaurant killed up to eight people and wounded more than 30, US military investigators in Iraq said today. The car bomb devastated the upmarket Nabil restaurant around two-and-a-half hours before midnight, scattering debris and wrecked cars across the street outside and sparking a blaze.

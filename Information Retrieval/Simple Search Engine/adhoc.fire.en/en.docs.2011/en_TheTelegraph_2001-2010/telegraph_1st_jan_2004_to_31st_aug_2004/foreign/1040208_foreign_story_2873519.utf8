 Sunday, February 08, 2004 				 Pak not to share nuke documents
																								Islamabad, Feb. 7 (PTI): Pakistan today said it would voluntarily cooperate with the investigations into nuclear proliferation but opposed demands for outside inspections and sharing documents.																								As far as Pakistan is concerned, we are cooperating and we shall cooperate voluntarily to ensure and assure everyone about the facts. Pakistan has no reason to hide the facts, the countrys permanent representative to the UN Munir Akram said in an interview to the BBC. He said Pakistan is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and, therefore, would not permit outside inspections. 																								There was no question of allowing anyone to inspect or hand over documents regarding investigations on nuclear proliferation, he said. We have to safeguard our nuclear and strategic assets which are not open to inspection.

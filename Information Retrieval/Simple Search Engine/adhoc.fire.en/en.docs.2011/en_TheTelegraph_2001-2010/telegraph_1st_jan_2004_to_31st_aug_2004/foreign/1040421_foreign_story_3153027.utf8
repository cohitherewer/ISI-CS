 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 US hikes immigrant service fees
Houston, April 20 (PTI): US immigrants will have to pay more while applying for citizenship, legal residency and other immigration services after April 30 to help fund the increased security measures in post 9/11 America.																								The fee increases will be used to help reduce the backlog of applications and help pay for increased security measures implemented after the September 11 terrorist attacks, officials of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (UCIS) said.																								Immigrants will now be required to pay $320 to apply for citizenship  instead of $260, which is a $60 increase. Residency or Green Card application fees will rise to $315. Work permits will cost $175. Overall fee increase averages about $55. 																								For example, if an immigrant loses his or her Permanent Resident Card, it now costs $130 to replace it. But after April 30, it will cost $185.																								The increase is the fifth since 1989. To apply for residency, immigrants paid $60 in 1989. Now it costs $255. After April 30, it will cost $315. Since October, the agency has been losing $1 million a month.

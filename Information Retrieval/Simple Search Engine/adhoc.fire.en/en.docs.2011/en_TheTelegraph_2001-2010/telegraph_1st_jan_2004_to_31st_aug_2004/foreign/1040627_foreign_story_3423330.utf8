The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 After ending one marriage, Britney ready for another
				 	 Britney Spears: Fresh lineLos Angeles, June 26 (Reuters): Just months after annulling her quickie wedding to a childhood friend, pop idol Britney Spears is ready for another trip to the altar.																								Her personal publicist and her label, Jive Records, both confirmed yesterday that the 22-year-old singer is engaged to marry her new boyfriend, dancer Kevin Federline. No further details were immediately available.																								But Federline reportedly has been dating Spears for about two months and moved in with her after she underwent arthroscopic surgery two weeks ago to repair a knee injury she suffered while shooting a music video.																								According to media reports, Federline, 26, has a 2-year-old daughter by his ex-girlfriend, former Moesha TV actress Shar Jackson, who also is pregnant with a second child.																								Federline reportedly met Spears during her 2000 tour, when he was in the opening act, and also was a backup dancer for Spears former beau, pop star Justin Timberlake, at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards.																								Spears and Federline were first captured by photographers together in Santa Monica, California, in April and were chased by the paparazzi again during her European tour.																								Their engagement comes fewer than six months after Spears was granted an annulment in early January to dissolve her surprise two-day marriage in Las Vegas to a childhood pal, Jason Allen Alexander. Spears, whose latest album, In the Zone, was released in November, announced last week that she was cancelling her North American summer tour dates while she recovers from knee surgery.

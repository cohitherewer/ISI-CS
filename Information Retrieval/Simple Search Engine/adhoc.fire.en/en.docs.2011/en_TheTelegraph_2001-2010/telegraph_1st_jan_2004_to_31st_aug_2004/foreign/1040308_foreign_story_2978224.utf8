 DAVID BAMBER(From top ) Brosnan, Connery, Dalton and Moore 																								London, March 7: When it comes to spying for Britain, small is beautiful.																								New guidelines by MI5, the security service, state that men seeking work as field agents should not be taller than 5 feet 11 inches so that they can blend into the background more easily.																								The rules, set out in a new application form sent to would-be officers, mean that all five actors who played James Bond, including Pierce Brosnan, the films present star, would be rejected.																								A similar height limit will apply to women, who must be 5 feet 8 inches or less.																								MI5s chief, Eliza Manningham-Buller, is 5 feet 8 inches.																								The new application form says: You should be able to blend into the background. We are looking for average height, build, appearance. Applicants would ideally be no taller than 5 feet 11 inches for men and 5 feet 8 inches for women.																								This would rule out even James Bond  the prize asset of MI6, the intelligence service.																								Although 007s height is not specified, all the actors who have played him tower above 5 feet 11 inches.																								Sean Connery is 6 feet 1 inches, George Lazenby is 6 feet 2 inches and Roger Moore is 6 feet.																								Timothy Dalton is 6 feet 2 inches, while Pierce Brosnan is 6 feet.																								A Whitehall official defended the policy. They do have tall people in the building, but it would be ridiculous to send a surveillance officer into a dangerous situation who stood out like a sore thumb.																								The official added that tall, or short, people would not be banned from joining the service, but would not be able to become field agents.																								A former MI5 officer of 6 feet criticised the restriction, however.																								This is absolutely ridiculous. Im 6 feet tall, as are many men, and that would have disqualified me from work- ing there. Some of the countrys top agents have been taller, he said.																								MI5 is seeking to recruit 1,000 officers, to add to its present 2,100-strong complement, over the next five years.																								Previously, the security service did not have any formal guidelines on height or appearance.																								Internally, however, its personnel panel was advised to find people who blended in. MI6 has not yet imposed a height restriction on recruits.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

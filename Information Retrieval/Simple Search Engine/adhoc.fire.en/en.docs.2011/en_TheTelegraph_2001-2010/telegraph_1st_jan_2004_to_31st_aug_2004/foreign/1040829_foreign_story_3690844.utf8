 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Jerusalem in strong denial
				 	 Paul Wolfowitz																								Jerusalem, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Israel denied today spying on its main ally, the US, responding to suspicions a Pentagon analyst passed secret papers to the Jewish state about one of its most bitter enemies, Iran.																								US government sources said yesterday the FBI was investigating an analyst connected to defence secretary Donald Rumsfelds office on suspicion he gave classified documents to Israel via the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the powerful pro-Israel lobby in Washington.																								Israeli officials insisted Israel had not spied on the US since being caught red-handed two decades ago in an espionage scandal involving US navy analyst Jonathan Pollard, arrested in 1985 outside the Israeli embassy.																								We deny carrying out any intelligence activity. It is a strange story, said a senior Israeli government official, who declined to be identified.Israel, for many years, has not carried out intelligence activity in the US. 																								An Israeli embassy spokesman in the US capital called the allegations completely false and outrageous. AIPAC described the suspicions as baseless and false.																								A former AIPAC staff member said that as a matter of policy the organisation hired former Pentagon insiders with security clearance to keep Israelis informed on projected US plans. Its a standard feature of the lobbying scene, the staffer said. How do you draw the line between a lobbyist briefing and spying? It is not as clear-cut as it should be.

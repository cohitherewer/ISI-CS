 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Khatami bid to resolve poll row fails
																								Tehran, Jan. 17 (Reuters): Irans reformist President Mohammad Khatami tried today to resolve a bitter row over the barring of election candidates, but MPs said his meeting with a conservative watchdog had achieved nothing.																								He and parliament speaker Mehdi Karroubi met members of the 12-member Guardian Council that has blocked almost half of the 8,200 parliamentary election candidates from running, predominantly liberals including 80 of the standing 290 MPs.																								The meeting really did not achieve anything, said one despondent MP, himself disqualified from the February 20 poll.																								Another senior reformist shared this gloomy outlook. I am not optimistic about the negotiations but let us see what practical steps the Guardian Council will take, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.																								The meeting came as Iranian MPs, heading towards their seventh night of a parliamentary sit-in protesting at the disqualifications, started a fast today, abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours.																								Khatami himself gave no sign of how talks had gone but, in a jab at the Guardian Council, asserted the elected parliament was the body best suited to overseeing public affairs.																								Parliament is the best place for setting the law and supervising all pillars of the establishment, he was quoted as saying on the official Irna news agency.

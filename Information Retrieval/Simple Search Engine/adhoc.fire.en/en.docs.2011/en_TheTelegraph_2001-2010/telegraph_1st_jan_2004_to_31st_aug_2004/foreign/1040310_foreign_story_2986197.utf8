																								London, March 9 (Reuters): Britain gave a thumbs up today for commercial planting of genetically modified (GM) maize, risking a backlash from environmentalists and a sceptical public despite setting strict conditions.																								Environment secretary Margaret Beckett told parliament the government would agree in principle to commercial cultivation of GM herbicide-tolerant maize but said it did not expect any to be grown for at least a year. There is no scientific case for a blanket approval of all the uses of GM, she said.

 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 US forces settle down for Osama hunt
																								Kabul, March 2 (Reuters): US forces are basing more troops in the south and east of Afghanistan and spending longer on patrol in rural areas to help gather intelligence about al Qaida and Taliban militants, the US military said today.																								The shift to more personal contact with Afghans comes amid heightened efforts in Pakistani tribal areas to hunt down rebels and growing confidence among American forces that they are closing in on Osama bin Laden.																								The changes appear to be a tacit admission that previous large-scale operations by 10,600 US-led troops in Afghanistan mostly failed to net significant numbers of guerrillas or senior militant figures.																								Searches conducted in villages and towns in the deeply conservative south and east of the country, where remnants of the ousted Taliban regime are most active, have also angered locals who complained of heavy-handed tactics and arbitrary arrests.																								:When our infantry go out they spend a longer time on patrols, generally, US military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Hilferty said in Kabul. Its also in rural areas.

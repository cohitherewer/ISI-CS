 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Crash kills Macedonia President 
																								Near Stolac (Bosnia), Feb. 26 (Reuters): Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski, hailed in the West as a peacemaker who averted civil war, was killed today when his plane crashed into a Bosnian mountainside in thick fog, officials said. 																								His death was announced by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern as he postponed talks with Macedonias Prime Minister, in Dublin to lodge a formal application to join the European Union. 																								Yet more than seven hours after the small, twin-engined Beechcraft Super King went down, Nato denied official Macedonian and Bosnian reports that its peacekeepers had found the wreckage and the bodies of all nine aboard.																								In a sometimes chaotic search over an area where landmines remain a risk, a convoy of Nato and Bosnian police vehicles, ambulances and de-mining units scoured muddy routes in a valley and mountainsides south of the town of Stolac. 																								Trajkovski was minutes from his scheduled landing in Mostar, Bosnia, for an economixc conference when his flight disappeared from radar screens at 0701 GMT.

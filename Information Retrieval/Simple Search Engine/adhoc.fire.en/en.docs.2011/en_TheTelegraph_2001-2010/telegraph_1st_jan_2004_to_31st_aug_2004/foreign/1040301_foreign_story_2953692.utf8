 							 - America arranges Aristides departure, focuses on deterring rebels				 	 Haitians celebrate Aristides departure on Sunday. (Reuters)																								Washington, Feb. 29 (Reuters): The US could send forces to Haiti within days to deter rebels from grabbing power after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide resigned today, a US official said.																								Canadian foreign minister Bill Graham today claimed Washington was planning to land troops in Haiti later in the day.																								I understand from speaking to (US secretary of state) Colin Powell this morning that the Americans will be landing troops there today at the invitation of course of the (new Haitian) President, the Canadian foreign minister told CTV television.																								Criticised for responding slowly to defuse the revolt and for failing to mediate a viable alternative to Aristide, the US is now worried rebels will fill a power vacuum in a nation with a history of coups and political violence.																								The wild card here is the rebels. Are they with the programme? a state department official asked.																								We want to make sure we neutralise them. Not necessarily by going after them but the timely insertion of some kind of deterrent is important.

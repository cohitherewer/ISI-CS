 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 High-value target not Zawahri: Pak
				 	 Pakistani soldiers guard a detainee at a military base in Wana, South Waziristan. (AFP)																								Wana (Pakistan), March 20 (Reuters): A suspected senior al Qaida member whom the Pakistani army thought it had surrounded in a remote area on the Afghan border is probably a Chechen or Uzbek militant leader, a Pakistani commander said today.																								Thousands of Pakistani troops have been locked in battle with al Qaida fighters and their tribal allies in Pakistans wild South Waziristan tribal area since Tuesday. 																								Dozens of fighters have been killed and about 100 suspected militants, many of them foreigners, captured, the army said. Commanders said the fierce defence the rebels mounted suggested they were trying to protect a high-value target, who officials said was possibly Osama bin Ladens deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri.																								But intercepted rebel radio communications suggested the mystery militant leader was an Uzbek or a Chechen. Zawahri is Egyptian.																								He is most probably a Chechen or Uzbek because all the intercepts we have been receiving have been in the Chechen or Uzbek language, Lieutenant-General Safder Hussain told reporters visiting the western town of Wana, near the fighting.																								Hussain said speculation Zawahri had been with the militants was conjecture. Zawahri, a doctor, is regarded as the brains of al Qaida. He is thought to be one of the key figures behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US.																								The capture of one of the worlds most wanted men would be a major coup for the US, under fire over its rationale for the war in Iraq. Today is the first anniversary of the start of that conflict.																								Hussain, the top military commander in the region, did not say who the Chechen or Uzbek militant leader might be.																								An intelligence source said earlier two Chechen militants, identified as Danyar and Quaran Ata, were believed to be in the area and there was a possibility a prominent Uzbek militant, Tahir Yaldashev, was with them.																								Pakistani forces had captured about 100 militants, many of them foreign, during the fighting, Hussain said. 																								Reporters saw an army truck carrying 30 or 40 prisoners, blindfolded and with hands tied behind their backs.																								Most wore the traditional Pakistani salwar kameez, some wore Muslim prayer caps, others the brown woollen hats common in the mountains of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The offensive, involving several thousand soldiers, is the biggest Pakistan has waged since it joined the US-led war on terror after the September 11 attacks.

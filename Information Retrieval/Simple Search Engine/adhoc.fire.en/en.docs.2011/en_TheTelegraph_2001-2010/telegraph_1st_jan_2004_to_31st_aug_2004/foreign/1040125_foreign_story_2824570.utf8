Youll have to tell your boss, too, reports The Daily Telegraph.																																	Executives at Lancaster city council have drawn up a lovers charter requiring all 1,100 staff to tell them if they have a serious fling with a colleague. Mark Cullinan, the councils chief executive, calls his three-page draft proposal Continuing Close Personal Relationships At Work.

Richard Loader, a regional officer for Unison, said: If it came in, it would mean that every time two junior clerks went to the cinema together theyd have to report it. Thats plainly ridiculous. Cullinan said that colleagues involved in such relationships would not be barred from either employment or promotion.

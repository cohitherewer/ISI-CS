 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Korean cloning a crime: Catholics
																								Vatican City, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Catholic officials today condemned the recent cloning of human embryos, with Pope John Pauls bioethics advisor calling it a repeat of what the Nazis tried to do in World War Two concentration camps.																								You cant kill human life in the hopes of finding medicines to save other lives, said Monsignor Elio Sgrecia, vice-president of the Vaticans Pontifical Academy for Life.																								That would be a repeat of what the Nazis did in the concentration camps, Sgrecia, who is close to the pope, said in a telephone interview. The scientists are saying: First Ill clone you. Then Ill kill you. This is not a victory but it is stepping on human life twice, he said.																								South Korean scientists announced this week they had cloned several human embryos and extracted stem cells from one. They were the first researchers to prove they had cloned a human embryo and said they did it not to make a baby but for the purposes of therapeutic cloning. Sgrecia said: This is not a victory for humanity but a crime twice over.																								However, at a hospital clinic in Seoul, doctors and patients hoped the ability to clone human embryo cells might one day help patients with damaged spinal cords. 																								Dr Moon Suk-bang, a rehabilitation doctor at the Seoul National University Hospital, said the cloning experiment could allow him to treat patients who have been paralysed.																								Since a nerve may be restored if embryo cells are transplanted and a paralysed patient can expect the damaged part to rehabilitate, we can say this is groundbreaking, Moon said.																								Stem cells in the tiny embryo have the potential to develop into different types of human cells, opening the way for them to be cultivated and grown to become nerve cells or new organs such as a kidney, heart or even skin that is genetically identical to the patients own cells.																								The Catholic Church condemns all forms of research on embryos that leads to their destruction. Scientists believe the stem cells can lead to cures for diseases.																								Stem cells, a kind of master cell, are found throughout the body but some scientists say adult stem cells are difficult to pinpoint and hard to work with.																								Sgrecia, who also heads an ethics centre at a leading Catholic medical school in Rome, said stem cells taken from umbilical cords or adults should be used for research instead because the process does not involve the destruction of life.

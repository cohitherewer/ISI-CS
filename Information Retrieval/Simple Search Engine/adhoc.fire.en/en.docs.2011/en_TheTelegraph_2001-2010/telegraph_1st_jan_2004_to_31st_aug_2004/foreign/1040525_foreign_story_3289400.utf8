 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Harkat faction in Musharraf net
				 	 Officials show weapons recovered from militants in Karachi. (Reuters)																								Karachi, May 24 (Reuters): Six members of an Islamic militant group that tried to kill Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in 2002 and described as highly trained and dangerous were arrested after a shootout today, police said.																								The militants  members of a group known as Harkat-ul Mujahideen al-Alami  were captured at a house in a congested low-income neighbourhood of southern Karachi and a large quantity of weapons were seized, a police statement said. The terrorists started firing at police and hurled a hand grenade which did not explode, it said.																								Al-Alami is a dissident faction of the pro-Pakistan Harkat-ul Mujahideen group that has been staging militant attacks in Kashmir.																								Police returned fire and forced the militants to surrender after firing teargas into the house. The statement described the militants as highly-trained and dangerous. Police have blamed Harkat-ul Mujahideen al-Alami for a spate of high-profile attacks in Karachi, including a June 2002 suicide bombing outside the US consulate that killed 12 Pakistanis.																								Last October, three of its members were sentenced to ten years in jail for taking part in a plot to blow up Musharrafs motorcade in April 2002. The car bomb they used failed to explode, but investigators say the same vehicle was later used in the attack at the US consulate.																								Police said todays arrests followed a tip-off by a key militant, Kamran Atif, who was arrested last Wednesday after a fierce gunbattle in which he was wounded and a woman bystander killed. 																								Police said the militants arrested today had gathered to plot how to spring Kamran from custody. They also planned to kill senior security officials by using remote control bombs and suicide attacks, he said.

 KATE CONNOLLY																								London, Jan. 20: A German theatre production of Samuel Becketts masterpiece Waiting for Godot has been scrapped after a publishers objection to the use of actresses.																								Women are not allowed to wait for Godot because Beckett wouldnt have wanted it, ruled the Fischer publishing house of Frankfurt, which owns the German rights. The play was only 10 days from opening night after six weeks of rehearsals.																								The decision has left the cast and Philip Kochheim, the director of the Landesbuhne Niedersachsen Nord, furious. Kochheim turned the two characters, Lucky and Estragon, into female parts alongside their male partners, Vladimir and Pozzo, in a tense, sexually-charged interpretation of the drama.																								But a spokesman for Fischer said anyone working in theatre was well aware of the notorious conditions attached by the Irish playwright. He said he felt little sympathy for the theatre.																								This is not us being difficult, its been determined by Beckett and is strictly adhered to by his heirs  that only men can wait for Godot. Kochheim and his cast now plan to hold a reading of the play, on condition that no movement is involved.																								Curtis Brown is responsible for distributing the English-language performing rights for the play, which was originally published in French in 1952 as En attendant Godot. It said Becketts estate had asked it not to comment on the reasons for his punctiliousness.																								According to the copyright law governing protected works, Becketts wishes have to be adhered to for 70 years after his death  in other words until 2059.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

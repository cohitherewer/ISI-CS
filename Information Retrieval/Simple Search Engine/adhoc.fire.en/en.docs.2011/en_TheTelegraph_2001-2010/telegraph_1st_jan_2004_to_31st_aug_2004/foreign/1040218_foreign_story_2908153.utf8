 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Samba bands take aim at Lula
				 	 President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva jokes with scribes in Brasilia. (Reuters)																								Rio de Janeiro, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Its almost Carnival time in Rio de Janeiro and samba bands already parading in the streets are taking aim at Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in scathing satirical songs.																								Bearded Toad is just one of the insults hurled his way. Lulas economic policies, perceived mistakes in his first year in office, and as-yet unfulfilled election promises are all mocked.																								Carnival officially kicks off on Friday but noisy processions, complete with dozens of drummers, are taking place in the streets now, along with singing, dancing and drinking.																								Brazilians like to scoff at politicians and the bands have always made their songs topical. Many have Leftist traditions dating back to the days of military dictatorship, when they were one of the few means of free expression. The populist Lula, a former shoeshine boy, has long been a hero to Brazils masses but he shifted to the centre of the political spectrum before his election in October 2002.																								His conservative policies since have cheered financial markets but disappointed some old supporters.																								I wanted to see the economy grow/But the government wouldnt let me go/They barred me and Portela and the rest of the nation/Im waiting Comrade, wheres the celebration? goes a song by a street band made up of journalists called Imprensa Que Eu Gamo (The Press that I Love).																								Lula was asking for trouble at the hands of the Rio songsmiths. The Portela referred to in the song is a traditional Carnival samba school.																								Lula was going to take Portela with him on a West Asia tour last December to represent Brazilian culture. 																								But he ditched it at the last minute and brought along a band associated with Sao Paulo soccer club Corinthians, of which he is a keen supporter.																								Another samba band  whose name is the rhetorical question What The Crap Is That?  expresses frustration at seeing no results from their criticisms over the years.																								We parade for 10 years flat/Many problems we lashed out at/But theyre still all out of hand/So, tell me, what the crap is that?																								Apart from politics, street bands sing about anything from Carnival-time adultery to charges against pop star Michael Jackson and the recent outbreak of bird flu in Asia.																								Brazils spat with the US over the fingerprinting of travellers at airports is reflected in a samba by Bloco Virtual:																								Identify yourself, my love/Show your fingers and lets make love.																								Rio has several dozen street processions, which provide a grassroots alternative to the glitzy parades by professional samba schools in the huge Sambodromo venue.																								One, As Carmelitas, has men dressing up as nuns. Among the newer ones is a procession of dog owners, where the canines wear colourful Carnival costumes.

 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Actor takes builder to court
				 	 Bullock																								Austin (Texas), Aug. 19 (AP): Miss Congeniality is waging a legal battle.																								Sandra Bullock was in Travis county court yesterday in a dispute with the Austin developer she hired to build a luxury home that she says is defective. The developer, MB Benny Daneshjou, claims the movie star owes him money and that the Lake Austin home was fine. He filed a lawsuit against the actress and she countersued. The Travis county judge Paul Davis barred cameras from his courtroom for the trial thats expected to last more than a month. 																								Bullock laughed when one woman said she didnt realise she was a movie star but had thought instead she was a former wife of the late Texas political giant Bob Bullock, a former lieutenant governor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Loos, Lewinsky amp; media
																								Edinburgh, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Their relationships with two of the worlds most famous men brought international scandals  but Monica Lewinsky and Rebecca Loos both used the media onslaught to boost their bank balances.																								Youd be an idiot not to get the money, said Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose affair with then President Bill Clinton nearly drove him from office.																								Advertisers, television stations, news anchors  everyone else is making money. Your story is a commodity, added Lewinsky, who received a reported 400,000 for an interview with Britains Channel 4.																								Loos, whose alleged affair with football superstar David Beckham was front-page news for weeks in Britain over the summer, got 120,000 for appearing on Sky News, according to her agent Max Clifford. Lewinsky, Loos and Clifford justified their media relations in a panel discussion in Edinburgh today at a British TV industry conference.																								Before, the media made a lot of money from peoples stories. Now, the people with the stories make the money  I dont have a problem with that, said Clifford, an agent famous for making lucrative interview deals with tabloid newspapers and television networks. An increase in chequebook journalism, especially on television, has spurred debates about ethics and reliability.																								I wasnt big on buy-ups, said David Yelland, former editor of Britains top-selling tabloid The Sun. When you pay money the relationship changes. I think the British public understands that tabloids pay, but that hasnt been generally true with television.

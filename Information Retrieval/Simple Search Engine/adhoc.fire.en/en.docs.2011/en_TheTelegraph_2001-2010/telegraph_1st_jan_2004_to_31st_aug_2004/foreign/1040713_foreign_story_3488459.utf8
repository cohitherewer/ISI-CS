 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Smokers paradise made to pay
																								Tokyo, July 12 (Reuters): A Japanese court ordered a Tokyo local government today to pay compensation to a man who said passive smoking had harmed his health, a rare ruling in a country that remains a smokers paradise.																								The Tokyo district court ordered the citys Edogawa ward to pay 50,000 yen ($464) in damages to the plaintiff, who said he had developed breathing problems due to the smoking of others in his office, a court official said.																								The plaintiff, whose name and age were not given, had demanded 300,000 yen in damages.																								Japanese media said the ruling was the first of its kind, but the official was unable to confirm this. The ward, which manages the place where the plaintiff worked, bears a responsibility to take steps in order to protect his life and health from passive smoking, Judge Akio Doi was quoted by Kyodo news agency as saying. The plaintiff was assigned to an office where smoking was permitted in April 1995 and subsequently began to suffer from breathing difficulties and shoulder pain.																								Although he requested that smoking be restricted to a specific area, the only step taken was the installation of extractor fans, Kyodo reported.																								In April 1996 he was transferred to a different office, three months after submitting a doctors report saying his health would suffer if nothing changed.																								Referring to this three-month period, the judge said:The fact that nothing was done violates (an employers) duty to consider safety, Kyodo added.																								Japans official efforts to curb smoking have increased but still lag behind other nations. The health ministry itself has smoking areas and there are several cigarette vending machines on its premises.

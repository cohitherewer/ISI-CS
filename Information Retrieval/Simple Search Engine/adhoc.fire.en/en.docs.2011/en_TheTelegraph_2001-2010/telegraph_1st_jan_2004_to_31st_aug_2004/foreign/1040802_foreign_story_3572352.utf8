																								Islamabad, Aug. 1 (PTI): Pakistan is trying to verify a claim by al Qaida that it carried out the recent suicide attack on Prime Minister-designate Shaukat Aziz. Investigators have not ruled out involvement of lower-level security officials in the assassination attempt.																								The role of junior security officials in Fridays suicide bomb attack against Aziz has not been ruled out as in the attacks against President Pervez Musharraf, director of Pakistans national police bureau, Sahoib Suddle, said. Musharraf had himself said the investigations into the two suicide attacks against him in December last year revealed involvement of low-ranking personnel from the army and air force. 																								The possibility of the suicide attack on Aziz as a result of fallout of the armys operations against al Qaida in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan was also not ruled out, he said. 																								Suspicion of the involvement of security personnel arose as investigators found there was an unusual delay in Azizs black Mercedes moving out of a public meeting at Fatehjhung soon after he got into it after addressing the meeting, which provided the opportunity for the suicide bomber, believed to be in his 20s, to rush to the car and explode near the drivers seat. 																								The driver and eight others were killed, but Aziz, sitting in the back seat, survived without sustaining any injury. 																								Five soldiers killed																								Gunmen attacked a government vehicle near a small town in the southwestern Baluchistan province today, killing at least six people, including five soldiers, and wounding two, police said.																								The gunmen ambushed the vehicle near Khuzdar, around 200 km southeast of the Baluchi provincial capital, Quetta, they said.

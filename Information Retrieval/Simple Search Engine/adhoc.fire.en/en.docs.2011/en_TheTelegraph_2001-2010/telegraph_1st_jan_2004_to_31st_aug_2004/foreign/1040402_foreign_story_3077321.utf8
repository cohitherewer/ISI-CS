 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Pension joke
																								Tokyo, April 1 (Reuters): Hows this for a government pension scheme: In lieu of payments, give eligible recipients five lottery tickets a year and a chance to win millions.																								A Japanese daily playfully reported today, April Fools Day, that Japans government was considering handing out lottery tickets to make up for future cuts in payments from the ailing public pension system.																								The aim is to suppress the publics discontent by giving them a dream that they may win millions, the Tokyo Shimbun said in the article, one of four joke stories it printed for the April 1 edition. Some readers, however, arent laughing.																								I dont want to see a joke that may not be so much of a joke, said a woman who feels like paying into the ailing system is indeed akin to gambling.

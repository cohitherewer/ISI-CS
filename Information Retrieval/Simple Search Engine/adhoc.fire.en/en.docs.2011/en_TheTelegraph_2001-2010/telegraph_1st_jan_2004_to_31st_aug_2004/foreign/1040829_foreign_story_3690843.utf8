 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Powell scraps Athens visit
				 	 Greeks during a protest in Athens. (Reuters)																								Athens, Aug. 28 (Reuters): US secretary of state Colin Powell abruptly cancelled plans to attend the Olympics closing ceremony in Athens tomorrow, a visit which had triggered angry protests from anti-war groups.																								The state department said the cancellation was forced in part because of events in Iraq and Sudan.																								US and Greek officials denied Powell changed plans because of protests against US foreign policy that were dispersed when police hurled tear gas yesterday at about 1,000 demonstrators headed in the direction of the US embassy in Athens.																								But Greek activists, who said the threat of street protests also forced Powell to cancel a trip in 2003, were crowing with victory. 																								Of course, the cancellation was linked to our protests, activist Yiannis Sifakakis said. This is a huge victory for the anti-war movement which protested by the thousands in the streets of Athens last night.																								US foreign policy on issues ranging from West Asia conflict, its war on terror and the war in Iraq is deeply unpopular among Greeks.																								Today Greek activists hoisted a massive banner saying Powell Killer Go Home on the Acropolis hillside towering over Athens to protest against his planned 24-hour visit. A Greek government source described the use of the site as deplorable.																								Later, about 1,500 members of the Greek Communist Party peacefully marched through Athens chanting: Get the Killer Imperialists Out of Greece.																								Secretary of state Colin Powell informed Greek foreign minister Petros Molyviatis that due to the press of business in Washington the secretary would not be able to travel to Athens to attend the closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games, state department spokesman Richard Boucher said in a statement.																								Powell called Molyviatis yesterday and expressed his congratulations to the government and people of Greece for hosting a spectacular, safe and successful Olympics.																								The fact that Powell would come was the best answer to all the wrong speculation claiming that the demonstrations were the reason for the cancellation, a Greek foreign ministry source said.

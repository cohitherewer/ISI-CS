				 	 Clinton: Reform ride Jeddah, Jan. 19 (Reuters):  Former US President Bill Clinton urged Saudi Arabia today  to push ahead with reforms, saying the deeply conservative  Muslim kingdom could not fight the tide of change.																								In a challenge to traditionalists in the birthplace of Islam, where women cannot drive and say they are marginalised, Clinton said if cars had been around 1,400 years ago Prophet Mohammad would have let his wife get behind the wheel. 																								He probably would have made Saudi Arabia the first automobile producing nation on earth and put her in charge of the business, Clinton told a conference in Saudi Arabias Red Sea city of Jeddah. 																								He was warmly applauded by women delegates, covered in black robes, or abayas, and segregated from men by a screen running the length of the conference hall. The worlds biggest oil exporter, facing a wave of militant violence and growing economic challenges, has embarked on a programme of cautious reform despite fierce opposition from some powerful religious figures.																								Clinton said Saudi Arabia had to address ways of broadening political participation in the absolute monarchy without compromising your faith and culture. Saudi policy cannot be based in the long run on fighting change because you cannot fight the tide of change, he said. Economists say women make up more than half the graduates from Saudi universities but just 5 per cent of the work force.

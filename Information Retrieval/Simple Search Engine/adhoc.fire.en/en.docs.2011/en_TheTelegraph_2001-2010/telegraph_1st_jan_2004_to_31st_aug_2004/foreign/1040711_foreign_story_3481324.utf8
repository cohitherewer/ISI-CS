 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Cheney quote spawns an industry
 Washington, July 10 (Reuters):  Your dog, your toddler, your car and your computer can now  sport the same pungent phrase  suggesting an anatomically  unlikely sex act  uttered in a moment of pique by US vice-  president Dick Cheney.																								Within weeks of Cheneys angry utterance of the f-word to US Senator Patrick Leahy on June 22, an online cottage industry quoting the vice-president has sprung up at Cafepress.com, a website offering customised merchandise.																								I thought it was funny, said Sean Bonner, a Los Angeles art gallery owner who designed a range of products with Cheneys angry remark.																								I kind of wanted a shirt like that and the best way to do it would be to make it myself, Bonner said by telephone.																								Bonners section of the Cafepress site  www.cafepress.com/vpquote  offers regular T-shirts, thongs, creeper outfits for toddlers and infants, dog T-shirts, computer mouse pads, car stickers and trucker hats. After a mention in The Washington Post on Friday, this collection went from getting few hits to being one of the top four shops on the site.																								It is hardly the only one that refers to Cheneys vulgarity.																								Others offer such slogans as: Its long overdue: go f*** yourselves! Bush Cheney 04 and one features a photo of Cheney surrounded by the wordsDick Heads, here for America. There are also several shops offering straightforward political merchandise supporting Bush and Cheney, who during the 2000 presidential campaign vowed to restore a tone of civility to the debate in Washington.

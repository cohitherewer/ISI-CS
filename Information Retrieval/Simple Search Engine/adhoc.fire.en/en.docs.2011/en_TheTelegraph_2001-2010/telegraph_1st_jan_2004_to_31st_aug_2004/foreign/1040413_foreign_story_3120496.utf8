 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Putin slams bid to ban protests
																								Moscow, April 12 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin today sharply condemned a move to curb street protests in Russia  a widely predicted step that will help improve his democratic image after criticism over his one-sided re-election.																								Putins backers in the Kremlin-controlled lower house (Duma) sparked an outcry from the Opposition when they voted through a bill after a first reading last month that would all but ban public rallies in Russia. The Opposition branded the bill as a blow against democracy.

Who, in todays circumstances, needs to limit the rights and freedoms of our citizens to demonstrate? he asked.

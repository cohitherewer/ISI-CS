 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Mbeki sworn in for second term
																								Pretoria, April 27 (Reuters): President Thabo Mbeki was sworn in for a second term today as South Africa celebrated 10 years of democracy, vowing to fight the crushing poverty that threatens his nations post-apartheid triumph.																								Endemic and widespread poverty continues to disfigure the face of our country, said Mbeki, whose African National Congress was re-elected in a landslide victory two weeks ago despite mounting problems with joblessness and AIDS.																								It will always be impossible for us to say that we have fully restored the dignity of all our people as long as this situation persists, he said at a massive celebratory concert.

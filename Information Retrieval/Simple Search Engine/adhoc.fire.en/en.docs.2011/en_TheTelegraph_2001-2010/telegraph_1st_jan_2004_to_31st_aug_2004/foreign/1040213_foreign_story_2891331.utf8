The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Hillary muscles into guys list
				 	 Hillary Clinton																								New York, Feb. 12 (AP): US Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has been called many things: a savvy politician, a devoted wife. But Mens Journal magazine is adding one more description to that list: tough guy.																								In its March issue, already on news stands, the magazine publishes its annual list of the 25 toughest guys in America  and Clinton weighs in at number 25, just behind human crash test dummy Rusty Haight, who has been in 740 car wrecks.																								Its the first time Mens Journal has put a woman on the list, senior editor Tom Foster said.																								I think just looking at what shes been through and what she represents, that sort of stood for itself, Foster said. Would you mess with her? He referred to Clintons handling of former President Bill Clintons sexual improprieties when he was in office. Hillary Clinton wrote about the pain caused by the Presidents affair with an intern and the subsequent impeachment effort in Living History, her White House memoir.																								Foster said Clintons listing  among athletes, martial artists, racers and wrestlers  is not a lambasting. I would think people would take it as a compliment, he said.																								Senator John McCain was number five on the list while defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld was number 21.

 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Paris terminal cracks
																								Paris, May 24 (Reuters): Workers heard new cracks at a Paris airport terminal today a day after part of the roof collapsed, and the airports head vowed to tear it down if an investigation proved the structure was unsafe.																								Terminal 2E at Charles de Gaulle airport has been closed to passengers since yesterdays accident killed four people, but workers are there clearing the rubble and trying to ensure the building is safe.																								Police evacuated the building as a precaution after the cracking was heard in the same terminal, said Jerome Dutrieux, spokesman for Aeroports de Paris (ADP), the Paris airports operator. The cracks were again in the departure hall.																								Concrete, metal and glass crashed down onto a waiting area in terminal 2E yesterday morning, bringing down a large section of the long tube-like building at Paris biggest airport  minutes after passengers saw and heard cracks in the roof.																								Permanent closure of the showcase building would be a big blow to the airport authoritys finances and image as it prepares for privatisation, but ADP chairman Pierre Graff said safety was the top priority.																								If all the (structural) rings which make up this terminal are beyond repair, we will raze everything to the ground, he told Le Parisien newspaper in an interview. We will take no risk in terms of safety.																								Firemen said they had retrieved four bodies from the rubble, revising the death toll down from five. 																								The futuristic terminal, used mainly by national carrier Air France, opened only 11 months ago and is intended eventually to handle 10 million passengers. 																								Its about 60 daily flights are being diverted to other terminals at the airport in Roissy, on the northeastern outskirts of Paris. The problem is not the flights, its the number of passengers, Dutrieux said. Some 20,000 to 25,000 people pass through it each day. 																								The collapse has raised questions about the design and construction, and whether the terminal was built too fast. 																								France has launched a criminal investigation and the architect, Paul Andreu, headed back to France from China where he is working on an opera house. I cant explain what happened. I just dont understand it, Andreu told LHumanite newspaper.																								Andreu said his team had adhered to all required security checks. 																								The opening of the terminal last year was delayed due to secondary problems, such as electricity installations, and did not have anything to do with the bigger structure, he added.

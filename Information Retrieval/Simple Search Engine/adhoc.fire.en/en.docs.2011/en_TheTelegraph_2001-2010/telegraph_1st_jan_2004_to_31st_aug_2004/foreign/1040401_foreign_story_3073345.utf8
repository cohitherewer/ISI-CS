 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Karzai seeks billions to fight twin terrors
																								Berlin, March 31 (Reuters): Afghan President Hamid Karzai asked international donors for billions of dollars today to stop his country becoming a haven of drugs and terrorism.																								Afghanistan, one of the worlds poorest countries and the biggest opium supplier, remains a key western security concern two years after US-led forces overthrew the Taliban which had provided a haven for Osama bin Ladens al Qaida guerrillas.																								What we have achieved is very promising, but let me be frank and say that the reconstruction has only begun, Karzai told a gathering of some 50 potential donor countries in Berlin.																								A US-led military operation of 13,500 troops has limited but not eliminated Taliban and al Qaida remnants, and the drugs trade and warlords have re-emerged as threats to stability.																								Karzai says Afghanistan needs $27.5 billion over seven years to build a state capable of supporting itself, although he was not expecting this sum at the two-day Berlin conference.																								Finance minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai said Afghanistan expected to receive more than $4 billion this year and stressed the aid would help cut the massive cost of the Wests military operations in Afghanistan.																								We are not asking for charity, we are asking for investment, he said. When we are asking for assistance it is to actually save you money, not to make further claims on your constrained budgets.

				 Fat furore

				 	 Michael Bloomberg
																								New York, Jan. 23 (AP): He thought he was just chewing the fat, but mayor Michael Bloomberg may have bitten off more than he bargained for.
																								Apparently thinking microphones were off during a visit to a Brooklyn fire house this week, Bloomberg, between bites of pasta, used an expletive to dismiss the reported details of Dr Robert Atkins death, hinting that he may have died from weight-related health problems. Later, he called the diet guru fat.
																								Atkins widow is furious over Bloombergs comments and wants an apology.

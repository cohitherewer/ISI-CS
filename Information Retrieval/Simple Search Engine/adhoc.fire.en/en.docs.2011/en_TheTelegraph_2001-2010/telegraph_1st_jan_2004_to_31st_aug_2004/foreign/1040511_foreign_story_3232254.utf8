 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Crackdown on partymen spurs Sharif brother return
																								London, May 10 (Reuters): The younger brother of exiled former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said today that a government crackdown on his supporters made his flight back to Pakistan today urgent.																								Pakistani police say they have detained hundreds of Shahbaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League (PML) activists ahead of his return from exile, but party officials put the number at over 1,200. In the face of these heavy-handed tactics of General (President Pervez) Musharraf, I will definitely depart London this evening for Pakistan, said Shahbaz. 																								I call on the regime to realise the gravity of the situation and not to act in a manner that would bring our great country into disrepute. Shahbaz, who faces charges in a murder case, said he was returning to clear his name and would reach Lahore late tomorrow.																								 I am ending my three years and five months of forced exile, he said during a hastily arranged news conference in the basement of a London restaurant, after a televised speech to supporters in Pakistan was pulled late yesterday. 																								This might be my last opportunity to address the people of Pakistan, he said. If they (authorities) wish to incarcerate me, that is up to them; if they wish to try me, that is up to them; if they wish to deport me, that is up to them.Political analysts see Shahbazs plan as a bid by the Sharif family to break back into Pakistani politics at a time when Musharraf is seeking to unite disparate factions of the PML to build a personal power base.

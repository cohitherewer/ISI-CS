The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Beckham has a new tattoo
				 	 David Beckham																								London, May 22 (Reuters): England soccer captain David Beckham surprised fans and dismayed media commentators by acquiring another tattoo, a winged cross, etched across the back of his neck.																								British newspapers today clucked their disapproval as they showed pictures of Beckham with the tattoo, his ninth, as he trained in Spain with Real Madrid teammates.																								The tabloid Daily Mirror said the design, stretching from ear-to-ear, left the shaven-headed Beckham looking more like a soccer thug than the England captain, while the Sun said he had gone from fab to yob.																								Beckham flew tattooist Louis Malloy to Madrid from Manchester on Thursday for the latest addition to his multi-million-pound body.

(AFP) 																								Dhaka, Aug. 21 (Agencies): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed today escaped an assassination bid after a series of explosions rocked an Opposition rally addressed by her here killing 14 people and injuring 300.																								The explosions took place as Sheikh Hasina finished addressing the rally organised by her party Awami League to protest the recent bombings in the northeastern city of Sylhet, witnesses said.																								A private television channel put the death toll at 14 while the official BSS news agency said 13 people were killed, out of which eight have been identified. 																								Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil said Sheikh Hasina was the target of the blasts but she was safe. 																								Among the dead were three women, the private ATN Bangla television channel said. Senior Awami League leaders, MPs, including Suranjit Sen Gupta and Abdur Rassak, were among those injured and officials at local hospital said the toll could go up as some of the wounded were in serious condition.																								Sheikh Hasina later told BBC that she was protected by her supporters, some of whom were killed. When the attackers started hurling grenades towards the makeshift podium in a lorry, my workers saved me by sacrificing their lives. 																								She called for the government to resign for failing to protect innocent people. No one has yet admitted to carrying out the attack. 																								Prime Minister Khaleda Zia condemned the dastardly attack on a political rally, and said her government will try to find those responsible.																								Let us all work together to prevent repeat of such cowardly attacks, she said.																								A Reuters reporter at a nearby government hospital where the injured were taken said he had counted seven bodies, including that of a woman. We are very busy trying to deal with such a large number of injured people, a doctor at Dhaka Medical College Hospital said. Awami League leaders were at the hospital amid chaotic scenes, with relatives crying and wounded people screaming.																								After one blast, I was lying in the street. Then I heard seven or eight more blasts and something hit me in the head and I fainted, Gaisuddin, an Awami League worker, his head bandaged, said.																								A Reuters cameraman at the scene said many of the injured were women activists. He said he heard several blasts. Two grenades lay unexploded at the site of the meeting, witnesses said. Wounded women activists were lying on the ground, many in bloodsoaked saris. 																								TV footage showed a badly bleeding child being carried to hospital.

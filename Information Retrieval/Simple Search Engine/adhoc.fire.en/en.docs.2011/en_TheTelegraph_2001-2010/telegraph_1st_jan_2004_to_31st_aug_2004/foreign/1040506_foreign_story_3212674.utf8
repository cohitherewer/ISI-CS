 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Nigeria ethnic clash toll soars
																								Lagos, May 5 (Reuters): Nigerias top Muslim leader said today that 300 people, mostly Muslims, were killed by Christian militia in Sundays attack on the town of Yelwa.																								Justice Abdulkadir Orire, secretary general of the Jamaatu Nasril Islam, described the killings with machine guns in the remote farming town as genocide and said they took the toll from three months of ethnic violence in central Nigeria to at least 700-800 people.																								The information we have is that 300 people died and they are mostly Muslims. We call it a genocide because they are killing women and children, Orire said in a telephone interview from his Kaduna headquarters.																								The conflict between the Christian Tarok tribe and Muslim Fulani is rooted in competing claims over the fertile farmlands at the heart of Africas most populous nation. It is fuelled by religious and ethnic differences.																								Orire, who is a leader of Nigerias 60 million Muslims, said Tarok militia used machine guns and arson in the attacks which left most of Yelwas buildings including a mosque destroyed. He criticised the Plateau state governor Joshua Dariye, a Christian, for apparently inciting violence.																								Police stationed in Yelwa had been withdrawn four days before the attack, he said, despite complaints by local Muslims that they were surrounded by Taroks and tension was rising.																								It seems the governor is supporting the move. We heard that the government said non-indigenes should move out of the area, Orire said. That is very bad. He should look after everyone in the state and not just his own tribe.																								Nigeria is the worlds seventh largest oil exporter. Ethnic fighting has hit the Opec countrys oil production in the past, but Yelwa is hundreds of miles from any oilfields.																								A Reuters correspondent in Yelwa yesterday saw thousands of Muslims lining the body-strewn streets chanting religious slogans and vowing revenge on the attackers.																								These people, many of whom have already fled violence in other parts of the state, are now virtually besieged by Tarok villages surrounding the town.

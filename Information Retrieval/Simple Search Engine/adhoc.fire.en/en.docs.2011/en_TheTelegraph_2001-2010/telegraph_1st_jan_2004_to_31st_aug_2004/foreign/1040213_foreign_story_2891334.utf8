 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Blair plots a way forward
																								London, Feb. 12 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair launched a concerted attempt today to draw a line under his Iraq troubles and refocus on the domestic politics which will decide next years expected election.																								Blair held a special political cabinet with his top ministers to plot a way forward in a week that has already seen a flurry of education, crime-fighting and justice initiatives. But with the body count still rising in Iraq and the Prime Ministers trust ratings at historic lows after the war, analysts say he faces a struggle to get his message across.																								More than 100 Iraqis have been killed by suicide bombs this week, forcing foreign secretary Jack Straw to declare: We will not let terrorists succeed in deterring us from working together to build a stable and democratic Iraq with proper rule of law.																								Opinion polls show that despite widespread opposition to the war it is bread-and-butter issues  schools, hospitals, taxes  that resonate most with the public when they cast their vote.																								But the fact that no banned weapons have been found in Iraq nearly 10 months after Saddam Hussein was toppled, has led Britons to view sceptically any claims Blair and his government make about improvements to key public services. Prior to the war, Blair said Iraq posed a serious and current threat, that it had continued to produce banned weapons and that it could deploy some of them within 45 minutes.																								That led many in his Labour Party warily to support military action. Now they feel let down, some to the point of mutiny.																								A growing group of disaffected Labour parliamentarians have pushed Blair perilously close to defeat over flagship health and education reforms in recent months. More revolts are expected. Government sources admit they would not be facing such angry internal discontent had Britain not waged war in Iraq. 																								Blair survived unscathed an inquiry into the suicide of British weapons expert David Kelly  who was revealed as the source of a BBC report that Blairs team exaggerated the threat from Iraq in order to justify war. But with a new probe into apparent failings of intelligence on Iraq due to report in July, the issue will not disappear. 																								Former minister Peter Mandelson warned Labour rebels that they were playing into the hands of opposition Conservatives and could even threaten a third successive election win.

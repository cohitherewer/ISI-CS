				 	 An elderly woman drinks coffee in Tirana, Albania. (AFP)																								Washington, July 6 (Reuters): Old people may hold the key to human civilisation, US researchers said today.																								They found evidence that, around 30,000 years ago, many more people started living into old age, in turn fuelling a population explosion. 																								Rachel Caspari of the University of Michigan and Sang-Hee Lee of the University of California at Riverside believe that groups in which old people survived better were more successful, in turn allowing more people to live into old age.																								There has been a lot of speculation about what gave modern humans their evolutionary advantage. This research provides a simple explanation for which there is now concrete evidence  modern humans were older and wiser, Caspari said.																								We think with increases in longevity two things happened to increase survivorship, Caspari, an anthropologist specialising in evolution, added in a telephone interview.																								First, individual people have more kids because if you live longer you can continue to have kids after your kids have kids. And second, you can contribute to your extended family and increase the survival of your progeny. This can increase population size, and it can happen quite quickly.																								The finding, published in this weeks issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, supports the so-called grandma hypothesis, Caspari said. This credits grandmothers with helping to raise their extended families, contributing to a groups success.																								Caspari and Lee studied 768 different human fossils, including examples of Cro-Magnon, which are early Homo sapiens who lived in Europe, Neanderthals, an earlier type of Homo sapiens that died out about 35,000 years ago, and earlier pre-humans such as Homo erectus and australopithecenes, which date back as long ago as 3 million years.																								What we looked at is differences in the proportion of people who were living to be older, Caspari said. Some individuals may have lived to great age, but at some point humans as a species began living longer on average than other primates and Caspari and Lee wanted to find out when and why. They divided the fossils into two groups  adults of reproductive age, which they settled on as 15 years, and adults that lived to be twice as old, 30, based on tooth wear.																								In primitive societies, people are often grandparents at 30, Caspari pointed out. 																								We live in a society that is so geared towards younger people. It is nice to realise that it might be older people that make us human after all, Caspari said.

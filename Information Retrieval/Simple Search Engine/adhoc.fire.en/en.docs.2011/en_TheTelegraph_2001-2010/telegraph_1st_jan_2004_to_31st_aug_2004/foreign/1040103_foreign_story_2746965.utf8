 															- US plans to set up baghdad embassy with 3,000 staff				 	 A US soldier guards his base while Iraqi civil defence corps troops make their way during a morning patrol in Tikrit on Friday. (AFP) 																								Washington, Jan. 2 (Reuters): In preparation for ending its occupation of Iraq, the US is making plans to create the largest US diplomatic mission in the world in Baghdad, with a staff of more than 3,000, the Washington Post reported today.																								The transition would mark the hand-over of responsibility for dealing with Iraq from the Pentagon to the state department, which will then help oversee the next steps in creating Iraqs first freely elected democratic government.																								The real challenge for the new embassy, so to speak, or the new presence will be helping the Iraqi people get ready for their full elections and full constitution the following year, secretary of state Colin . Powell told the Post in an interview this week. Thats going to be a major effort on our part.																								One of the first steps would be resuming diplomatic relations between Washington and Baghdad. Although the US is the occupying power in Iraq, the two have not formally resumed relations, which were severed after Iraqs 1990 invasion of Kuwait.																								The US embassy in Egypt has a larger presence, more than 7,000 personnel. But this number includes many non-diplomats from other US agencies, including, for example, two members of the US Library of Congress who collect foreign books.																								The Baghdad embassy will have the largest US diplomatic staff anywhere in the world, the Post quoted state department officials as saying. The US is tentatively planning to build a new embassy, it added, with construction expected to take three to five years. Chopper downed																								A US soldier was killed and another was wounded in a helicopter crash in central Iraq today while ethnic tensions flared again in the oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk, leading to at least one death.																								A policeman who witnessed the helicopter crash, which occurred about 50 km west of Baghdad, near Falluja, said the aircraft was shot down, although the US military could not immediately confirm that.																								We were in a joint patrol with US troops to remove land mines and I saw a helicopter hovering in the sky which was hit by a missile, policeman Mohammad Abdul Aziz said. It was split into two and went down in flames.																								A US military spokeswoman said the helicopter, an OH-58 observation chopper, came down around 0950 GMT near Falluja but had no further details. She said the cause of the crash was under investigation. Reuters television pictures showed pieces of the aircraft scattered across a ploughed field. US forces cordoned off the area as helicopters flew overhead keeping watch. 																								In Kirkuk, at least one man was killed and another was wounded overnight as police and protesters clashed in the ethnically divided city, where Kurds, Arabs and Turkish-speaking Turkmen are all bidding for more political say.

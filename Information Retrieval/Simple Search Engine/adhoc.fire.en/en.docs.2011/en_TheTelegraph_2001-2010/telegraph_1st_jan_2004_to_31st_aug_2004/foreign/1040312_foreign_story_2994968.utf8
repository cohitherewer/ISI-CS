																								New York, March 11 (Reuters): A former congressional aide was arrested today on charges she gave secret information to Iraqi intelligence agents and was paid $10,000 for her services, federal prosecutors said.																								Susan Lindauer, 41, was arrested in Takoma Park, Maryland, on charges in an indictment filed in a federal court in Manhattan. She is expected to appear in court in Baltimore today.																								Lindauer worked in 1996 as an aide to former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, an unsuccessful candidate for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, according to congressional records. She also worked for other lawmakers in the past.																								The charges against Lindauer are included in a case against two sons of a former Iraqi diplomat. The indictment against them, filed last year, charges Wisam Noman al-Anbuke and his brother, Raed Roman al-Anbuke, with passing information to Iraqi intelligence agents about Iraqi dissidents living in the US.																								The heart of the case against Lindauer focuses on activity that took place between October 1999 and March 2002, a year before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was ousted by a US-led invasion. She is also accused of having meetings last year with an undercover FBI agent she believed was a member of the Libyan intelligence service who was seeking to support resistance groups in post-war Iraq. The charges state she kept in touch with the undercover agent via e-mail until last month.																								Lindauer is charged with conspiracy, acting as an unregistered foreign government agent and taking money from a government that supports terrorism. If convicted of all counts, she could face 25 years in prison. 																								The two other defendants previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. Court documents spell their surname as al-Anbuke, but a defence lawyer said the men go by al-Anbuge.																								The brothers are the sons of Rokan al-Anbuke, who was deputy permanent representative to Iraqs UN mission until August 1, 2000, when he returned to Iraq. His sons remained in New York.																								The indictment accuses them of conspiring to act as agents of the Iraqi Intelligence Service, and failing to register with the justice department as foreign government agents.																								Prosecutors said the intelligence service had helped carry out terrorist operations, including an attempted assassination of former US President George Bush and attempted bombings during the 1991 Gulf War. The Iraqi service has also located, intimidated and killed Iraqi defectors and dissidents living abroad, they said.

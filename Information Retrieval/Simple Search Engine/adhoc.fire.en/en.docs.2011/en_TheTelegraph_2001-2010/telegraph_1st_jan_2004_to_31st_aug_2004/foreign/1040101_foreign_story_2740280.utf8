The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Eye on the skies as party rolls
 London, Dec. 31 (Reuters):  Warplanes patrolled American skies and international airlines  placed sky marshals on some flights today as fears of a  terrorist attack cast a giant shadow over New Years celebrations  across the globe.																								Millions of New Year revellers were expected to throng city centres across the world today under a security umbrella raised amid fears of a terrorist attack, possibly involving aircraft. Some international airlines, responding to a US warning of a possible attack by Islamist militants, placed armed sky marshals on flights. Cities from Rome to New York imposed flight restrictions and airports stepped up security.																								US authorities, who have said they fear an attack bigger than the September 11, 2001 strikes that killed some 3,000, restricted flights over Las Vegas and New York, where over a million people are expected to gather for the countrys two biggest street parties.																								Warplanes will be on high alert to intercept any errant flight. In Pasadena, California, where thousands will attend American footballs annual New Years Day Rose Bowl game, police will use electronic sensors to detect any biological attack.																								We will have in play...not only temporary flight restrictions over cities, but we will have aviation patrolling the skies on alert, US homeland security secretary Tom Ridge told CBS television.																								Police in Britain, one of Washingtons chief allies in its war on terror and a target of recent guerrilla attacks in Turkey, said they remained on high alert but saw no specific threat in coming days. 																								In Jakarta, police said they feared fugitive Islamic militants could launch attacks on New Years eve festivities. Indonesia, predominantly Muslim with a sizeable Christian minority, has been the scene of several major attacks in recent years, including an explosion in October 2002 at a Bali nightclub favoured by foreigners that killed 202.																								But protecting mass gatherings against infiltration by individual bombers or by attacks from the air is an enormous task, even with close international cooperation.																								Britains aircraft pilots body said it had reached agreement with one airline on rules governing armed air marshals.																								We remain opposed to the whole concept of bringing sky marshal guns on board an aircraft. This will not make flights more safe, said Jim McAuslan, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), in a statement.																								BALPA said it would cooperate with security measures announced after six Air France flights between Paris and Los Angeles were cancelled last week amid security fears. French transport ministry state secretary Dominique Bussereau said guards had been posted on some Air France transatlantic flights. Armed guards are not the rule, but now we have an exception reserved for certain very specific situations, he said.																								Sweden, however, said that in the event of a serious threat, it would rather ground flights than allow armed guards on to airliners. Germany says sky marshals fly on all transatlantic flights and other unspecified routes. Action by Italian police demonstrated fears were not limited to al Qaida militants Washington says were behind the September 11 attacks. They blocked all mail sent from the Bologna region addressed to EU bodies after a spate of letter bombs blamed on anarchists.

 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Indian caught in crossfire
 K.P. NAYAR 				 	 Indian truck driver Mohammad Shahid who was released by his Iraqi captors on Sunday. (Reuters)Washington, April 12: An Indian truck driver, who was held hostage in Iraq as the fighting flared, has been released, according to information reaching here.																								Neither his name nor other details such as his nativity were officialy announced, but Reuters identified the man as Mohammad Shahid. His nationality was confirmed from his passport during a line up of nine released hostages for a videotape sent to the Arabic TV station, al Jazeera.																								In New Delhi, the ministry of external affairs had no information about the man and the Indian embassy in Baghdad could not be reached because of poor communication.																								The Indian was part of a group of nine hostages released by insurgents today in response to an appeal from the Association of Muslim Scholars. The group was made up of three Pakistanis, two Turkish nationals, one Filipino, a Nepali and a Briton, in addition to the Indian.																								The tape contained a message from the hostage-takers that we have released them in response to a call from the Association of Muslim Scholars... after we were sure that they will not deal with the occupation forces again.																								The Briton was a contractor, but the other eight were all truck drivers delivering supplies for the occupation forces.																								Their capture represents a new tactic by Iraqi insurgents aimed at sapping supply lines to the US-led coalition. A large number of Indian companies in Kuwait have won multi-million dollar sub-contracts for supplying the troops in Iraq and the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA).																								Trucking companies ferrying supplies to Iraq from Kuwait in the south and Turkey in the north have employed Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and nationals of countries which have neither supported the war nor provided troops for the US-led coalition. Supply contractors have also employed people from such countries to go into Iraq.																								Such a strategy has been based on the assumption that nationalities which do not belong to the coalition of the willing in Iraq would be less vulnerable to threats from insurgents. So far this has, indeed, been the case.																								But the latest surge in violence appears to have changed that and Iraqis opposed to the Anglo-American occupation are targeting precisely those employed from countries like India, Pakistan, Germany and China which did not support the war as part of a plan to derail supplies to the CPA and the occupation forces.																								Although three Japanese and some Americans continue to be hostages, the latest to be siezed are seven Chinese from Fujian province. A Palestinian and a Canadian of Syrian origin are also among those taken hostage last week. 																								Today, insurgent gunmen attacked several supply convoys and targeted roads which are used by CPA to make provisions and reinforce the occupation forces. Last week, eight South Koreans, variously described as aid workers or evangelists were allowed to go after they were held by an insurgent group for a few hours. 																								Seven civilian contractors working for a Halliburton subsidiary are also missing. However, a member of Iraqs governing council said today that 12 hostages had been freed and he was hopeful all remaining hostages would be freed later.

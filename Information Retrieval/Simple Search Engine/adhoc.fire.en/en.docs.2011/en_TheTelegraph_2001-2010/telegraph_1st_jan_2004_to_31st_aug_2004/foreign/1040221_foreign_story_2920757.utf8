 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Vodka language test backfires
																								Warsaw, Feb. 20 (Reuters): A Polish vodka maker has put the old adage that alcohol loosens the tongue to the test, offering clients a free English language course with each bottle.																								But what was an attempt to boost vodka sales has landed Polmos Zielona Gora firm in the dock. The governments Agency for Solving Alcohol Problems accused the firm, controlled by Swedens state-owned Vin amp; Spirit, of inducing young people to drink by questionable marketing practices.																								They are breaking the law, which prohibits advertising alcohol by making associations with culture, science or success in life. We will take them to court unless they stop, Renata Durda, a director at the agency, said. Polmos vowed to press ahead with its campaign, under which it attaches DVDs to bottles of its flagship Luksusowa vodka brand.																								First of all, its not an advertising campaign but a sales support campaign. Others attach bottles of juice to bottles, we sell them with an English DVD. Whats wrong with that?, said the Polmos chief executive. 																								Ryszard Jakubiuk.

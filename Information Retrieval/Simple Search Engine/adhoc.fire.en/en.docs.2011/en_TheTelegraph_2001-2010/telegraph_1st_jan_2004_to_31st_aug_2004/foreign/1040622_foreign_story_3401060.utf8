 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Militants boast of Saudi help
 MEGAN K. STACK 				 	 Former Saudi policeman Saleh Mohammad al-Oufi who has taken over as leader of the al Qaida network on the Arabian peninsula, according to Saudi- based daily Asharq al-Awsat. (AFP)																								Riyadh, June 21: Islamic militants used police uniforms and cars provided by collaborators among the Saudi security forces to erect a phoney traffic checkpoint and kidnap an American engineer, according to an account posted on a radical Islamist website yesterday. 																								The body of Paul M. Johnson, the engineer and long-time Saudi resident who was beheaded on Friday, still hasnt been found. The notion that security agents aided in his kidnapping stirred lingering suspicions among diplomats and analysts here that Islamist insurgents have penetrated Saudi government agencies. 																								Weve been concerned about that for some time; weve always assumed there has been leakage, said a western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. But then you have to figure out which units. Theres no way of telling how deep it goes.																								Saudi officials staunchly deny that the government has been infiltrated by what the Islamist website called cooperators who are true to their religion in the security apparatus.																								I think thats in the realm of fiction, Adel Jubeir, a senior adviser to Crown Prince Abdullah, told CNNs Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer yesterday. The notion that our security services are infiltrated by the terrorists really doesnt hold. If that were the case, they would not be going after soft targets, they would be going after government installations.																								Police uniforms are easy to buy, Jubeir pointed out. And although suicide bombers tried to drive an explosive-laden vehicle that resembled a police car into a housing compound last year, Jubeir said the car had been disguised by militants. 																								Nevertheless, the Islamist website boasts of low-level cooperation from government agents tapped into a common suspicion. Even some Saudis quietly express fears that their security forces have been compromised by militant sympathisers, although virtually nobody will say so publicly. 																								After Johnson disappeared more than a week ago, his abandoned car turned up near Imam Mohammed bin Saud University. According to some reports, the car had been booby-trapped. But it hasnt been clear how militants had managed to capture him. 																								In the online article, the militants claimed they erected a fake checkpoint on a road close to the university. They stopped Johnsons care, drugged him, loaded him into another vehicle and drove off. 																								The radicals account of the kidnapping appeared in Voice of the Jihad, an online magazine published by the group calling itself al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Abdelaziz Muqrin, the organisations leader, was gunned down by security forces on Friday, the same day the militants announced they had killed Johnson.

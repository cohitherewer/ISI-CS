 ANTON LA GUARDIA, AHMED RASHID AND ALEC RUSSELL  Vienna/Lahore/Washington, Feb.  6: Intelligence agencies and nuclear inspectors are  racing to close a vast international nuclear supermarket  that has secretly supplied Iran, Libya, North Korea and  perhaps several other countries for more than a decade.																								The extent of the Pakistan-based network became clear last night as a leading UN official said there was still an urgent need to dry up the source.																								The supermarket, run by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of the Pakistani bomb, was the most dangerous phenomenon in proliferation for many years, said Mohammed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UNs nuclear watchdog. This is an area where we cannot act alone. We need the co-operation of intelligence agencies and governments. I expect everybody to chip in.																								Despite Khans confession that he was at the centre of the operation, few believe that the uncovering of the network will stop the lucrative black market in nuclear designs, technology and components. Western intelligence agencies face alarming uncertainties. Are similar networks in operation? Which countries have already bought Pakistani nuclear technology?																								American sources said there were suspicions Syria or Saudi Arabia were clients of Khans network. They said Iran appeared to have bought more technology than it declared.																								Middlemen bought parts from half a dozen countries: Japan, Malaysia, South Africa, Germany and at least two other European countries. The components were ostensibly meant for industrial purposes but were then assembled to make gas centrifuges to enrich uranium for atomic bomb-making. Experts compared the process to selling designs for a kit car and providing help in buying the parts around the world.																								George Tenet, the director of the CIA, said the credit for uncovering the network belonged to his organisation and MI6, using old-fashioned espionage techniques. 																								First we discovered the extent of the hidden network, he said. We tagged the proliferators. We detected the network stretching across four continents offering its wares to countries such as North Korea and Iran. Working with our British colleagues, we pieced together the picture of the network, revealing its subsidiaries, client lists, front companies, agents and manufacturing plants on three continents.																								Despite the growing scale of the revelations, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf pardoned Khan yesterday after his public confession to unauthorised proliferation activities.																								Islamabad declared the scandal over, sticking to its claim that Khan had acted on his own, rather than with Pakistani military co-operation, as is widely suspected. 																								Musharraf said he would not hand any documents about the scandal to UN inspectors. This is a sovereign country, he said. No documents will be given. No independent investigation will take place here.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Ricks Cafe, in Casablanca
At the gin joint: Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart 																								Casablanca, June 27 (Reuters): You must remember this...																								Those familiar with the 1942 film with the same name as Moroccos biggest city know that much of the action centres on a gin-joint known as Ricks, a place of intrigue where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman reignite lost love.																								Most of the film was shot in a Hollywood studio and visitors arriving in Casablanca hoping to savour the atmosphere of the Cafe Americain were disappointed. Now legend has met reality. After 60 years of renovation, says owner Kathy Kriger, Ricks Cafe has re-opened.																								An entrepreneur turned US diplomat, Kriger fell in love with Morocco where she worked as commercial counsellor for the US Consulate in Casablanca, the countrys economic hub. Wanting to stay on when her post ended in 2001, she toyed with the idea of opening a Ricks Cafe to honour the film in which Bogart plays bar owner Rick Blaine. 																								I couldnt believe no one had done it before, she said.																								In October 2001, the idea stopped being a daydream and became a mission. After 9/11 I just felt like Morocco needed this for its international image, said Oregon-born Kriger. 																								And when Islamist suicide bombers bankrolled by al Qaida hit Casablanca in May last year, she was all the more determined. 																								Instead of making a replica of the cafe in the Oscar-winning Casablanca, Kriger chose to instill the essence and ambience of the era. Moroccans who remember how cosmopolitan and sophisticated the old Casablanca they knew was thank me for it, she said. What we got is actually better than the movie.																								Ricks Cafe, which opened in March, offers a blend of sophistication and friendliness with the clientele a mix of Moroccan business people and members of the expatriate Western community. But we also have a middle-class, sort of yuppie clientele, young people who have no idea about the film but just love the place, Kriger said.																								Situated on the edge of Casablancas old city overlooking the fishing port, Krigers cafe is in a remodelled three-level residence built in traditional Moroccan style with rooms around an open courtyard. Every Sunday night, Casablanca is shown on a large television screen on the second level. 																								Tucked between the piano and the bar, two leather armchairs, a chessboard and a reserved sign is Krigers private table and where shed put Bogart if he were to walk through the door. Kriger lives on the top floor, as Rick did. 																								Even the piano was carefully selected, a genuine relic from the 1940s. Patrons clearly enjoy telling pianist Issam Chaaba, from Rabat, to play it again, Issam.

 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Brad ready for mid-life crisis
 Brad Pitt (top) and Jennifer Aniston Los Angeles, May 4 (Reuters): While the tabloids speculate on the future of his marriage, Brad Pitt says he knows theres a mid-life crisis on its way and that he is not sure it really is in our nature to be with someone for the rest of our lives.																								In an interview yesterday in the new issue of Vanity Fair, Pitt said he and his wife Jennifer Aniston, always made a pact, that well see where this thing is going.																								Pitt added in the interview with contributing editor Leslie Bennetts, You keep going as long as you keep growing. When that dies, we do. But it constantly surprises me. Just when you think youve gotten all you can out of it, you get knocked upside the head ... Its complicated but thats what keeps it interesting.																								Pitt, 40, who stars as Achilles in Troy, which opens on May 14, said he knew that he would some day face a mid-life crisis, Im sure there are some rude awakenings yet to come. But I like it like that. I like the unknown. Its just more vibrant that way. 																								Im not a big proponent of happiness. I think its highly overrated, Pitt said, adding, I think misery is underrated. Theres so much value in that. You cant have one without the other.																								The actor compared his wife, Friends star Anniston, to a magnet that everyone crowds around but added, Neither of us wants to be the spokesman for happy marriage, for coupledom.																								The interview was conducted before gossip surfaced in tabloid newspapers about an alleged romance between him and Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a movie about a bored married couple who find they are assassins hired to kill each other.

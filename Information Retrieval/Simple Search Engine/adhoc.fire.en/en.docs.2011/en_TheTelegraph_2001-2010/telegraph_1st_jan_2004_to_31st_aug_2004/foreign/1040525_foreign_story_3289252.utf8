 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Homers The Iliad compressed for GeNext
				 	 Brad Pitt in a scene from Troy. (Reuters)London, May 24 (Reuters): Homers ancient Greek poem The Iliad, the basis for Hollywood blockbuster Troy, has been compressed for a new generation too lazy to see the film let alone read the 24-book epic that runs to over 15,000 lines.																								 The first five books of the centuries-old tale, set in the final year of the Trojan War  which began when Trojan Paris snatched Helen (the face that launched a thousand ships) from Greece  are now available in the language people use when sending instant messages, Microsoft said today. 																								Book Two is reduced to just 24 words of messenger speak, losing some of the lyricism of the original.																								Agamemnon hd a dream: Troy not defended. Ordered attack! But Trojans knew they were coming were prepared. Achilles sat sulking in his tent.																								The translation, designed to publicise Microsofts messenger product, is not written in Homers dactylic hexameters but it does use emoticons  little faces or images  to emphasise intense moments.																								Troy, which stars Brad Pitt as Achilles, is a freewheeling adaptation of The Iliad. Scriptwriter David Benioff said that he had to cram the 10 years of the Greek war against Troy into two hours and 40 minutes.																								The author agreed that he had taken liberties in his 120-page script, in particular with Agamemnon, who is killed by the Trojan woman Briseis, instead of, as in the original, by his wife, seeking vengeance.

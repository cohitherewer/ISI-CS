 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Alcoholism study boosted by gene find
 Washington, Jan. 15 (Reuters):  Researchers said yesterday they had found a gene that seems  to put people more at risk of alcoholism, but said they  cannot yet explain how it works.																								The study of more than 260 families showed that several different changes in the gene, called GABRG3, were linked with the risk of becoming an alcoholic. The gene is a receptor, or molecular doorway, for gamma-amino butyric acid, a message-carrying chemical, or neurotransmitter. The findings, published in the  January issue of Alcoholism: Clinical amp; Experimental  Research, do not suggest there is an alcoholism gene,  said Dr Danielle Dick, an assistant professor of psychiatry  at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis  who led the study. But now researchers can watch people  with particular versions of the gene and see what other  factors contribute to becoming an alcoholic. It is likely  that many genes that influence alcoholism act through indirect  pathways, he added.

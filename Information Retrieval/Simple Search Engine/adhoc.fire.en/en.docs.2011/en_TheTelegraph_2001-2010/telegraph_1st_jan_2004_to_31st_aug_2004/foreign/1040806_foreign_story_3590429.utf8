 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Couples bid to save bird by not smoking
London, Aug. 5 (Reuters): A British couple booked themselves into a clinic to quit smoking after the vet said it was the only way to save their beloved sick parrot.																								Kevin Barclay and Sharon Wood gave up a 50-cigarette-a-day habit to save their Amazon orange-winged parrot JJ, said the vet, Glen Cousquer of the South Beech Veterinary Surgery in Essex, southeastern England.																								One of the key things that we need to get right with parrots generally is air quality, he said.																								This particular bird presented with very severe respiratory problems. 																								The owners were instructed to do everything they could to improve the birds environment.																								I think I must have shaken the owners up quite badly, because the next time I saw them they actually had booked themselves into one of these anti-smoking clinics and were determined to stop. Theyve gone five weeks, he said.																								JJ, he said,is doing really well. It is certainly going to improve his life expectancy.																								It may help the owners, too.

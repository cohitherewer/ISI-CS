 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Pervez backs woman
																								Islamabad, Jan. 15 (Reuters): A 24-year-old Pakistani woman threatened with death after marrying without her familys permission got special protection today on the orders of President Pervez Musharraf.																								Shaista Almani eloped with Balakh Sher Mahar in August in defiance of tribal customs in which marriages are arranged by the partners families. Local media said the couple were forced to flee after returning as man and wife to their home town of Pannu Aqil in the southern province of Sindh when Almani received death threats.																								Some news reports said Mahar had divorced Almani under pressure from his family but her life was still in danger. The official APP news agency said Musharraf had ordered Sindh authorities to take all possible measures to ensure her safety. The President also directed the provincial government to take action against those who are harassing Almani, it said. Every year, hundreds of women  are killed in feudal rural Pakistan for offences deemed  to have offended family honour or Islam, including adultery  and marrying without the consent of their families. It was  the second intervention by Musharraf in less than two months  in cases relating to women. In November, he ordered a probe  into whether a 23-year-old woman was the victim of a so-called  honour killing in central Pakistan.

 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Terror not priority for Ashcroft: 9/11 panel
				 	 John Ashcroft Washington, April 13 (Reuters):  The commission on the September 11, 2001, attacks today  broadly criticized the justice department and the FBI for  failing to meet the threat from al Qaida and said Attorney  General John Ashcroft did not see counterterrorism as a  top priority before it was too late.																								In its latest report detailing security breakdowns throughout the government, the commission issued two lengthy staff reports analyzing the failure to prevent the hijacked airliner attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people.																								One report drew attention to a May 10 justice department document that set out priorities for 2001. The top priorities cited were reducing gun violence and combating drug trafficking. There was no mention of counterterrorism.																								When Dale Watson, the head of the counterterrorism division, saw the report, he almost fell out of his chair, the report said. 																								The FBIs new counterterrorism strategy was not a focus of the justice department in 2001.																								Then-acting FBI director Thomas Pickard said he appealed to Ashcroft for more money for counterterrorism but on September 10, 2001, one day before the attacks, Ashcroft rejected the appeal.																								Former FBI director Louis Freeh testified that he sought permission to hire almost 1,900 counterterror linguists, analysts and agents in the previous three years but was allowed to add just 76. 																								Thats not to criticize the US Congress. Its not to criticise the department of justice. It is to focus on the fact that that was not a national priority, Freeh told the commission.

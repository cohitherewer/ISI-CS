 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Chechen widows linked to crashes
 JULIUS STRAUSS																								Moscow, Aug. 28: Russian officials investigating the crashes of two passenger planes have discovered the remains of two Chechen women thought to be Black Widows  suicide bombers given that name because many have lost husbands in the war with Russia.																								Officials have also found traces of explosive in the wreckage of both planes, all but confirming the theory that the jets, which crashed on Tuesday night killing 89, were destroyed by terrorist attacks.																								The loss of the two planes, which blew up three minutes apart, is the first successful attack on passenger aircraft by Islamic extremists since September 11.																								The smaller of the two planes  a Tu-134 which crashed near Tula, south of Moscow, with 44 people on board  was carrying a Chechen woman passenger, identified as Amanta Nagayeva, who bought a ticket an hour before the flight.																								Her body was almost completely vapourised by the bomb but experts found two fragments more than one and a half miles apart. She was the only passenger on the flight whose remains are unclaimed.																								Police records show she was born in 1977 near Vedeno, the home village of a militant Chechen warlord, Shamil Basayev. She lived in Grozny.																								Explosives experts also said they had found traces of the military explosive hexogen in the wreckage of the larger jet, a Tu-154 that broke up near Rostov, killing 46.																								A second Chechen woman, named as S Djerbikhanova, was initially booked on another flight to the Black Sea resort of Sochi which was due to carry more than 300 passengers. During check-in, she changed her ticket to the less popular evening flight.																								Djerbikhanova sat in seat 19F, nine rows from the tail, which is considered the most vulnerable part of the plane. Her body is the only one that remains unclaimed from the Tu-154. There was confusion yesterday about how she was allowed to board.																								A representative of Sibir, the airline, said: We were surprised to discover a complete absence of any of her personal details. It seems she simply gave her name when buying the ticket... How could she have passed passport control? That is not our responsibility, but that of the airport. The attacks are deeply embarrassing for President Vladimir Putin who swept to power on a pledge to eradicate Chechen militants.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

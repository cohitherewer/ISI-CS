 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Security law to tackle Iraq clashes unveiled
																								Baghdad, July 7 (Reuters): Iraqs interim government announced a new security law giving itself wider counter-insurgency powers today as gunmen battled US troops and Iraqi forces in the heart of Baghdad.																								Almost within earshot of the clashes, justice minister Malek al-Hassan said the widely anticipated National Safety Law enabled the government to impose emergency measures such as curfews, searches and detentions in defined areas for periods of up to 60 days. We are aware that it could curb some freedoms, Hassan said, but he added that the law was the first in the region to impose a state of emergency while protecting citizens rights.																								The law was needed to stop rebels derailing progress towards national elections due by January. Free, public elections will take place on time and no delay will be allowed, Hassan said. As the justice minister spoke, street clashes were raging in central Baghdad. Two US helicopters fired at a building during the fighting in the Haifa Street area, a Reuters photographer said. Black smoke poured from the building after the strikes.																								Announcement of the National Safety Law had been delayed several times as the government, which formally took over from the US-led occupation on June 28, ironed out the details and consulted with American officials. Allawis government has said it also planned to restore the death penalty and offer a temporary amnesty for rebels who fought the Americans.

 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Police lead in Karachi Shia attack
																								Karachi, June 2 (Reuters): The skull of a suspected suicide bomber provided the main lead today for Pakistani police trying to find who was behind an attack on a Shia mosque that killed 20 people this week in Karachi.																								President Pervez Musharraf said he would take a serious decision over the law and order situation in the southern city after the blast on Monday, which followed the killing of a senior Sunni cleric a day earlier. 																								Another suicide bomb attack on a Shia mosque in central Karachi on May 7 killed 24 worshippers.																								Today, the Sindh provincial government ditched three of Karachis top police officers for negligence although thousands of officers had been deployed around city mosques on Monday in anticipation of violence after pro-Taliban cleric Mufti Nizamuuddin Shamzai was gunned down a day earlier.																								Asad Ashraf Malick (Karachis police chief) and two other senior officers were transferred but not dismissed, a police spokesman said. Newspapers speculated that Musharraf might dismiss the Sindh provincial government and impose federal rule through a governor, but officials denied this.

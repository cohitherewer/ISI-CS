 Sunday, February 08, 2004 				 First flu case in US
																								Washington/Bangkok, Feb. 7 (Reuters): The first case of bird flu appeared in the US just as hard-hit Thailand said it hoped to clear the last outbreak of an epidemic that has killed 18 people and decimated poultry flocks across Asia.																								More than 12,000 chickens have been quarantined in the US state of Delaware and are due to be destroyed after they were found to have a strain of the virus which differs from the one that has killed people in Thailand and Vietnam, the Delaware State News reported on its website.																								Delaware secretary of agriculture Michael Scuse told the newspaper the strain found in the US chickens was known as H7. The killer Asian strain was H5N1. We are trying to act as quickly as possible, Scuse told the Delaware State News. We are trying to protect an industry here that is awfully valuable.																								In addition to the destruction of the 12,000 chickens in Delawares Kent county, all farms within two miles of the infected birds will be tested within the next week, Scuse said.																								South Korea, which is battling its own outbreak of the virus, reacted swiftly to reports of the discovery in Delaware, immediately halting imports of US poultry. News of the US outbreak came on the same day the Prime Minister of Thailand  one of the 10 Asian countries hardest hit by the epidemic  said he expected the last outbreak of the virus to be contained within days.																								There is only one red zone, in Bangkok at Lat Krabang. We hope to clear that within one or two days, Thaksin Shinawatra said. Thailand was confident the virus was under control, Thaksin said. 																								Last week, Thailand had more than 140 of the red zones, the 5-km area around a confirmed outbreak within which the government orders the slaughter of all poultry.

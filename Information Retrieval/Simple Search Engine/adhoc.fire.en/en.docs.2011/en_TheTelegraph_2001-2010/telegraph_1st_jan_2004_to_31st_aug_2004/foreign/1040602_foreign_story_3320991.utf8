 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Musharraf plea to stem plunge into barbarism
 Pakistani policemen and journalists run for cover after Shia mourners open fire during clashes in Karachi. (AFP) 																								Islamabad, June 1 (Reuters): A day after a bomb killed 19 Shias in Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf called on the West and Muslims to stop civilisation from falling into an abyss of barbarism.																								Musharraf, a key ally of the US in its war on terror, also urged reform and restructuring of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) saying it had become paralysed in front of present challenges.																								It is imperative that the entire international community collectively addresses the dangers that tend to push human civilisation into the abyss of barbarism, Musharraf told a conference of the OIC in Islamabad.																								Musharraf, who twice escaped attempts on his life late last year, is a target of Islamic militants enraged by his support to the West against Islamic militancy after September 11, 2001 attacks on the US. 																								Lately he has become more forceful in condemning religious extremism at home, only to be answered with more deadly bombings and assassinations of religious figures.																								In May at least 47 Pakistanis, most of them Shias, and three Chinese were killed and more than 200 people wounded, in seven incidents of car bombings, suicide attacks and ambush.																								Musharraf warned Muslims they had to pull themselves out of a pit or western perceptions that Islam was a religion promoting extremism would be perpetuated. We need to infuse life into this body. OIC needs to be restructured, reformed and energised to meet the challenges of the 21st century, he said.																								Musharraf called the West, particularly the US, to quickly resolve political disputes confronting Muslims to remove perceptions in the Islamic world that the West was bent upon subjugating them.																								Most of those living under foreign occupation, be it Palestine, Kashmir or Iraq, are Muslims, he said. He warned the world was headed the wrong way. The emerging political contours do not kindle any hope for enhancing international cooperation for peace and prosperity, for the rule of law and justice, for combating poverty and social evils, or pursuing the path of accommodation and moderation.				 	 Musharraf Pakistani policemen and journalists run for cover after Shia mourners open fire during clashes in Karachi. (AFP)																								Shia protest																								Angry Shias clashed with police during funerals today for most of the 20 people killed in the apparently sectarian suicide bombing of a mosque in Karachi.																								Riot police fired tear gas and live rounds into the air to drive back crowds of thousands gathered for the funerals. 																								Some mourners pelted them with stones and torched nearby vehicles.																								We have no faith in police and rangers because they failed to protect our mosques, senior Shia cleric Hasan Zafar Naqvi said. We demand that the government deploy the army to ensure their security and safety.																								The blast wounded at least 50 people, some seriously, and three Shias died later in clashes with police. It appeared to be another in a spate of tit-for-tat sectarian violence in the volatile port city, coming less than 24 hours after the killing of Mufti Nizamuddin Shamzai, a senior cleric from the majority Sunni sect.																								It was the second bloody attack on a Shia mosque in Karachi in less than a month. A suspected Sunni suicide bomber killed 24 people on May 7.

 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Bishops rebuke Blair
																								London, June 30 (Reuters): Britains most senior Anglican churchmen delivered a harsh rebuke to Prime Minister Tony Blair today over the behaviour of coalition troops in Iraq.																								In a letter on behalf of all the Church of Englands bishops, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York said the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners was deeply damaging and would harm the credibility and moral authority of Western governments.																								The apparent breach of international law in relation to the treatment of Iraqi detainees has been deeply damaging, they wrote in the letter printed in todays Times newspaper.																								The appearance of double standards inevitably diminishes the credibility of Western governments with the people of Iraq and of the Islamic world more generally. A Downing Street spokesperson confirmed the Prime Minister had received the letter, saying: The archbishops are entitled to their views and the Prime Minister will reply in due course.																								The US is investigating a series of allegations of abuse, including sexual humiliation, of prisoners by the US military in Iraqs Abu Ghraib jail. A series of gruesome photographs showing prisoners being humiliated and treated like dogs have been published in American and world media. Britain is also investigating alleged abuse of Iraqi detainees by its troops, including deaths of Iraqis in UK custody in the south of the country.																								In their letter, drawn up after a meeting of more than 100 archbishops and bishops last week, the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and Archbishop of York David Hope warned Blair the sense of moral shock at prisoner abuse was wearing off. More fundamentally still, there is a wider risk to our own integrity if we no longer experience a sense of moral shock at the enormity of what appears to have been inflicted on those who were in the custody of Western security forces, they wrote.																								The credibility of coalition partners in advocating respect for the law and the peaceful resolution of disputes will, we fear, be undermined unless the necessary moral authority is clearly demonstrated at every level.																								Foreign secretary Jack Straw said he had a very high regard for the churchmens views.																								Our horror and rejection of what happened in Abu Ghraib prison  which is run by the US, I may say, not the UK  is no different and no less profound than that of the bishops, he added.

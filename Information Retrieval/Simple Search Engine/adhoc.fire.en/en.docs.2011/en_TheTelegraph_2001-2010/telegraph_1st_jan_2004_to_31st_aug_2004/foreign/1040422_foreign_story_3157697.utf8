(Reuters)																								Kuala Lumpur, April 21 (Reuters): Using local tribesmen to search for al Qaida and Taliban militants along Pakistans rugged border with Afghanistan will build local trust and help long-term development, Pakistans foreign minister said today.																								The Islamabad government, its army bloodied in last months clashes with foreign militants in the South Waziristan tribal region, gave tribal leaders a deadline yesterday by which to get rid of fighters still hiding there.																								But with tribal leaders calling off the hunt and the government saying it wouldnt insist on the deadline, foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri brushed off suggestions the softer line was flawed.																								We want to make it clear to the people of the tribal areas that the Pakistan army is not rushing in, Kasuri said in an interview.																								The army is there, its on guard, but we want to involve the local people also, he said, adding force was always an option. If these people cannot be tackled by the tribals, then the army will do what is necessary, he said, without being specific.																								Pakistan has mounted its biggest campaign to pacify the lawless and largely autonomous tribal region and clear the area of foreign fighters.																								The offensive followed two assassination attempts on President Pervez Musharraf in December, which he linked to militants hiding in the tribal area.																								More than 120 people were killed in a 12-day offensive in the South Waziristan tribal region that ended on March 28.																								Since then, troops have been moving in several places in the rugged region and one intelligence official said a sweep of North Waziristan was now being considered. Kasuri said involving local tribesmen was a positive step to help the areas stability, and ultimately, its economy.																								We are not doing this as a favour to the USA. Its quite clear, we dont want terrorism around because our main problem is how to tackle poverty.

 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Fat and fizz off McDonalds
				 	 A woman serves customers at a McDonalds outlet in Tokyo. (Reuters)New York, March 4 (Agencies): McDonalds Corp, battered by criticism of its fatty foods, said it would eliminate Supersize French fries and soft drinks by the end of the year, part of a swing toward pleasing health-minded customers and simplifying its menu. 																								McDonalds Supersize option, which includes a 7-ounce carton of fries and 42-ounce fountain soda, has been targeted by critics as contributing to a growing obesity crisis in the US where more than half the population is considered overweight or obese.																								McDonalds has also introduced salads, started providing options for yogurt and fruits with meals and introduced fruit and milk meal for children to win new customers.																								The decision has been welcomed by health activists who see their victory in the decision. They blame large fatty potions served by fast food chains for almost half of the US population  from young children to the old  being obese or overweight.																								Mcdonalds said it was making changes to simplify its menu and promote a balanced lifestyle. But, according to McDonalds, not many Supersize French fries were sold. This could be the food chains attempt to counter the impression that it was acting under pressure. 																								Mcdonalds is not the only fast food chain which is eliminating the supersizes. Others are also quietly shelving such sizes or giving choices beyond fast food to avoid criticism.																								The food chain had been sued by people who had blamed their obesity on its food. But the legal suit was thrown out twice by federal courts. 																								It had alleged that the fast food chain did not disclose the risks of eating the high calorie food that it served to its customers.																								A US filmmaker was so intrigued by McDonalds claim its food was nutritious that he ate all his meals at the fast-food giant for a month. 																								The result? Twelve extra kilogrammes, higher cholesterol and an award-winning documentary of his fast-food journey, Super Size Me: A Film of Epic Portions.																								Morgan Spurlock hit the morning TV shows today to promote his film on surviving on a McDonalds diet.

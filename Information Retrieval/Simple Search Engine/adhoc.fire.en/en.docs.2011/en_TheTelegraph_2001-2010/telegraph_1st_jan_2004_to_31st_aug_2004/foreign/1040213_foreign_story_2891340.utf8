 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 UN envoy, Shia cleric agree on Iraq polls
				 	 UN envoy to Iraq Lakhdar Brahimi speaks to journalists in Najaf. (Reuters) Najaf, Feb. 12 (Reuters):  A senior UN envoy said today he had agreed with Iraqs top  Shia leader that elections must be held, but he left open  when and said polls must occur in the best possible conditions. 																								In a separate development, the US commander in West Asia, General John Abizaid, escaped unscathed today when guerrillas fired rocket-propelled grenades at his convoy in Falluja. The US military said it was not clear whether the attackers knew that Abizaid and the local US commander, General Charles Swannack, were in the convoy. Neither they nor other US personnel were hit.																								UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi was speaking after meeting Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani who has called for direct elections before US occupiers hand back sovereignty to Iraqis.																								It was not clear if agreement on the need for polls to be well prepared meant Sistani might be flexible on his call for early elections that would likely favour the Shias who make up around 60 per cent of the population. Washington favours an approach involving regional caucuses selecting delegates and has set a deadline of June 30 to hand over sovereignty, with elections only in 2005.																								Recent suicide bombings and attacks on US troops have deepened fears about security at an election that could leave civilians vulnerable at polling stations. Two suicide bombings this week killed 100 Iraqis, mostly police and army recruits. A UN team led by Brahimi is touring Iraq to assess the feasibility of early direct elections.																								Sistani is insistent on holding the elections and we are with him on this 100 per cent because elections are the best means to enable any people to set up a state that serves their interest, Brahimi said after two hours of talks with Sistani.																								There was no immediate comment from Sistanis office.																								We are in agreement with the Sayyid (Sistani) that these elections should be prepared well and should take place in the best possible conditions so that it would bring the results which the Sayyid wants and the people of Iraq and the UN, Brahimi said.																								Brahimi is due to leave Iraq tomorrow, a senior US-led administration official has said. The rest of the UN team has started touring provinces, and UN secretary-general Kofi Annan is expected to give his opinion on the elections on February 21.																								Sistani has been holding meetings with members of Iraqs governing council on the countrys political future after 24 years of dictatorship under toppled leader Saddam Hussein. Brahimi, an Algerian, met the reclusive cleric in the holy city of Najaf the day after a suicide bomb in Baghdad killed 47 people at an army recruitment centre. 																								A similar attack on Tuesday killed 53 people lining up for jobs at a police station.

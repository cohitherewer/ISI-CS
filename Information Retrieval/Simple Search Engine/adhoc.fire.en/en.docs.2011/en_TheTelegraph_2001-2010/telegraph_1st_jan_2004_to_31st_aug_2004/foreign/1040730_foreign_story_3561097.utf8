				 	 Keira Knightley																								London, July 29: Residents of a picturesque town are facing weeks of traffic delays when filming starts for a new version of Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley.																								Local tourism chiefs are delighted Pemberley Productions is using the Lincolnshire town of Stamford to shoot its version of the Jane Austen classic. Its a boost for the area, they said.																								However, local police have warned that the production, starring the Bend It Like Beckham actress who is currently appearing as Guinevere in King Arthur, will mean weeks of delays for drivers.																								The film company wants to recreate the 1790s in the town by erecting a covered walkway. Traffic flow will be restricted until the road is closed completely at the beginning of September for final preparations and filming.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

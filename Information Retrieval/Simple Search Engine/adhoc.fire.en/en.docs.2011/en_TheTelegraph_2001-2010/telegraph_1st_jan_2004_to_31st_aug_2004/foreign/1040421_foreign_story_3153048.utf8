 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Brad glad he stopped smoking 
				 	 Brad PittBerlin, April 20 (Reuters): Brad Pitt said today he reluctantly quit smoking for months of intense physical training to prepare for his role as Greek hero Achilles in the film Troy but admitted he was now glad he kicked the habit.																								In an interview with the German magazine Cinema before the May release of the film in the US and Germany, Pitt said he spent many unpleasant months working out with a fitness trainer to build up muscles to play the legendary warrior.																								I had to quit smoking, Pitt said when asked about the hardest part of the getting ready for the film about the Trojan war. Im now happy about it because these things were killing me. But at first I was really missing my cigarettes. The withdrawal was so hard that I was ready to kill  which was actually helpful for the role I was playing, he said.																								Pitt, who stars in the Wolfgang Petersen film adapted from Homers epic poem The Iliad, said he did not at all enjoy his physical preparations for the production about the siege of Troy by united Greek forces.

 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Britains Di debacle
				 	 The Princess Diana memorial in London. (Reuters)																								London, Aug. 4 (Reuters): First there was the Millennium Dome, a vast London complex that swallowed nearly a billion pounds, attracted barely half its visitor target and now stands empty.																								Then came the Millennium Bridge over the Thames, also meant to celebrate the new century but with one snag: it wobbled.																								Now  in Britains latest construction farce  a new 3.6 million ($6.6 million) fountain memorial to Princess Diana is lying drained and fenced off in a London park after problems with leaves, flooding and scraped knees.																								Its bloody ridiculous, moaned English pensioner Alan Short, peering through the fence on a hot day in Londons Hyde Park.																								The first thing any beginners book will tell you about water features is: Dont put it near trees, so look where they put it, he said, gesturing at trees all around and inside the circular stone chute round which water is intended to flow. 																								After some embarrassing bureaucratic delays and squabbling between designers, the Diana memorial was unveiled amid great fanfare on July 6 in the presence of Queen Elizabeth.																								A snaking 210 metre-long sculpture with water emerging at the apex to part and flow in two separate streams, it was supposed to double up as a childrens play area, reflecting Dianas effervescent nature and outreach work.																								I congratulate those who have created the memorial before us. I thank both the design team for the imagination which they have brought to this project and those who have realised their concept with such care and craftsmanship, the Queen saidin a nationally broadcast speech beside the fountain. 																								Within hours of those words, however, storms hit England and flooded the fountain. A week later, a pump blocked and again the memorial was closed for repairs.																								Litter and dogs also dirtied the fountain. Then, in a final straw, three people  including a young boy  slipped and hurt themselves on the algae-covered stone while playing in water. That prompted The Royal Parks authority to close the fountain indefinitely while solutions were sought.																								Britons are dismayed, saying it was obvious that sunlight on untreated water was bound to produce slippery algae. 																								Critics also say the fountain saga dishonours the ever-popular Dianas memory and has cost too much.

 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 US plans mother of all bombs
																								Washington, July 16 (Reuters): The US plans to develop an experimental 13,600 kg bomb, the biggest in its inventory, aimed at destroying deeply buried targets beyond the reach of existing bombs, the air force said today.																								The Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP, would be about one-third heavier than the 9525-kg Massive Ordnance Air Blast, MOAB, dropped twice last year inlive tests at a range in Florida.																								The air forces Air Armaments Center at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, said it planned to award a contract for the technology demonstration work as early as mid-September, based on a perceived need for such a weapon. We think a bomb like this could be important in the future for targets that we cant destroy with what we now have, said Jake Swinson of the armaments center, which develops, tests, evaluates and acquires non-nuclear, air-dropped munitions.

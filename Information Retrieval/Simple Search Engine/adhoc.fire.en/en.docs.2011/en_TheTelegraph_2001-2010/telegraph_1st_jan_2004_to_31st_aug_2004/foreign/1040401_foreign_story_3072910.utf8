 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Fresh blast rips through Tashkent district
Tashkent, March 31 (Reuters): A new explosion struck an outlying district of the Uzbek capital Tashkent today, residents reported, but there was no indication of casualties.																								Residents of Karakamysh district in southwest Tashkent said the blast occurred in the early evening. I heard a loud blast about half an hour ago, a man identifying himself as Sardo said outside a hair salon.																								Police were out in force, cordoning off all major roads leading to the district. Russias Interfax news agency had earlier quoted an unnamed source as saying a blast in a southwestern district had caused an unknown number of casualties. 																								It said the number of casualties was being checked but gave no more details.Tashkent has been in the grip of two days of violence which has killed more than 40 people. Authorities blamed radical Islamist groups for a series of explosions on Monday which killed 19 people. Uzbek arrests																								Uzbek security forces arrested 30 people today on suspicion of involvement in violence blamed by the US-backed government on Islamic terrorists but scepticism mounted over official explanations.																								The Central Asian state put soldiers on street corners and tightened border controls after explosions and gun battles in the ancient Silk Road city of Bukhara and the capital Tashkent killed at least 42 people over the last three days.																								Russian news agency Itar-Tass, quoting sources in the state prosecutors office, said the 30 people detained in the past 48 hours had been charged under anti-terrorism laws. 																								A new explosion struck a district of southwest Tashkent on Wednesday evening, residents said, but there was no indication of casualties. Soldiers, clearly nervous, were out in force in the street, many patrolling with dogs. 																								Major roads were cordoned off.Officials in Tashkent were not immediately available to comment. President Islam Karimov, whose motorcade travels along closed streets with a carload of troops aiming semi-automatic weapons at pedestrians, has defended his hardline stance against Muslim dissidents by pointing to the rise of the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan.																								But on the streets of the Uzbek capital, few appeared surprised at the violence and some were openly sympathetic to those behind the attacks. 																								The Uzbek people have had enough. I think this was aimed against the police, not ordinary people, said Guzal, 20, a student in central Tashkent. 																								Ive heard people saying they support this (violence) every time I get on the bus, she said, refusing to give her surname. 																								We dont know anything, said Kolya, a 53-year-old unemployed bricklayer. People are angry. Whoever did these things lacked something, people have nothing to eat.																								Police corruption, extreme poverty and the lack of a legal political opposition have fostered resentment. Uzbekistan keeps its economy going mainly thanks to high cotton and gold prices. 																								This is a kleptocratic government with an economic policy that is causing deepening poverty, Britains ambassador Craig Murray said.

 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 He-man threatens to terminate girly-men
 PETER NICHOLAS  Arnold Schwarzenegger 																								Ontario (California), July 18: Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger mocked his opponents in the California Legislature yesterday as girly-men, and called on voters to terminate them at the polls in November if they dont pass his $103 billion budget. 																								Using tough rhetoric borrowed from his days as a body-builder and movie actor, the governor said that lawmakers are telling lies and are back to their old habits after a post-recall burst of bipartisan collaboration. 																								Legislators, he said at a rally in the food court of the Ontario Mills Mall, are part of a bureaucracy that is out of shape, that is out of date, that is out of touch and that is definitely out of control in Sacramento. 																								He also said: They cannot have the guts to come out there in front of you and say, I dont want to represent you. I want to represent those special interests: the unions, the trial lawyers. I call them girly-men. They should get back to the table and they should finish the budget. 																								Democratic lawmakers, gay and lesbian advocates, and feminist groups bristled over the governors comments, which were greeted with sustained applause by hundreds of people who were invited to the rally through automated phone calls put out by Schwarzeneggers camp. 																								The governor used the girly-man reference twice in a 16-minute speech aimed at pressuring the legislature to pass his budget, now 17 days late. 																								The remark is an apparent reference to an old Saturday Night Live skit parodying Schwarzenegger. Comedians Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon played pumped up bodybuilders  Hans and Franz  with thick Austrian accents. Anyone without a muscled torso was dismissed as a girly-man. 																								Though the four leaders in the Senate and Assembly are men, women chair some of the legislatures most influential committees, ranging from appropriations to energy. 																								Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, a San Francisco Democrat, said he was nonplussed by Schwarzeneggers comment. I dont know what the definition of girly-man is. As opposed to his being a he-man? Burton said. 																								Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, also a San Francisco Democrat, said: Those are the kinds of statements that ought not to come out of the mouth of the governor. He says hes going to terminate members in November? I really dont know what he means by that. Thats not funny any more. 																								Its really painful to hear the governor resort to such blatant homophobia, said Senator Sheila Kuehl, Democrat from Santa Monica. 																								Its an old-fashioned way of talking about gay men as to indicate theyre not as strong. So that part is really painful. And I have to say its really surprising. Its like he cant get his way so he resorts to some kind of name-calling. 					 THE LOS ANGELES TIMES- WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

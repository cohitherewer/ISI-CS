 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 ETA peace talks offer rejected
Madrid, March 21 (Reuters): Basque separatist group ETA called for dialogue with Spains incoming government but pledged to maintain its armed campaign for an independent homeland, according to a new communique published today.																								The Socialists immediately poured cold water on the words of a terrorist organisation. We give no validity to a communique from ETA which is a terrorist group, a spokeswoman said. Sources in the moderate nationalist Basque regional government were also unimpressed.The only thing to say to ETA is that it should abandon violence and leave politics to politicians, one source said.

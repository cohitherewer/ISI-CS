Loose cat Brussels (Reuters): A cat running loose  on a Belgian commercial flight attacked a pilot and forced  the crew to turn back to the airport. The grey cat, named  Gin, broke out of its cage about 20 minutes after take-off  and scurried to the cockpit where it scratched the co-pilot.  The flight with 62 crew and passengers had left Brussels  for Vienna on Monday when the cat, a prized animal that  travels to cat shows around the world, started wandering  around the passenger cabin. The passenger was asleep and  at that point the cat managed to escape the cage, an airline  spokesman said.

(AP/ Reuters)																								Moscow, May 9 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putins top man in Chechnya was assassinated in a bomb attack today that killed at least five others and dealt a huge blow to the Kremlin leaders plans to stamp out rebellion there.																								Moscows senior soldier in the rebel province was also fighting for his life after being seriously wounded by the blast that tore through the VIP section of a stadium where dignitaries were gathered to celebrate the 1945 victory over Nazi Germany.																								After conflicting reports of the death toll, Russian news agencies said six people, including an eight-year-old girl, had been killed and more than 50 people injured.																								The attack, staged on Russias most solemn day, soured the atmosphere of the Victory Day weekend which kicked off on Friday with Putins inauguration for a second four-year term.																								Putin himself announced the death of Akhmad Kadyrov, President of the region and a key player in Kremlin plans to crush the bloody separatist rebellion.																								Kadyrov passed away on May 9 on the day of our national holiday, a shaken-looking Putin said standing alongside Kadyrovs son, Ramzan, in the Kremlin. Kadyrovs close aide Hussein Isayev and two of Kadyrovs bodyguards were also killed, said Interfax news agency, quoting Vladimir Yakovlev, Putins envoy in southern Russia.																								The attack drew immediate condemnation from abroad.																								The attack on the top-security event attended by military and political officials was one of the most audacious on Russian forces and the administration in mainly-Muslim Chechnya since Russian troops reoccupied the area in 1999. The bomb was placed inside a concrete part of the stadium, said Khamid Kadayev, Chechnyas deputy interior minister, speaking on television from the scene of the blast.																								He said this meant it escaped detection in security sweeps. He did not say how the bomb could have been smuggled in, but reconstruction work had been going on at the stadium.

One of his legs was torn off in the blast and he was in critical condition undergoing surgery, Interfax news agency said. Interior ministry officials said an artillery shell, primed to explode, had also been found in a neighbouring stand.																								There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Chechen information and nationalities minister Taus Dzhabrailov pointed the finger at rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov and Moscows most wanted man, Chechen warrior Shamil Basayev. I think that only they could have organised an explosion at such an important occasion. The ground will burn under their feet, he was quoted by Interfax as saying. Itar-Tass news agency quoted an interior ministry spokesman as said five people had been detained in connection with the attack. 																								Victory Day is a national celebration of enormous symbolic importance in Russia and the Grozny ceremonies were mirrored by festivities throughout the country, including a marchpast on Moscows Red Square overseen by Putin.

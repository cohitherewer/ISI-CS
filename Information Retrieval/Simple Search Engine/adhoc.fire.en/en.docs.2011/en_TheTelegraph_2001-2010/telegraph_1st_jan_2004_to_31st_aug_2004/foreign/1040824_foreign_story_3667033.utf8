 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 US soldier for shifting trial
																								Mannheim (Germany), Aug. 23 (Reuters): A US soldier at the centre of the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal asked at a hearing today that his pending court martial be moved away from Baghdad, saying he had no chance of a fair trial there.																								US soldier Charles Graner and three others are accused of sexually humiliating and, in some cases, beating Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. Photos of their tormenting of naked Iraqis aroused worldwide outrage when they emerged in April and sparked criticism that sweeping US anti-terror policies had encouraged the abuses. Graner was the first to appear at the pre-trial hearing at a US army base in Germany.																								His lawyers argued that publicity surrounding events at Abu Ghraib meant it would be impossible to find an unbiased jury among Graners peers.

 KARYN MILLERLondon, Aug. 22: It is the news that sweltering office workers have been waiting for. British scientists have invented a smart window that blocks out the summer heat when the temperature rises too high.																								The window glass is coated with a thin film of chemicals. In normal conditions, the film allows sunlight and heat to pass through, but when the outdoor temperature reaches 25C, light is still allowed through but the infra-red rays that cause heating are shut out.																								Troy Manning, a senior research assistant at the University of Liverpools department of chemistry, who developed the new glass during a three-year research project, said it could offer workers many benefits.																								With this glass, it will be a lot easier to keep offices cool in summer. The laboratory in which we developed it had no air conditioning and was unbearably hot in summer, so I know what it is like for people in offices. It is good to think that this glass could make a difference.																								Manning, who developed the new windows with Ivan Parkin, a professor of chemistry at University College London, said that the smart glass would also save money. Energy costs for a building would be reduced because less air conditioning would be required.																								Conservation groups have estimated that climate control accounts for almost 40 per cent of the energy costs for an average office building. The new coating is made by taking vanadium dioxide, a compound that reflects heat at 70C, and adding tungsten hexachloride. The tungsten alters the vanadium compound, enabling it to repel heat at lower temperatures.																								At the moment, the glass that has been developed by the scientists blocks out heat when the outside temperature is 25C, but if more tungsten is added the glass will reflect the suns rays at lower temperatures, keeping buildings even cooler inside.																								All the chemicals used are common, which, according to the researchers, should make the glass relatively cheap to produce. An application for the patent has been filed, and already the smart glass has attracted the attention of manufacturers, including Pilkington Glass, who hope to produce it commercially.																								Simon Hurst, a senior technologist in the research and development arm of Pilkington, said that windows made from the glass could be available to customers within five years.																								At present, the only way to prevent heat passing through windows is to use tinted glass. This, however, also blocks out light, making it unpopular with office workers. The smart glass has a yellow-brown tinge, but the researchers say that they expect to be able to create clear glass. The heat-reflective windows could also be installed in homes. 																								A spokeswoman for the London Transport Users Committee predicted that they would also be popular with bus and rail passengers. Last summer we had more complaints than ever about temperatures on buses. The new double-deckers have large picture windows, which seems to be the problem  temperatures on the upper decks can reach the high thirties.																								We would encourage any measures that made transport more comfortable and got more people onto public transport.																								At Londons Liverpool Street station last week, office workers waiting to board buses, tubes and trains, welcomed the innovation. Paul Lee, a shop manager, said: On the buses, windows that reflect the heat would make a big difference. At the moment I try to sit at the back of the bus, where it is coolest.																								James Cooper, a computer technician, said: I am sweating at work. The air conditioning unit in our office is so old and cranky, it only cools the person next to it. These new windows sound like a brilliant idea.																								A spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, was enthusiastic. Air conditioning contributes huge amounts to our energy use and therefore carbon emissions. We welcome innovation to reduce the amount of energy used.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

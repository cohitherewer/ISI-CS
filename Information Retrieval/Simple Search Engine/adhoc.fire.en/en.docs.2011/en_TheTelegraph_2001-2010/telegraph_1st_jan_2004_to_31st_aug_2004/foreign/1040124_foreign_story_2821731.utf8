																								Tehran, Jan. 23 (Reuters): The head of Irans hardline Guardian Council said today the watchdog panel was willing to reverse any mistakes made when it banned thousands of liberal candidates from running in parliamentary elections.
																								The Guardian Councils move to bar nearly half of 8,200 hopefuls from standing in the February 20 vote has prompted dozens of top government officials to threaten to resign. Reformist parties have said they may boycott the election.
																								Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said the 12-member panel, which has received more than 3,000 complaints from disqualified candidates most of whom are reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami, would inform candidates of any changes by January 30.
																								There are misunderstandings about the Guardian Councils work, Jannati told a Friday prayers congregation in Tehran.
																								Mistakes are possible. We neither insist on (standing by) mistakes nor would we violate the law, he said in the sermon, broadcast live on state radio.
																								Many of those barred from standing were accused by the council of lacking loyalty to Irans constitution and the system of clerical rule adopted after the 1979 Islamic revolution. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has urged the council to review the bans and said that hundreds who had been allowed to run in previous elections should be allowed to stand again.
 Qaida trial
																								Iran, long accused by the US of harbouring al Qaida militants, said for the first time today that it would place a dozen jailed suspects on trial. 
																								They are currently in prison. Their relations are cut off from outside and they are going to be tried, foreign minister Khamal Kharrazi said.

 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Kill Bill in two parts pleases Uma
				 	 Uma Thurman in a scene from Kill Bill Vol. 1. (AFP)New York, April 12 (AP): Uma Thurman is glad Kill Bill turned out to be two instalments. Volume 1 of the action movie was released in October; volume 2 opens on Friday. 																								The model-turned-actress wouldnt tell Newsday whether director Quentin Tarantino planned it that way all along, but the footage always felt like two movies to her. The first film was like a giant dance number, she said. This one is much more focused.																								Thurman sees plenty of action as an assassin out for revenge against a hit man who tried to kill her, and she credits Tarantino with letting her play the part. Hes certainly given me really incredibly physical, very freeing parts, Thurman said of Tarantino, who also cast her in his 1994 Pulp Fiction. Quentins work is kind of a genre unto itself, she said.																								Getting into shape for Kill Bill required a massive amount of physical training and learning three styles of kung fu, two styles of sword throwing and hand-to-hand combat just three months after giving birth, Uma said.

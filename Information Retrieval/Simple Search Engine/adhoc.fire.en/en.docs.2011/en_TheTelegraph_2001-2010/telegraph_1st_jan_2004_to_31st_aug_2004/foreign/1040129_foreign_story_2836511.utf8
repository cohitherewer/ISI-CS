 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Kerry tightens grip
				 	 John Kerry																								Manchester (New Hampshire), Jan. 28 (Reuters): John Kerry took firm command of the Democratic presidential race with a big win over Howard Dean in the New Hampshire primary yesterday, cementing his grip on the front-runners role and dealing another setback to Deans reeling campaign.																								Kerry, the Massachusetts senator whose come-from-behind win in the Iowa caucuses last week turned the 2004 presidential race upside down, scored his second consecutive victory in the race to pick a Democratic challenger to President George W. Bush.																								I have only just begun to fight, Kerry told cheering supporters in Manchester, urging them to stand with us on a drive to evict Bush from the White House.																								In nearly complete returns, Kerry led Dean 39 per cent to 26 per cent, sending him into next weeks crucial round of seven Democratic state contests on a huge wave of momentum.																								In a battle for third-place bragging rights ahead of next week, retired General Wesley Clark narrowly led North Carolina Senator John Edwards, 13 per cent to 12 per cent																								The loss was the latest in a series of setbacks for Dean, whose high-flying campaign stalled on a dismal third-place showing in Iowa, a widely ridiculed concession speech and growing voter doubts about his ability to beat Bush in November.																								But Dean, who cancelled television ads in other states to focus his resources on New Hampshire, called the finish a solid second and said he was pleased.

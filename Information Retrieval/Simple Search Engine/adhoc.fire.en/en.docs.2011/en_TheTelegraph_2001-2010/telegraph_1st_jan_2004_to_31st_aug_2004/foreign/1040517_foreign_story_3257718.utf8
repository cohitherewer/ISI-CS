The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, May 17, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Flight fright																																	Mexico City, May 16 (Reuters): A cluster of mysterious objects that surrounded a Mexican air force plane, alarming the pilots and sparking a UFO scare, could be a weather phenomenon known as ball lightning, a scientist said.																																	The pilots grew nervous during a routine drugs surveillance flight in March when their radar detected strange objects flying nearby and an infrared camera showed 11 blobs of light, invisible to the eye, hovering or darting about their plane.																																	Mexicos air force this week released footage from the infrared camera that was shown widely on television. As Mexican and international media published photographs of the objects, UFO websites saw the case as possible evidence of a new sighting of some form of extraterrestrial life.																																	But nuclear science researcher Julio Herrera said the blobs of light may have been nothing more than ball lightning  glowing spheres that are little understood but often sighted near the ground during thunderstorms. 																													 																Bond bugCannes (Reuters): After four years of filming and editing his Kill Bill revenge saga, American director Quentin Tarantino feels like hes climbed a cinematic mountain. But instead of a much-desired rest he wants to tackle the Everest of film genres: James Bond. Once Tarantino finishes worldwide promotion for his Kill Bill - Volume 2 sequel, which stars Uma Thurman as a bride bent on finding the man who tried to kill her, he plans to approach the producers of the big-budget Bond series.																													 																Moore music																																	Los Angeles (Reuters): Pop singer Mandy Moore has signed with Sire Records, the Warner Bros. imprint whose roster includes the Distillers, the Von Bondies and Hot Hot Heat, she said. Moore, 20, recently parted ways with Sony Musics Epic Records label, where she released four albums, the most recent being Coverage, a collection of 70s cover tunes written by the likes of Todd Rundgren, Joan Armatrading and Cat Stevens.																													 																Britney blowLondon (Reuters): A Grammy-award winning Christian rock star, who preaches a message of abstinence from sex until marriage, says she feels sorry for pop princess Britney Spears who herself once famously vowed to be a virgin until she wed. Rebecca St. James, a star of the US Christian music scene, said she was disappointed that role models from the world of music and movies such as Spears led youngsters astray with their message of anything goes, if it feels good do it. The biggest thing I feel for Britney is I feel sad for her, she said on Saturday. 																																	I also feel sad for the nine or 10-years-old watching her who see her dressing in a very promiscuous fashion, almost asking for people to treat her as a sex object. They are going to start dressing that way too.

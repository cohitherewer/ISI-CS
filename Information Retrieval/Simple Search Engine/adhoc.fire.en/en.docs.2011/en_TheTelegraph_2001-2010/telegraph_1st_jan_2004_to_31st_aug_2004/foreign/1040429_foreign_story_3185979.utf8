 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 China to cool economy: Wen
				 	 Wen Jiabao																								Beijing, April 28 (Reuters): Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said today China was committed to forceful measures to cool its dangerously fast-growing economy, which has benefited global growth but, left unchecked, has the potential to drag it down.																								In an exclusive interview behind the vermilion red walls of the Zhongnanhai leadership compound, Wen also expressed optimism that the North Korean nuclear crisis could be resolved, and that Hong Kong people would one day elect their own leaders.																								Wen, on the eve of a 10-day tour that includes stops in Germany, Belgium, Italy, Ireland and Britain, also said he hoped to build on a partnership with the EU  his first visit to the continent since he was named premier in March 2003.																								But his strongest comments were reserved for his own economy, which logged 9.7 per cent growth in the first quarter of this year but faces resurgent inflation due to unchecked expansion in money supply, bank credit and fixed asset investment.																								Counting out a series of problems on his fingers, Wen underscored the weaknesses underlying one of the worlds fastest growing economies, problems which he said would prevent all but the most prudent steps in reforming the tightly held yuan currency. We need to take effective and very forceful measures to resolve those problems as soon as possible, Wen said.																								China has restricted bank lending, singled out cement, steel and aluminium projects in a broad clampdown to stamp out excess development and, just today, issued new land-use rules to rein in industrial growth.																								We believe that all those measures are going to take off in future, and we hope not to see any major ups and downs in our economic development, he said.																								The pressures would require China to tread softly in reforming the yuan, he said, and sudden changes would threaten global growth.																								China has been the target of criticism in the US and elsewhere for its tight yuan policy. Those critics argue that the yuan is artificially weak and makes Chinese goods cheap.																								If we change the system rashly, it will certainly bring unpredictable problems to the domestic economy, and at the same time could affect the financial stability of the region and even the world, the Chinese Premier said. Analysts have said China may move on the currency towards the end of this year, and officials have said they are studying the possibility of pegging it to a basket of currencies, a measure somewhere in between an outright revaluation and a modest widening of the trading band.																								Wen offered no preference for which path China might take, saying only that China would keep an open mind and was willing to give serious study to any proposal.

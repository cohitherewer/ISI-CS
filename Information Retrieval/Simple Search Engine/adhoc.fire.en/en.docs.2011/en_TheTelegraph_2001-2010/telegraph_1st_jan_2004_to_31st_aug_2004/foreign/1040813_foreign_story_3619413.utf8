 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 China sops to stop female foeticide
																								Beijing, Aug. 12 (Reuters): Rural families in China, where there is a traditional bias for boys, are being offered cash incentives to stop aborting baby girls and help correct a sex imbalance, the China Daily said today.																								Under the Care for Girls pilot programme, girls would be exempted from paying school fees, insurance would be given to households until their daughters grow up and families with just one daughter would enjoy housing, employment, education and welfare privileges, the newspaper said.																								China has stringent rules on family planning that allow couples usually to have just one child, at least in the cities, and limit numbers elsewhere.																								If a farming familys first-born is a girl, it is allowed to have another baby. But the bias for boys, especially in the countryside, means many parents decide to abort if the unborn child is found to be a girl.																								Such moves prompted the government to pass regulations a few years ago banning doctors from revealing the sex of an unborn child amid demographic indications that births of boys far outnumbered those of girls.																								In China, an average of 117 boys are born to every 100 girls. Authorities are aiming to bring the number of boys down to an average of between 103 and 107. In 1982, the birth gender ratio was relatively normal at about 108 boys for every 100 girls.																								In southern provinces such as Hainan and Guangdong, the ratio is now up to 130 boys per 100 girls, officials have said. The National Population and Family Planning Commission called yesterday for a nationwide effort to create a favourable environment for females and correct the sex imbalance, the China Daily said.

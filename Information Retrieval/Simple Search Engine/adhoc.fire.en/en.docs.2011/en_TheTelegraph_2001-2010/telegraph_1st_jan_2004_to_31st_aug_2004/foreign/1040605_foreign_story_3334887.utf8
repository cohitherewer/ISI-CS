 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 US to reduce nuclear stockpile
																								Washington, June 4 (AP): The US plans to substantially reduce its stockpile of nuclear warheads over the next eight years to coincide with reductions in operational weapons, the energy department told Congress.																								 Linton Brooks, head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, said in letter to Congress that a major reduction in the number of warheads held in reserve is justified because of a planned two-thirds cut in operational warheads by 2012 under a treaty already negotiated with Russia.																								 President George W. Bush in 2001 announced that the number of operational warheads the US will maintain will be reduced to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012, from an estimated 6,000. As a result, the stockpile of reserve warheads will be reduced and the total number of warheads cut by nearly half over the next eight years, Brooks said in an interview today.

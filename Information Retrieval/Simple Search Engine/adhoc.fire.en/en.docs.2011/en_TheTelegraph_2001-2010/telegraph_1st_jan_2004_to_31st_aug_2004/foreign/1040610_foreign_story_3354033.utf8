The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, June 10, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Beatles online																																	 Los Angeles, June 9 (Reuters): Representatives of the Beatles are in discussions with various online music services about licensing their songs for distribution on the Internet, people familiar with the discussions said yesterday.																																	The Beatles have been one of the biggest holdouts in releasing their catalogue for sale online, and the lack of such mega-hits as Let it Be and Yesterday has been cited as a major weakness for fledgling, web-based music stores.																																	Negotiators for the Beatles have talked with several companies, with a particular emphasis on Microsoft Corps MSN, which is expected to open an Internet music store late this summer, people familiar with the talks said.																																	MSN is working very closely with the music industry to build a top-quality music service for consumers, which includes providing a wide selection of music, but has nothing specific to announce at this time, said a Microsoft spokesman.

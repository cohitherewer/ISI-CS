There were a couple of references that had to be changed, the Daily Mirror quoted Simpsons producer Al Jean as saying.																																	 the original script, there was a scene where Blair presents the Simpsons with a corgi dog as they get off the plane.																																	This had to be cut because Downing Street felt there was a risk that he would be seen as Americas poodle, Jean said.																																	Blair was labelled by the worlds media as President George W. Bushs poodle over his staunch backing of the US-led war on Iraq. Blair, said to be a big fan of the animated situated comedy, recorded three lines of dialogue for the show in April while the war was ongoing.																																	The episode, titled The Regina Monologues, aired in the US in November and is due to hit British television screens on January 9.																																	The cartoon shows an animated version of Blair giving tourism tips to the shows protagonists  namely Homer Simpson and his dysfunctional family. 																													 																Monica fees Washington (Reuters): A federal appeals  court on Tuesday ruled that Monica Lewinsky should not be  reimbursed for $1.16 million in legal fees related to an  independent counsel investigation of President Bill Clintons  affair with the former White House intern. A three-judge  panel of the US court of appeals in Washington, which has  jurisdiction for independent counsel cases, ruled that Lewinsky  failed to meet the requirements to be reimbursed by US taxpayers.  Lewinsky, whose affair with Clinton ultimately led to his  impeachment, had asked the court for $1.16 million she said  she incurred during the independent counsels investigation  into the scandal. She said she should be reimbursed because  there would have been no investigation into perjury and  other allegations against her if it had not involved the  President. But the court disagreed and said she could have  been probed by the justice department even if the independent  counsel had not been investigating the matter.

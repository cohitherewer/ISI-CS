 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 70 killed as Turkey train derails
Istanbul, July 22 (Reuters): Seventy people died when a new Turkish express train heading to Istanbul from the capital Ankara derailed today, a provincial governor said.																								Ayhan Cevik, governor of Bilecik province near the scene of the disaster, told CNN Turk television scores more were injured.																								Witnesses earlier told CNN Turk around 40 people died.																								It was not immediately clear what caused the train to go off the tracks in the province of Sakarya in northwestern Turkey, but CNN Turk said a mechanical problem was suspected. Officials said one of the rear wagons may have derailed first, causing the accident, the station said.																								Four wagons were derailed, Ali Kemal Ergulec, the deputy general manager of the state railways, said. This was not an area where the train went at high speeds. We are investigating what happened... We dont know how many died, Ergulec said. I think the train was full. There were no empty spaces.																								CNN Turk reported that the train was probably travelling at 70-80 km per hour.

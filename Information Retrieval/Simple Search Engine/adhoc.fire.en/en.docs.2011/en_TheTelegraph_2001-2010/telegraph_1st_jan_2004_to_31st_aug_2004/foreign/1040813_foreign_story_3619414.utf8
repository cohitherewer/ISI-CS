(AFP)																								Singapore, Aug. 12 (Reuters): Lee Hsien Loong, eldest son of modern Singapores founding father, became the republics third Prime Minister today in a tightly choreographed succession aimed at underlining the islands stable reputation.																								In a ceremony held on the steps of a 134-year-old colonial palace known as the Istana, the new government of familiar faces, including his 80-year-old father Lee Kuan Yew and retiring Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, were also sworn in.																								In his first speech as Prime Minister, Lee directly addressed the tight control the government exerts over the affluent city state, saying he wanted society to become more open and inclusive, where economic growth was not an end in itself.																								Our people should feel free to express diverse views, pursue unconventional ideas or simply be different, he told an invited audience of around 1,400 guests made up people from all walks of life, including taxi drivers, diplomats and community leaders.																								The guest list pointed to one of the biggest challenges facing the 52-year-old Lee  combating an image as an aloof intellectual, or stern and authoritarian in the mould of his famous father.																								He is seen as a product of his father, with a silver spoon in his mouth. This makes him appear out of touch with the grassroots, said 32-year-old businessman Edward Yap.																								The younger Lee, who holds degrees from Cambridge University in Britain and Harvard in the US, military rank of brigadier-general and speaks four languages, has been groomed to lead since his appointment as Gohs deputy in 1990. 																								The elder Lee, now aged 80, remains a powerful force in the new cabinet asminister mentor. Lees first speech also highlighted risks facing Singapore, from terrorism to a mishap in cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan, and the need for an ageing population to get married and have more babies.																								He said finding a successor would be a top priority after naming two deputy Prime Ministers in his new cabinet who are both around 65-years- old.

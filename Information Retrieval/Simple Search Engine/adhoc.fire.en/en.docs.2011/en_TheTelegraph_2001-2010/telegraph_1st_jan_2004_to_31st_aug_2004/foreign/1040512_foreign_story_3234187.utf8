				 	 Private Lynndie England																								Denver, May 11 (Reuters): An attorney defending a female US army private accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners said yesterday her client was being made a poster child for the Bush administrations flawed Iraq war policies.																								Denver lawyer Rose Mary Zapor represents Private First Class Lynndie England, who is depicted in a series of photographs purportedly humiliating Iraqi detainees, images that have outraged the Arab world and sparked a political firestorm in the US. 																								We believe Lynndie is being made a poster child for the deficiencies of the administrations Iraq war, Zapor said, saying military commanders shared the blame because they had assigned poorly-trained soldiers to staff the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.																								England, 21, of Fort Ashby, West Virginia, is one of seven US army reservists charged with inhumanely treating detainees at the prison. In one photograph, England is seen holding a leash attached to a prone Iraqi prisoner and in another she is seen smiling as she points to the genitals of a naked and hooded Iraqi man.																								Sent home from Iraq in March because she was pregnant, England was charged on Friday with one count of conspiring to maltreat prisoners, three counts of assaulting prisoners by battery and conduct discrediting the service.																								Possible penalties for those charges include a reduction in rank, dishonourable discharge and, potentially, a maximum of 15-and-a-half years in prison.																								The army has 120 days from Friday, the day she was charged, to bring England up for arraignment. Zapor said President George W. Bushs comments about the widening scandal, including saying he found the photographs despicable, could jeopardise Englands right to a fair court martial hearing.																								The President illegally undermined the military chain of command and well be asking the President to cease and desist his comments about our client, Zapor said. Those comments violate the Code of Military Justice and the President is the commander in chief, she said.Failure of leadership																								The abuse of Iraqi prisoners reflected a failure of leadership in the US armed forces, the general who investigated the mistreatment said today, but he said he found no evidence that American soldiers had acted on the direct orders of higher-ups.

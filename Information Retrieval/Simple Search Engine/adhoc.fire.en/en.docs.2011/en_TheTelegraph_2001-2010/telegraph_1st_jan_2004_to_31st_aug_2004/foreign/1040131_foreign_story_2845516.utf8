 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Spanking legal
 Ottawa, Jan. 30 (Reuters):  Canadian parents can continue to spank their children but  only if they are not infants or teens, the Supreme Court  ruled today.																								In a case that pitted conservative groups against those supporting the rights of children, the court declared that it would be more harmful to families to turn parents into criminals for applying reasonable force to children from two until their teen years.																								But for the first time the high court left parents open to criminal sanctions outside that age bracket.																								The justices rejected a taxpayer-subsidised constitutional challenge which said childrens dignity was threatened by any corporal punishment. They also upheld the right of teachers to remove a child from a classroom or to secure compliance.																								Introducing the criminal law into childrens families and educational environments in such circumstances would harm children more than help them, chief justice Beverley McLachlin wrote for the 6-2 majority. A ninth justice had a split opinion.																								The force permitted is limited and must be set against the reality of a childs mother or father being charged and pulled into the criminal justice system, with its attendant rupture of the family setting, or a teacher being detained pending bail, with the inevitable harm to the childs crucial educative setting, McLachlin wrote. 																								The case did not center on any specific incident, but the issue of spanking did hit the news in Ontario in 2001 when social workers seized seven children from a conservative evangelical family that used corporal punishment.																								The children were returned to their home in about a month and the parents escaped criminal penalties because of the existing law that allowed spanking, but the Ontario Association of Childrens Aid Societies joined in asking for the section to be struck down.																								Parents can breathe a sigh of relief that they will not be criminalized for lovingly disciplining their children, Michael Martens said for Focus on the Family, one of the groups that made arguments before the court.																								The majority report of the Supreme Court has affirmed that parents are the best judge to decide what is best for their children.																								The lawyer who argued the case to ban spanking, Cheryl Milne, said the court had given a mixed message.																								Im heartened by the courts attempts to narrow the defense, she told reporters in the Supreme Court lobby after the decision was released.What Im concerned with overall is that its still OK to hit children.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Tigers not sole voice of Tamils, says Karuna
				 	 A member of Karunas faction loads a rocket into a launcher in Batticaloa district. (AFP)																								Batticaloa (Sri Lanka), March 11 (Reuters): A breakaway Sri Lankan rebel commander  who has the support of 6,000 fighters  denounced the Tamil Tigers today, saying they were no longer the sole representatives of the Tamil people.																								The eastern commander  who goes by the nom de guerre Karuna  said Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran lacked the leadership to heal the rift  an unprecedented slap in the face to the founder of the movement. I cannot see any positive leadership qualities in him (Prabhakaran) now. He took some improper steps, which is not a characteristic of a good leader, Karuna said in an exclusive interview from his heavily fortified jungle camp in the islands east.																								Karuna split from the Tigers last week, but has said he will honour a two-year truce that has given Sri Lanka its best chance for peace after two decades of civil war.																								The problems for the people of the east can be solved with the government through negotiations, he said through a translator, smiling and looking relaxed despite his conviction the Tigers northern-based leadership would try and kill him.																								The split in the LTTE has rattled Sri Lanka ahead of an April 2 election that is already being fought over how to win peace with the rebels. But Karuna said there was no hope of the two sides bridging their rift.																								Wanni administration is not considered as the sole representatives of Tamils now, he said, referring to the Tigers northern headquarters. They cannot be considered the representatives of the people in the east.																								The claim to be the sole representatives of the islands minority Tamil community has been a pillar of the Tigers platform, and they have defended it by ruthlessly eliminating challenges to their rule.																								The LTTE has appointed a commander to replace Karuna but he is still at their headquarters in the north and Karuna said it was not possible for him to return. 																								Even if that happens, we are fully prepared, he said.																								I will never admit (allow) my people to be slaves of a Wanni administration.

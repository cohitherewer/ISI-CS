The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Britain restricts access to House
				 	 Speaker of the House of Commons Michael Martin. (Reuters)																								London, May 26 (Reuters): Britains parliament restricted access to the galleries of its debating chamber today, a week after Prime Minister Tony Blair was hit by a powder missile in a breach of security at the heart of government.																								The restrictions left Blair playing to a depleted audience at this weeks session of Prime Ministers question time, which was spectacularly disrupted last Wednesday when protesters threw condoms filled with purple-dyed flour from the guests gallery.																								One man charged with throwing the missiles, who is from a divorced fathers rights group, was fined 600 today and another remanded on bail after pleading not guilty.																								Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, said he had suspended the right of parliamentarians to invite guests into those parts of the historic chambers galleries that are not shielded by a security screen.																								It is in the interests of all those who work in this building that the lessons of last weeks incident are learned and acted upon, Martin told parliament.																								The security screen was erected just weeks ago across the public part of the gallery after British intelligence said attackers could release anthrax or ricin into the chamber. But it failed to protect Blair because a member of the upper House of Lords had unwittingly signed the protesters in to the privileged gallery areas in front of the screen.																								The stunt raised fears that Blair could have been the victim of a chemical or biological attack.

 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Blair position unchanged
				 	 Tony Blair London, Jan 24 (Reuters):  British Prime Minister Tony Blair yesterday stuck by his  stance weapons of mass destruction would eventually be found  in Iraq, despite the top man hunting them saying they did  not exist.																								It is important people are patient and we let the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) do its work, a spokesman for Blair said. There is still more work to be done and we await the findings of that. But our position is unchanged. 																								However, Donald Anderson, a member of Blairs ruling Labour Party and chairman of parliaments foreign affairs committee, told BBC television: It looks increasingly forlorn that there are any chances now of finding those stockpiles.																								David Kay, stepping down on Friday as head of the US-led ISG hunt for banned Iraqi weapons that replaced earlier UN inspections, said no arms would be found.																								Blair joined US President George W. Bush in ordering the war to oust Saddam Hussein on grounds Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and was a threat to world peace. 																								Although no such weapons have been found since Saddam was toppled last April, Blair says he will be proved right.																								What they have found already is a whole raft of evidence about clandestine operations that should have been disclosed to the UN, he said in a recent interview. What was the point of having all these elaborate concealment mechanisms if there was nothing to conceal? Britains minority Opposition Liberal Democrats said Kays remarks cast severe doubt on the governments reasoning for the Iraq war.																								This is yet another massive blow to the credibility of the British governments case that Iraq presented such a serious threat to the UK that only military action would do, said the a party spokesman. Iraq blast																								A car bomb exploded at the entrance to an American military base in Iraq today, killing three US soldiers just hours after separate blasts elsewhere left two servicemen and at least four Iraqis dead. 																								Witnesses said they saw a car ram a checkpoint outside the base in Khaldiya and explode as a number of soldiers were getting out of a vehicle.

 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Militia leaves Najaf shrine
																								Najaf, Aug. 27 (Reuters): Shia fighters left the holiest shrine in Najaf today and began turning in their weapons, after tens of thousands of pilgrims celebrated a peace agreement that ended a bloody rebellion.																								Religious authorities locked the doors of the Imam Ali mosque after the Mehdi Army militia of radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr left. The fighters had defied US military firepower and the interim Iraqi government for three weeks.																								Iraqs most revered cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, made a dramatic return to Najaf today and persuaded Sadr to accept a peace deal to halt the fighting, after a day of violence in which 110 Iraqis were killed and 501 wounded.																								Militants tossed AK-47 assault rifles and mortar launchers into wooden carts being pushed around near the shrine. Mosque loudspeaker announcements in Sadrs name gave the order. 																								Al Arabiya television said Sadrs representatives had handed over the keys to the mosque, Iraqs holiest Shia shrine.																								A Reuters correspondent there said Iraqi police took control of the area around the mosque, as envisaged under the deal.																								Several Mehdi militants refused to give up their guns while some US troops  who are supposed to leave the southern city in line with the peace deal  were seen nearby. By mid-afternoon, the narrow streets around the mosque were relatively quiet, destroyed and blackened buildings a testament to the fierce fighting that killed hundreds and drove world oil prices to record highs.																								But a big question mark hangs over what role Sadr and his militia want to play in Iraq, especially ahead of elections in January. Prime Minister Iyad Allawi gave them an amnesty under the peace deal. Sadr draws formidable support among Iraqs downtrodden majority Shias. 																								After the bitter fighting with US Marines, many Mehdi militants still breathed defiance today. We will support whatever Ayatollah Sistani and Sayyed Moqtada have agreed. But we will still slit the throats of the Americans, said one militiaman, Hussein Taama.

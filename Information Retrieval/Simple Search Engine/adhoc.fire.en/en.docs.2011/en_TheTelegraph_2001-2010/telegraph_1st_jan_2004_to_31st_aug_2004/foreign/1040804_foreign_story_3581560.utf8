(Reuters)																								Fort Bragg (North Carolina), August 3 (Reuters): US soldiers who abused Iraqi prisoners at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison did it for fun, a military investigator testified today at the start of a hearing in the case of a female soldier photographed holding a naked Iraqi on a leash.																								A military court at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, convened to decide whether US soldier Lynndie England will be tried for the prisoner abuse that outraged the Arab world and embarrassed the Bush administration as it sought to stabilise Iraq.																								Chief Warrant Officer Paul Arthur, the lead criminal investigator into the abuse at Abu Ghraib, was the first witness to take the stand in a red-brick judge advocates building in Fort Bragg, where the pregnant England has been stationed since her return from Iraq.																								Arthur told the military court that England said in a sworn statement in January that one of her superiors, Specialist Charles Graner, told her to pose for the infamous photograph of the naked Iraqi prisoner on a leash, one of a series of pictures. US media reports have said Graner, who has also been charged, is the father of Englands child.																								(She said) Graner suggested she pose in a photograph with him (the prisoner). And pose for the picture as if she was dragging him, Arthur said, repeating several times that England and other soldiers said they were just joking around. 																								Asked if he had determined why the US soldiers had abused the prisoners, Arthur said: Basically it was just for fun ... and to vent their frustration.England, dressed in camouflage uniform, black boots and beret, entered the courthouse moments before the hearing began, ignoring dozens of media cameras and reporters.																								Inside the courtroom, she answered: Yes Maam and No Maam to a series of simple questions from Colonel Denise Arn, the investigating officer, about the charges she faces. England, 21, was charged along with six other US military police reservists in a scandal that prompted an apology from George W. Bush, who placed the blame on a small group of soldiers.																								England has said she was following orders when she appeared in the pictures, which also included one in which she pointed at a prisoners genitals, a cigarette dangling from her lips. Addressing that, Special Agent Warren Worth, a military crimes investigator, said he found no evidence that orders came from further up the chain of command than Graner and Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick, another of the seven soldiers charged.																								If were talking about persons higher ... I had no indication that anybody knew, Worth told the court.																								The hearing is called an Article 32 investigation. Arn will decide whether the case should go to trial. It has been delayed since June as the military filed new charges and Englands defenders made changes to their legal team.

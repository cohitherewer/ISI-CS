 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Pak quizzes Osama aide
																								Islamabad, Aug. 9 (Reuters): Pakistan is questioning a key operational chief of al Qaida who knew Osama bin Laden and is suspected of involvement in attempts to assassinate President Pervez Musharraf, intelligence sources said today.																								Qari Saifullah Akhtar was seized in Dubai on Friday and handed over to Pakistan the following day, the latest major al Qaida scalp claimed in a month-long swoop by Pakistani intelligence agencies that has netted around 20 suspects so far.																								Intelligence sources say Akhtars capture was linked to information gleaned from top al Qaida suspect, Tanzanian Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, and Pakistani computer engineer Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan, seized in separate raids in July. But Pakistans information minister has denied any link.																								Pakistan says it is searching for four or five more important al Qaida planners, including an Egyptian known simply as Hamza and a Libyan called Abu Faraj.																								We are looking for four or five other planners of terror attacks, information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said. If we are successful in getting them, it will be a big blow to their network and there will be a sharp drop in terrorism. 																								Officials said the planners were being more actively sought than al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri. Protest at FBI sting																								Pakistan has protested to the US about an FBI sting operation involving a fake plot to kill Pakistans UN ambassador, describing it today as a mind-boggling and dangerous mission. The FBI set up the sting to try to snare Mohammed Hossain, founder of a mosque in Albany, New York, and its prayer leader Yassin Aref after surveillance beginning about a year ago.																								The operation involved money laundering, a shoulder-fired missile and the fake plot to kill the Pakistani ambassador. An FBI informant told Hossain and Aref he was working with Jaish-e-Mohammed, an Islamic extremist group in Pakistan, and said the missile would be used to assassinate the envoy.																								Pakistans foreign ministry spokesperson Masood Khan said it was a bizarre move that could have endangered the life of Muneer Akram. It is mind-boggling why they could not use the name of an American functionary, Khan said.

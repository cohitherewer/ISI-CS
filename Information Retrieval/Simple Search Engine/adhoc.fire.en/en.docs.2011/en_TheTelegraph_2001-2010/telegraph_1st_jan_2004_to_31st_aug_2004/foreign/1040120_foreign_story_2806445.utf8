 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Japan troops kick off Shia test
																								Iraq/Kuwait Border, Jan. 19 (Reuters): Japanese troops entered Iraq from Kuwait today to begin Japans most controversial and risky deployment since World War Two.																								An advance party of soldiers that will prepare the ground for the likely deployment of about 1,000 troops crossed the border at around 0950 GMT in a convoy of about 12 jeeps and military vehicles. The dispatch marks a historic shift away from Japans purely defensive postwar security policy and poses a huge political risk for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, whose government could be rocked if, as many expect, casualties occur.																								Japanese public opinion is divided over Koizumis decision to send troops to Iraq but he defended the dispatch in a speech prepared for the opening of a new session of parliament. 																								We would not be meeting our responsibilities as a member of the international community if we were to leave the contribution of personnel to other countries because of the possible danger, he said.																								The troops will be based in the mainly Shia southern city of Samawa, where they will conduct reconstruction and humanitarian operations. If defence minister Shigeru Ishiba judges the area safe after team members report back, he will likely order the main body of troops to set off from late January.																								A law enacted last July allows the troop dispatch, but in line with Japans pacifist constitution, limits the militarys activity to non-combat zones, a murky concept in Iraq, which continues to see daily attacks on occupying troops.																								Security was tight in Tokyo after media reports said late last year al Qaida had warned Japan it would attack the heart of the capital as soon as Japanese troops set foot in Iraq.																								About 48 per cent of respondents to a weekend poll by Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said they opposed the dispatch, down from 55 per cent in the previous poll in December. About 40 per cent said they supported it, up from 34 per cent.

(AFP)																								Washington, Jan. 17 (Reuters): Faced with objections from Iraqs most powerful Muslim cleric, the Bush administration said yesterday it was willing to adjust US plans for handing over political power to Iraqis but would not let the June 30 sovereignty deadline slip.																								After talks at the White House with US President George W. Bush, the US administrator of Iraq, Paul Bremer, said the administration may alter the way a transitional assembly is selected and make other clarifications.																								While he expressed doubts about Iraqi Shia demands for direct elections before the transfer of power on June 30, Bremer said: These are questions that, obviously, need to be looked at.																								He said he planned to return to private life on July 1.																								Bush is eager for the UN to return to Iraq to help with the transition  a shift in strategy that reflects US concerns about growing Iraqi opposition to its plan.																								Bremer will meet UN secretary-general Kofi Annan on Monday and is expected to press him to send a UN team to Iraq to convince Shias that direct elections are unfeasible or suggest a workable compromise.																								After excluding the UN from Iraq, the US plans to ask the world body to play an active role in virtually every aspect of the political transition process from overseeing the selection of an Iraqi government and writing new laws to the transfer of power when the US occupation ends on June 30, the Washington Post reported in todays edition.																								Were intending to stick to the timeline that weve laid out  for the transfer of power on June 30 and direct elections in 2005, Bremer said.																								But senior administration officials said they were open to changes  within that timeline  to address Iraqi concerns.																								We are willing to discuss refinements or improvements, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. Bremer added: We are prepared to see clarifications in the process, ... the ways in which the selection of the transitional assembly is carried forward. Iraqs most revered Shia cleric,  Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, has refused to support the US  plan for regional caucuses to select the transitional assembly,  which then will pick an interim government to take control  by July 1.

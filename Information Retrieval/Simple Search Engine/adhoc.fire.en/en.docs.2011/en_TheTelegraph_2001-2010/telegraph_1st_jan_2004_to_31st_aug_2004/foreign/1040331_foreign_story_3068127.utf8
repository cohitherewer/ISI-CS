 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Hawking probe dropped
 DAVID SAPSTED				 	 Stephen Hawking																								London, March 30: A seven-month police investigation into claims that Prof. Stephen Hawking had been the victim of a series of assaults in his home was dropped yesterday.																								The investigation by Cambridgeshire Police  the second conducted in the past four years  came to an end after detectives decided that there was no evidence to warrant further action.																								Police began the latest inquiry after complaints were made by staff employed to provide round-the-clock care for the 62-year-old Lucasian professor of applied mathematics at Cambridge University.																								Both Prof. Hawking and Elaine, 53, his second wife, were interviewed by detectives this month. Previously, at least 12 current and former members of his care team gave statements to police.																								Deputy superintendent Michael Campbell, who led the inquiry, said: My investigation into these allegations has been extremely thorough and detailed. I would emphasise that this inquiry has encompassed allegations from a previous investigation in 2000. The purpose of this has been to establish once and for all the position with regard to Prof. Hawking.																								I appreciate that these allegations have caused discomfort and distress to Prof. and Mrs Hawking but the depth of my inquiry has provided me with a great deal of information.																								Based on what I have learnt, I can find no evidence to substantiate any assertion that anyone has perpetrated any criminal acts against Prof. Hawking.																								Police began the inquiry after claims were made by a third party last August that the disabled author of A Brief History of Time had been the victim of a string of assaults.																								When news of the investigation reached the media earlier this year, Prof. Hawking issued a statement denying all knowledge of the alleged attacks against him.																								A fortnight ago, detectives interviewed the physicist at Papworth Hospital, where he is being treated at a specialist sleep disorder unit. Last week, Elaine Hawking was interviewed at a police station in Bottisham just outside Cambridge. She spent about 50 minutes with detectives, and a force spokesman said at the time that the interview had been conducted with her full agreement.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

(AFP)																								Islamabad, June 29: The ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) chief Shujaat Hussein was today chosen as the caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan after the National Assembly elected him as the new leader of the House.																								Husseins election followed a surprise resignation on Saturday by Zafarullah Khan Jamali amid reports that he had fallen out with President Pervez Musharraf.																								The 59-year-old Hussein, who broke ranks with former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 2000, won 190 votes to emerge as the new leader of the House amidst thumping of desks today.																								The rival candidate Makhdoom Amin Fahim, acting chief of the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy (ARD), managed only 76 votes.																								However, the six-party Opposition Islamic alliance, the Mutahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA), did not vote citing ideological differences with Fahims Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). 																								I hereby announce election of Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein (as leader of the house), who commands confidence of the majority of members of the National Assembly, Speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussein said to thumping of desks by ruling party MPs.																								Hussein will take oath as the 21st Prime Minister of Pakistan tomorrow. He will also seek a vote of confidence from the National Assembly and announce his cabinet the same day.																								My government will work for strengthening Islamic values and promoting good governance, Hussein told the House after his election.																								We will also have to fight injustice, lawlessness, poverty, backwardness and terrorism, he said, adding that these are some of the challenges, which the nation has to face with determination.																								Significantly, Hussein is a close friend of Musharraf confidant Tariq Aziz who is an influential behind-the-scenes player. Aziz is also the secretary of the National Security Council (NSC). 																								Amin Fahim made an indirect reference to their friendship when he erroneously called Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein as Chaudhry Tariq Aziz while greeting him after his election amidst peals of laughter. 																								Earlier, the Opposition parties objected to Husseins nomination and accused him of getting bank loans waived.																								Jamali had nominated Hussein to lead the country as interim Prime Minister, a move Opposition parties described as inappropriate. They also criticised the rulers, without actually naming Musharraf, for forcing a thorough gentleman to step down. However, Jamali rejected the criticism, saying every party has the sole right to take its own independent decisions.																								No other party has the right to object to the decision taken by the PML, he said while speaking in the National Assembly after Husseins election. 																								I would like to make it clear that nobody forced me to resign, the outgoing Prime Minister said.Leader of the Opposition and MMA secretary general Maulana Fazalur Rehman criticised the change of Prime Minister as unwarranted.

 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Kerry dash with a hiccup
																								Seattle, Feb.4 (Reuters): Democratic front-runner John Kerry savoured a string of victories even as he suffered his first primary defeat in yesterdays voting and pledged to take nothing for granted in his campaign to challenge President George W. Bush for the White House.																								For the second time in a few days, a New England patriot has won on the road, Kerry said of his wins in at least four of the seven states holding nominating contests. On Sunday, the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl in Houston, Texas.																								In remarks prepared for delivery at his victory party, Kerry said: I am humbled and honoured that so many Americans have joined our cause.																								Now we will carry this campaign and the cause of a stronger, fairer, more prosperous America to every part of America, he said. We will take nothing for granted; we will compete everywhere and in November, with your help, we will defeat George W. Bush. I pledge to you tonight: I have only just begun to fight, he said.																								The four-term senator from Massachusetts, drafting his remarks as he was declared the winner in Missouri, Arizona, Delaware and North Dakota, congratulated rival Senator John Edwards of North Carolina for winning in South Carolina. He also paid tribute to Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who dropped out of the race after finishing second to Kerry.

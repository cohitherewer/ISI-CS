 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 20 die in strong Iran quake
Tehran, May 28 (Reuters): A powerful earthquake rocked the Alborz mountain chain in northern Iran today, killing at least 20 people and damaging scores of villages, officials said.																								The US Geological Survey said the tremor had a magnitude of 6.2  powerful enough to bring down many buildings. 																								The quake late this afternoon shook the capital Tehran, about 100 km south of the epicentre, where startled residents poured into the streets and some windows were broken.																								But Irans Vice-President Mohammad Ali Abtahi said the Islamic Republic was not steeling itself for a big death toll.																								Memories are still fresh of an earthquake that devastated the city of Bam, far away in the southeast, on December 26, measuring 6.8 and killing more than 20,000 people.																								State media put todays epicentre at Chalus, a small town on the Caspian coast on the other side of the Alborz mountains from Tehran.																								A government official in Tehran, who declined to be named, put the overall toll at 20 dead and 150 people injured. But separate reports from different provinces in northern Iran suggested at least 28 had been killed.																								Among them were drivers on the mountainous Tehran-Chalus road whose vehicles were hit by falling rocks.																								Up until nine clock this evening (1630 GMT) 16 people were killed and 70 were wounded on the road, an interior ministry official told state television. 																								Massoud Emami, governor of Qazvin province northwest of Tehran, said damage to 80 villages in his area varied between 20 per cent and 100 per cent.																								He said a call had been put out for food and tents and troops were being mobilised to help villagers.

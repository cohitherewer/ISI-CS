 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Bulky SUVs barred from Paris
				 	 A Ford Endeavour sports utility vehicle																								Paris, June 9 (Reuters): Bulky four-by-fours could be banned from clogging up the chic streets of Paris after a top official in the capitals Left-wing government described them as a polluting caricature of a car unsuited to city life.																								An anti-sports utility vehicle (SUV) resolution passed by the city council could lead to a ban on the popular vehicles in about 18 months if it is included in an overall project to improve traffic flow in the city, deputy mayor Denis Baupin said today. You have to wonder why people want to drive around in SUVs, Baupin, a Greens party member, said on Europe 1 radio. 																								We have no interest in having SUVs in the city. Theyre dangerous to others and take up too much space.																								The city council voted yesterday to urge Socialist mayor Bertrand Delanoe to consider banning SUVs, which have become popular in recent years and now make up about five per cent of the French car market  just below the western Europe average.																								Baupin said Paris, which has been setting aside more lanes for buses and bicycles since a Socialist and Greens coalition took over City Hall in 2001, could not legally ban SUVs outright.																								Our idea is to limit the circulation of the most polluting vehicles, he said. That means SUVs and lots of other vehicles that dont meet European pollution standards.																								Baupin, who often cycles around Paris to promote more environmentally friendly transport, called SUVs a caricature of a car and said they were not adapted for use in a city.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Pak hawk not to join panel meet
				 	 Fazal-ur-Rehman: Odd man out																								Islamabad, June 23 (Reuters): The leader of Pakistans Opposition said today he would not attend the inaugural meeting of the National Security Council, a body critics fear will further enhance the militarys role in politics.																								The NSC, headed by powerful President General Pervez Musharraf, meets for the first time tomorrow, but Fazal-ur-Rehman, the Islamic conservative who heads opposition to the pro-military government, will not take up his seat.																								Rehman said his participation in the NSC, chaired by a President in uniform, would go against national interests.																								The presence of this institution will not strengthen democracy, he told a news briefing after a meeting of leaders from the six-party Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious conservatives which is part of the parliamentary opposition.																								The creation of the NSC was approved by parliament in April, and includes the Prime Minister, provincial governors and chief ministers, the leader of the parliamentary Opposition and senior military officers.																								The government contends that the council will have only an advisory role in politics, but the Opposition says the military will use it to run the country and override civilian leaders. 																								We think the National Security Council will be a parallel or a superior body to the parliament as long as the President remains in uniform, Rehman said. 																								The first session of the NSC comes amid intense speculation in Pakistan over whether Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terror, will step down as head of the army by the end of the year. Observers say Rehmans boycott is unlikely to seriously hamper the NSC, but it will further embarrass Musharraf, a leader who maintains sweeping powers despite formally ending military rule through elections in October 2002.

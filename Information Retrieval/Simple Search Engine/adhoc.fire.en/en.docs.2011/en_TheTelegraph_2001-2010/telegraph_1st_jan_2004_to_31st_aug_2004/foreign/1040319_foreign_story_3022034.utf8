 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Chandrika alarm on Tiger split
																								Colombo, March 18 (Reuters): Sri Lankas President called a split in the Tamil Tiger rebels a dangerous situation but said today she was determined to quickly restart peace talks if her party wins next months general election.																								The break away of a strong faction in the Tamil Tigers complicates efforts to end the islands 20-year war that are already in turmoil because of feuding between President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that led to the election being called on April 2.																								It is a very volatile situation and we will have to see how the situation develops, Kumaratunga said in an interview.She said campaigning for her United Peoples Freedom Alliance was going well, but a complex electoral system that combines a first-past-the-post system with proportional representation made it difficult for any party to win a solid mandate.

 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Mona Lisa to go under microscope
																								Paris, May 5 (AP): Is the Mona Lisa headed for surgery?																								Leonardo da Vincis 500-year-old painting of the woman with the mysterious smile will go under the microscope and be X-rayed for the first time in half a century to determine whats causing it to warp. 																								The worlds most famous portrait, painted in Italy over several years beginning about 1505, has long been known to be fragile. The oil painting sits on a 12-mm poplar board that has undergone many nips and tucks over time. 																								Last week, the Louvre museum said warping was discovered during the most recent of routine checks, which are conducted every one to two years. 																								Vincent Pomarede, chief curator in the Louvres department of painting, said the study is to help determine whether past repair work is doing more harm than good  and whether new touchups are needed.

 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Kerry slams Bush for narrow values
																								Philadelphia, July 15 (Reuters): Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry tried today to exploit US President George W. Bushs rejection of a speaking invitation from the oldest US Black organisation and said that as President he would not shut the door on his critics.																								In a speech to the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Kerry chided Bush for promoting narrow values and policies that he said tolerate racial and economic inequalities in US society.																								I will be a President who talks with everyone, those who agree with me and those who dont, the Massachusetts Senator said in his first public appearance in three days. I will be a President who truly is a uniter, not one who seeks to divide our nation by race, riches or any other label.																								His remarks came a week after Bush said he would not accept the NAACPs invitation to address it because the groups members have persistently criticised administration tax and social policies that they say have hurt Black Americans.																								Republicans say the President has helped minority-owned businesses and minority homeowners. Bush will speak next Friday to the National Urban League, a civil-rights group that emphasises economic access for minorities. 																								But the NAACP snub still left Bush on the defensive and gave Kerry a charged backdrop for the roll-out of $3 million in new campaign ads aimed at Black and Hispanic voters.

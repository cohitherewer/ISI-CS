 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Saddam brings back Osama
 Dubai, Jan. 5 (Reuters):  The Arabic television channel Al Jazeera aired an audio  tape yesterday purported to be from al Qaida leader Osama  bin Laden in which he mentioned the arrest of Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein by US troops last month. Saddam was captured  on December 13. 																								A CIA analysis found that the tape is likely the voice of Osama bin Laden, a CIA official said today. After conducting a technical analysis, the CIAs assessment is that it is likely bin Ladens voice, the CIA official said on condition on anonymity																								In Washington, a CIA spokesman said it might take a couple of days to determine whether the tape, which sounded like previous broadcast recordings by the al Qaida leader, was genuine.																								The voice said Muslim and Arab leaders had reason to fear the precedent of letting foreigners topple a Muslim government, especially after they saw the capture of their former comrade in treachery and collaboration with America  meaning Saddam.																								The recording, which rambled like a sermon between a myriad of topics, urged Muslims to fight US occupation forces in Iraq and criticised Gulf Arab governments for supporting Washingtons invasion of an Arab country. It said the fall of Baghdad would be a precursor to a US occupation of Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Gulf Arab states. There should be no dialogue with the occupiers except with arms, and this is what we should strive for, the voice said.																								The West is trying to kill whoever carries the banner of Islam under the pretence of combating terrorism because they all know that jihad (holy struggle) is the effective power to foil all their conspiracies... Gulf Arab states know that their turn (for a US invasion) is coming and they dont have the will to make the difficult decision to confront the aggression. 																								The voice also criticised West Asia peace moves, singling out the US-backed road map for an Israeli-Palestinian peace and a symbolic peace accord signed in Geneva as an attempt to destroy (Jerusalems) al-Aqsa mosque and to vanquish jihad and mujahideen in Palestine.

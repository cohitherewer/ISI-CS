The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Prime opener for Passion
				 	 Mel Gibson: Passion pays Los Angeles, Jan. 15 (Reuters):  Sometimes a little faith can go a long way.																								Mel Gibsons controversial new film, The Passion of Christ, which at first had a hard time finding a distributor, will be independently released on about 2,000 screens in the US next month, a Gibson spokesperson said yesterday.																								A release on 2,000 screens is similar to what a major studio release would receive.																								The movie, whose dialogue is in Latin and Aramaic, covers the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ and has come under fire from some Jewish groups who claim its story could foment anti-Semitism by tying Christs death to Jewish authorities.																								But Catholic and Protestant groups, as well as biblical scholars, have defended the film, saying it sticks closely to accounts of the crucifixion as told in the New Testament.																								Pope John Paul saw the movie in December and told his longtime Polish secretary Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, It is as it was, meaning he considered it an authentic portrayal of Gospel accounts, a Vatican source said.																								Even though Gibson is a high-profile actor and Oscar-winning director of films such as Braveheart, Passion of Christ could not find a major motion picture studio that would distribute it due to the controversy. 																								In October, Gibsons Icon Productions film company and independent movie specialist Newmarket Films agreed to jointly distribute Passion of Christ starting on February 25.

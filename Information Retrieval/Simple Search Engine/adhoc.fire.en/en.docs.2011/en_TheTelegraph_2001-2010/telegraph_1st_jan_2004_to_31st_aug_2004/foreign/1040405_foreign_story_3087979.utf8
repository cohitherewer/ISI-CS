 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 US, Afghan troops set for Qaida offensive
																								Spin Boldak (Afghanistan), April 4 (Reuters): Afghan and US forces will soon launch an attack on al Qaida militants who fled from an offensive in Pakistans tribal lands into Afghanistan, an Afghan official said today.																								Pakistani troops fought a 12-day battle against about 500 al Qaida fighters and their Pakistani tribal allies on Pakistans western border with Afghanistan last month. The Pakistani military said about 200 were captured or killed.																								The governor of Afghanistans Paktika province, Haji Gulab Mangal, said a large number of militants had escaped from the fighting in Pakistans South Waziristan and taken refuge in Afghan mountains.																								Afghan forces have been told to be ready and soon an operation along with allied forces will be carried out against these elements, Mangal said.																								Pakistan has mounted its biggest ever campaign to pacify its lawless and largely autonomous tribal region on the Afghan border and clear the area of foreign fighters. 																								As Pakistani forces hunt on their side, US forces have mounted an operation on the Afghan side of the border in what the Pentagon has called a hammer and anvil action to catch al Qaida leaders, possibly Osama bin Laden.

(AFP)																								Beijing, Feb. 26 (Reuters): North Korea gave signs today it was willing to halt its nuclear weapons programmes but blamed the United States for lack of progress in six-party talks in China.																								The North, in a hastily arranged evening news conference, fell back on familiar rhetoric and said that if the US halted its hostile policy against Pyongyang, it would give up its nuclear weapons development programmes. The US is saying that it can only discuss our demands after we give up all nuclear programmes, including for peaceful purposes, as it continues with its stale demand that we give up nuclear programmes first despite our flexible position, the embassy said. It is because of this that there has not been a breakthrough in the solution of the problems.																								US assistant secretary of state James Kelly told reporters he could only comment on the North Korean statement after he had read it. After two days of talks in the exclusive Daioyutai State Guest House in Beijing, details of North Korean proposals were murky and it was not clear what would be agreed in the next session tomorrow. China has said it wants a written agreement.																								Russia said earlier the North was ready to freeze its military nuclear programme, but not its peaceful one. Chinas Xinhua agency quoted a North Korean official as saying it was willing to freeze all its nuclear programmes. Diplomatic sources said North Korea also continued to deny it had a uranium enrichment programme for nuclear weapons, the crux of its disagreement with the US. During todays round, South Korea, China and Russia offered North Korea energy aid in exchange for freezing its weapons programmes, delegates from the sides said.																								Russia said the United States and Japan were not ready to take part in the compensation plan.																								With the talks heading into a third day on Friday, the six sides were working on a joint statement, the establishment of a working group and when next to meet, delegates said. A Japanese official said the talks would continue beyond Friday if necessary. Russian deputy foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov said North Korea proposed stopping its military nuclear programmes, but wanted to be able to continue their peaceful ones, a reference to nuclear power plants under construction.

 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Madonna in Israel holy whirl
				 	 Madonna: Like a prayerJerusalem, June 24 (AP): Madonna is planning to tour holy places in Israel in October with a group of more than 100 students studying Kabbalah, or jewish mysticism, the Israeli newspaper Maariv reported today.																								 Madonna, who recently announced that she wants to be known by the name of the Jewish heroine Esther, has been deeply immersed in Kabbalah studies in recent years. Madonna now wears a red thread on her wrist, a common Jewish charm to ward off the evil eye.																								According to Maariv, Madonna decided to come here with her fellow Kabbalah students after she cancelled a tour in Israel. London tabloids reported that Madonna called off the concert after letters from an unidentified Palestinian group threatened to kill her children.																								Madonnas trip is planned to coincide with the Jewish new year, Maariv reported. She will stay in an out-of-the-way guest house and avoid fans and TV cameras so she will be able to focus on her Kabbalah studies, the newspaper reported.

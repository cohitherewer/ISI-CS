 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Saudi cleric condemns bombing
																								Riyadh, April 22 (Reuters): Saudi Arabias top cleric said today the people behind a suicide car bombing in Riyadh would burn in hell for killing innocent Muslims in the attack, which a militant group linked to al Qaida said it carried out.																								The Islamist group, Al Haramain Brigades, said it was responsible for yesterdays blast that destroyed a security force headquarters and vowed to carry out more bombings against government symbols.																								A security officer died of his wounds today, raising the official death toll to five, with 148 hurt. 																								Diplomats in the Saudi capital said they also had conflicting death figures. Saudi authorities looked for evidence at the site of the destroyed compound, sifting through the rubble. God has promised wrath, damnation, painful torture and an eternity burning in hell for he who deliberately kills a Muslim... Unjustly killing a Muslim is the gravest crime which cannot be atoned, said the kingdoms highest religious authority, Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah al-Sheikh.

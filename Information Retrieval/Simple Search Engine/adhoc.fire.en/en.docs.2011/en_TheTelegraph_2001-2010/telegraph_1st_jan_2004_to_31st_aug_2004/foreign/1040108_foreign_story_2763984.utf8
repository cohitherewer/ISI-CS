																								Washington, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Women who smoke may have a far higher risk of breast cancer than those who do not, or those who once smoked but quit, US researchers reported today.																								California women who said they were current smokers had a 30 per cent greater incidence of breast cancer than non-smokers, the researchers reported in this weeks issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.																								Peggy Reynolds and colleagues at the California department of health services studied 16,544 women between 1996 and 2000. 																								Women who described themselves as current smokers had a 30 per cent higher risk of being among the cancer patients.																								 Those who started smoking before age 20, who began smoking at least five years before their first full-term pregnancy and who smoked the most or the longest all had higher risks.

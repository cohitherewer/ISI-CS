 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Bird flu 10 close ranks
 							 - China reflects WHO urgency																								Bangkok, Jan. 28 (Reuters): The 10 Asian countries hit by the rapid spread of bird flu, which has killed at least eight people and threatens to develop into an epidemic worse than Sars, today promised to fight it together.																								Details of what they agreed were sparse as their task loomed even larger now that the lethal virus has struck in China, the worlds most populous country, the birthplace of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and home to a vast poultry industry.																								But the WHO said the one-day meeting in Bangkok, also attended by EU and US officials, was a good start. This meeting is the beginning of the process. Quite clearly theyre going to start to work together now, said WHO spokesperson Peter Cordingley, who described some delegates as clearly shaken by the rapid onslaught of the H5N1 avian flu virus.																								Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao reflected the urgency displayed by the WHO which, with two other international organisations, has called for money and expertise to launch an all-out war on the bird flu virus. Any epidemic must be eradicated as soon as it occurs to prevent it from spreading, the Chinese leaders were quoted by state television as saying. Such an epidemic must be contained in one spot and cut off to prevent it from infecting humans.																								China is slaughtering poultry around three farms in three regions where bird flu was confirmed yesterday, the latest of the quick fire eruptions across Asia from Pakistan to Japan which the WHO says has no historical precedent.																								The Bangkok statement said that was the right thing to do and rapid culling was the preferred solution to an outbreak, something Indonesia said it cannot do because it doesnt have the money to compensate farmers.																								The statement promised a regional animal survey system to be plugged into the health network to make it easier to tackle diseases such as bird flu and Sars which leap the species barrier.																								The great fear is that the H5N1 avian flu virus might mate with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it. So far, there is no evidence of transmission between people.

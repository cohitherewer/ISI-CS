																								Rome, June 28: A security barrier has been installed at the Leaning Tower of Pisa to protect against a possible terrorist attack.																								The wrought iron barrier, 70 feet long and 6.5 feet high, will keep the public away from the 12th-century tower when it is closed at night. Security is being tightened up at several historically important or politically sensitive sites in Italy, which supported the Iraq war. 																								The barrier at Pisa is the first of four that will eventually seal off the monument entirely from adjoining streets and piazzas.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

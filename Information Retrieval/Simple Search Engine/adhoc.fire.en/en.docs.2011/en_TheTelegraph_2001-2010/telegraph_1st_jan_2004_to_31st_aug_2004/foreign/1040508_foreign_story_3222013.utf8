 Saturday, May 08, 2004 				 Repentant Rumsfeld bears abuse burden
				 	 Donald Rumsfeld testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington on Friday. (Reuters)																								Washington, May 7 (Reuters): Defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld took responsibility today for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US personnel and offered his deepest apology to the victims in the face of partisan demands that he step down.																								These events occurred on my watch as secretary of defence. I am accountable for them. I take full responsibility, Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee.																								I feel terrible about what happened to these detainees. They are human beings, they were in US custody, our country had an obligation to treat them right. We didnt. That was wrong, he said.																								To those Iraqis who were mistreated by members of the US armed forces, I offer my deepest apology.																								Rumsfeld, lacking his trademark bravado, said he had ordered the formation of a special commission to investigate the actions. But Arizona Senator John McCain said Americans needed all the available information at once.																								Several Democrats, including presidential candidate John Kerry, have called for Rumsfelds resignation because of the physical and sexual abuse of Iraqis held at the Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad, which had previously served as a torture centre under deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.																								However, President George W. Bush has said he retains confidence in his defence secretary. Republican lawmakers were reserving judgment until after Rumsfelds testimony. He was also due to appear before the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee. 																								The committee chairman, Virginia Republican Senator John Warner, said the abuse, vividly depicted in photographs of naked Iraqi detainees being mocked, humiliated and sexually abused by US personnel, represented as serious a case of military misconduct as he had ever seen in his long career.																								Michigan Democratic Senator Carl Levin called the abuse depraved and despicable. He said Congress needed to know how far up the chain of command the abuse went, whether it was part of a conscious policy, condoned by top officials, of softening up detainees before interrogation. So far, six people have been criminally charged and six military personnel have been reprimanded.																								Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy said Rumsfeld had shown a disregard for the Geneva Convention that protects the rights of prisoners. He asked how long Rumsfeld had known about the abuses and kept them secret.																								Rumsfeld said the US military had announced the allegations of abuses as soon as they were known. They werent hiding anything. They disclosed it to the world.																								Hecklers shouting slogans interrupted the session shortly after Rumsfeld began his opening statement. The defence secretary sat calmly, sipping his water, as they were peaceably removed from the chamber.																								Rumsfeld said there were many more photographs and video tapes that have not been published showing cruel and sadistic acts by US personnel.																								The scandal exploded last week with the release of photographs showing grinning uniformed personnel posing in front of naked detainees. One photograph that appeared yesterday depicted a naked Iraqi on his knees with a leash around his neck that was held by an American servicewoman.																								Bush apologised for the abuse yesterday. He rebuked Rumsfeld but said he wanted the defence secretary to remain in his job.																								The New York Times, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, New York Newsday, Boston Globe, Minneapolis Star Tribune and Detroit Free Press all called for Rumsfeld to step down in editorials yesterday or today.																								The US military also said today it had punished two army Reserve soldiers who assaulted prisoners while working as guards at the Guantanamo Bay prison for terrorism suspects.																								Republicans and Democrats were fuming that Rumsfeld had met lawmakers on the day the scandal broke and gave them no warning of the images of naked, humiliated prisoners that were to be televised that night.																								Congress does not like to be surprised, said Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican.

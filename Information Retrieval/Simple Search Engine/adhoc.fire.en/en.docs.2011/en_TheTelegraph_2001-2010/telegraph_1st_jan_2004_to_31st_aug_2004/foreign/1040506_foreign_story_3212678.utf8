New York, May 5 (Reuters): The Internet cant make you beautiful, but it does cater to a host of vanities, from the search for the perfect eye shadow to the ultimate make-over, plastic surgery.																								If you have ever wondered whether television hit Friends star Jennifer Anistons signature hairstyle would complement your own cheekbones, the Makeover--Matic (www.substance.com/es/mom) can paste celebrity hairdos onto your scanned photograph.																								A similar site, makeoversolutions.com, lets visitors play with blush tones and lipstick on a number of models faces, as well as their own photos, to determine whether winter or summer colours suit them best.																								Looking for more a radical way to fix a troublesome flaw or revive a fading youth?																								An estimated 80 per cent of cosmetic surgery practices have their own websites to advertise procedures, and a growing community of patients are sharing their experiences, and photographs, online in vivid detail.																								For Wendy Kane, the Web was an indispensable source of information as she considered her first foray into cosmetic surgery  a lower body lift to sculpt hips and thighs after a major weight loss.																								Kane, a US Air Force events planner in central Georgia, dropped nearly 68 kg through a gastric bypass surgery after struggling with her weight for nearly 20 years. 																								She went to the Internet to look for a cosmetic change that best suited her, and to find a reputable surgeon from the selection there.																								I did research on the Web on the different things out there for people who had a lot of weight loss, she said. I would not have felt as comfortable had I not been able to learn more about it ahead of time.																								Kanes surgeon, Dr. Richard Greco of Savannah, Georgia, said that most new patients come to his office through referrals. But Internet research is often a touchstone for discussing the kind of expectations a patient has, including using the wealth of before-and-after images available online.																								They have read about the procedures and they are more ready to schedule surgery  they have made up their minds, Greco said. It has really reduced the amount of people who call up just to get information.																								Greco belongs to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), whose website (www.plasticsurgery.org) allows visitors to locate certified surgeons in their geographic area. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (www.surgery.org) offers similar advice and an extensive photo gallery of results, from nose jobs to tummy tucks.																								Liposuction and breast augmentation are the Webs most widely researched forms of plastic surgery, since the procedures appeal to a young clientele and can be photographed without revealing a patients face, said Dr. Brian Kinney, a Los Angeles-based plastic surgeon and chairman of ASPS Web editorial committee.																								In 1993 to 1995, there was a lot of conservatism...saying we shouldnt be showing bare breasts (online), Kinney said. But then we saw that patients wanted them. The before-and-after pictures have been extremely valuable.																								Kinney cautioned that nearly half of medical information online was inaccurate, or could simply mislead a person to think that what works for someone else would suit them as well. He said surgeons should also offer prospective patients a glimpse at less-than-perfect results to give them a more realistic view.																								The ABC television network does little to dampen expectations with its Extreme Make-over site (abc.go.com/primetime/extrememakeover), a companion to a weekly programme in which plain Janes and Joes undergo multiple plastic surgery procedures to transform themselves. A link on the site offers graphic footage of the actual surgeries.																								Rival network Fox is no less effusive about the hidden beauty unearthed on its plastic surgery-laden show The Swan at www.fox.com/swan/home.htm.																								An unvarnished account of surgery can be found at www.implantinfo.com, an Internet site devoted to the personal tales of women who opted for breast implants. The sites True Life Journals documents surgeries that were a success as well as some that went awry.																								Similar sites for liposuction www.liposite.com and facial surgery www.faceforum.com allow prospective patients to chat with veterans about their procedures.																								And in a final word to the wise, awfulplasticsurgery.com gives an unauthorised view of celebrities who appear far worse after being nipped and tucked.

 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Spain imbecile slur on Blair
 ISAMBARD WILKINSON				 	 Tony Blair: Spanish dig																								Madrid, Jan. 16: Tony Blair has been called a complete dickhead by a leading Spanish politician live on television. The comment was made by Jose Bono, one of the three most powerful figures in the Socialist Party. 																								His remarks were not intended to be heard, but were recorded by a television team while he was talking to Joaquin Almunia, a former Socialist leader. Bono said: Hey, and our colleague Blair? Hes a complete dickhead (un gilipollas integral). Hes an imbecile. 																								The comments contrast with the Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznars carefully cultivated friendship with Blair and will embarrass the Socialists.																								The party is irritated by Blairs friendship with Aznar and dislikes the resulting Anglo-Spanish alliance.																								There is little question that were Spains conservatives to lose power, the London-Madrid axis would collapse.																								Bono, a staunch Catholic, is regarded as a potential leader of the Socialist Party of Spanish Workers. The present leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, could be dropped if Aznars centre-Right Peoples Party wins a predicted third successive victory in the March 14 elections.																								 That would mirror the upheaval in the Popular Party where Aznar will step down at the election and make way for his successor Mariano Rajoy. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Name-drop heat piles on Kerry
				 	 John Kerry																								Bethlehem (Pennsylvania), March 15 (Reuters): Democratic White House candidate John Kerry was challenged over his comments that some foreign leaders wanted him to beat President George W. Bush, but he refused to reveal any of their names.																								Reacting to comments made by secretary of state Colin Powell in a television interview, and a question raised by a persistent Republican at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania, Kerry repeated his contention that foreign leaders were encouraging his presidential bid because of unhappiness with US policy.																								But he refused to name the leaders and said some of the conversations were by telephone, not face-to-face. 																								No leader would obviously share a conversation if I started listing them, Kerry told reporters after Powell suggested he name some names or stop implying foreign leaders wanted him to beat Bush.																								I dont think Colin Powell or the president would start listing names of people who had said something critical of something or somebody. Im not going to do that, he said.																								The White House today called on Kerry to name the foreign leaders. If Kerry refuses, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said, then he is probably making it up. Kerry, who visited Pennsylvania to criticise Bushs health care policy, said last week he had met foreign leaders who cant say this publicly, but boy they look at you and say youve got to win this, youve got to beat this guy, we need a new policy.																								Powell took issue with the comments on Fox News Sunday, saying: If he feels it is that important an assertion to make, he ought to list some names. If he cant list names, then perhaps he should find something else to talk about.																								The Massachusetts senator also was challenged by Cedrick Brown, owner of a small business in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and a registered Republican who demanded at a town hall meeting to know who the leaders were.																								Kerry, who last travelled overseas in late 2002, insisted to reporters that he both talked to and met with foreign leaders who were rooting for him. He said during the town hall that he talked to several in the past week.																								He said the leaders were at all different levels of government and said their support was fuelled by dissatisfaction with US unilateralism and an arrogant foreign policy.

 Wednesday, July 21, 2004 				 Sharon urged to clarify 
																								Paris, July 20 (Reuters): France said today it was still waiting for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to explain a call for French Jews to emigrate immediately to Israel, but signalled it wanted to end the diplomatic row quickly.																								A day after France put on hold an invitation for Sharon to visit Paris until he explains his comments, France and Israel both said the row arose from a misunderstanding and an Israeli official said Israel was preparing to offer clarifications. French foreign minister Michel Barnier said France wanted to move on from the dispute to focus its diplomatic efforts in West Asia on seeking peace. We are waiting for explanations, Barnier told Europe 1 radio. But he sought to avoid making any comments that would worsen the dispute. What is true is that there has been a serious misunderstanding, he said.

 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Nagasaki bomber dies at 84
																								Boston, July 18 (Reuters): The pilot of the US bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, in the last days of World War II died in a Boston hospital on Friday.																								Charles W. Sweeney, who later rose to the rank of brigadier-general in the US Air Force, died of natural causes at Massachusetts General Hospital, his son, Joseph, said today. He was 84.																								Sweeney was 25 when he and the crew of a B-29 bomber known as Bocks Car circled over Nagasaki several times on August 9, 1945, before a break in the clouds allowed them to release their 10,000-pound nuclear weapon, nicknamed Fat Man. Some 70,000 were killed.																								His son said Sweeney remembered thinking that he had an enormously sensitive mission to perform and that he had better not bungle it. Three days earlier the Enola Gay, another US bomber, dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Sweeney was involved in that attack as well, flying a plane that aided the Enola Gay, his son said.

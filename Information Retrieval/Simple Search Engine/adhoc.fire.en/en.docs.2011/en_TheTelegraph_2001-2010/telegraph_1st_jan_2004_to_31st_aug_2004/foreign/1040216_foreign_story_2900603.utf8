 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Women win war for screen space
 (From top) Charlize  Theron, Cate Blanchett and Nicole Kidman  Berlin, Feb. 15 (Reuters):  Charlize Theron is in most scenes and kills seven men, Cate  Blanchett is a sharp-shooting 19th century single mum outwitting  men while Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger push their male  co-star into a mere supporting role.																								At the Berlin Film Festival, which ended today, women playing strong characters in those and other productions dominated the screen, and their growing clout was also clearly evident behind the camera as directors, writers and producers. Even the jury  four women and three men  was headed by a woman: Frances McDormand, who won an Oscar in 1997 for Fargo.																								Its about time, McDormand said when asked about the abundance of women in leading roles in films seen in Berlin. Its important. It shows women are doing more writing now too. For anyone who hasnt noticed, we are an interesting gender.																								South Africas Theron won a Silver Bear best actress award yesterday for her stirring performance as a low-life Florida prostitute turned serial killer in Monster. Blanchett eclipsed co-star Tommy Lee Jones in the American Western The Missing. Kidman and Zellweger also outshone Jude Law in the Civil War epic Cold Mountain, which screened out of competition. 																								Zellweger said there are obvious reasons why strong women are now featuring atop cinema marquees more often. People making films are recognising there is value in portraying female characters that way, audiences are interested and theres a market for those sort of films. They are beautiful stories. I think things are definitely changing.																								The festival, one of Europes top three, ended today with public screenings of the competitions highlights. Eight of the 23 films competing for the festivals prizes over the last 11 days featured women in the top role and four films were directed by women, including Monster by Patty Jenkins and Somethings Gotta Give by Nancy Meyers. 																								Many other films, such as a widely applauded love story Before Sunset between an American novelist played by Ethan Hawke and a French environmental worker played by Julie Delpy, evenly balanced their male and female lead characters. 																								Any actress will tell you Im tired of being the girl-friend who laughs at stupid jokes from guys, said American director Richard Linklater.

 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Scientists fire hush-up salvo at Bush regime
				 	 President George W. Bush after addressing troops at Fort Polk, Louisiana. (AP)																								Washington, Feb. 19 (Reuters): Top scientists and environmentalists today accused the Bush administration of suppressing and distorting scientific findings that run counter to its own policies.																								They backed a report from the Union of Concerned Scientists that said the administration had suppressed research on global warming, air quality, sexual health, cancer and other issues. The report said there had been a systematic effort to manipulate the governments supposedly independent scientific advisory system to prevent the appearance of advice that might run counter to the administrations political agenda.																								We are not... taking issue with the administrations policies. We are taking issue with the administrations distortion of the process with which science enters into its decisions, Dr Kurt Gottfried, a professor of physics at Cornell University and chairman of the UCS, said.																								Russell Train, head of the Environmental Protection Agency under former Republican Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, said that during his tenure I do not recall ever receiving a suggestion, let alone an order, from the White House as to how I should make a regulatory decision. How times have changed, Train added.																								Neal Lane of Rice University in Houston and former science adviser to ex-President Bill Clinton said scientific findings were being kept from decision-makers. I am afraid that our leading policymakers simply dont know what they dont know given the manipulation of the science advice process, Lane said.																								The White House denied the accusations. I can assure you that this is an administration that makes decisions based on the best available science, President George W. Bushs spokesman Scott McClellan said.																								I just dont think these incidents or issues add up to strong support for the accusation that this administration is deliberately acting to undermine the processes of science, John Marburger, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a conference call.																								Marburger noted that the group making the complaints included esteemed scientists and said the government obviously needed to do a better job of communicating its policies.																								The UCS reviewed long-standing complaints that the federal government had deliberately disregarded a worldwide consensus that human industrial activity is to blame for much of the steady warming of the planets climate over the past century.																								It also cited what it called the suppression of an EPA study that found the bipartisan Senate Clear Air Bill would do more to reduce mercury contamination in fish and would prevent more deaths than the administrations proposed Clear Skies Act would.

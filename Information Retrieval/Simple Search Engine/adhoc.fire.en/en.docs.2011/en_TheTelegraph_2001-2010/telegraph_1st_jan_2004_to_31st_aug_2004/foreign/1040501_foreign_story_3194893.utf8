 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 China flexes naval muscles
																								Hong Kong, April 30 (Reuters): Eight Chinese warships sailed into the city today in the largest show of military force by Beijing since 1997.																								The visit appeared aimed as a warning to Taiwan after the re-election of a pro-democracy President in March and as a show of force to Hong Kong, where many have been calling for greater democratic freedom. We, the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army, are ready at any time to obey our motherlands orders, vice-admiral Yao Xingyuan, commander of the visiting fleet, told reporters.																								More than a thousand Chinese sailors in gleaming white uniforms crammed the dock area of the base as the flags of China and the PLA fluttered in the breeze.																								Beijing fears the re-election of Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian will mean the island edging closer to a formal declaration of independence. Chens plan to adopt a new constitution in 2008 is just one step Beijing perceives as moving Taiwan towards independence.																								A pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong today said China was expanding the militarys top decision-making body to seven members to suit the needs of modern warfare. Analysts said the move signalled Beijings readiness to go to war over Taiwan. The visit came days after Beijing defied public calls and ruled out universal suffrage for elections for Hong Kongs leader in 2007 and all legislators in 2008. The move sparked protests in the city and more are being planned.																								The PLA has made great contributions to Hong Kongs long-term prosperity and stability, Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa said at a welcoming ceremony for the warships. The fleet is here for six days.																								Memories of PLA soldiers cracking down on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijings Tiananmen Square in June 1989 remain vivid here. More than a million took to the streets to protest the repression.

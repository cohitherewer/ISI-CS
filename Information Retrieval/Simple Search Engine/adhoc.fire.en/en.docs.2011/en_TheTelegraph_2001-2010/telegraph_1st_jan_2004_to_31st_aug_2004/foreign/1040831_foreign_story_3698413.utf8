 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 France in frantic appeal to free hostages
		 French foreign minister  Michel Barnier in Cairo. (AFP)Cairo, Aug. 30 (Reuters): France scrambled to secure the release of two French journalists kidnapped in Iraq by militants who have given Paris an ultimatum to drop its ban on Muslim headscarves in schools.																								French foreign minister Michel Barnier, visiting Egypt as part of a French mission to rally support in Iraq and the region, made an impassioned plea to the Islamic Army in Iraq to free Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot.																								The militant group, which last week said it had killed Italian journalist Enzo Baldoni, on Saturday gave the French government 48 hours to rescind the headscarf ban, without saying what would happen to the two Frenchmen if it failed to comply.																								We will continue, come what may, to follow all contacts ... with civil and religious personalities to explain the reality of the French republic ... and obtain the release of these people, Barnier said in Cairo.																								Iraqi Sunni and Shia groups and Islamic groups outside Iraq urged the kidnappers to release the journalists, noting Frances opposition to the Iraq war and saying journalists were not combatants.																								The crisis stunned France, which campaigned against the US-led war and so had considered itself relatively safe from militant attack. France also opposed the 1990-2003 economic sanctions on Iraq.																								Chesnot of Radio France Internationale and Malbrunot, who writes for the dailies Le Figaro and Ouest France, disappeared on August 20 on their way from Baghdad to Najaf, the day after Baldoni was seized.																								Protests were held across Paris against the kidnappings while French diplomats explored possible solutions.																								Their kidnapping is incomprehensible to all those who know that France ... is a land of tolerance and of respect for others, Barnier said before meeting Arab League chief Amr Moussa and Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit.																								I urge everyone who has power, or has the capabilities, to set the journalists free as soon as possible so that the situation does not become more complicated, Moussa said.																								Aboul Gheit also called for the hostages to be released.																								Barnier said foreign ministry secretary-general Hubert Colin de Verdiere arrived in Baghdad today for crisis talks. Barnier is expected to visit Amman and Qatar, but not Iraq.																								Islamic groups in Iraq sympathised with the French.																								Frances position toward Iraq is good. But we also are against kidnapping all journalists, said Sheikh Abdel Sattar Abdel Jabbar, a top official in the Muslim Clerics Association. Outside Iraq, Egypts Muslim Brotherhood, the Arab worlds largest Islamist organisation spoke out against the kidnapping.

 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Blair on course for third term: Opinion poll
																								London, Aug. 1 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair seems to have survived the worst of the political damage over Iraq and is on course for a third general election win, an opinion poll showed today.																								The MORI poll put Blairs ruling Labour Party on 32 per cent  one point ahead of the Opposition Conservatives whom analysts say would need to be well ahead by now to stand a real chance of winning the next general election, widely expected in May 2005. 																								The Liberal Democrats, who opposed the Iraq war, were on 24 per cent in the survey published in the Independent on Sunday.																								The newspaper said such results at the election would give Blair a comfortable majority of about 80 seats in parliament. 																								It is of course the case that we need to raise our game, senior Conservative Tim Yeo, the partys environment spokesperson, told BBC Television. Of course we would rather be doing better in the opinion polls than we are. Many Britons are furious Blairs main argument for war over Iraq  that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction  proved founded on dodgy information. 																								But two inquiries focusing on the pre-war intelligence have exonerated Blair from any personal blame, and the Conservatives have failed to capitalise on his unpopularity over Iraq.																								Although Conservative leader Michael Howard injected fresh optimism into the party when he took over last November, he was widely panned for a poor showing in parliament.

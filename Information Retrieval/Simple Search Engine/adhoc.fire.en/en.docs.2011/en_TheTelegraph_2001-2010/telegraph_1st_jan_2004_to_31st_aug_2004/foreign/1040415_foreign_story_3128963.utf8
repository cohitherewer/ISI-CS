 Bad time: George Best (top) and Alex Best 																								London, April 14 (Reuters): British soccer legend George Best and his second wife Alex were divorced today after she told a court she found him in bed with another woman.																								Judge Richard Harper took just over two minutes to end their nine-year, often tempestuous marriage. 																								Former air hostess Alex Best, 32, said she discovered the former Manchester United wingers adultery last November. I found the respondent (Best) in the bed of the woman concerned at her home, Alex said in a statement read to Londons high court. The woman was not named.																								Alex announced her separation from Best, 57, last September. It followed newspaper reports that the former Northern Ireland winger had been drinking after a liver transplant in 2002 following decades of alcohol abuse.																								Best said in a BBC television interview in October that he had frequent arguments with his wife. I never really hurt anybody. But Alex and I, we had fights ... actually she did have to go to hospital once. She fell and broke her arm once, Best said.																								Best, who works as a TV soccer analyst and newspaper columnist, said his wife had helped him control his alcoholism in the early part of their marriage.																								If I hadnt met her, I probably would have just carried on, he told the Observer newspaper.

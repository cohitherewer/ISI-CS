 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Christian Arab lied to stay alive
																								Khobar (Saudi Arabia), May 31 (Reuters): A Christian Arab who was held captive by al Qaida militants in Saudi Arabia said today he lied to them about his faith and praised their battle against the West, to save his life.																								Nizar Hajazeen, a Jordanian software businessmen who was at the Tower hotel in the Oasis compound during the 25-hour drama in Khobar, said the militants lectured him about Islam and their aim to liberate Saudi Arabia from infidels and crusaders. Hajazeen, 32, had tried to call a cab to go to work on Saturday but the phone lines were jumbled. I went down and the Filipino receptionist told me there were terrorists in the compound, he said. 																								I went to the room of a Jordanian colleague. Someone banged violently on the door. We opened and there were two men, one with a machinegun, another with a revolver. They were wearing black track suits, he said. 																								They asked us if we were Arab or westerners. We told them: Were Arab. One then asked if I was a Christian or a Muslim. I told him we were Muslims and showed him my colleagues Koran as proof. I told him we were against America.

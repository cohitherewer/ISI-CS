																								London, Feb. 16 (Reuters): A group of marine archaeologists may have solved one of the worlds most enduring maritime mysteries  the final resting place of HMS Beagle in which Charles Darwin developed his landmark theory of evolution.																								This vessel is one of the most significant in the history of scientific research, Robert Prescott of the Beagle Ship Research Group said by telephone.																								So far all that has been seen is a radar image of the outline of a hull under some four metres of mud in the marshes of Essex, east of London, with further research needed to verify that it is indeed the Beagle. 																								For such a famous ship, the Beagle has been frustratingly hard to find, having disappeared from sight more than a century ago.																								But Prescott, who is based at St Andrews University in Scotland, is confident they have found their quarry. 																								We have followed a carefully researched trail that has led us to this berth, he said.

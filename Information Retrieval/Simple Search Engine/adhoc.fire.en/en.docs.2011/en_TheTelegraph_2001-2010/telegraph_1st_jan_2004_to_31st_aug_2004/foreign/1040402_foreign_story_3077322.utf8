 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Planned US sale of radar to Taiwan angers China
																								Beijing/Washington, April 1 (Reuters): China scolded the US today for its planned sale of long-range early-warning radar worth up to $1.78 billion to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province.																								The Pentagon said the ground-based, ultra-high-frequency radar would boost Taiwans ability to identify and detect ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and air-breathing target threats, or weapons that operate in the Earths atmosphere.																								The US acknowledges Chinas claim to Taiwan, but makes no statement about Taiwans status. It remains the self-ruling islands main arms supplier, major trade partner and biggest ally despite last months controversial re-election of pro-independence President Chen Shui-bian. We have always opposed US sales of advanced weapons to Taiwan, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan said in Beijing.																								Especially under the current complicated and sensitive situation across the Taiwan Strait, we ask the US to be faithful to what it says and abide by its promises and not send the wrong signal to Taiwans independence (seekers).																								For his part, Chen urged the US to take a more active, constructive role in encouraging dialogue between Taiwan and China, diplomatic and ideological foes since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.																								In a newspaper interview published today, Chen made clear he had no intention of backing down from his stance that Taiwan and China were separate entities or to ease off on policy proposals to which Beijing objects.

 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 US Kashmir verdict
 JAMES DAO																								Alexandria (Virginia), March 5: In a victory for the Bush administrations campaign to root out home-grown terrorism, a federal judge convicted three American Muslims yesterday of conspiring to help a Pakistani group wage violent jihad against Indian forces in Kashmir and possibly US troops in Afghanistan. 																								Federal prosecutors had portrayed the men, two of them US-born converts and one a Pakistani immigrant, as radical Muslims who had prepared to fight for Islamic causes overseas by acquiring weapons, as well as training at a camp for mujahideen fighters in Pakistan. 																								The defence had disputed that depiction, arguing the men were moderate Muslims who never intended to hurt Americans. They asserted the prosecution had been driven by anti-Muslim bias. 																								In a 75-page ruling issued from the bench yesterday, judge Leonie M. Brinkema came down squarely behind the prosecutions argument, calling the defendants denials incredible. Though she found each of the defendants not guilty on some of the indictments numerous counts, she convicted them on most of the major conspiracy and weapons charges against them. 																								I could not find the testimony of the two defendants credible, Brinkema said from the bench, referring to the testimony of Seifullah Chapman and Hammad Abdur-Raheem. The third defendant, Masoud Ahmad Khan, did not take the witness stand. 																								Brinkeman said the defendants claims of innocence amounted to a blind and deliberate ignorance of the law that did not justify wrongdoing, adding that she found the case poignant because the defendants appeared to be good fathers and husbands. The justice department issued a statement praising the verdict as a major victory against Islamic terrorists efforts to recruit, train and finance jihad in America.																								Brinkema ordered Chapman and Adbur-Raheem, who had been free on bail, held at the federal detention centre in Alexandria until their sentencing hearing in June. Khan was already being held at the detention centre. The three men were part of a broader indictment handed up last year that charged 11 men with plotting to assist the Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Toiba.																								All three men had rejected plea agreements that would have given them much shorter prison sentences than what they now face, their lawyers said. Khan, who was convicted on the most serious charges, could receive more than 100 years in prison.

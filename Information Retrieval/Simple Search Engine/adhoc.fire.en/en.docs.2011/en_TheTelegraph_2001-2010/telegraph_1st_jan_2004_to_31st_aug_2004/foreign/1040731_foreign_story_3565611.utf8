The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, July 31, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Croaks corner frogs																																	 London, July 30 (Reuters): British biologists have taken a leaf out of the literary Doctor Doolittles book and started talking to their animals.																																	We have been croaking to our tree frogs for about two weeks now. They respond and it makes it easier to find them, Robin Mulford, a biologist at Bournemouth Oceanarium on Englands south coast, said today. We croak and the males croak back. But the females stay quiet, he said by telephone.																						The chatty, colour-changing male frogs respond to any loud noise, trying to outdo the volume and attract a mate. But while the Bournemouth biologists may manage to fool the male tree frogs, the females are proving more canny. None of us has attracted a female with our croaking so far, Mulford said.																													 																Road rage for driving slowly Berlin (Reuters): A German truck driver beat up a motorist he believed was driving too slowly in a case of road rage in a country famous for having no limits on stretches of its motorways. The trucker got in a fight with a car driver who had been slowing him down by observing a 30 kmph speed limit in a built-up area. Police in the western town of Bochum said the truck driver told them he felt provoked by the motorist because he was actually driving 30 kmph in a 30 kmph area. The trucker faces an investigation and may lose his driving licence.

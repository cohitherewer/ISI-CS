 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 WHO clean chit on flu came too early
 Geneva, Feb. 10 (Reuters):  The World Health Organisation (WHO) said today it had jumped  the gun in declaring tests on victims had shown no genetic  evidence that bird flu could be passed from person to person.																								It said latest information showed that it was too early to make that conclusion. Last Fridays announcement by the UN agency had been greeted with huge relief because of fears that the deadly virus, which has prompted the culling of millions of chickens and other fowl across Asia, could spread quickly amongst humans.																								But the WHO said that there had been a mix-up in the testing of two Vietnamese sisters who died after catching it, and that results initially given for one of them had turned out to be from another victim instead.																								The sequencing announced on Friday by WHO showed that the two viruses were both entirely of avian origin with no human genes, indicating the viruses had not become adapted to be easily transmitted from one human to another, it said.																								Today, WHO has learned that the virus from only one sister has been sequenced, it said, adding that the results from the other sister were expected later this week. Until then, no firm conclusions could be drawn, particularly because it was the second, so far untested sister, who was of particular interest, WHO officials said.

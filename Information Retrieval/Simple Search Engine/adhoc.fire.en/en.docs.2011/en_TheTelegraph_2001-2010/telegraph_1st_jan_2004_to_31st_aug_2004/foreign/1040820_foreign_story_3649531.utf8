 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Killer flu strain found in Malaysia
																								Kampung Pasir Pekan (Malaysia), Aug. 19 (Reuters): A strain of bird flu blamed for 27 deaths in Asia this year has been found in Malaysia, the government said today, as hundreds of birds were gassed and their carcasses burnt to contain the outbreak.																								Two chickens that died in a northern village near the Thai border were found to be infected with the deadly strain in Malaysias first bird flu outbreak, said Abi Musa Asaari Mohamed Nor, secretary-general of the agriculture ministry. The results (from tests of the birds) show they were H5N1, which is pathogenic, which is the dangerous one, he said in Kuala Lumpur.																								In Geneva, the WHO called the sudden outbreak of the virus strain in Malaysia disconcerting and said there was still the risk it could jump to humans, with pandemic potential. Malaysia was now on nationwide alert for bird flu cases.

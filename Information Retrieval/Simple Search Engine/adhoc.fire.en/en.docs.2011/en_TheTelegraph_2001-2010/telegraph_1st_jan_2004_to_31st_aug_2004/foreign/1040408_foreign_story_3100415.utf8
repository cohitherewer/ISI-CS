 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 White House resists 9/11 panel bid for Rice speech
				 	 Lips sealed: Condoleeza Rice 																								Washington, April 7 (Reuters): The White House has refused to provide the panel investigating the September 11, 2001 attacks with a speech national security adviser Condoleezza Rice was to deliver on that day touting missile defence as a priority rather than al Qaida, sources said yesterday.																								With Rice slated to testify publicly before the commission tomorrow, the commission submitted a last-minute request for access to Rices aborted September 11, 2001 address, sources close to the panel said.																								But the White House has so far refused on the grounds that draft documents are confidential, the sources said.																								A spokesperson for the commission would neither confirm nor deny the request, or the administrations response. The White House said it was cooperating with the investigation. 																								The White House is working with the commission to ensure that it has access to what it needs to do its job, White House spokesperson Trent Duffy said.																								Critics of the administration have seized on Rices scrubbed speech to back up charges that President George W. Bush and his top advisers ignored an urgent al Qaida threat before the September 11 attacks.																								The Washington Post, citing former US officials, reported last week that the speech was designed to promote missile defence as the cornerstone of a new national security strategy, and contained no mention of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, or Islamic extremist groups.																								Daniel Feldman, who was a director at the National Security Council under Bushs predecessor, Democrat Bill Clinton, said that the excerpts appeared to reflect the intellectual underpinnings for the administrations pre-9/11 neglect of counterterrorism.																								Thats why its critical that the White House release the full text of the speech and for the commission to ask Dr. Rice about the apparent inconsistencies, Feldman said.																								A main area of questioning for Rice is expected to be claims by former US counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke that Bush ignored the threat posed by al Qaida before the September 11 attacks and was fixated on Iraq.

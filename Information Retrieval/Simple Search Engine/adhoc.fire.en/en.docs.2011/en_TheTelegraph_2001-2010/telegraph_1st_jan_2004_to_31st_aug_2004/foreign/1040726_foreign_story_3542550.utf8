 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Stars threaten to rock Bush re-election bid
 GEOFF BOUCHER				 	 George W. Bush: Music menace																								Los Angeles, July 25: Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, R.E.M., Pearl Jam and a big roster of other rock stars will unite for a series of politically minded concerts this winter that will give voice to dissatisfaction with the Bush administration. 																								The all-star rock show, which is expected to begin in October and target campaign swing states, is in the planning stages but was confirmed by half a dozen music industry sources who spoke on the condition of not being identified. (From top) Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and Pearl Jams singer Eddie VedderInsiders disagreed on the unifying rhythm of the celebrity coalition: Some said it is the promise of the John Kerry candidacy but at least one thought it was simply the potential of a Bush re-election. There is a range of feeling about Kerry, the source said, but a uniform belief that Bush must go.The high-profile tour dramatically turns up the volume of the rock scenes role in 2004 politics but it is not the only example of an apparent surge of political commentary among artists. The rock reaction seems all but uniform in its anti-Bush stance, just as in country music there has been a passionate patriotism and support of the President, as exemplified by the songs of Toby Keith. 																								On MTV, the British dance-pop outfit Faithless has a popular video that shows a teen shipped off to Iraq only to return home wounded and disillusioned. Representing a different generation, Tom Waits and John Fogerty have each recorded songs about Iraq  for Waits its the first political song of his four-decade career, for Fogerty its a return to his Vietnam-era songs such as Wholl Stop the Rain. 																								Elsewhere, rapper Sean P. Diddy Combs is steering a new voter registration drive and the usually bratty punk-pop band Green Day has announced that their next album will be a political concept piece. Steve Earle has a new album laced with Iraq and Bush songs and even a mocking Valentine to presidential adviser Condoleezza Rice while blues player Keb Mo has an upcoming CD of peace sons, including John Lennons Imagine and the Buffalo Springfields For What Its Worth.

 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Bono puffs, regrets
																								Dublin, June 18 (Reuters): Rock and roll aint what it used to be. U2 frontman Bono has apologised  for having a cigarette.																								The breach of Irelands new smoking ban was committed last week during a night out with Californian rockers The Red Hot Chili Peppers.																								The singer was spotted lighting up during a late-night bash in the Clarence Hotel. It was the wee small hours. I was in the company of people from out of town who didnt know about the ban and for a moment nor did I, newspapers quoted Bono as saying today. I was reminded by the staff and a few friends. I apologised then and I apologise now.

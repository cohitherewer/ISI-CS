 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Forget Britney, Janet rips the shock scale
				 	 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake during the Super Bowl half-time show in Houston. (Reuters) Houston, Feb. 2 (Reuters):  Move over Madonna and Britney  their onstage kiss may be  upstaged by singer Janet Jacksons bodice-ripping at a Super  Bowl performance. Jackson turned heads yesterday night during  a half-time appearance with Justin Timberlake during the  American Football game between Carolina Panthers and New  England Patriots, bumping and grinding through a duet.																								Just as the song came to its close, Timberlake reached for Jackson and tore part of her black leather bustier.																								Stage lights at Houstons Reliant Stadium immediately went black, leaving millions of football fans watching the CBS network broadcast wondering whether the peek-a-boo act was intentional. Im sorry if anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl, Timberlake said. It was not intentional and is regrettable. Music television channel MTV, which produced the half-time entertainment for the National Football Leagues championship game, apologised for the undressing.																								The tearing of Janet Jacksons costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance, MTV said in a statement.																								But some viewers may not be convinced that the two singers were not raising the threshold on shocking behaviour, mindful of how pop icon Madonna and Britney Spears grabbed headlines with a kiss during the MTV Music Video Awards in August.																								Shocking as it was, it was not a mistake. Its really sad. How are we going to up the ante next? said Barbara Lippert, advertising critic at trade report AdWeek. The National Football League (NFL) was also not impressed. We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced halftime show, said NFL executive vice-president Joe Browne. They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the content of the show, he added. Its unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime.																								An outraged Federal Communications Commission chairman Michael Powell today ordered an investigation into the broadcast of the half-time show.																								That celebration was tainted by a class-less, crass and deplorable stunt, Powell said in a statement. Our nations children, parents and citizens deserve better. Powell promised a thorough and swift investigation by the agencys enforcement division. Scores of complaints were coming in about Jackson and other portions of the entertainment segment of the game.

Qom (Iran), Feb. 20 (Reuters): Faizolah Hazrati may not know anything about the three candidates he voted for in Irans parliamentary election today, but he knows exactly why he voted for them.																								I voted for Islam, the wrinkled and stooped former farmer, who gave his age as about 100-years-old, said at a busy polling station in Qom, the nerve centre of Irans Islamic theocracy about 125 km south of Tehran.																								Like many in the desert city where thousands of religious students study under the tutelage of leading Shia clerics, Hazrati turned to the theological schools for advice on who to vote for today. We vote for the ones that the theological school recommends, explained his son, Abbas, a local government employee.																								There are a lot of candidates so we just follow what they (the theological schools) say, he said, as a steady stream of young and elderly men and women wearing the traditional head-to-toe black chador filed in to cast their ballots.																								In Qom, about 30 would-be legislators were barred by the hardline Guardian Council, including a reformist member of the outgoing parliament who won the biggest number of votes cast in the 2000 election.																								Some believe that when they cannot participate theres no freedom, but thats not true, said Hossein Bakhtiari, who wore a brown clerical robe.																								Look at Qom, for three seats we have more than 80 candidates so how can they say that this election is not fair?

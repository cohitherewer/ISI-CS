 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 With Bush around, US doesnt need Osama
																								Washington, Aug. 5 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush told a roomful of top Pentagon brass today that his administration would never stop looking for ways to harm the US.																								The latest instalment of misspeak from a President long known for his malapropisms came during a signing ceremony for a new $417 billion Defence Appropriations Bill that includes $25 billion in emergency funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.																								Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we, Bush said.																								The Republican incumbent, who is in a tight race for reelection against Democrat John Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, used the 11-minute presentation to underscore his commitment to US troops.																								On hand for the ceremony were defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz and General Richard Myers, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.

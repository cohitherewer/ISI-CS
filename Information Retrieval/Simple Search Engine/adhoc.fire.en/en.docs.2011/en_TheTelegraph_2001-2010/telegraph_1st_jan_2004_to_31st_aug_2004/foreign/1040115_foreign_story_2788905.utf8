The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Sudanese held with bullets at Heathrow
																								London, Jan. 14 (Reuters): British police arrested a Sudanese man carrying bullets at Heathrow airport today after flying in from Washington en route to Dubai  but officials made no link to terrorism.																								The 45-year-old man was detained after passing through a security check at 0740 GMT following his arrival on British airline Virgin Atlantics VS022 flight. A quantity of suspected ammunition was found in his possession. The items are being forensically examined, said a statement from Londons Scotland Yard police. Heathrow sources said the man had five bullets of two different types. 																								The man was arrested under Section One of the Firearms Act. We will interview him to see what he was doing but we have not initially treated it as terrorist, a police spokesperson said. Security has been especially tight at Heathrow and other big world airports in recent weeks, with US-bound flights from Britain, France and Mexico grounded amid fears of a plot by extremists to carry out another September 11-style attack.																								With the US administration eager to see security beefed up at other airports round the world, todays incident raised questions as to how the man managed to get past security checks at Dulles airport in Washington. Doubtless questions are being asked in America on how he got through ground security and to the plane, said Jim McAuslan, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association.

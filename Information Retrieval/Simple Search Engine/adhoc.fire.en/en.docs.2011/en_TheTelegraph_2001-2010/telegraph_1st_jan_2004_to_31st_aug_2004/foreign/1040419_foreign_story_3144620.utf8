 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Eton to appoint imam
																								London, April 18: Eton College is to become the first top public school in Britain to appoint an imam to help pupils gain an understanding of Islamic culture and thought.																								Tony Little, headmaster of the Berkshire school, has written to parents to reassure them the school will remain an Anglican, Christian school. The school, which has taught 18 British Prime Ministers, is also to offer Arabic as a language for the first time from this September to increase understanding of the Muslim world. The imam, who is a trained Muslim cleric will also attend to the needs of around 20 Muslim pupils who attend the exclusive 21,000-a-year school.																								The appointment of Oxford graduate Monawar Hussain has already been supported by many who say it is a positive initiative on behalf of Eton and a sign that many traditional British institutions are changing. The school currently has a Roman Catholic chaplain and a Jewish tutor as well as its four Anglican priests.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

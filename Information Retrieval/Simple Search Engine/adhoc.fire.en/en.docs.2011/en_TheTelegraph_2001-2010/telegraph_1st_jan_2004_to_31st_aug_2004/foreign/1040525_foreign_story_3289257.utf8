 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 New UN decree endorses Iraq sovereignty
																								United Nations, May 24 (Reuters): A new US-British drafted UN Security Council resolution endorsing sovereignty for an Iraqi caretaker government approves the presence of the US-led force there but sets no date for the troops to leave.																								The resolution, distributed to council members today, would endorse the formation of a sovereign interim government that would take office by June 30 and says that government would assume the responsibility and authority for governing a sovereign Iraq.																								The draft emerged as President George W. Bush prepared a televised speech mapping out his plans for Iraq, where violent attacks on occupying forces have dimmed US hopes for a peaceful transfer to democratic rule.																								The definition of sovereignty is a contentious issue, with the Bush administration attempting to assure UN Security Council members they would not be asked to approve an occupation under another name.																								British ambassador Emyr Jones Parry said the resolution underlines clearly that all sovereignty will be returned to the Iraqis, that the interim Iraqi government will assume total responsibility for its own sovereignty.

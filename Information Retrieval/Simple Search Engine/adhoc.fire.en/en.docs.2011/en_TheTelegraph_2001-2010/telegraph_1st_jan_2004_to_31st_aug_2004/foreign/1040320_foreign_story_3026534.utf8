(AFP)																								Taipei, March 19 (Reuters): Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian survived an assassination attempt today while campaigning on the eve of a presidential election, escaping with a bullet wound to the stomach.																								Vice-President Annette Lu was also wounded in the attack in the southern city of Tainan but was not badly hurt, officials said. The pair were rushed to hospital, but a hospital official said later that they had left to fly back to the capital. Officials said tomorrows election would go ahead as planned.																								Chen and Lu had been travelling in an open-top jeep through Tainan streets, waving to crowds, when unknown assailants shot at them at 0545 GMT. Police said they believed two standard handguns had been used and at least two shots fired. They had yet to make any arrests.																								China had no immediate comment. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province to be recovered, by force if necessary.																								Chen, who was not wearing a bullet-proof vest, was rushed to hospital in Tainan, his home town, where he received 14 stitches in an 11-cm long, three-cm deep wound. Television reports said the 54-year-old President was able to walk in for treatment. Lu, 59, was hit in the right leg and had to be assisted but her condition was not serious.																								It was unclear if the attack in a country where such political violence is virtually unknown would affect the election outcome. Analysts said most voters had already made their choice based on policy and were unlikely to be swayed by emotion now.																								Chens chief of staff, Chiou I-jen, said that the President had called for calm. Both the DPP and the Opposition Nationalists called off campaigning after the shooting. Officials had voiced worries that hardcore supporters of Chen, leader of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), might cause violence at final evening election rallies.																								For the sake of social stability, we have suspended all campaign activities, said DPP campaign manager Su Chen-Chang. Chen had been due to address an evening rally in Taipei. Opposition candidate Lien Chan, who was believed to have a slight edge in the contest, also called off his campaign. 																								China reaction																								A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said he could not comment on the shooting because Taiwan issues were handled by the cabinets Taiwan affairs office. That office also declined official comment. 																								But Hong Kongs Phoenix television, www.phoenixtv.com, quoted on its website a Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman as saying Beijing had taken note of the incident and was paying close attention.

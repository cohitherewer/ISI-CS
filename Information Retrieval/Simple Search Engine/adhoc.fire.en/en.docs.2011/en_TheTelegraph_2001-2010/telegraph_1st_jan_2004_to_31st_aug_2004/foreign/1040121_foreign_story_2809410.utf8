 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Egypt struts, Sarah gasps
				 	 A model in a John Galliano creation in Paris. (AFP)																								Paris, Jan. 20 (Reuters): British designer John Galliano resurrected the splendour of ancient Egypt in his spring-summer haute couture display for Christian Dior, sending out jewelled gowns fit for a modern Cleopatra.																								Rays of light bounced off pyramid gowns made of dozens of golden mirrors, while glamourous mummies paraded in bandages of black silk tulle flashing with rainbow sequins.																								American actress Sarah Jessica Parker gasped in awe as a model swathed in a gold snakeskin sheath walked like an Egyptian, striking a sideways pose to set off her giant jackal mask representing Anubis, god of the dead. 																								These madcap creations beat even the most eccentric ensembles worn by Parkers alter-ego Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City, televisions most trend-setting show.																								I was stunned. Is it not the most extraordinary thing? the diminutive actress said backstage, during a break between filming scenes for the final episodes of the show. 																								Turning to Bernard Arnault, head of the luxury group LVMH which owns Dior, she raved about the evening dresses: I want to live in them, sleep in them, bathe in them!																								For, beneath the oversized Nefertiti crowns and pharaonic regalia, there also lurked romantic 1950s ballgowns in mouth-watering shades of peach, tangerine and lemon.																								Waves of applause greeted a cinched blue silk jacket with a shawl collar scattered with silver embroidery, worn over a citrine skirt in mille-feuille layers of stiff organdie.

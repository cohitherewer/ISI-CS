 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Martha sentenced to five months in prison
				 	 Martha Stewart leaves the court in New York. (Reuters)																								New York, July 16 (Reuters): Martha Stewart, who built a catering company into a media empire, was sentenced today to five months in prison for lying about a suspicious stock sale.																								The judge could have sentenced her to a maximum of 16 months. Stewart, 62, who has stepped down as an officer and board member of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, was found guilty in March of conspiracy, making false statements and obstruction of agency proceedings.																								Following the sentencing, shares of her company soared 20 per cent to $10.37 on the New York Stock Exchange. The judge also sentenced Stewart to two years of supervised release and ordered her to pay a fine of $30,000.																								Stewarts surrender to authorities was delayed to allow her attorneys to appeal her conviction. If she does serve time in prison, the judge recommended she be sent to a prison in Danbury, Connecticut. The case against Stewart stemmed from her suspicious sale of stock in biotech company ImClone Systems Inc. on December 27, 2001.																								Prosecutors said the sale occurred after her stockbroker Peter Bacanovic ordered an assistant to tip Stewart that ImClone founder Sam Waksal was dumping all his ImClone shares, knowing federal regulators were about to give a thumbs down to the companys anti-cancer drug.

 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Nepal rebels suspend siege
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES				 	 A man shifts large pieces of concrete after a bomb, allegedly planted by Maoist rebels, exploded in Kathmandu. (AFP) New Delhi, Aug. 24: Maoist  rebels today decided to suspend the economic blockade of  Kathmandu for a month. 																								The announcement caught most people within and outside Nepal by surprise. Some fear this to be a brief respite before the Maoists step up their agitation against the palace. But optimists feel this may be an attempt by the rebels to create the right atmosphere before they return for talks with the government. Some analysts believe the rebels were losing the sympathy of the poor as the week-old blockade began to hit Kathmandus 1.5 million people.																								The brief statement issued by the Maoists said that they were withdrawing the blockade for a month in response to appeals by human rights activists. The indefinite transport blockade has been postponed for one month with effect from August 25, the Maoists said in a statement today. But they warned of tough measures if the government continued to ignore their demands to release detained guerrillas, probe the killings of activists in what they say were fake gunbattles and provide information on thousands of missing comrades.																								The blockade allowed the Maoists to establish their supremacy over King Gyanendra and his hand-picked Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. It stopped the movement of most vehicles to and from Kathmandu for nearly a week. 																								The success that the Maoists had in the past few days with the blockade was widely reported in the Nepalese and Indian media. This did not go down well with the Nepal government. The fact that there were some speculation about India helping to ease the siege by air-dropping foodgrains and other essential items, only made the Deuba governments position  which is already under tremendous strain  far worse.																								The governments decision to stockpile food, petroleum products and other essential items during the blockade did not allow a serious crisis to develop in Kathmandu.																								India, which had been watching the developments in Nepal closely, hurriedly clarified that even though it had offered to help Nepal, the government in Kathmandu has managed to cope with the crisis on its own. However, New Delhi is not happy with the manner in which the Maoists have managed to establish their supremacy during the blockade in the past few days over the Nepal government. 																								Earlier today, the rebels killed four soldiers in an attack on a patrol trying to keep the main highway to Tibet open for traffic, an army spokesman said. The gun battle, about 100 km north of Kathmandu, was the first clash over the blockade since it began a week ago. Until then the rebels had relied on intimidation rather than an armed presence on the highways to keep Kathmandu cut off from the rest of the country.

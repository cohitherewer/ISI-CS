The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, May 28, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																3 yrs to cross 50 km																																	 Dhaka, May 27 (Reuters): Red-faced postal officials in Bangladesh are investigating why it took almost three years to deliver a letter just 50 km to a mill worker who had died in the meantime.																																	The family of rice mill worker Assiruddin Moral posted the letter in northwestern Dinajpur district on June 13, 2001. It reached his workplace in the nearby Nilphamari district, only 50 km away, on Monday.																						Managers at the mill refused to take the letter, saying that Moral had died 15 months ago, local officials said today.																																	They said snail mail in Bangladesh often meant letters failed to reach intended recipients, who may have left their jobs or moved to other areas while the mail was in the post.																																	But the latest delay was the first known case in recent times of the recipient having died before receiving the letter.																																	Postal officials said they had launched an investigation.

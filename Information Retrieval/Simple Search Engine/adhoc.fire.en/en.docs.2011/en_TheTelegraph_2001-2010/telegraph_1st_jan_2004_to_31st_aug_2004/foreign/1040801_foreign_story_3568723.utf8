				 	 Pope																								Vatican City, July 31 (Reuters): Modern feminisms fight for power and gender equality is undermining the traditional concept of family and creating a climate where gay marriages are seen as acceptable, the Vatican said today.																								In a 37-page document, On the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World, the Vatican said women should be respected and have equal rights in the workplace, but differences between the sexes must be recognised and exalted.																								Recent years have seen new approaches to womens issues including a tendency to emphasise strongly conditions of subordination in order to give rise to antagonism, it said.																								The document, which re-stated Catholic Church positions, including the ban on female priests, said that many women felt they had to be adversaries of men in order to be themselves.																								Faced with the abuse of power, the answer for women is to seek power. This process leads to opposition between men and women... which has its most immediate and lethal effects in the structure of the family.																								The document is a booklet-letter to bishops by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. It criticises feminisms attempt to erase gender differences.																								This has inspired ideologies which, for example, call into question the family in its natural two-parent structure of mother and father, and make homosexuality and heterosexuality virtually equivalent, , it says.

 Sunday, June 20, 2004 				 Claptons Blackie to be auctioned for charity
				 	 Kerry Keane of Christies holds Eric Claptons guitar called Blackie in New York. (Reuters)New York, June 19 (Reuters): The guitar Eric Clapton used to record the album that included one of his biggest hits, Cocaine, is going on the auction block to benefit the drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre the legendary rock musician founded.																								The Fender Stratocaster, nicknamed Blackie, is one of 58 guitars that rock and blues master Clapton, 59, is donating as part of an auction to benefit the Crossroads Centre Antigua in the West Indies.																								The guitar is practically the only one Clapton used on stage and in the studio from late 1970 to 1985. Christies, the New York auction house handling the sale, estimated the instrument would fetch between $100,000 and $150,000. But if past sales are any indication, the guitar could bring in much more money.																								At a 1999 Christies auction that also benefited Crossroads, an anonymous bidder paid a record $497,500 for Brownie, a 1956 Fender Stratocaster that Clapton used on the Derek and the Dominos hit, Layla. 																								That auction of 100 of Claptons guitars brought in over $5 million.																								Blackie, a composite of three guitars from 1956 and 1957, is on the cover of Claptons 1977 album Slowhand, which includes such hits as Cocaine and Wonderful Tonight.																								He also used it to record the albums 461 Ocean Boulevard, No Reason To Cry and Just One Night, as well as his first music video for the song Forever Man.

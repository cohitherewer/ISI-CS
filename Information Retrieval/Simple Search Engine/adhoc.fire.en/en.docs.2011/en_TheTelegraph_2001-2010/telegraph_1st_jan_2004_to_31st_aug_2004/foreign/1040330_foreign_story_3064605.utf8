The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Lanka poll body takes over state media
				 	 Election observer Shannon Turner-Covell marks the region allotted to her in Colombo. (AFP) 																								Colombo, March 29 (Reuters): Sri Lankas election commission shocked the island today by taking over state-run media four days before the vote and after weeks of charges that newspapers and television favoured President Chandrika Kumaratungas party.																								Election commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake said he was using his powers under the constitution to appoint a new authority  the first time a commissioner has used such power.																								Its something good, in the run-up to elections, to avoid reportage which might lead to any problems, the newly appointed Competent Authority for state media, Lakshman Perera, said.																								Dissanayakes statement mentioned only state radio and television, but Perera said his authority would also extend to print.																								Kumaratunga took over state media last November in a feud with her rival, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, replacing officials with those loyal to her  and appointing her spokesman to head state television.																								State media have been dogged by allegations of bias throughout the election campaign, which pits Kumaratungas United Peoples Freedom Alliance in a close race with Wickremesinghes United National Party.																								A court challenge was expected, although presidential spokesman Harim Peiris said he would not speculate on that.																								Im extremely surprised. At no point has the elections commissioner pointed out any violations of his guidelines (on fair reporting), he said.																								He also questioned why the commissioner had not acted against private newspapers and television stations  some of which are owned by relatives of Wickremesinghe  which the Presidents backers say are biased against the Freedom Alliance.																								Dissanayake, who is independent and has strong powers under the constitution, has been under pressure for weeks to move on the state media.

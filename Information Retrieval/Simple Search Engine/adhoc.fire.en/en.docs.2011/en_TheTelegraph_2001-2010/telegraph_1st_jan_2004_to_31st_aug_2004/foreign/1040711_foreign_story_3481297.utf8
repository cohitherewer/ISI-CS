 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Blair planned to quit, aides urged him not to: BBC
																								London, July 10 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair considered resigning last month and had to be persuaded to stay on by senior colleagues, the BBC reported today.																								Blairs office made no comment on the report, saying he had repeatedly insisted when asked about his future that he would lead his ruling Labour party into a third general election expected next year, which analysts predict he would win.																								Blair, who has seen his ratings tumble in opinion polls since last years war in Iraq, had beenseriously considering his position following a series of attacks on his leadership, the broadcaster said in an unsourced report.																								Three cabinet colleagues, health secretary John Reid, culture secretary Tessa Jowell and education secretary Charles Clarke met Blair, urged him not to quit and sought to assure him he had wide government support, it said.																								Im not going to speculate on what I see as Westminster gossip, Jowell told BBC radio today. Tony Blair is our Prime Minister  the most successful Prime Minister of modern times. He will continue to lead our government.																								Blair has come under pressure from within party ranks in recent months with some saying the time has come for him to step down. 																								Some say he is no longer the Labours best electoral asset and is a liability because of the unpopularity of the Iraq war.																								Last month Blair admitted the war had cost his party votes when it was trounced in local government and European Parliament elections.

 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Amid deaths, Iraq success
				 	 An Iraqi policeman stands guard on the roof of the Falluja police station on Sunday. (Reuters) 																								Baghdad, Feb. 15 (Reuters): Iraqi police today arrested the number 41 on a US most wanted list of 55 former officials of Saddam Husseins government, giving the beleaguered force a scrap of cheer at the end of a bloody week.																								The US administrator in Iraq said he was awaiting a UN recommendation on a handover of sovereignty to Iraqis, insisting it come by June 30 as President George W. Bush has demanded but showing some willingness to speed up proposed national elections.																								Iraqs leaders and six neighbouring states called for a central role for the UN in the transfer of power.																								Iraqs deputy interior minister Ahmed Kadhim said police arrested Muhammad Zimam Abd al-Razzaq al-Sadun, a senior member of Saddams toppled Baath Party. He said Sadun was detained by police at 0900 GMT today. He is now held in my office, Kadhim said. Asked if he would be handed over to the US military, Kadhim said: We are interrogating him now, we will see what well do later.																								Qatar-based Al Jazeera television showed a man it said was Sadun, sitting in a room appearing startled and clothed in traditional Iraqi dress.																								What is special about this operation is that the Iraqi police alone conducted it. It is a distinguished operation which should be a source of joy for Iraqis because they now have police they can depend on, Kadhim told a news conference.																								Saddams former lieutenant, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, number six on the list, is the highest-ranking official still at large. In all, 11 fugitives on the list are still free. 																								Guerrillas are mounting increasingly bold raids against US -backed Iraqi security forces with the apparent aim of disrupting US plans for a handover of control by June 30.																								Scores of gunmen stormed a police station and two other buildings yesterday in Falluja, 50 km west of the capital, freeing prisoners in the latest spectacular assault on forces key to the transfer of power in Iraq.																								Assailants fired automatic weapons at a US military patrol in western Baghdad today, damaging a civilian vehicle travelling with the patrol, a US military spokesperson said.

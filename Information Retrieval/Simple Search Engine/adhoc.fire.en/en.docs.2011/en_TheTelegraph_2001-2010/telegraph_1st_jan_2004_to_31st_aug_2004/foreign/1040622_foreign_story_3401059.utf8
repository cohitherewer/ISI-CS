The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Hanks Terminal hit by Stillers Dodgeball
																								Los Angeles, June 21 (Reuters): Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn aimed low and came up on top of the weekend box office in North America, as their raunchy comedy Dodgeball knocked down presumptive champions, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.																								According to studio estimates issued yesterday, the aptly titled Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story sold $30 million worth of tickets since opening on June 18. The Terminal, director Spielbergs latest collaboration with Hanks, followed with a disappointing $18.7 million for the three-day period.																								Fortunately for Oscar-winners Spielberg and Hanks, a more expensive new arrival did even worse. The Jackie Chan remake Around the World in 80 Days, reportedly budgeted at $110 million, opened at number nine with just $6.8 million for the weekend. The film was financed by Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz as part of a plan to make family-friendly projects.																								Unfortunately for him and domestic distributor Walt Disney, the low-concept antics of Dodgeball held more appeal. The $20 million sports satire stars Vaughn and Stiller as leaders of rival teams vying for a $50,000 prize.																								Dodgeball was huge beyond expectations, said Bruce Snyder of Twentieth Century Fox, which had hoped to match the production budget. People were ready to laugh. 																								With a much stronger pedigree, industry observers had expected The Terminal to open with about $30 million. It was budgeted at about $60 million. Hanks, most recently in theatres with the disappointing remake of The Ladykillers, plays an eastern European traveller stranded in an airport lounge when the US government refuses to recognise the visa of his strife-torn homeland.

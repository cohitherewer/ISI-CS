 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Comb hair, catch terror 
 DAVID BAMBER AND RAE LEWISLondon, April 18: Britains ministry of defence has told the police to use household combs in the fight against terrorism.																								Scientists from the governments defence science and technology laboratory have found that combs fitted with fine cloth or wire gauzes are ideal for collecting particles that show a terror suspect has come into contact with explosives. The technique is expected to be used to screen passengers at ports and airports.																								Many chemicals used in bomb-making remain in the hair of their handlers, even after repeated shampoos, chemists found. They have developed a kit that officials can use to help to identify bomb suspects. It should be tested this summer and in use by the end of the year.																								Researchers found the new use for the comb after establishing that explosives leave traces in the hair in a home office study. The scientists found that vapours emitted by the explosives favoured by suicide bombers are easily absorbed into human hair. The comb is simply run through the hair. The gauze is then extracted and results analysed. The test takes a couple of minutes and could be used to screen passengers before boarding flights at airports, and in other security situations.																								Sue Ellison, a spokesperson for the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, at Porton Down, Wiltshire, said that law enforcement agencies were seriously interested in using the comb.

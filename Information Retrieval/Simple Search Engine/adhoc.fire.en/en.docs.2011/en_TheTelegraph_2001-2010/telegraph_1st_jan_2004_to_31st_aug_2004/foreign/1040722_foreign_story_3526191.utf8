The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, July 22, 2004 				 Left or right decided before birth
																								London, July 21 (Reuters): Whether a person will be right-handed or left-handed could be decided early in the womb when the foetus is about 10 weeks old.																								Scientists who studied ultrasound scans of 1,000 foetuses and followed the progress of some of them after birth, found that if a foetus preferred to suck its right thumb more than its left at 10 to 12 weeks old, the child tended to be right-handed. 																								The hand you favour as a 10-week-old foetus is the hand you will favour for the rest of your life, New Scientist magazine said today.																								The findings, by Peter Hepper and researchers at Queens University in Belfast, Northern Ireland challenge current thinking that hand preference does not develop until a child is three- or four-years-old.																								The scientists also looked at hand movement in the womb which begins at about 10 weeks and found a similar association between preference and handedness after birth. Hepper said there is no evidence that the brain has any control over the early movements in the womb.

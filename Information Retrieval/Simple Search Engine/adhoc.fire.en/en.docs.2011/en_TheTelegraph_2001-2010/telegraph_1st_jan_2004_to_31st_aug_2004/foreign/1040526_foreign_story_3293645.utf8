 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Iraq godsend for Osama: Survey
				 	 Osama bin Laden																								London, May 25 (Reuters): Al Qaida has more than 18,000 militants ready to strike and the US-led occupation of Iraq has accelerated recruitment to the ranks of Osama bin Ladens network, a leading London think-tank said today.																								Al Qaidas finances were in good order, its middle managers provided expertise to Islamic militants around the globe and bin Ladens drawing power was as strong as ever, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said.																								It warned in its annual Strategic Survey that al Qaida would keep trying to develop plans for attacks in North America and Europe and that the network ideally wanted to use weapons of mass destruction.																								Meanwhile, soft targets encompassing Americans, Europeans and Israelis, and aiding the insurgency in Iraq, will do, the institute said.																								 Galvanised by Iraq if compromised by Afghanistan, al Qaida remains a viable and effective network of networks, it said.																								The IISS said al Qaida lost its base after the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan in late 2001 but had since adapted to become more decentralised, virtual and invisible in more than 60 countries.																								The Afghanistan intervention offensively hobbled but defensively benefited al Qaida, it said. The institute said 2,000 al Qaida members and more than half of the groups 30 leaders had been killed or captured. The IISS said the 1,000 al Qaida militants estimated to be in Iraq were a minute fraction of its potential strength.																								A rump leadership is still intact and over 18,000 potential terrorists are at large with recruitment accelerating on account of Iraq, the IISS said. It gave no source for the figure.																								Purported video and audio tapes by bin Laden have appeared from time to time despite a US-led manhunt since the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington to capture him dead or alive. 																								Bin Ladens charisma, presumed survival and elusiveness enhance (al Qaidas) iconic drawing power, the IISS said.																								It said al Qaida was reported to be exporting extremism on a global scale with middle managers providing planning, logistical advice, material and financing to smaller groups in Saudi Arabia and Morocco and probably Indonesia and Kenya.																								The IISS said the Madrid train bombings in March suggested al Qaida had now fully reconstituted and had set its sights firmly on the US and its closest allies in Europe.Madrid bombing links																								A Paris court sentenced a Frenchman linked to a suspected Madrid train bomber to four years in prison today for abetting a network of Islamic terrorists in Europe.																								David Courtailler, a French convert to Islam, was found guilty on charges of conspiring with criminals engaged in a terrorist enterprise. Two years of his term were suspended.																								Courtailler, 28, has been linked to Jamal Zougam, a key suspect in the Madrid bombings which killed 191 people in March. The court also convicted on the same charge Mohamed Chaouki Baadache, an Algerian said to have top-level operational contacts with Islamic militants. He received the maximum 10-year jail sentence.

 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Syria not to tolerate terrorism
																								Damascus, April 28 (Reuters): Syria said today it would not tolerate terrorism after an armed group set off a bomb in the tightly controlled capitals diplomatic quarter and four people were killed in ensuing gunbattles.																								Syrians were shocked by the unprecedented strike at the heart of the autocratic state that tolerates no dissent.																								Security forces exchanged fire with four men after they detonated a car bomb outside an empty former UN building in the Mazze district last evening, killing two assailants and wounding and detaining two, the state Sana news agency said. 																								Calm returned to upmarket Mazze, where traffic was slow today because Syrians showed up to gaze in amazement at a charred four-storey building. 																								Security forces stormed a building used by the gunmen and found a small cache of arms and explosives, state television said.

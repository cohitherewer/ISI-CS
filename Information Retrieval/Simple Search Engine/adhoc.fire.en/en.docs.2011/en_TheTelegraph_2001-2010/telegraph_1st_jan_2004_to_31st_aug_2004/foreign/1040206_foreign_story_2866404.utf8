 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Gibson mum on Christ scene cut
 Los Angeles, Feb. 5 (Reuters):  Mel Gibson is keeping mum about whether he intends to cut  or keep one of the most controversial scenes in his upcoming  film about Christs final hours  that of a Jewish high  priest declaring a blood curse on Jews for the death of  Jesus.																								The New York Times, citing an unnamed close associate of Gibson, reported yesterday that he has decided to delete the scene from the film The Passion of the Christ, before it is released in North America.																								A spokesman for Gibson, who directed, co-wrote, produced and put $25 million of his own money into the film, declined to comment. It would be irresponsible of me to talk about a work in progress, Gibson publicist Alan Nierob said.

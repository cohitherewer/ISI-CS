 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Voter apathy in last lap of EU polls
																								Brussels, June 13 (Reuters): Europeans were today completing the election of the first EU parliament since the blocs expansion, but with a lack of enthusiasm that spelled trouble for many domestic governments.																								The four-day exercise in cross-border democracy reached its climax as 19 countries were voting in the poll that for the first time included members from behind the old Iron Curtain such as Hungary and the Baltic states.																								Six other countries  Ireland, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Britain  have already voted, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair seemed set to be punished for his staunch support for the US-led war in Iraq.																								People use elections in many countries to sanction their governments, with domestic issues rather than European-dominating debates, said John Palmer, director of the Brussels-based European Policy Centre think-tank.																								The Centre-Right was forecast to dominate the new assembly as it did the old, with the Socialists the second-largest group.																								Opinion polls suggested the Christian Democratic opposition in Germany would rout Chancellor Gerhard Schroeders Social Democrats beset by a stagnant economy and high unemployment.																								French Socialists were expected to profit from anger at the Centre-Right governments social security reforms, while voters in many new member states may punish incumbent governments for corruption and pain caused by free market reforms.																								The last polling stations were due to close at 2000 GMT, with first results expected shortly afterwards.																								About 14,700 candidates were contesting 732 seats in the increasingly powerful Strasbourg-based assembly, which has a major say on EU corporate regulation, the blocs 100 billion euro ($120 billion) annual budget, and transport, labour and environmental rules.																								In a bid to stir public excitement, candidates included a Czech porn queen, an Estonian supermodel, several sports stars, two astronauts and a Nobel prize winner.																								Surveys suggested a low turnout, barely above the record low of 49.8 per cent in 1999, reflecting popular disenchantment with EU institutions, often perceived as distant and elitist.																								In Italy, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was expected to suffer at the polls for his support of the Iraq war.

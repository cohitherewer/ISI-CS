 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 New Doom gathers pace
																								London, Feb. 25 (Reuters): Security experts issued fresh alerts over a new, file-deleting version of the MyDoom e-mail worm that was targeting computer users with greater ferocity today.																								The new outbreak, known as MyDoom.F, emerged late last week and has been gathering steam ever since.																								The virus is programmed to infect personal computers and use them to unleash a crippling digital barrage known as a denial-of-service attack on select websites belonging to Microsoft Corp. and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).																								The attacks failed to bring down the sites, though access to the website for the RIAA was hampered slightly today, security firms reported. The RIAA, a lobbying group for the music industry, has drawn the ire of computer users since it began suing American online song swappers last year.																								While it was not spreading as fast as its MyDoom predecessors nor as rapidly as last weeks Netsky.B outbreak, MyDoom.F is considered a growing risk as it deletes random Microsoft Word and Excel files, plus photos and movies stored on an infected computer.																								MyDoom.F has been picking up pace since Monday and Tuesday, said Mikko Hypponen, manager of Finnish anti-virus research firm F-Secure. The disturbing thing is that it has a destructive payload. 																								We havent seen a destructive virus like this in a while, he said.																								Computer viruses rarely destroy files these days. They have instead evolved over the years to turn unsecured computers into zombie machines capable of carrying out the virus writers commands.																								Typically, this army of commandeered machines is used to send out torrents of e-mail spam messages, unleash digital attacks on targeted websites and, in some cases, host websites that sell everything from vitamins to pornography.

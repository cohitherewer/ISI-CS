 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 N. Korea puts pride before pain
				 	 Children injured in the April 22 train explosion share beds at the Peoples Hospital in Sinujiu, North Korea. (AFP)																								Seoul/Beijing, April 26 (Reuters): North Korea urgently needs medical aid to treat victims of its huge train blast, UN officials said today after aid workers described children writhing in pain, their blackened faces stitched with twine.																								But the secretive communist state shut down one route to quick relief when North Korean officials told South Korea they did not want direct overland shipments. 																								Seoul agreed to hold more talks tomorrow and will send some goods by sea, officials said.																								UN officials in the North Korean capital said Chinese aid was reaching the town of Ryongchon, where at least 161 people died and hundreds were injured in last Thursdays blast.																								A lot of assistance is needed very urgently, said Gerald Bourke, spokesperson for the World Food Programme in North Korea.																								At the hospital, they are overwhelmed. They have very little in the way of equipment and the necessary drugs and medicines, he said by telephone. So there is a big need there.																								Brendan McDonald, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Pyongyang, said the blast had put Ryongchongs hospital out of action. 																								Thats a hospital that services the needs of the whole countys 123,000 people, he said.																								North Koreas official KCNA news agency said government bodies had sent aid and officials were striving to heal the damage. 																								But KCNA devoted more space to evening galas marking army foundation day yesterday. Ministers and top army and party officials watched an acrobatic show in Pyongyang, it said.																								The death toll could rise above 161 as ill-equipped hospitals in the impoverished North battled to save the lives of hundreds suffering from serious burns, Swedens envoy said.																								Scores of primary school children were among those killed when the two trains exploded, obliterating a school and large parts of the border town. 																								Aid workers who visited victims at nearby Sinuiju Provincial Hospital described great suffering. International agencies had relief operations under control, said Swedish ambassador Paul Beijer. 																								But he said he feared the death toll could rise with hundreds of burn victims suffering in crude hospitals with minimal supplies. 																								I believe it might get much higher. There are still some 300 seriously wounded people in hospital, he said in Stockholm by telephone from Pyongyang.																								The blast took place just hours after North Korean leader Kim Jong-Ils train passed through Ryongchon on his way back from China. 																								He is widely reported to fear flying, and his rail routes are heavily guarded, often with traffic halted for hours.																								We saw children rolling and moaning in pain, many with a lot of cuts to the face and rudimentary twine stitching, World Food Programme Asia regional director Tony Banbury said by telephone.																								Faces of many of the injured were blackened by burns or lacerated by rubble and dust blown into the air.																								The first outside help arrived yesterday from China, the Norths giant neighbour and closest ally. South Korea decided to send goods worth $1 million as soon as possible and Japan announced plans to contribute $100,000 worth of relief supplies.																								Officials of the two Koreas were to meet tomorrow in the North Korean border city of Kaesong after North Korea said it preferred receiving aid by sea to overland shipments, a Seoul official said. 																								The South Korean Red Cross said some goods would leave by boat on Thursday, making the 15-hour trip from Inchon to Nampo.																								North Koreas first official report on the disaster blamed the incident on carelessness during the shunting of wagons loaded with ammonium nitrate fertiliser and fuel tanker wagons.																								Seoul has said the blast was probably an accident resulting from a train backlog rather than a botched attempt on Kims life.

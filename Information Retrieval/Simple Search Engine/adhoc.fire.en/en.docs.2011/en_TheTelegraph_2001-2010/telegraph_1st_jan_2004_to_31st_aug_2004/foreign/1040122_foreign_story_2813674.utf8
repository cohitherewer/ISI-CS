 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 UN key to Shia truce on poll
																								Baghdad, Jan. 21 (Reuters): Iraqs most influential Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, is likely to drop his demand for early elections if the UN concludes they would not be feasible, a Shia political leader said today.																								UN secretary-general Kofi Annan is considering sending a team to Iraq at the request of the occupying powers and the US-appointed Iraqi governing council to study whether it would be possible to hold a national election in the next few months.																								Washington poured scorn on the UN for failing to back the war to topple Saddam Hussein and long resisted any role for the organisation in post-war Iraq. But it now wants UN help to salvage its own plan to transfer sovereignty to Iraqis.																								The original plan was for regional caucuses to select a transitional assembly by the end of May, and for this assembly to pick an interim government that would take back sovereignty at the end of June. Full elections would follow in 2005.																								But Sistani has insisted on elections to choose a sovereign government. Mass demonstrations have been held in several cities to back his demand. Ibrahim al-Jaafari, a leading member of the governing council and head of Iraqs Shia Dawa party, said he believed Sistani would accept the findings of any UN team. 																								If there is a UN delegation that has a background in electoral and census matters, and has an open dialogue... one side may be convinced by what the other says, Jaafari said. 																								Whatever the result, if it comes to an agreement, I believe Sistani will accept that. Jaafari said there was agreement that elections were preferable. The question was whether they were feasible now.

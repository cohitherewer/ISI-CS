 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Expats having second thoughts
 DAVID MILLWARD				 	 Mohammed bin Fahd, governor of the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, with a victim of the Khobar attacks at a hospital in Dammam. (AP)Riyadh, May 31: The 25,000 Britons enjoying generous tax-free salaries and a comfortable lifestyle in Saudi Arabia were last night questioning the wisdom of staying in the desert kingdom.																								Estate agents in neighbouring Bahrain reported a flood of calls after the weekends atrocity. With terrorists having claimed the life of a third Briton in a month, some expatriates are now willing to swap lower salaries for greater security elsewhere.																								We have been getting a lot of inquiries, said Paul Thaliath of National Property Investments. A lot of people think it would be safer here in Bahrain, especially since the Khobar incident. Some companies are even looking to move their offices.																								Saudi Arabia has offered lucrative employment for decades and has been the favoured destination of Britons willing to accept the restrictions demanded in return for a well-paid job. The activities of Islamic fundamentalists have heightened anxiety among exiles, some of whom have lived in the country for many years.																								Up until a year-and-a-half ago it was a pretty pleasant place to live in many respects, said Darren Davis, a colleague of Michael Hamilton, the British oil executive murdered on Saturday.																								In the five years that I have been here I didnt have a negative experience with the locals. I and my colleagues felt safe on the streets. Obviously there were restrictions on cinemas and you couldnt drink alcohol. But there were restaurants, the climate was good and the money was tax-free.																								Davis, 35, who still works in Saudi Arabia, has moved his wife to Bahrain and is commuting instead. The foreign office has been warning Britons of the dangers of life in Saudi Arabia for several months. Expatriates have been told they must be confident of their security arrangements and be especially vigilant in public places frequented by foreigners such as banks, restaurants and shopping malls. Even without the terrorist threat some Britons have run foul of the authorities. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

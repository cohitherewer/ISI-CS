 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Pak, Britain at odds over arrests
				 	 A picture, obtained by American TV channel ABC News, of al Qaida communications expert Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan who was arrested in Pakistan three weeks ago. (AFP) 																								London/Islamabad, Aug. 5 (Reuters): Pakistan provided information leading to the arrest of 12 terrorism suspects in Britain and may have thwarted a plot to attack Londons Heathrow airport, sources in Islamabad said today.																								US officials seized upon reports of the Pakistani link to the British arrests, describing them as part of a new campaign against al Qaida by the US and its allies, tied to a security alert around New York and Washington this week.																								But British police played down any Pakistani role in the arrests, saying the investigation was under way before they received information from Islamabad. And Pakistans interior minister said his country had not given Britain any specific information related to the arrests. 																								The role of Pakistani intelligence in Britains arrests goes to the heart of a political debate in the US, where the White House has defended its decision to launch the disruptive Orange alert in three metropolitan areas.																								Several British newspapers said the 12 men arrested in raids on Tuesday included a senior al Qaida figure named either Abu Musa al-Hindi or Abu Eisa al-Hindi.																								The newspapers said he was believed to be plotting an attack on Heathrow airport.																								An unidentified senior US official quoted in The New York Times also reported Hindis arrest, and described him as someone of serious interest to Washington.																								A senior Pakistani government official said maps of Heathrow were found on computers of Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan, arrested three weeks ago and described by intelligence sources as an al Qaida communications expert. The entire crackdown in London is based on the information extracted from him, the official said. Maps of Heathrow airport were found from his computer which was one of their targets. Khans computers also provided the data that led to the clampdown in New York.																								A Pakistani intelligence officer said: We got the information on the people who were arrested in Britain from the computer of Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan. We got some names and there were also some e-mails he had sent. 																								The unidentified senior US official told The New York Times the British arrests were part of this web that emanates from Pakistan and a result in part of data from Khan.																								The paper said unidentified administration officials had described a new global crackdown on al Qaida in response to the Pakistani data, with US national security adviser Condoleezza Rice phoning colleagues from Pakistan, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.																								But the precise role of Pakistani intelligence in the British arrests was far from clear. British police would not comment on the 12 mens identities, the allegations against them or the source of intelligence that prompted the arrests.																								Our operation was ongoing before any of the recent arrests in Pakistan, a spokesman said. And British officials said there was no imminent threat to Heathrow, which saw several major security scares last year.																								If there was a specific threat, a specific target, then we would tell people, as was the case over British Airways flights to America some months ago, cabinet minister Peter Hain told BBC radio.																								Pakistans interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat dismissed a role in the British arrests: There is no linkage ... There was no specific information that we gave to Britain.																								US officials have been at pains to convince the public the security clampdown this week  the most disruptive in New York since the September 11, 2001, attacks  was not an over-reaction or politically motivated. Signs Britain acted on intelligence from the same Pakistani sources would help bolster their case.																								US officials said the security scare was prompted by detailed plans seized on Khans computer that showed key financial buildings which officials believed were targets.																								It later emerged that much of the data seized from Khan was several years old. But US authorities said they were right to take urgent precautions based on old data, because other information pointed to an increased likelihood of attacks during the weeks leading up to Novembers presidential vote.																								British police have two weeks to charge the 12 men.

 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Faced with arrest, Chalabi blames US
				 	 Ahmad Chalabi Tehran, Aug. 10 (Reuters):  Ahmad Chalabi, once tipped to lead Iraq after Saddam Husseins  fall, said today his former US allies were pulling strings  to end his political career, making him unsure of a fair  trial on his return home.																								Chalabi faces arrest on a charge of counterfeiting money as soon as he returns to Iraq from Iran, where he has been attending a trade conference. He dismisses the charge as ridiculous.																								Formerly a darling of the Pentagon, Chalabi has fallen foul of his old paymasters who accuse him of supplying false intelligence over Iraqs supposed weapons of mass destruction and of leaking secrets to Iran. The principal motive is to keep me out of the political process or hamper my participation in it, the former mathematics professor and banker said in an interview in his hotel room in Tehran. He said the CIA was involved to a considerable extent.																								This is a classic situation, they have done it in South America... It is not a domestic Iraqi issue, said Chalabi, the scion of a merchant family.																								The Americans create structures in the judiciary and special units in the police and security which are ostensibly part of the government of Iraq which have covert channels to the Americans who direct them to do their bidding.																								Chalabi says the US-led administration promoted Maliki from junior lawyer to judge after he worked as an interpreter for US forces. When asked whether this meant he could still get a fair trial in Iraq, he replied: I do not know.																								Despite this, Chalabi said he would return to Iraq in a few days but declined to reveal the date, adding he was confident he would easily win his case. I will not stay here, I will go back to Iraq, he said. I am not going to be intimidated by a novice judge. The charges are easily rebutted.

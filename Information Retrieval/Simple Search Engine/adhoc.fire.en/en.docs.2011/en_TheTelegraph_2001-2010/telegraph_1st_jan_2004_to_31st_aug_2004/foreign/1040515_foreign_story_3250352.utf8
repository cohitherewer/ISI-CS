 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Blair rejects quit calls
																								London, May 14 (Reuters): Britains Tony Blair dismissed talk of his resignation as froth today but some in his party say the revelations of prisoner abuse in Iraq could be the final straw for the damaged Prime Minister.																								Increasing numbers of Labour Party parliamentarians are calling for Blair to stand down, worried the charismatic leader who was once their best electoral asset has become a liability. The unfolding picture in Iraq means that if you have taken such a high position in going to war against such enormous opposition and it appears that its the disaster it is, if I was him I would consider my position, anti-war Labour member of parliament Bob Marshall-Andrews said.																								And there is a substantial number of people who think thats the case  more in sorrow than in anger, he added.																								Many other MPs and political analysts say talk of an end to the Blair era is premature but the fact his resignation is being openly discussed  something unthinkable just months ago  shows Iraq has left Blair more vulnerable than ever.																								Blairs trust ratings have plummeted and while Labour remains favourite to win the next general election, expected in a years time, the latest Populus poll put support for Labour at 32 per cent, four points behind the Conservative Party and a 17-year low.																								Blair defiantly vowed in an interview in The Independent today to fight the next general election and called talk of his exit froth. Ultimately, it is for Blair to say when he goes since Labour rules require more than 80 MPs to trigger a leadership contest.

 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Pak govt not involved in Libya nuke deal: US
																								Washington, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Libya obtained nuclear weapons technology from Pakistan, a key US anti-terror ally, but there was no sign Pakistans government was involved, Bush administration official said today.																								The White House said Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, whose country is nuclear-armed, had given earlier assurances Pakistan was not participating in any proliferation activity regarding unconventional weapons. But a White House spokesman said rogue individuals may be hard to control.																								We fully expect President Musharraf and the government of Pakistan to follow through on those assurances, White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters. We recognise that its always difficult to control the activities of rogue individuals whose motives are personal gain. We are working with many nations to overcome that issue.																								McClellan declined to confirm a report in the New York Times that Pakistan was the source of centrifuge design technology that allowed Libya to make advances toward a nuclear weapon over the last two years.																								Another US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the report but said he was not certain of the timing of the transfer. He said there was no sign of Pakistani government involvement.																								The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for US relations with both countries, and Washingtons suggestions discounting a Pakistani government role are in line with previous Pakistani denials that it aided proliferation.																								Pakistan supported the US effort to topple the Taliban government in Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US, which were blamed on the al Qaida network of Osama bin Laden. Musharraf has faced two assassination attempts in the last month, and suspicions have focused on al Qaida. But western diplomats have expressed concern previously about the possibility Iran and North Korea obtained nuclear technology from Pakistan.																								Libya last month said it would abandon its unconventional weapons programmes and allow international inspections, and Bush said yesterday that if Libya follows through on its pledges, Washington would take tangible steps to improve ties. A congressional foreign policy aide said the report of a Pakistan source for Libyan nuclear technology did not come as a surprise, but it was unclear whether Congress would take any action.

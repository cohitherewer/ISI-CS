 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Pak rangers seize arms, foil Karachi attack
				 	 A Pakistani paramilitary ranger shows seized weapons in Karachi. (AFP)																								Karachi, April 10 (Reuters): Pakistans paramilitary rangers said today they had foiled a major attack bid in the restive port city of Karachi, recovering a huge cache of weapons but making no arrests.																								The weapons seized in a raid yesterday at a house under construction included a Russian-made mortar, shells and rockets.																								This is the first time ever we seized a 82 mm mortar gun in Karachi, senior ranger officer Colonel Zafar Iqbal Awan said.																								Officials said the mortar could hit a target at a distance of five km.																								Karachi has seen a spate of assaults, including suicide bombings, targeting westerners, government officials and the religious minorities in the last couple of years.																								Police blame most of these attacks on Islamic militants furious at the governments support for the US-led war on terror following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Awan said, however, that it was too early to blame any group for bringing the weapons to Karachi. Separately today, police seized more than seven kg of high-grade explosives, several detonators and hand grenades in a raid at an abandoned house in northern Karachi.																								The explosives and the bomb-making material were packed in a suitcase, inspector Tahir Ameer said.																								The raid was part of an anti-terror campaign that has gained momentum after police defused a massive car bomb outside the US Consulate in Karachi last month.																								Police say scores of suspected militants have been arrested and have given tips about places where weapons have been dumped.																								Pakistan deported to Canada the youngest son of an Egyptian-born Canadian killed by Pakistani forces during a raid on an al Qaida hideout in October, officials said today.

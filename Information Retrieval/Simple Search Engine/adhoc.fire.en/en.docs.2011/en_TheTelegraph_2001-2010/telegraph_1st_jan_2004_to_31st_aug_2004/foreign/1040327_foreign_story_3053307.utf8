 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Pak scorn versus Qaida threat
																								Islamabad, March 26 (Reuters): Pakistan scornfully dismissed a taped message, apparently from Osama bin Ladens deputy, calling for the overthrow of the government, and vowed today to step up the hunt for al Qaida fighters.																								A CIA official in the US said the voice on the tape was likely that of Ayman al-Zawahri, whom Pakistan hinted troops had trapped in a border region just days ago, although it was unclear when the recording was made.																								President Pervez Musharrafs government said more soldiers would be sent to its semi-autonomous tribal territories bordering Afghanistan to reinforce a bloody campaign to flush out al Qaida fighters and their Pakistani tribal allies.																								The 11-day operation sparked a defiant message purportedly by bin Ladens right-hand man Zawahri, calling on Pakistanis to overthrow Musharraf and describing the Pakistani leader as a traitor to Islam working for the US. 																								Military and government spokesmen derided the threat as ridiculous and cowardly. I strongly condemn these baseless allegations...made to create unrest and anarchy in the country, information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said.																								Such threats have been made in the past but have no effect or appeal, foreign ministry spokesperson Masood Khan told a television interviewer.																								The audio tape, aired on Arabic Al Jazeera television, was the second believed to have been made by Zawahri calling for Pakistanis to revolt since September. Pakistans military has said suggestions the fugitive had been cornered in a battle near the Afghan border were just guesswork.																								Nearly 100 people have been killed since last week when paramilitary forces hunting al Qaida fighters and their tribal allies ran into a hail of bullets as they approached a suspects house in the lawless South Waziristan tribal region.																								The battle, involving 5,000 troops, is Pakistans biggest in the region and comes after Musharraf narrowly escaped two assassination attempts in December, blamed on Muslim militants. This operation will continue at whatsoever cost may be, Ahmed said. The army is sending reinforcements.																								Thousands of protesters, chanting Musharraf is a dog, Down with America, and other slogans gathered in Rawalpindi and other cities, accusing the government of pandering to President George W. Bush at the expense of Muslims.																								We will instill hatred of the US in every Pakistani child, read one banner in Rawalpindi, where some protesters burned an effigy of Musharraf after conservative Islamic politicians demanded an end to the offensive. Opposition politicians say the sweep was launched only because of pressure from Washington.

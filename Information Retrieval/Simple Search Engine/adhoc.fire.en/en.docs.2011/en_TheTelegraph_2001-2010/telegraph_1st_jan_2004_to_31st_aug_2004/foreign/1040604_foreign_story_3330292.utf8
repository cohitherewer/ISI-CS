 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Computer glitch hits UK air traffic
				 	 Passengers queue up to check-in at Heathrow airport. (AFP)																								London, June 3 (Reuters): A computer failure that briefly grounded all aircraft in Britain in the peak morning hours caused airport chaos today and raised further questions about the state of the countrys transport infrastructure.																								The computer crash that disrupted some of Europes busiest airspace added to pressure on the government amid talk of a consumer backlash over soaring petrol prices and with strikes looming in the crumbling national rail network.																								Prime Minister Tony Blairs Labour government, facing local and European elections next week, blamed a lack of investment in the countrys transport system by previous administrations. Over decades, successive governments did not spend enough on the infrastructure and air traffic control is no different, transport secretary Alistair Darling told BBC radio.																								But analysts and the Opposition Conservatives said the problem lay with National Air Traffic Services (NATS), the organisation jointly owned by the government and the airlines which runs the countrys air traffic control system.																								This is not the first time that the travelling public have had to endure problems associated with NATS computers, said Conservative transport spokeswoman Theresa May.																								Air industry writer Julian Moxon said money was not the problem. At root was an overloaded system plagued by software problems and out of synch with neighbouring systems.																								It is nothing to do with investment. It is the system type. There have been a lot of programming problems, he said.																								NATS blamed the 43-minute outage that began soon after 0500 GMT on a technical failure, but said it was rapidly corrected.																								However, all planes were grounded during the outage for safety reasons as incoming flights were landed manually by traffic controllers, and airport sources warned of delays to flights throughout the day.																								It was a problem with the flight data processing system. We think it was a data link. So what we did was to reboot the system and it was fine, said a NATS spokesman.																								He said it was a link between an old control centre at West Drayton in Middlesex and a new one at Swanwick in Hampshire that opened in 2002  six years behind schedule and 230 million over budget.																								Just months after the 600-million centre at Swanwick went operational, there were reports that controllers were being plagued by ghost data on their screens making it hard to identify real aircraft.																								Swanwick didnt fall over at all. It is quite robust, the NATS spokesman said. It gets upgraded regularly. It has proven to be more than robust in the past.																								Moxon said he was surprised that a simple computer failure could have caused such major disruption, but that since its initial problems Swanwick had operated smoothly.																								Another airline analyst said NATS had been short of money but that was now resolved, and that making comparisons with the countrys decrepit rail network was invalid. The parallel, of course, is easy to draw between the UKs rail infrastructure and air infrastructure, but it is a fairly misleading one since we are talking about a one-off glitch in the computer system, he said, declining to be named.Blair test																								Tony Blair, hammered at home for waging war in Iraq, faces a raft of elections next week with experts predicting reverses on most if not all fronts.																								Elections for the European Parliament, London mayor and English and Welsh local councils, on what is being dubbed Super Thursday, add up to the biggest electoral test for the Prime Minister outside a general election.																								Speculation that Blair may soon quit has died down but his uneasy party is braced for ugly results, although eurosceptic Britons may also desert his Conservative opponents in favour of a fringe party advocating withdrawal from the EU.

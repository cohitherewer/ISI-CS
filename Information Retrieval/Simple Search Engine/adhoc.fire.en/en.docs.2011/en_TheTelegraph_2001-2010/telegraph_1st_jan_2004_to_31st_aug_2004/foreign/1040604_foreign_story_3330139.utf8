 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Top Shia cleric nod to new Iraq team
																								Najaf, June 3 (Reuters): Iraqs new government won a precious vote of confidence today from the countrys top Shia cleric, who urged it to erase the marks of occupation and secure full sovereign powers from the UN.																								As Baghdads foreign minister prepared to put his case to the UN Security Council, US secretary of state Colin Powell made clear, however, the sovereignty Washington is offering on June 30 will be subject to 138,000 American soldiers having the last word on any actions they deem essential.																								New President Ghazi al-Yawar said Iraq must rebuild its own security forces to replace foreign troops and that former members of Saddam Husseins Baath party should be welcomed back for their expertise  at least those innocent of grave crimes.																								Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, a CIA-backed former Baathist who turned against Saddam in the 1970s, has also sought allies among the old Iraqi military and sees restoring security as a priority in the run-up to Iraqs first free elections, due in January.																								He met the top US commanders for Iraq, General John Abizaid and Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, as he took over the chairmanship of the national security committee from Paul Bremer, outgoing US governor of Iraq. 																								Officials said improving intelligence and tightening border security would get attention.

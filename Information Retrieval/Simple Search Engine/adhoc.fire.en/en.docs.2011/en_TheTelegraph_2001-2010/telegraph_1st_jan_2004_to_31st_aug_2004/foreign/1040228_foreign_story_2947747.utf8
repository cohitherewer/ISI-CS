The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Battle lines drawn for Lanka polls
																								Colombo, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Battle lines were drawn in Sri Lankas election campaign today, with the Opposition accusing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of war-mongering and the Tamil Tiger rebels endorsing a possible kingmaker party.																								The United Peoples Freedom Alliance also said it was ready to negotiate without any pre-conditions with the LTTE to end a two-decade civil war. The choice is not the simplistic one, as the Prime Minister would like us to believe, of peace with him or else war, party leader Lakshman Kadirgamar said. Wickremesinghe told a rally today in Kandy that the war will start, the economy will collapse and we will all lose if he was not re-elected. The April 2 poll was called after President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe failed to resolve a disagreement over how to pursue a peace bid with the Tigers.

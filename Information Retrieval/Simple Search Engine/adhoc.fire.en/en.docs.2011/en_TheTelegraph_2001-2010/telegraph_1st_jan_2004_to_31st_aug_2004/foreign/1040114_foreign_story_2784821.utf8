 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 US out of bounds for the corrupt
																								Washington, Jan. 13 (PTI): People who have been linked with corruption will be barred from visiting or immigrating to the US, according to a proclamation issued by President George W. Bush.																								The entry suspension announced yesterday by Bush from Monterrey, Mexico, is specifically targeted at corrupt public officials, former public servants and those who have attempted to bribe them.																								 Until now, US visa policy had been that corruption in itself was not ground for denial or revocation of visa.																								The proclamation referred to corruption in the performance of public functions where that corruption has serious adverse effects on international activity of US businesses, foreign assistance goals, the security of the US against transnational crime and terrorism, or the stability of democratic institutions and nations. The new policy is in keeping with previously stated US goals to emphasise good governance and prevention of corruption as essential ingredients to economic development, Bush said.who was in Monterrey, mexico, to attend the summit of the Americas, said.

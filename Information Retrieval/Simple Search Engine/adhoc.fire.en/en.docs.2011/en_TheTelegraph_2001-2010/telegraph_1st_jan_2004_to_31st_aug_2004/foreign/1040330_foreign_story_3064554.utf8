 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Chirac in crisis after Left wins regional poll
																								Paris, March 29 (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac held crisis talks with his Prime Minister today, under pressure to dismiss him and shake up the conservative government after a crushing defeat in regional elections.																								A cabinet reshuffle is widely expected and the fate of cost-cutting reforms hangs in the balance after the Left-wing Oppositions landslide win on Sunday.																								Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin made no comment but Chiracs office said he was working with the Prime Minister on decisions he will take over the next few days.																								Buoyed by deep public discontent with painful reforms that have provoked widespread protests, the Socialist Party and its allies won nearly all of Frances 26 regions and beat all cabinet ministers running for regional council seats.																								The Left won about 50 per cent of the votes to the Centre-Lefts 37 per cent. A big mid-term protest vote had been expected, and it had little impact on Frances stock market, but the size of the swing to the Left was a shock for Chirac. The French have fired a very big warning shot in our direction, government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope said.																								Chirac could yet ask Raffarin to stay on, shake up the cabinet below him and just tinker with reforms. There are three years until the 2007 presidential and parliamentary elections and the centre-right holds a comfortable majority in parliament. But ignoring such a rebuff for reforms and the Prime Ministers lack of popularity would be a big risk.																								The pressure will be very hard to bear in the next few weeks, said opinion pollster Pierre Giacometti, looking ahead to a European Parliament election in June and tough decisions ahead on how far to go with reforms. Chirac, whose Centre-Right UMP party won 14 regions in 1998 against 11 for the Left, has not commented on the outcome.																								The Left swept 20 of the 22 regions in metropolitan France, with the Right winning only in Alsace. In Corsica, the Left was ahead but needed to agree a coalition before declaring victory. Left-wing leaders, swept from government in 2002, will use the success as a platform for the 2007 elections. 																								Interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy would be the most likely candidate to become Prime Minister, but his strained relations with Chirac and presidential ambitions could block his way.																								Finance minister Francis Mer could be ousted but the foreign and defence ministers are likely to stay, commentators said. France is under pressure from Brussels to bring the soaring public deficit in the eurozones second largest economy back to within EU limits.																								Raffarin vowed yesterday to press on with reforms but said policies must be more efficient and fair.																								Economic analysts said the defeat was likely to weaken the governments resolve to forge ahead with sensitive reforms such as cost-cutting in the healthcare system.

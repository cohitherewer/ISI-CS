 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Zimbabwe mercenaries
																								Harare, March 12 (Reuters): Zimbabwe said today it will charge dozens of mercenary suspects with trying to destabilise a sovereign state and said they were talking about their purported plot to stage a coup in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea.																								Zimbabwe detained more than 60 men after their Boeing 727 was seized in Harare on Sunday, and Equatorial Guinea detained 15 more who it said were an advance party. Both groups include South Africans.																								The charges are quite clear ... they include destabilising an independent and sovereign government and our statutes, and the African Union, forbid that, Zimbabwean home affairs minister Kembo Mohadi said after President Robert Mugabe met a delegation from Equatorial Guinea. Asked if the suspects were cooperating with the investigation, he said: They are talking.

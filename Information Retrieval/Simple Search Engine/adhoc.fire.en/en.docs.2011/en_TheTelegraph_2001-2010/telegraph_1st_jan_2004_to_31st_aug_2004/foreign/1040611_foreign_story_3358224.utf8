																								Washington, June 10: In the first genetic analysis of the ageing human brain, Harvard scientists have identified hundreds of genes tied specifically to ageing  genes that begin to change at the ripe middle-age of 40.																								This finding gives new meaning to reaching 40, said Ann Graybiel, a professor of brain science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge who was not involved in the research. It is a heroic effort to determine which genes are particularly vulnerable as we age.																								Also of consequence is a finding of great variability in the ageing status of these genes among individuals between 40 and 70 years. These age-related genes looked like those of young adults in some people in their 50s, while others at that age had the genetic patterns of people in their 80s, said Dr Bruce Yankner, lead investigator of the study, which appears in Nature. 																								Yankner, a professor of neurology and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School and Childrens Hospital in Boston, and his colleague, Tao Lu, collected brain tissue from 30 unidentified people who died between ages 26 and 106. These were so-called normal brains, with no signs of injury or disease. 																								According to Yankner, about 4 per cent of the 11,000 genes identified were significantly changed over the life span and linked to the ageing process. 																								The frontal lobe is a uniquely human tissue that regulates ability to carry out tasks, organise, plan, judge and analyse information. The scientists took snippets of frontal lobe brain tissue and placed them in lab dishes filled with thousands of gene markers, so-called gene chip analysis. This allows scientists to identify specific genes active at a particular time.

 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Khan apologises, seeks Musharraf pardon
 IMTIAZ GUL 				 	 President Pervez Musharraf (right) with the founder of Pakistans nuclear programme Abdul Qadeer Khan in Rawalpindi. (AFP)																								Islamabad, Feb. 4: Pakistans top scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan made a dramatic personal apology today for leaking nuclear secrets, the latest twist in a proliferation scandal stretching from Libya to North Korea.																								During the rare 40-minute meeting with Musharraf, Khan also submitted a petition of mercy and requested clemency in view of his services to the nation, an official statement said.																								The nuclear scientist took responsibility for pilferages that took place when he was in charge of the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) until his retirement in 2001, the statement, which was issued after the meeting, said. 																								Later, in a televised statement Khan said: It is with deepest sense of sorrow, anguish and regret that I have chosen to appear before you in order to atone for some of the anguish and pain that has been suffered by the people of Pakistan on account of the extremely unfortunate events of the last two months. The investigation has established that many of the reported activities (by several Pakistanis pointed out by the International Atomic Energy Agency-IAEA) did occur and the deals were inevitably initiated at my behest, he said.																								Qadeer Khan said during the course of the investigation, he voluntarily admitted that much of the reported activities were true for which I offer my deepest regrets and unqualified apologies to a traumatised nation. 																								It pains me to realise that my entire lifes achievements of providing foolproof security to my nation could have been placed in serious jeopardy on account of my activities which were based in good faith but on errors of judgment related to unauthorised proliferation activities, he said.																								I also wish to clarify that there was never ever any kind of authorisation for these activities by the government. I take full responsibility for my actions, the silver-haired scientist added, speaking in English. Khan also took full responsibility for his actions and sought pardon for causing so much trauma to the nation since November, last year. An official statement earlier had said that Khan had realised that his activities, which were in clear violation of various Pakistani laws, could have seriously jeopardised Pakistans nuclear capabilities and put the nation at risk.																								Musharraf also convened a meeting of the National Command Authority (NCA), which was in session till the filing of this report, to take a final decision on Khans mercy petition. 																								The decision on Saturday last week to remove Khan from his post as the adviser to the Prime Minister on strategic affairs was also taken during an NCA meeting. Subsequently, the nuclear scientist was placed under house arrest. Khans meeting with the President and the request for clemency, however, triggered an adverse reaction by Opposition parties. 																								We have yet to determine as to whether and under what circumstances Qadeer Khan made confessions and sought reprieve. The whole affair is suspect, Amin Faheem, chief of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), said. The government must place the whole issue in parliament, he demanded.																								Families of four detained KRL officials also rejected Khans reported requests for clemency and the TV statement.																								These statements have been extracted under duress, we simply do not accept them, said Aisamul Haq, the younger brother of Islamul Haq, one of Khans aides who is still in custody.																								If the government is right, it must allow Qadeer Khan to appear on an independent and live media forum to explain the situation, Shafiq, wife of another official demanded. The Islamic Opposition pounced on the governments treatment of Khan, saying he had been treated as a scapegoat and had only been hounded by the authorities because of pressure from the US.																								I dont think people like A.Q. Khan should be tried. He is a national hero. He has developed the (nuclear) programme, said Qazi Hussain Ahmed.																								Pakistan originally denied its nuclear secrets and technology had been leaked, either officially or by individuals. But it launched a probe in November after the IAEA provided evidence pointing to Pakistans involvement in Irans nuclear programme.

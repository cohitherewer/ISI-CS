																								Washington, April 14 (Reuters): Heavy social drinkers show a pattern of brain damage similar to that seen in hospitalised alcoholics  enough to impair day-to-day functioning, US researchers said today.																								Brain scans show clear evidence of damage, and tests of reading, balance and other functions show people who drink more than 100 drinks a month have problems, the researchers said.																								Often alcoholics are the last ones to know they have a problem, said Peter Martin of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, who wrote a commentary on the report.																								I think this is the first study of its kind that has looked at brain functioning in individuals who are heavy social drinkers who have not gone to get treatment for their alcoholism, added Martin, a professor of psychiatry who specialises in addiction.																								Dieter Meyerhoff of the University of California San Francisco and colleagues examined 46 chronic, heavy drinkers and 52 light drinkers recruited using newspaper ads and flyers.																								They used magnetic resonance imaging to look at physical brain structures and measured various brain chemicals associated with healthy brain function. The enrolment criterion for heavy drinkers was the consumption of more than an average of 100 alcoholic drinks per month for men over three years before the study (80 drinks for women), the researchers wrote in their report, published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical amp; Experimental Research.																								One drink is usually defined as a serving of spirits, a glass of wine or a can or bottle of beer.																								Our heavy drinkers sample was significantly impaired on measures of working memory, processing speed, attention, executive function, and balance, the researchers wrote.

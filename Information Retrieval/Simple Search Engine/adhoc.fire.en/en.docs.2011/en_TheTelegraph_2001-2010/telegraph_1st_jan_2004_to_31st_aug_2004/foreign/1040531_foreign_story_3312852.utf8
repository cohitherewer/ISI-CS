 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Baghdad ambush kills 3 foreigners 
																								Baghdad, May 30 (Reuters): Gunmen attacked three civilian vehicles carrying foreigners in northwest Baghdad today, killing two Westerners and seizing three others, witnesses and police at the scene said.																								Two of the four-wheel-drive vehicles, of the type used by foreign contractors, employees of the US-led administration and some media in Iraq, appeared to have collided after coming under fire on a main highway, and two bodies could be seen. 																								Locals and police said the attackers had dragged away three survivors of the attack. Their fate was unknown.																								Iraqi leaders wrangled today over who should succeed Saddam Hussein as President after they agreed on other key posts in the new government that will take power next month from the US occupation authority.																								With the top post of Prime Minister filled and consensus on key ministries, Iraqi officials spoke of sharp disagreement on the largely ceremonial choice of head of state between Adnan Pachachi, veteran scion of a pre-Saddam political dynasty, and Ghazi Yawar, a youthful engineer long based in Saudi Arabia.																								US and UN officials may now be ready to propose a third candidate to break the deadlock. Many of the 23-member Iraqi governing council meeting today favoured Yawar, said another senior politician. But US administrator Paul Bremer and UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi were putting the case for Pachachi.

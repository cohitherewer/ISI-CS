The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Oscars in Spider-Man web
				 	 Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man in a scene from Spider-Man 2 (Reuters)Los Angeles, Aug. 18 (Reuters): The Academy Awards may be more than six months away, but Columbia Pictures is already trying to lure Oscar voters into the Spider-Man 2 web.																								While most competing studios are still verifying Academy members addresses for the coming awards cycle, Columbia this week sent voters a coupon entitling a member and a guest to see the superhero movie on the big screen at any AMC Theaters location or at Regal Cinemas in Manhattan.																								While we will be sending an awards-season screener of Spider-Man 2 later this year, the mailing promised: We encourage you to visit a theatre and appreciate the movie as the filmmakers intended it to be seen  on the big screen.																								Last year, in the face of the threatened ban on promotional screener videos, Fox Searchlight resorted to sending ticket vouchers to Academy members to encourage them to attend public screenings of its films In America and Thirteen, which ended up with Oscar nominations.																								Last weekend, Spider-Man 2, which opened on June 30, was playing in 1,907 theatres across North America. The summers second-biggest movie has grossed more than $360 million domestically. The 77th annual Academy Awards will take place on February 27, 2005.

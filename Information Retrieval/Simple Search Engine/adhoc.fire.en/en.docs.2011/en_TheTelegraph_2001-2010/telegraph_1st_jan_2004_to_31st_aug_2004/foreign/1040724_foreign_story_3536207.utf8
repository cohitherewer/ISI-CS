 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Sadr condemns beheadings
Kufa (Iraq), July 23 (Reuters): Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who led an uprising against US-led forces in Iraq, said today militants were not justified in beheading a South Korean hostage.																								A group led by Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi beheaded a South Korean hostage in June after Seoul refused the groups demands to withdraw its troops from Iraq.																								If you knew politics and religion, you would not have cut off his head, Sadr said during Friday prayers. There is no religion or religious law that punishes by beheading. True, they are your enemies and occupiers, but this does not justify cutting off their heads, Sadr said in Kufa, near Najaf.																								Some analysts say that foreign militants have come to Iraq to pursue jihad against the West, while Iraqi insurgents are broadly fighting against what they see as an occupation.																								Sadr has been a fierce opponent of the US-led occupation, but since calling off a rebellion by his Mehdi Army militia earlier this year, he has shown signs of moderating his stance,.																								Zarqawis group has also beheaded an American and at least one Bulgarian. 																								Bulgaria said it was investigating a decapitated corpse that was found yesterday to determine if it was the body of a second Bulgarian that was being held by the group.																								Sadr said he was still committed to seeing an end to the presence of foreign troops in Iraq. 																								US-led forces handed sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government on June 28, but 160,000 US and other foreign troops remain in the country.																								We are suffering and will continue to suffer as long as our country is occupied. We want our country freed from occupation. We will offer our blood to sacrifice for this country, and dont imagine I will ever yield to the occupier, he said.Falluja attack																								US forces mounted an air strike on the rebellious city of Falluja today, the latest in a series targeting suspected insurgents linked to Zarqawi, the US military said. It did not say if anyone was killed in the operation.

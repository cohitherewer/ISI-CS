 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Key Pak militant arrested
																								Karachi, May 19 (Reuters): Pakistani police today arrested a key Islamic militant wanted for a failed assassination attempt on President Pervez Musharraf in 2002, police said.																								Kamran Atif, 28, was arrested after a shootout with police in Karachi in which he was critically wounded, senior superintendent of police Sultan Khawaja said. A 50-year-old woman passer-by was killed in the gun battle, which started when the police raided a house where at least two militants were hiding.																								Atif, a member of the shadowy Harkat-ul Mujahideen al-Alami group, is wanted in several other high-profile terrorism cases. An unidentified man with him managed to flee, police said.																								In early 2002, militants from the al-Alami group parked a van laden with explosives on a road which Musharrafs motorcade was due to take, but the charge failed to detonate.																								Investigators say the same van was later used in a suicide attack at the US consulate in Karachi in June 2002 that killed 12 Pakistanis. Al-Alami is a dissident faction of Harkat-ul Mujahideen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Lahore sectarian clash takes barbaric turn
				 	 Police arrest a Shia protester in Lahore. (Reuters)																								Lahore, May 14 (Reuters): Six members of a Shia family, including two women and two children, were found shot dead in their house in Lahore today in a suspected sectarian attack.																								The hands and feet of the victims, including a seven-month-old baby girl, were bound. All had been shot in the head. Police said the words Shias are infidels was spray painted on the walls of the house on the outskirts of the city. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but police said they suspected sectarian motives.																								Our first suspicion is that it is sectarian terrorism, police investigator Shafqat Ahmed Chaudhry said. The killings came exactly a week after 15 people were killed and 125 wounded when a suicide attacker set off a powerful bomb at a Shia mosque in Karachi. 																								Pakistan has been racked for decades by violence between militants from the majority Sunni and the minority Shia sects. At least 140 people have died in sectarian violence in Pakistan in the past year, most of them Shias.Karachi strike																								In Karachi, Islamist Opposition parties called a strike today forcing many shops and businesses to close in protest against vote rigging in violence marred by-elections earlier this week.																								Sporadic violence was reported today, but no deaths.																								Other than some minor skirmishes in the citys outskirts, no major incidents of violence had been reported, said Salahuddin Haider, the provincial Sindh governments spokesman. The Islamist alliance of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) mourned six dead among nine people killed during clashes with supporters of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). The MQM, an ally of Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali, appeared to win the three National Assembly seats and one provincial assembly seat contested on Wednesday.																								But the Election Commission of Pakistan stopped the results from being declared because of reports of grave irregularities and various incidents of violence during the polls.																								The MMA blamed the MQM for triggering violence and accused it of massive vote fraud. It also blamed the MMA for the violence and dismissed the rigging charges. Protestors burned tyres on main roads to stop public transport today and traffic was thin, while major commercial and shopping centres closed fearing violence. The national seats fell vacant after the MQM forced three of its lawmakers to resign.

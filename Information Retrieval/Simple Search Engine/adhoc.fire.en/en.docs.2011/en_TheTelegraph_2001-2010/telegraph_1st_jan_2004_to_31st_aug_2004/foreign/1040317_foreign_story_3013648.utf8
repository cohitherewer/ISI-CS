				 	 A man pays tribute to the victims of the Madrid blasts at Atocha train station, Madrid. (AFP)																								Madrid, March 16 (Reuters): Spanish police today hunted Moroccan militants suspected of links to bombs that killed 201 people on Madrid trains and propelled the opposition Socialists into power at a general election.																								Local media said police were looking for five fugitive Moroccans, part of a group of eight main Moroccan suspects.																								Three are already in custody in connection with Spains worst attack and the first suspected al Qaida-linked strike in the West since the September 11 strikes on the US.																								But investigators cautioned against drawing any conclusions from the evidence gathered so far. The investigation is in its infancy. We have a long way to go, one law enforcement official said.																								Spanish police, experienced with Basque separatist attacks, are considered expert at bomb analysis but have sought foreign help for what has become a complex international investigation.																								Police from across Europe are to convene in Madrid in coming days to share information on the probe, and Spain and Morocco already have exchanged investigative teams.																								Meanwhile US investigators are assisting Spain with fingerprint and background checks on suspects.																								 One of the three detained Moroccans has been named as Jamal Zougam. Police sources said bomb survivors had identified him from photographs as having been at the crime scene but said they were treating witness reports cautiously.																								Legal sources said the bombers are believed to have left the country. 																								However, police sources said no international arrest warrants had been issued.																								Investigators were also examining the remains of one of the dead from Thursdays train blasts as a potential bomber.																								The Moroccan line of investigation emerged at the weekend when police arrested five suspects  the three Moroccans and two Indians  in their first breakthrough.																								El Pais newspaper said Zougam had connections with some of those arrested for last Mays bombings in Casablanca that killed 45 people, including 12 suicide bombers. Friends described Zougam as a modern Muslim who liked to wear good clothes.Bush appeal																								President George W. Bush today urged European allies to stick with the US in Iraq, and the White House said it may seek a new UN resolution to help persuade Spain not to withdraw its troops. Its essential that we remain side-by-side with the Iraqi people, Bush said.																								Al Qaida understands the stakes. Al Qaida wants us out of Iraq as it wants to use Iraq as an example of defeating freedom and democracy, he said.

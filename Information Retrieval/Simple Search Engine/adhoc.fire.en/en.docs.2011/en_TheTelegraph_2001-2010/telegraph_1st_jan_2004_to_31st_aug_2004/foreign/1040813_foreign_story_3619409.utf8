 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Internet Qaida new classroom
Paris, Aug. 12 (Reuters): Al Qaida has turned the Internet into a virtual classroom for its supporters around the world after US troops drove Osama bin Ladens followers from training bases in Afghanistan, security experts say.																								The Internet played a key role in al Qaidas planning and coordinating for the September 11, 2001, attacks on US landmarks. In the years since, the Web has taken on an even greater role in recruiting, spreading fear and propaganda, and executing attacks, they say.																								The Internet is even more dangerous than it was in the past, said Rita Katz, director of the SITE Institute, in a telephone interview from Washington.																								Whatever you had in Afghanistan in the training camps you have today on the Internet, said Katz, whose non-profit organisation tracks militant Islamic sites and counts the US government and major US corporations among its clients.																								Some of the manuals (posted on the Web) are the actual manuals from Afghanistan... some written by Saif al-Adel, one of the most wanted military commanders of AQ (al Qaida) who has not been captured, she said. A recent posting detailed how to use a mobile phone in a bomb attack, a method used to kill 191 people in March in coordinated blasts on Madrid commuter trains.																								It was step-by-step, and to make sure you get the picture they had a video to demonstrate it. Its scary, said Katz. A month before a wave of kidnappings in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, she said, manuals appeared on Jihad websites with precise instructions on how to seize hostages. 																								One was posted by Abu Hajer, who later kidnapped US engineer Paul Johnson and assassinated him, she said. I was asking myself why are we getting so many warnings. Maybe the answer is that this way they communicate with other members, saying look, this is our agenda. The Internets role was highlighted this month with news of the secret arrest in July of Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan, a computer expert used by Pakistan to track down al Qaida militants in Britain and America.

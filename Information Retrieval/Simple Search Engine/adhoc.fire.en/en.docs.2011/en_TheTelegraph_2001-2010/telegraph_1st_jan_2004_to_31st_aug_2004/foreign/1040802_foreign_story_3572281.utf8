The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Get set to munch on Draculas diet
 KARYN MILLER, CHRIS STEPHEN AND MICHAEL MAINVILLE																								London, Aug 1: It has always been the staple and highly nutritious food of vampires even if a diet consisting entirely of blood could hardly be considered balanced. But now scientists have found a way of turning it into biscuits, yoghurts and drinks.																								The scientists, from the Voronezh State Technological Academy in Russia, say that mass production could begin in six months. They also say that their blood-based foods taste as good as the real thing.																								Ludmila Antipova, the head of the academys department of meat and meat products, said: When we were first working on the project we had 16 students involved, and the main problem was that they would keep eating the experiments. People should not be apprehensive. When you eat meat, there is blood in that.																								Antipova and her team decided to find a way to use blood 12 years ago after learning that a local meat plant discarded up to seven tonnes of it daily.																								This week, The Daily Telegraph visited their laboratories. There, staff presented a snack  chocolate-filled biscuits and a vanilla-flavoured yoghurt drink. The chocolate filling was made from cow blood cells, sugar and chocolate flavouring. The yoghurt drink contained no dairy products, but was plasma extracted from cow blood and treated with bacteria to give a creamy appearance, with sugar, preservatives and flavourings.																								The products looked and tasted like chocolate biscuits and vanilla milkshake, it was impossible to tell that either contained blood. They were delicious. Blood has long been used to make black pudding, but for this new range of foods it is separated into its components: red cells, white cells, platelets and plasma. The plasma is used for yoghurt and fermented drinks.																								For dairy yoghurt, plasma is substituted for the milk and heated. Bacterial cultures are added to it, and a yoghurt-type substance forms.																								To make chocolate, a paste of red blood cells is exposed to oxygen to turn it brown. It is then substituted for the cocoa butter or vegetable fats with which chocolate is usually made. Coffee drinks are made using a similar method.																								The processed food industry has been identified as a potential market because the blood products are up to five times less expensive to manufacture than their dairy equivalents.																								The products contain virtually no fat, and red blood cells are a rich source of iron. Yoghurt made with plasma contains up to twice as much protein as dairy yoghurt. It is not yet clear whether the food products will go on sale in Britain. 																								A spokesperson for the Food Standards Agency said: It is quite difficult to say anything at present without knowing a lot more about these products. This is a whole new territory for us.

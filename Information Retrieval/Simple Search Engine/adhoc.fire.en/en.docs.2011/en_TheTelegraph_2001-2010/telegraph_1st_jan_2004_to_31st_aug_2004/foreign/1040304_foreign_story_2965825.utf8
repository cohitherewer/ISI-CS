 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Uneasy calm hangs in Haiti
																								Port-au-Prince, March 3 (Reuters): Armed rebels patrolled the streets and foreign forces held the airport and National Palace today in an uneasy standoff over control of Haiti following a bloody revolt that ousted the poor Caribbean countrys elected President.																								US Marines had not begun street patrols of the troubled Haitian capital despite a pledge to increase their presence after rebel leader Guy Philippe declared himself the military chief of Haiti and sent out soldiers, who raced around the city and frisked people for weapons.																								We have not been missioned to patrol as yet, Marine Staff Sergeant. Timothy Edwards said in a morning briefing at the airport, where Marines slept in tents or on the tarmac.																								More than 1,000 US troops were on the ground in Haiti as part of a multinational force approved by the UN on Sunday after President Jean-Betrand Aristide was driven from power. French and Canadian troops were also in Haiti to join a force expected to grow to about 5,000.																								A Dutch Caribbean commercial airliner arrived at the airport today, a sign things were slowly returning to normal after weeks of turmoil. US officials had said they hoped to have the airport back to relatively regular operations by weeks end.																								A US official said planning was under way for a formal ceremony at the National Palace to inaugurate Haitis new President, Supreme Court President Boniface Alexandre, who was sworn in on Sunday.																								Alexandre has not made a public appearance since becoming Haitis leader. Questions have been raised about the legitimacy of his appointment because there is no legislature in place to approve it as required by the constitution.																								US Marines secured key installations, stationing troops at the airport, seaport and the National Palace, a symbol of Aristides power. US military officials said friction points had developed between foreign forces and the rebels. In one encounter on Tuesday, a band of about 20 armed rebels roared up to the airport, searching for Aristides political allies.																								Marines chased them away with a show of force. As soon as we rolled up on them, they got the heck out, Sergeant Christopher Smith said.																								The US state department made clear yesterday it did not recognise the rebels claim to control of security in Haiti and told all illegal and armed groups to lay down their weapons and go home. Although Port-au-Prince had returned to a semblance of normality, there were clear signs security had not been sorted out following days of burning and looting that surrounded Aristides departure.

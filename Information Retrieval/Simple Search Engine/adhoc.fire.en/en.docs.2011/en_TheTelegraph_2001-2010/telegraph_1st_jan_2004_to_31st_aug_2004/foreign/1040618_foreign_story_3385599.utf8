(Reuters)																								Islamabad, June 17: A key leader of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party was killed in Karachi today despite a change of government in the Sindh province. 																								Munwar Suharwardis car was ambushed by unidentified gunmen near Karachis Gru Mandir area who opened fire at him before fleeing. Suharwardi was rushed to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. Eyewitnesses said two gunmen opened fire on Surharwardi as his car stopped. 																								The attackers were in a car and they shot the leader with a pistol from close range, senior police officer Tariq Jamil said. 																								The incident sparked violence in the area as party workers attacked shops and private offices and damaged traffic signals. Hundreds of PPP activists gathered at the hospital and chanted anti-government slogans. The body of the slain PPP leader was later shifted to his home where thousands gathered including political leaders of other parties. 																								PPP central chief Makhdoom Amin Fahim condemned the murder of his colleague and accused the government of not providing protection from militants.																								 It is a target killing. It has become evident that there is no government and law in the country, Fahim said. 																								On June 9, Arbab Ghulam Rahim from the pro-military coalition was elected chief minister of Sindh after Ali Mohammad Maharter resigned after a wave of militant and political violence in Karachi.																								Suharwardi is the second PPP leader who has been killed this year. Abdullah Murad and his driver were shot dead in Karachi in March this year.																								Karachi has been the target of militancy for the past one year. Last month, more than 40 people, including pro-Taliban Sunni cleric, Mufti Nizamuddin Shamzai, were killed a terror attack. Fresh assault																								Pakistani security forces backed by helicopter gunships launched a fresh assault on al Qaida-linked militants today in rugged mountains bordering Afghanistan, witnesses and officials said.																								Dozens of transport and gunship helicopters headed towards the mountains near Angor Adda, 60 km west of South Waziristans main town of Wana, to hunt foreign militants and their local supporters, they said. It is the continuation of the operation which started last week in response to the attack on our security forces, military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan said in Islamabad. Witnesses in Angor Adda said they heard helicopters fire rockets at suspected militant hideouts.																								There is some activity going on in which our security forces are knocking out militant targets, he added, declining to give any further details. Since early this morning, many helicopters had been seen flying in the direction of Angor Adda, residents in Wana added.																								Pakistans military ended a five-day crackdown on militants yesterday in the Shakai area, 17 km west of Wana and some 400 km southwest of Islamabad.																								More than 55 militants, most of them foreigners, and 17 security personnel were killed in fierce clashes, and at least 10 militants were arrested.																								Pakistans conservative Islamic parties are strongly opposed to military operations in tribal regions, arguing that they could lead to further bloodshed and turmoil. They also criticise Pakistan for its support of the U.S.-led war on terror.																								The situation will continue to worsen, Fazal-ur-Rehman, leader of the Opposition in Pakistans lower house of parliament, said. The government cannot control the situation. It is not wise to make the whole country a war zone.																								The pro-Taliban Rehman also accused the government of conducting operations under US pressure, and said foreigners had lived in tribal areas for 15 years without causing problems.																								There are foreigners there, but they are not enemies of Pakistan. 																								Pakistan says that up to 600 foreign militants, including Arabs, Chechens and Uzbeks linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network, have been hiding out in tribal areas protected by Pakistani tribesmen.																								Many of them fought in the US-funded war against Soviet occupation in neighbouring Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989, and have married into local Pakistani tribes since. In a separate incident, militants fired three rockets at a Pakistani security post around 40 km north of Wana in a pre-dawn raid, but there were no reports of casualties, witnesses said.

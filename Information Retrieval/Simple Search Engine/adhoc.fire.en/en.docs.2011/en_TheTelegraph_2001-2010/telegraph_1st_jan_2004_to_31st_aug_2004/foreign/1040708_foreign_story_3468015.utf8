				 	 Val Kilmer: Women, what else?																								Paris, July 7 (Reuters): Screen sirens were given a royal makeover at the Christian Dior haute couture show yesterday, where bombshell gowns fit for a showgirl were paired with diamond tiaras and furs in a decadently opulent mix.																								It looked as if British designer John Galliano had raided the crown jewels as he bedecked models with chandelier earrings, jewelled crowns and even a gold orb and sceptre. But these were no stuffy European royals. Rather, they brought to mind the type of consort played by Marilyn Monroe in The Prince and the Showgirl.																								With their hair piled into messy pompadours and their tiaras perched skew-whiff, models preened to a rock  roll soundtrack in bustiers with conical bras and nipped-in waists that made for a 1950s hour-glass figure. Guests including actors Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Hurley trekked out to a polo club outside Paris for the display, causing a traffic jam in the normally tranquil Bois de Boulogne.																								Kilmer had a simple reason for attending his first ever fashion show. Women. What else do you want me to say? the laid-back actor told reporters as he arrived. Feminine curves abounded, with hips emphasised by giant folds of fabric and exaggerated fishtail skirts.																								Handpainted cherubs on a cream silk dress reflected Gallianos fascination for the 18th century, when excess was celebrated in the baroque paintings of artists like Fragonard.																								With a shrinking number of practitioners, haute couture is a symbol of excess in a fragile economic climate. Every outfit on the catwalk is a one-off requiring hundreds of hours of work by skilled seamstresses and embroiderers.

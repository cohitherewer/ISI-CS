The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Loos keeps vital parts for court 
				 	 Rebecca Loos																								London, April 15 (Reuters): David Beckhams former personal assistant said in an interview being aired today she is ready to tell a court all about the England soccer captains intimate parts to prove she had an affair with him.																								Beckham has already dismissed as ludicrous claims from Rebecca Loos that she had sex with the 28-year-old midfielder in Madrid. Beckham and his pop star wife Victoria called in lawyers after a Sunday newspaper printed allegations from a second woman  29-year-old lawyers daughter Sarah Marbeck  who said she had an affair with Beckham.																								But Loos, the 26-year-old daughter of a Dutch diplomat, insisted in a television interview that she was telling the truth and could prove it. Theres something I know about him, an intimate part of his body that I think only women who have been in bed with him would know, she told Sky One in the interview.																								So I think if they did want to take me to court, I could easily stand up and say Well ....																								A spokesman for Sky One said: We have received a legal letter from David Beckham regarding the interview. We cannot go into details. We are still on course. The programme has not been suspended though the content is still being finalised. 																								Britains tabloid press, who have gone into a feeding frenzy over the claims, gave blanket coverage to Loos again today. Bookmakers even offered odds on what the intimate detail might be.																								In the interview, Loos shows off raunchy text messages that she said she received from Beckham. She also said Beckham fed her strawberries at breakfast in a Madrid hotel bedroom and made her feel like a million dollars. Insisting her story was 100 per cent true, she said:There is no doubt in my mind. I have no reason to lie. Why should I? I was wrong to have done what I did. But it did happen and Im not going to live a lie for the rest of my life.

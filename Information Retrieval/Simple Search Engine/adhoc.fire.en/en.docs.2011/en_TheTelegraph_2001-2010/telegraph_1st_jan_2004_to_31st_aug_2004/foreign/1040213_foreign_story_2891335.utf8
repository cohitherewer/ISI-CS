 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 WHO tests show flu not passing to humans
				 	 A nurse examines a blood sample taken from a patient in Hanoi. (AFP)																								Washington, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Genetic tests showed no evidence a deadly bird flu that has killed 19 people in Asia was passing from person to person, the WHO said today.																								It said DNA tests on a 23-year-old Vietnamese woman who died of the H5N1 poultry influenza virus showed no evidence she caught it from another person.																								Her 30-year-old sister also died of bird flu and their brother succumbed to a respiratory illness though he could not be tested for the virus because his body was cremated. The WHO originally reported the results last week but then recalled them, saying they had in fact tested a different woman.																								WHO has today received the results from a study of virus isolated from a 23-year-old woman who is part of a family cluster in Vietnam under investigation as the first possible instance of human-to-human transmission, the UN health agency said in a statement posted on its website at http://www/who.int.																								Virus genetic material from this woman, as for the other case in this cluster, is of avian origin and contains no human influenza genes. At least 14 people in Vietnam have died of the bird flu. Five have died in Thailand.																								Late yesterday, the Ho Chi Minh City health department said a 22-year-old man from the southern city tested positive for the bird flu virus on February 10. He was being treated at a city hospital. 																								Experts say the bird flu virus must mutate before it can be passed easily from person to person, although people can clearly catch it from birds.																								But recent studies on the virus that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed 40 million people globally, showed it had mutated very little from its original form in birds. This suggests few changes are needed to make any bird influenza virus into one that is easily passed between humans. 																								Bird flu has been detected at four live poultry markets in New Jersey, but the strain is not the same as the deadly Asian virus and the findings were not unusual for live poultry markets in the state, the Star-Ledger newspaper reported today.																								The report quoted state officials as saying the strain was H7N2 and stressed it was not known to be harmful to humans. 																								The strain was the same one detected in Delaware, where a total of 84,000 chickens have been killed since Saturday after the virus was found on two farms.

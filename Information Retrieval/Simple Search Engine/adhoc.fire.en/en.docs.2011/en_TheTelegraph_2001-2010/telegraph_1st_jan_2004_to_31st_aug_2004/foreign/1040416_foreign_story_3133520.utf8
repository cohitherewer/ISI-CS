				 	 Kim BasingerNew York, April 15 (Reuters): Actress Kim Basinger will auction off her 3.7-carat diamond engagement ring from ex-husband Alec Baldwin and other jewellery next week to raise money for retired circus animals, Christies said yesterday.																								The ring, a simple but elegant bauble in a modern Tiffany setting, was put on display with other jewels yesterday and is expected to fetch between $30,000 and $40,000. 																								Christies estimated the 11 pieces of jewellry on offer could raise $100,000 for The Performing Animal Welfare Society, a California group that runs a refuge for abused, retired and surplus elephants, lions, bears and other captive wildlife.																								The sale also includes an $8,000-$10,000 multi-gem necklace with a butterfly motif that was another gift from Baldwin whose nine-year marriage to Basinger ended in 2002.

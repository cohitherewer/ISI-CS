				 	 Kevin SpaceyLondon, April 19: Kevin Spacey, the Oscar-winning actor, has admitted that he fell for a con rather than being mugged when he had his mobile phone stolen in a London park.																								Spacey initially told police he had been mugged while walking his dog in the early hours of Saturday morning in Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park in Lambeth, south London.																								But he said he went back to the police station a day later because there is a difference between assault and theft and he felt he should come clean about my own level of embarrassment.																								The story was put on the front page of a tabloid newspaper, but Spacey said he wanted to set the record straight when he was interviewed on BBC Radio 4s Today programme.																								What actually happened is, I fell for a con, he said. And I was, I think, incredibly embarrassed by it. Some sob story about somebody needing to call their mother and could they use my phone.																								It was such a good con, that I actually dialled the number myself and when somebody answered I then finally handed [over] my phone. And this kid took off and I was so upset I ran after him. 																								It was late in the morning and I was walking my dog, it was about 4 am, and I tripped up over my dog, and I ended up falling on to the street and hitting myself in the head.																								And now Im bleeding relatively profusely, Im extremely upset, I feel like the biggest fool that has ever lived.																								I march over to the police station and I say I got mugged. And Im thinking they are going to run out and find this kid a block later. Of course they take me to the hospital, and they were very kind.																								He added: I just want to apologise to the police, and any readers and anyone who picks up this story thinking it is actually true. It is probably good that I got bumped on the head because obviously I wasnt thinking.																								Asked what he was doing in the park at 4 am, Spacey said: You know walking your dog in the park is a perfectly normal thing to do. He added: My doggy had to go!																								The theft happened near Londons Old Vic theatre where Spacey is artistic director.																								A police spokesman said a man in his 40s, with a minor head injury, had reported the theft of his mobile early on Saturday.																								Kevin Spacey wons an best actor Oscar for his role as a conman in The Usual Suspects and also as a disgruntled father in American Beauty.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Kerry targets Bushs stubborn pursuit
				 	 John Kerry during an anti-war rally in Pennsylvania on September 7, 1970. (Reuters)																								Washington, March 17 (Reuters): Democrat John Kerry, marking the first anniversary of the Iraq war, accused President George W. Bush today of stubbornly pursuing a failed policy that has weakened the military and driven away allies.																								The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said there was no end in sight to the daily dangers faced by US soldiers in Iraq despite Bushs declaration on an aircraft carrier last May of mission accomplished.																								We are still bogged down in Iraq  and the administration stubbornly holds to failed, unilateral policies that drive ... allies away, Kerry said in a speech at George Washington University.																								But the answer is not a stubborn pursuit of the same arrogant policies; the answer to failure is not more of the same, he said. Instead we have to return more effectively to the international community.																								Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran who has been hammered by the Bush campaign for voting against various weapons programmes and $87 billion in spending to support operations in Iraq, said the US military was more extended than at any time in a generation. We are weaker today militarily than we should be, but this administration stubbornly refuses to admit it, Kerry said. Soldiers in Iraq are paying the price every day.																								Kerrys speech was designed as a counter-balance to Vice-President Dick Cheney, who was giving a speech in California today about the war which began a year ago on Saturday. Informed by reporters on his campaign plan that Cheney planned to criticise him, Kerry said: Im flattered.																								Kerry was joined on stage by former defence secretary William Perry, former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff John Shalikashvili. Kerry said he would not hesitate to use force when needed in the war of terror.

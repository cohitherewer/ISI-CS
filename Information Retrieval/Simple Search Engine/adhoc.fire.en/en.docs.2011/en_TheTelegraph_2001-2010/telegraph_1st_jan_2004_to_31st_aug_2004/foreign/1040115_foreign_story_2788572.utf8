 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 A lab robot that can act like a graduate student
 London, Jan. 14 (Reuters):  It doesnt look anything like R2-D2 of Star Wars  fame but British researchers said today they have created  an intelligent robot capable of doing experiments and interpreting  the results.																								The robot scientist can formulate theories, do research and could be useful in discovering new drug targets. It works as well as a graduate student but is unlikely to put anyone out of a job. Instead, its creators say it could free scientists from routine laboratory tasks and allow them to concentrate on more important aspects of their research.																								As with many other developments in the lab, it will hopefully give people more time to do the creative part of the work, Prof. Stephen Oliver, of the University of Manchester, said. Oliver and a team of computer scientists, microbiologists, molecular biologists and other researchers from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland and Imperial College London have been developing the robot scientist for three years.																								It sits on top of a desk and is attached to a computer.																								In the latest issue of the science journal Nature, the researchers told how the robot scientist gained top marks when asked to determine functions of genes in yeast. 																								It was given background knowledge about the biochemistry but it had no knowledge of the genetics and had to deduce the genetic relationships, Oliver said.																								Now that it has passed its first scientific hurdle and proved that it can uncover something that was already known, Oliver and his colleagues want to see if it can discover something new.																								Although the problems we set for the robot were relatively simple, we have shown that it could be used to help solve real-world problems, Prof. Ross King, a member of the team from the University of Wales, said in a statement.																								The scientists hope the robot will speed up the search to uncover the function of other genes in yeast. We also think there are applications in the pharmaceutical industry for (drug) target discovery and verification, Oliver added. 																								He said there is nothing novel in the robots hardware: its uniqueness lies in the way it has been put together and the programmes used to control it.

 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 LA varsity shuts down cadaver programme
																								Los Angeles, March 10 (Reuters): The University of California at Los Angeles shut down its scandal-plagued donated cadaver programme  possibly for good  yesterday amid a criminal investigation into the sale of body parts.																								Officials at UCLA put the programme on hold as lawyers for family members of body donors obtained a court order barring the prestigious public university from further work on the cadavers it had in cold storage.																								It was decided it would be in the best interests of the public, in the best interests of UCLA and in the best interests of the College of Medicine to suspend the Willed Body Programme at this time, UCLA attorney Lou Marlin said outside court.																								Whether or not UCLA will restart the programme is a decision that has not been made at this time and will not be made for some period of time, he said. It is being examined.																								Marlin and university officials remained adamant that the scheme went no higher than Willed Body Programme administrator Henry Reid, who was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of selling off bodies piecemeal instead of providing them to medical students for study.																								Marlin said in court that Reid, one of the departments three employees, may have got away with trafficking in body parts by keeping some of the donated cadavers off the books.																								He may have been accepting cadavers that he never recorded, Marlin said.																								Also arrested was 46-year-old Ernest Nelson, a body parts broker who claims that over the past six years he bought parts from some 800 cadavers from Reid for about $700,000 with the permission of the university.																								Nelsons lawyers showed the Los Angeles Times documents which they claim prove that the university knew about the sale of body parts. 																								Families of donors also made that charge in lawsuits they filed against UCLA and a number of medical research companies, including Johnson amp; Johnson .																								I still believe that ultimately the facts will show that people higher than Mr Reid at UCLA were aware of what was happening with the body parts or at a minimum ... turned a blind eye, donor family lawyer Raymond Boucher said.

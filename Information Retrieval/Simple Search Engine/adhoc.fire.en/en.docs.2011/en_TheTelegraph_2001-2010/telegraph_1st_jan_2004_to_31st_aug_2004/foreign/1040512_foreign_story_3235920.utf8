The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Double blow to UK troops in Iraq
				 	 Hanan Saleh Matrud. (Reuters)London, May 11 (Reuters): Britain was hit by a double blow today as a report accused its troops of killing Iraqi civilians without justification  including an eight-year-old girl  and a court allowed relatives of victims to mount a legal challenge to the government.																								With the British government struggling to cope with a growing Anglo-American scandal over alleged mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners, the court ruling and Amnesty International report threatened to inflict yet more damage on the reputation of UK forces and their commanders.																								Lawyers acting for 12 Iraqi families who allege their relatives were killed by British troops won the right in Londons High Court to challenge the government  a case which could lead to criminal proceedings against soldiers or the government for unlawful killing.																								Judge Justice Andrew Collins ruled the 12 families should be given permission to argue that the European Convention on Human Rights applied to their cases. The way things are going in Iraq it seems to me it is in everyones interest that this point should be decided as soon as possible, he said.																								The families lawyer, Phil Shiner, argued that because the Iraq war was officially over when the victims died, and Britain was an occupying power, the European Convention should apply.																								He said many of the deaths occurred when the victims were at home or going about normal life. 																								Human rights group Amnesty also accused British troops of killing Iraqi civilians  including eight-year-old Hanan Saleh Matrud  when they posed no apparent threat. It was not immediately clear whether the cases cited by Amnesty overlapped with those before the High Court.

 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Nukes in safe hands: Pervez
																								Istanbul, Jan. 22 (Reuters): President Pervez Musharraf said yesterday the fight to root out Islamic militancy in Pakistan would be long and hard, but there was no danger of his countrys nuclear weapons falling into extremist hands.																								Musharraf, who survived two recent assassination attempts blamed on militants opposed to his support for the US war on terror, said the violence sprang from years of conflict in flashpoints such as Afghanistan, Kashmir and West Asia.																								All this has a fallout, and it has led to extremism, it has led to militancy in Pakistani society, he told a small group of reporters during an official trip to Turkey. It will certainly take time to curb. There is no short-cut solution to it.																								But he said he was confident most Pakistanis backed his stance, despite noisy protests on Saturday by Opposition politicians during his first speech to parliament since seizing power in a 1999 coup.																								The protests were led partly by Islamists who recently cut a deal to keep him in power until 2007, but who walked out of the session en masse to condemn his support for Washington.																								The vast majority of Pakistanis are moderate. They are not extremists, he said. And that is my strength... What I am trying to do is give voice to this vast majority.																								Musharraf, who called on Saturday for a jihad against extremism, said there was no cause for concern that militants would get access to Pakistans nuclear arsenal. Pakistans nuclear assets... are under very strong custodial controls, he said. There is no danger of our nuclear assets falling into extremist hands.																								Worries about nuclear security in Pakistan have been fanned by a police probe into suspicions that several of the countrys top scientists may have sold nuclear know-how to Iran. 																								Two Dutch ministers said this week the same technology may also have found its way to Libya and North Korea.																								Musharraf, who has vowed to strengthen his countrys nuclear and missile defence programme, said the government had never been involved in spreading nuclear technology, and any individuals found guilty of this would face tough action.																								He was speaking a day after signing an anti-terrorism accord with Turkey, another country battered by militant attacks and courting closer relations with the west.																								Four suicide bombings claimed by al Qaida killed at least 61 people in Istanbul in November and Turkish press reports said some of those involved had been trained in Pakistan.																								Turkey hopes to start full membership talks with the European Union. Washington sees both countries as strategic allies and views Turkey in particular as a model Muslim democracy that should be emulated elsewhere.

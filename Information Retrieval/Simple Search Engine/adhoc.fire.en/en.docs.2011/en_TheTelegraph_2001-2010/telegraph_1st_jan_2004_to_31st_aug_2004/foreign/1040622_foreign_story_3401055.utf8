The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, June 22, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Nuts on numbers																																	 Manama, June 21 (AFP): A mobile telephone number in Bahrain has become the most expensive in the history of the local market, on sale for 5,000 dinars ($13,200) for no reason other than aesthetics. 																																	Abdullah al-Hammadi, who specialises in selling mobile and license plate numbers in a country which, like most affluent Gulf states, is obsessed with owning an eye-catching sequence of such numbers, said he was willing to come down to 4,500 dinars ($11,900), but no less. 																																	Im sure that there are some people who want to buy this number  which is 9111119  at this price, he said. There is a market for trading in mobile and car numbers, he said, adding that he has sold some 5,000 much coveted mobile phone numbers since starting his business in 1988. 																																	Hammadi said his customers are wealthy people who are willing to pay virtually anything for a unique licence plate or mobile number. One man once bought his son a licence plate for 6,000 dinars ($16,000 dollars). Another bought one for his son just to encourage him to work hard, he said. 																													 																Pauls back St Petersburg, Russia (AFP): Sixty thousand enthusiastic fans attended an open-air concert late on Sunday in the centre of Russias second city St Petersburg by former Beatle Paul McCartney, under tight security. Now, when I have children, I will have something to tell them about, said 23-year-old Alexei as he left the show, McCartneys 3,000th gig. A cheerful audience sang along with McCartney during most of the show, particularly when the rock legend performed one of the Beatles most famous songs, Back in the USSR. McCartney addressed the crowds both in English and in Russian, and drew mad applause when he re-entered the stage at the end of the show carrying a Russian flag, Itar-Tass news agency reported. 																													 																Burp bar Berlin (Reuters): Scientists have developed a serum to reduce methane gas in burping sheep, cows and other ruminants to combat global warming, a German magazine reported on Monday. The Hanover-based monthly Technology Review will report in its July issue that Andre-Denis Wright, a molecular biologist at Australias CSIRO Institute, has found a vaccine that reduced the methane emissions of sheep by eight percent. The magazine said that scientists believe the amounts can be reduced even further and more testing is planned. Sheep produce 20 g of methane each day, or seven kg per year, the magazine with 80,000 subscribers reported. Cows produce about 114 kg per year of methane (CH4)  a gas 21 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, the main gas blamed for driving up temperatures.

Al Qaida beheads American
																								Dubai, May 11 (Reuters): Al Qaidas leader in Iraq beheaded an American civilian and vowed more killings in revenge for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, an Islamist website said today.																								A poor quality videotape on the site showed a man dressed in orange overalls sitting bound on a white plastic chair in a bare room, then on the floor with five masked men behind him.																								My name is Nick Berg, my fathers name is Michael... I have a brother and sister, David and Sarah, said the bound man, adding he was from Philadelphia.																								After one of the masked men read out a statement, they pushed Berg to the floor and shouted: God is greatest above his screams as one of them sawed his head off with a large knife then held it aloft for the camera.																								The website said Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a top ally of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, was the man who cut off Bergs head. The statement read out before the killing was signed off with Zarqawis name and dated May 11. Jordanian-born Zarqawi, 37, has raised his profile and status as al Qaidas most active operational leader with a series of suicide bombs and attacks on US troops in Iraq.																								A US state department official said today the body of a US citizen identified as Berg had been found in Baghdad. The official said Berg had no ties to the US military or the defence department, but offered no further details. He was a private American citizen not associated with a military contract, said the state department official.																								It was not immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the tape carried on the Muntada al-Ansar Islamist website.																								The ritual killing resembled the murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl, beheaded by Islamist militants in Pakistan.																								Bergs orange overalls were reminiscent of those worn by al Qaida detainees held by US troops at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Photographs shown around the world of naked Iraqi prisoners stacked in a pyramid or positioned to simulate sex acts at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad have provoked international anger.

 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Brazil seeks exemption from US travel checks
 Brasilia, Jan. 8 (Reuters):  Brazil asked the US yesterday to exempt Brazilians from  anti-terrorism checks and defended retaliatory fingerprint  controls on US citizens that have strained relations between  the countries.																								Brazilian foreign minister Celso Amorim suggested to US secretary of state Colin Powell that if America could exempt distant nations from the new security controls, it could exempt a neighbour in the Americas like Brazil.																								Amorim said that if several young and distant nations are exempt from the US measure, all the more reason for nations that are members of the Organisation of American States, Brazils foreign ministry said in a statement after a telephone conversation between the two.																								On Monday, the US began fingerprinting and photographing foreign visitors needing a visa to enter the country. The programme does not apply to citizens of 27, mainly European nations, who do not need a visa for short vacations or business trips. 																								In retaliation, a Brazilian federal judge ordered the fingerprinting and photographing off all US citizens.																								Amorim said on Tuesday that Brazilian controls were being applied to US visitors based on the principle of reciprocity... a basic element of international relations.																								The US has said the order was designed to punish Americans rather than to reciprocate the American measure. 																								It has demanded changes in manual ink-pad fingerprinting that has caused delays for US travellers. 																								The American system is fully digital.																								We are doing it for all individuals coming into the US, whereas in this one case in Brazil a judge singled out Americans, Powell told reporters before his talk with Amorim. 																								What were asking is not terribly unreasonable.

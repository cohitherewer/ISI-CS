(AFP)																								Islamabad, Aug. 14 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf vowed today to crush Islamic militancy, saying there would be no let up in the Muslim nations biggest ever crack down on al Qaida operatives and other radicals.																								Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terror, said foreign militants linked to Osama bin Ladens network and their local allies posed the biggest challenge to Pakistan, which was celebrating its 57th anniversary of independence today. We will crush them and will not allow them to move forward, he said, speaking at a musical show held to mark the anniversary.																								Musharraf made no direct reference to a spate of recent arrests across the country, including top al Qaida operatives, which have raised hopes that security forces may be getting closer to bin Laden or his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri.																								Officials have played down such hopes, saying the whereabouts of the worlds two top wanted men was still a mystery. They are believed to be holed up in the mountainous region on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.																								In its massive sweep since July, Pakistan has caught about 30 foreign and local militants, revealing growing evidence of links between al Qaida and local militant groups. Today, six hand-made bombs exploded in the southwestern city of Quetta but caused no casualties.

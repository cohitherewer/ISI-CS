 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Gyanendra seeks new PM
																								Kathmandu, May 31 (Reuters): Nepals King Gyanendra, facing a bloody Maoist revolt and a political crisis, asked national parties to suggest a replacement for the royalist Prime Minister who resigned early this month amid street protests.																								Nepal has been effectively without a government since Surya Bahadur Thapa stepped down three weeks ago.																								The individual must have a clean image, be able to garner the support of all quarters ...and initiate elections to the House of Representatives (within mid-April 2005) by maintaining peace and security, Gyanendras palace said in a statement late yesterday. 																								The call from the king came hours after Maoist rebels, who want to topple the Hindu monarchy and set up a communist state, set off a powerful bomb in a bus in Kathmandu killing one person and wounding 21 others.																								Gyanendra plunged the impoverished nation into turmoil in 2002 when he fired an elected prime minister and indefinitely postponed elections to parliament dissolved early that year.																								He has changed two royalist prime ministers since then but has failed to make peace with the rebels, which is key to fresh parliamentary elections. The kings move could only be a ploy to split the Opposition, said an Opposition alliance member.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, June 11, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Star croc caught																																	 Hong Kong, June 10 (Reuters): Hong Kong conservation workers finally bagged an elusive crocodile today after it evaded and embarrassed some of the worlds top croc hunters for months.																																	The reptile, thought to have been brought in illegally as a pet and later released in a river in the citys rural New Territories area, swam into a trap after a seven-month hunt involving everything from chicken heads to bamboo poles.																																	The 1.5-metre animal, named Croc Croc Chan after the family that first spotted it in October, became a media star in a city better known for its gleaming skyscrapers and nightlife than its wildlife.																																	Its fame soared when it managed to give hunters from Australia and mainland China the slip. 																													 																Early riser Johannesburg (Reuters): Civil servants in South Africas poorest province have been given a wake-up call  literally  by their new leader who is starting meetings long before sunrise in a drive to boost efficiency. Heeding the national governments call for public servants to get to work and deliver, Nosimo Balindlela, the Eastern Capes newly appointed Premier, meets officials as early as 4 am and is often still going after midnight. Some people were a bit surprised when they first got the memorandum for a meeting at 4 am  they thought it was a mistake for 4 pm, a spokesman for Balindlela said.

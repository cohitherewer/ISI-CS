 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Unusual Cheney 
																								Washington, July 11 (Reuters): Lynne Cheney today said her husband, Vice-President Dick Cheney, was acting out of character when he used the F-word on the Senate floor last month.																								She said the Vice-Presidents heated discussion with Senator Patrick Leahy, in which he cursed the Vermont Democrat, was meant to be a private exchange. 																								He was sorely tried, if I may say so, by someone attacking his integrity and then pretending to be his best friend. I think thats what set it off, she said on CNN. The way Dick did it, it was a private comment. You wouldnt know it from the amount of publicity its garnered. He is such a good man, and more likely to say, Put a sock in it if hes really tried. I can understand when people are pushed to extremes, in a private setting they might say something unusual, she said.

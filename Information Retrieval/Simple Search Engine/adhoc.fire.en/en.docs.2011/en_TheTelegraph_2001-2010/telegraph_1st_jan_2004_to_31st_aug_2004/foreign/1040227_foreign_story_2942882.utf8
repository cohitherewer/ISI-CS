 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Arrested murder suspect lost kids in crash
																								Zurich, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Swiss police have detained a man who lost his wife and two children in a 2002 air crash as a suspect in the killing of a Zurich air traffic controller on duty the night of the mid-air collision, officials said today.																								The suspect lost his wife, daughter and son in the crash, officials told a news conference, but they declined to give his nationality. Dozens of Russian children bound for a holiday died in the disaster, which killed 71 people in all. Police had said revenge might have been a motive for the slaying of the 36-year-old Danish controller, who was stabbed on his doorstep on Tuesday and bled to death in front of his family.																								The 48-year-old suspect was detained yesterday afternoon and was still in custody, officials said. He was calm, he denied having done the deed, Zurich prosecutor Pascal Gossner said.																								Officials said the man first aroused suspicion when he came to Switzerland for a memorial service on the first anniversary of the July 1, 2002, crash and behaved oddly. 																								Police have said the knifeman was a burly man who spoke broken German and might have been from eastern Europe.																								The dead controller, who has not been named, was in charge of traffic over Lake Constance late on July 1, 2002, when a holiday charter collided in the darkness with a cargo jet above the town of Ueberlingen. 																								Yesterday, colleagues cut back air traffic by 40 percent to ensure grief-stricken staff could maintain flight safety. 																								Officials stepped up protection for a second controller on duty on the night of the crash as well as for other staff.

 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 China tightens HK grip
																								Beijing/Hong Kong, April 6 (Reuters): China, fearing growing calls for greater democracy in Hong Kong, tightened its grip on the city today by ruling that it alone will determine the shape and timing of elections.																								The widely expected ruling came as a blow to pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong ahead of legislative assembly elections in September.																								But some analysts in the city said Beijings move could backfire, triggering a protest vote in favour of pro-democracy groups in the September poll.																								Beijing is assuming total control over political change in Hong Kong, said Hong Kong political commentator Andy Ho.																								It is trying to cool aspirations for democracy here, telling Hong Kong that it has control, but instead of doing that it is heating things up.																								Financial markets were, however, unruffled and there was little sign of tension in the former British colony returned to Beijing in 1997.																								A top committee of Chinas parliament today passed a review of Hong Kongs Basic Law, or constitution, giving Beijing full control over the territorys political reform.																								Tsang Hin-chi, a Hong Kong member of the top-level Standing Committee of Chinas National Peoples Congress, said the ruling was for the good of the people.																								It is very mild and very clear, he said. People should not blindly oppose it, but put the best interests of Hong Kong people first.																								Hong Kongs constitution says the citys nearly seven million people can directly elect their leader and all their lawmakers from as early as 2007  something they have never done before either under the British or after the handover.																								But that prospect is remote now that Beijing has the overriding authority to decide if electoral changes are even needed.																								In Hong Kong, about 30 pro-democracy activists marched to government headquarters. Some carried wreaths symbolising the death of democracy.																								Down with the interpretation! they shouted.																								Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa pleaded for understanding at a news conference, saying Beijings move was necessary for better understanding of the constitution.																								No harm has been done to the one country, two systems principle, he told reporters, referring to the high degree of autonomy promised after the handover.																								Senior Chinese officials will arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow to explain the interpretation to the citys legal experts and lawmakers, he added.

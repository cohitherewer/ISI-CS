The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 2 killed in series of blasts in Istanbul
 Istanbul, Aug. 10 (Reuters):  Simultaneous bomb attacks rocked two hotels and a gas depot  in Istanbul early today, killing a Turk and an Iranian and  injuring 11 others including foreign tourists.																								Interior minister Abdulkadir Aksu said the government was looking at whether the early morning attacks were the work of a single group, and if they might be linked to recent operations against Kurdish separatist guerrillas.																								Our teams are still investigating at the crime scenes ... and based on the information the laboratories will try and identify what type of bomb was used, Aksu said.																								Istanbul, Turkeys largest city and commercial capital, has been targeted repeatedly by bomb attacks in recent years. There was no claim of responsibility for todays blasts, but Kurdish militants, far-Leftists and radical Islamist groups have all carried out bomb attacks in the city. We are considering all groups, said Aksu.																								Aksu said several people had been arrested in Istanbul recently in a crackdown on the armed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which wants a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey.																								Violence in the southeast has recently flared again after a lull of several years, and Iranian troops have also battled with the PKK along the border between the two countries.																								Staff at the Pars Hotel in Laleli district, where the two men were killed, said they received a telephone warning 10 minutes before the explosion. Most hotel guests were Iranian. 																								A tip-off was also received before two separate devices exploded at a storage complex for liquid petroleum gas in an outlying area of the city, causing damage but no casualties, state-run Anatolian news agency said.

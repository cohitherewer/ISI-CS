 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Rubble miracle after a week: In nineties amp; alive
				 	 Shahrbanou Mazandarani after she was rescued. (Reuters)																								Bam, Iran, Jan. 3 (Reuters): An elderly woman rescued from the rubble of the Bam earthquake said today she had been kept alive by God and after eight days freezing and without food or water had just one humble request  a cup of tea.																								Shahrbanou Mazandarani, believed to be in her 90s, became an instant celebrity after she was found by soldiers who spotted a hand protruding from the ruins of a collapsed building.																								At first they thought they had discovered just another corpse. But after hearing a faint voice they began digging. It still took three hours to pull the tiny but robust woman from beneath fallen timbers that had protected her from debris and created an air space in which she was able to survive against very long odds.																								Chai  the Persian word for tea  was among the first words Mazandarani uttered. But when rescuers handed the healthy-looking woman a steaming cup of the beloved Iranian drink, she pushed it away.																								Its hot, she admonished them. Dont give it to me now.																								The miracle of Bam rescue gave the battered nation badly needed relief from a week of gloom after a quake that killed at least 30,000.																								Images of her reciting from memory a poem as she lay in a hospital bed quickly filled television screens.																								God kept me alive, Mazandarani said before reciting the poem about God and his power in running the universe. She had been found wrapped in a blanket that rescuers said may have helped save her life.																								There was confusion about her age. Red Crescent spokeswoman Masoumeh Malek first said Mazandarani was about 60. Perhaps reluctant to reveal her true age, Mazandarani had said she was in her 50s when medics asked her how old she was.																								The Red Crescent later said she was aged 97 and neighbours said the toothless woman, whose skin was deeply wrinkled and weathered, was 98. 																								State television at one point said she was 95, but later revised that to 100.																								Its a miracle, said Red Crescent worker Abdollah Moundehali. She had been half sheltered in a corner by a bit of wood that toppled on top of her.																								Wearing a dark blue blouse and a traditional headscarf, Mazandarani became an instant celebrity, surrounded by dozens of journalists, medical staff, and other well-wishers eager to savour the moment.																								Her white hair had several orange patches where it had apparently been dyed.																								At one point in an interview from her hospital bed broadcast on state television she seemed slightly confused about where she was and had been. When asked where she was found, Mazandarani twice replied: Right here!

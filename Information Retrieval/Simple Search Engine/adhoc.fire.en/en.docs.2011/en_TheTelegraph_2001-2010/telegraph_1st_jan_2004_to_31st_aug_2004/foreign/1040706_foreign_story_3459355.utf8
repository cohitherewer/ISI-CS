Rania before (top) and after the attack 																								Riyadh, July 5 (Reuters): A Saudi man jailed for savagely beating his television presenter wife has been released after she pardoned him and dropped claims for compensation, a local newspaper reported today.																								Pictures of Rania al-Bazs battered face were published in local newspapers in April, giving the case unusual prominence in Saudi Arabia.																								Newspapers said the popular presenter suffered 13 fractures after her husband Mohammed al-Fallatta repeatedly slammed her head against the floor during a domestic dispute.																								Arab News said Fallatta was freed on Saturday, having served half of his six-month sentence, after Baz dropped claims for financial compensation saying she had settled the case in a way satisfactory to both sides.

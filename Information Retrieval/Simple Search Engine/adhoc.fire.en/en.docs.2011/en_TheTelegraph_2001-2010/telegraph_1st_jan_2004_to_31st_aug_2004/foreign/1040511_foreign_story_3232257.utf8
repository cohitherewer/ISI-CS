 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Koirala rejects kings offer
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Girija Prasad Koirala																								Kathmandu, May 10: The Nepali Congress chief Girija Prasad Koirala and the Communist Party of Nepal (United, Marxist-Leninist ) general secretary Madhav Nepal, have turned down King Gyanendras offer to meet them individually. 																								Instead, both have insisted that all leaders of the five-party alliance should be invited for the meeting called by King Gyanendra to break the current political impasse.																								However, the alliance has not withdrawn the two-day countrywide bandh which begins tomorrow. Till this evening, there was no fresh invitation from King Gyanendra. But the meeting, with or without all the alliance leaders, may take place in the next few days.																								However, much depends on how Gyanendra assesses the situation in Nepal and how seriously he takes the challenge thrown before him by the Opposition parties.																								The king had wanted to meet Koirala at 5 pm this evening and an hour later had planned a separate meeting with Madhav Nepal. But at this mornings meeting of the five-party alliance at Koiralas house, it was agreed that none of the alliance leaders would meet the king individually. They stressed that Gyanendra should meet them together as an alliance.																								On the face of it, the alliances resolve not to meet the king separately gives out a strong and clear message to Gyanendra that the democratic forces will not allow any attempt to cause a split in their ranks. 																								The alliance of the five parties has worked well so far. It has not only held together for more than a year, but also managed to bring enough pressure to force the kings nominee Surya Bahadur Thapa to step down from the Prime Ministers post last Friday.																								But the refusal to meet the king separately may also have stemmed from the lack of trust that exists among the leaders of the alliance. Nepal and Koirala are both Prime Ministerial aspirants and, therefore, if either was to meet the king exclusively it may have led to the end of the alliance and brought out the cracks in the pro-democracy movement.Instead, the alliance is now waiting for an invitation from Gyanendra to meet them together. Once that happens, the alliance feels the chances of Gyanendra accepting a nominee put forward by them for the Prime Ministership is higher.

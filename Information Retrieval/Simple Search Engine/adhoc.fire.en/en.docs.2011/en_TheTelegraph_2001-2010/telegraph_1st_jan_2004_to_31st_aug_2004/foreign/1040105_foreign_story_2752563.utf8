 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Blair in Basra to pat boys on the back
				 	 British Prime Minister Tony Blair with troops from a medical unit at a military installation in Basra international airport on Sunday. (AFP)																								Basra, Jan. 4 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Washingtons closest ally in the war to overthrow Saddam Hussein, made a surprise visit to occupied Iraq today to praise the 10,000 British troops serving in the country.																								Speaking in the southern city of Basra, Iraqs second largest, Blair told British soldiers they were the new pioneers of soldiering in the 21st century, fighting against threats of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and brutal regimes.																								Blair said world security was threatened by the virus of Islamic extremism and brutal and repressive states which are developing weapons that can cause destruction on a massive scale. Such states were a huge liability for the whole security of the world, he said.																								Blair gave weapons of mass destruction as the main justification for joining the US-led invasion of Iraq in March in the face of stiff domestic opposition.																								This was Blairs second visit to Iraq since Saddam was toppled in April and follows a high-profile and highly secretive trip to Baghdad by President George W. Bush at the end of November, when he joined US troops to celebrate Thanksgiving.																								With Iraq wracked by a relentless insurgency against occupying forces, Blair urged the soldiers to concentrate on winning the peace, saying this was the only way to ensure a stable future for the country.																								Part of the pride people feel in you is the knowledge that in years to come, people in this country...will look back on what youve done and...recognise that they owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude, Blair said.																								Blair later met the US top administrator in Iraq, Paul Bremer, to discuss the political transition towards Iraqi self-rule. He also held a short meeting with the governor of Basra, Judge Wael Abdullatif, and promised to remain committed to Iraq until it was safe and stable enough to govern itself. Our purpose is very simple. It is to help Iraq to become a stable, prosperous, democratic country that is going to be run by Iraqis under the sovereignty and control of the Iraqis themselves, he said after meeting the governor.																								US administrators in Iraq have set a timetable to hand over power to Iraqis by June-end. 																								During his trip Blair was taken by helicopter to a former prison at the town of Az Zubayr where British, Danish, Czech and Italian police are running a training academy for Iraqi police. Basra and the southern region which they patrol have been stable compared to other parts of the country, where the US has lost more than 200 soldiers to guerrilla attacks since it declared major combat over in May.																								Twenty British soldiers have died in combat since the war was launched on March 20, and more than 30 have been killed in non-combat or friendly fire incidents. Some 45,000 British troops were part of the original invasion force  the largest deployment since the Korean war 50 years ago  but numbers have been steadily cut back. Custody death																								Eight young Iraqis arrested in Basra last year were assaulted by British soldiers, and one of them died of his injuries, a British newspaper said today.																								Baha Mousas body was returned to his family covered in bruises and with his nose broken, after he and seven other men were arrested by British forces in September 2003 and held in custody for three days, the Independent on Sunday said.

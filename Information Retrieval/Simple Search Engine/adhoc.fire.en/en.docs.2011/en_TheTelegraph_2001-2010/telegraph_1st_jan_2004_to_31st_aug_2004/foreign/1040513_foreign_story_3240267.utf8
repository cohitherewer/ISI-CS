 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 US imposes sanctions on Syria
																								Washington, May 12 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush imposed economic sanctions on Syria yesterday in an order that accused Damascus of supporting terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and failing to stop anti-US guerrillas from entering Iraq.																								In the widely expected, but largely symbolic move, Bush labelled Syria an unusual and extraordinary threat and imposed a series of sanctions including a ban on US exports to Syria other than food and medicine. The sanctions also sever banking relations with the Commercial Bank of Syria, freeze assets of Syrians and Syrian entities suspected of involvement terrorism or WMD development, and prohibit Syrian flights to and from the US. 																								The sanctions were chosen from the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, which the President signed into law last December. The White House said Bush would consider additional sanctions unless Damascus took steps to end support for Islamic militant groups including Hamas and Hezbollah, withdraw its troops from Lebanon and cease WMD development.

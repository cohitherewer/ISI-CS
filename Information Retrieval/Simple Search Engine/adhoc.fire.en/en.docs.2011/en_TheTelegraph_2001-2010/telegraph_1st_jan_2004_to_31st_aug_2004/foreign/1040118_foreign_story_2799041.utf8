The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Scientists back Gwyneth moan
 ROGER HIGHFIELD				 	 Gwyneth Paltrow London, Jan. 17: When Gwyneth  Paltrow complained about Britains weather headlines branded  her Moaning Gwynnie and grumpy Gwyneth, while travel  editors suggested sunny locations that could lift the spirits  of the sullen Oscar winner.																								Paltrow, one of a number of music and movie stars who have decided to make England their home, has told friends how much she loves the British way of life, after being brought up in California. But she has carped about the inclement weather. Most recently, while discussing her role as Sylvia Plath, the depressive poet, she told The Telegraph that the sky here does get very oppressive: very small and very grey and impenetrable.																								Yesterday scientists worldwide rallied to her support because, they claim, she has poetically summarised how meteorological and psychological phenomena conspire to create the impression of a small sky. 																								Although Paltrows reference to a small sky could mean the atmosphere is thinner over London, Bill Wright of the US National Geophysical Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado, said he would like to reassure her it stays pretty much the same across the planet. 																								One obvious factor is cloud cover. Los Angeles gets 3,350 hours of sunshine each year, which overshadows Londons paltry 1,505 hours, said the meteorological office. Prof. Anthony Illingworth of Reading University, who probes clouds with radar, agreed that London was significantly more overcast than southern California.																								It is a good thing Paltrow was not brought up in San Francisco, he added, since some of the best low-level thick clouds are to be found there and above the cold waters off northern California.																								This is a favourite spot where many international cloud experiments have been held, he said.																								Londons grey days darken mood: the rate of production of the brain chemical serotonin, which plays a role in depression, is linked to the duration of bright sunlight, according to Gavin Lambert of the Human Neurotransmitter Laboratory at the Baker Heart Research Institute in Melbourne.

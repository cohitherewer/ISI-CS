																								Washington, April 29 (Reuters): President George W. Bushs private session with the commission investigating the September 11 attacks was not televised, taped or transcribed.																								But the secret proceedings still are providing US cartoonists and comedians with a rich source of material for satirical stabs at the Republican President. 																								In the US capital, Washington Post cartoonist Tom Toles recently depicted commission members asking, Why do they have to testify together? To which Cheney replied, Do you want me to answer that or him?																								Another by Mike Luckovitch of The Atlanta Constitution showed Cheney dressed like the character Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies, with Bush as his tiny sidekick, Mini Me. 																								Bush and Cheney only agreed to todays highly unusual interview on the grounds they would appear together and behind closed doors. That has only spurred on the lampoons, whose basic theme has been that Cheney will be supplying Bush with the answers. 																								Cartoonist Etta Hulme of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram showed the two driving in a car marked, Cheney Q amp;A School and a sign above it reading, Student President.																								The night before the two were to appear, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno host took aim. Tomorrow President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are scheduled to testify before the 9/11 commission. Right now theyre finalising the seating arrangements. Should Bush sit on Cheneys right knee or left knee?																								Another recent joke: This week, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney released their tax returns. Cheney made more money than the President. When asked about it, the President said, Thats true, but he also made more decisions.

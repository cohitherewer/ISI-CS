 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Powell appeal
																								Budapest, July 27 (Reuters): US secretary of state Colin Powell said today Hungary and other members of the US-led coalition in Iraq must not get weak in the knees and pull out in the face of a deadly campaign of kidnappings.																								Acknowledging the Iraq war was unpopular in much of Europe, Powell thanked Hungary for contributing a 300-soldier transport battalion and likened its efforts to US support for democracy when Central Europe laboured under Soviet domination. Powell visited Budapest after the Philippines withdrew from Iraq this month to spare the life of a Filipino hostage, joining Spain, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Honduras as nations that have left what was once a 34-nation coalition.																								While denying his 18-hour visit aimed to shore up support for the Iraq war, Powell argued that the US and its allies did the right thing in toppling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and in ousting Afghanistans Taliban regime. He also hinted he wanted Hungary to keep its troops in Iraq beyond its scheduled year-end departure. The Hungarian Opposition has called for withdrawal of the troops, who suffered their first casualty in Iraq last month.																								A Gallup Poll in June found 61 per cent of Hungarians want the troops withdrawn immediately and a recent survey of 34,000 Hungarian teens showed they disliked US President George W. Bush more than Saddam and Osama bin Laden.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 After US, I, Robot charges into UK
				 	 Will Smith																								London, Aug. 10 (Reuters): The sci-fi thriller I, Robot starring Will Smith has followed up its US success to manoeuvre King Arthur off the UK box office number one spot.																								The film, in which Smith plays a police officer who investigates a murder which could have been committed by a robot, took more than 4.7 million in its opening weekend, chart compiler Screen International said today. 																								I, Robot, loosely based on a story by sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov, was followed in the UK charts by another new entry, 13 Going on 30, a romantic comedy about a teenager who transforms into an adult overnight. The film starring Jennifer Garner, best-known for her role in the action TV series Alias, took 1.2 million in its first weekend at UK cinemas.																								King Arthur, a gritty version of the legend which tells of a half-Briton, half-Roman warrior who rebuffs a Saxon invasion in the 5th century AD, dropped to third place.																								Superhero sequel Spider-Man 2, starring Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, clung on in the top five, taking its overall haul to 23 million, but slipped two places to number four. The live-action/animated rendering of the comic strip cat Garfield, featuring Bill Murray, was in the fifth spot.																								Cartoon comedy tale Shrek 2 was still drawing the crowds in sixth spot, pulling in 44 million since its release.																								The Stepford Wives, a comedy about perfect wives starring Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick, dropped to seventh place.																								Thunderbirds, the big-screen version of Gerry Andersons cult TV puppet adventure, continued its dive down the charts to eighth. Michael Moores documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 was in ninth place.

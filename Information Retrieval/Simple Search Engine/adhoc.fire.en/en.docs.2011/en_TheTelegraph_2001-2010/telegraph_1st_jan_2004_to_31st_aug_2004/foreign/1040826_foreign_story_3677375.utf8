 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Tambourine Man to shed light on career
				 	 Bob Dylan: Like A Rolling Stone																								New York, Aug. 25 (Reuters): The famously private Bob Dylan, whose background and music are the stuff of legend, will shed light on his life and four-decade career as a singer and songwriter in a memoir to be published this autumn, his publisher said yesterday.																								Dylans Chronicles: Volume One (to be published by Simon amp; Schuster), the first of a planned three-book series, is a first-person narrative from the 63-year-old music icon, who rose to fame in the early 1960s and whose musical style ranged from folk and blues to rock, country and gospel.																								The first volume of his memoirs focuses on significant periods in Dylans life and is described by publisher David Rosenthal as extraordinary, revealing and surprising. It is a beautifully written, singular achievement.																								The 304-page book is schedule to be out on October 12 and will be followed about a week later by an updated edition of Lyrics: 1962-2001, a compendium of lyrics to nearly every Dylan song.																								Born Robert Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota, Dylan left the University of Minnesota for New Yorks Greenwich Village folk music scene at the start of the 1960s. 																								He soon won fame for such protest anthems as Blowin in the Wind and The Times They Are A-Changin.																								The scrawny mid-westerner who wrote lyrics like poetry and sang with a distinctive howl, shifted to more introspective material and later added electric instrumentation as he helped create the folk-rock sound and scored a big singles hit with the song Like a Rolling Stone.																								While Dylan sold millions of records on his own, some of his songs are best known through recordings by others like Joan Baez, Peter Paul and Mary, The Byrds, and The Band.																								Dylan, who still tours the world with his rock band, was given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammies in 1991 and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen in 1988.																								He previously published Tarantula, a 1971 volume of poems. 																								Simon amp; Schuster Inc. is the publishing arm of Viacom. .

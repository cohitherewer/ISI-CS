				 	 Mirwais SadiqKabul, March 21 (Reuters): More than 100 people died in factional fighting in the western Afghan city of Herat today after the killing of a cabinet minister who was the son of the powerful provincial governor, officials said.																								Civil aviation minister Mirwais Sadiq, the son of Herat governor Ismail Khan, died after his car was hit by a rocket -propelled grenade in the centre of the city, Khans spokesperson said. 																								Unfortunately, he has been killed, Ghulam Mohammad Masoan said. He was in his car along with two police officers who were killed with him.

He broke into my house and started the fighting there, Nayebzada said. I did not kill Sadiq in an ambush; he was killed a clash afterwards. More than 100 people have been killed on both sides.																								State television said there was also a failed attack on Ismail Khan, but his spokesperson rejected this. There has been no attack on the governor, he said.																								Masoan said heavy fighting was going on in several areas of the city, which is about 100 km east of the Iranian border. They are using rocket propelled grenades and heavy machine guns, he said.																								He said there had been casualties among Ismail Khans forces and some civilian deaths, but he did not know how many.

Make-off Ashgabat, Turkmenistan (Reuters): Turkmenistans authoritarian President, whose recent decrees have included banning gold teeth, has told television presenters to stop wearing make-up because he had difficulty telling the men from the women. You put too much make-up on female TV presenters whose faces would be paler without it. Her own, natural colour is better, President Saparmurat Niyazov said. Sometimes you even put make-up on the lads. Then I really cannot tell the two apart, he said at a meeting shown on state TV on Thursday.

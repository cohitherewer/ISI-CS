 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Degree-for-cash scandal in UK
																								London, Aug. 1 (PTI): A degree-for-cash racket, featuring some big names , has come to light in the UK, media reports said today.																								The degree-for-sale scandal involves prestigious institutions as well as former polytechnics and includes undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, foreign and home students, The Observer claimed. In the most extreme case, the newspaper said it has evidence of a professor ordering staff to mark up students at risk of failing in order to keep the money coming in. 																								Lecturers at institutions across the country, including Oxford, London and Swansea told the newspaper the scandal is undermining academic standards, but they cannot speak publicly for fear of losing their jobs. 																								In the most blatant example of the financial pressure to pass failing students, Professor Richard Wynne, head of Bournemouth Universitys design, engineering and computing department, emailed staff telling them to minimise the number of failures because of a drop in applications, the report said. 																								I would urge all academic staff involved in marking examinations to look very carefully at those students gaining marks in the 30s. If the mark is 38/90 (just below the pass mark) then please, where possible, look for the extra 1/2 marks if appropriate and not leave it to the exam board to make this decision, he wrote, according to the newspaper. 																								According to the report, Bournemouth University has given Wynne its full backing, claiming that his e-mail simply urges a closer scrutiny of borderline students. 																								Clarifying its position, Oxford University in a statement said: The university sets great importance on both the rigour and fairness of its examination procedures. Candidates are examined anonymously, with numbers rather than names or other identifying details on exam papers. Papers are blind double marked, with external examiners carrying out random quality control checks and adjudicating in borderline cases or where there are discrepancies in the double marking. 																								The newspaper however claimed that according to its investigation, university staff are being put under increasing pressure to pass foreign students studying for masters degrees as the income from these students is keeping many universities afloat. Since the mid-1990s, the number of foreign graduates coming to Britain has risen from nearly 7,000 to more than 33,000. The income from non-EU foreign students is estimated at 600 million. 																								Many universities now believe income from foreign students is the only solution, and some have decided to cut courses as a result, the report said. Foreign students pay 30,000 a year to study for a business degree  six times the income received from a UK undergraduate. Even masters degrees in traditional academic subjects cost as much as 7,000 for foreign students. Universities lose about 5,000 on each UK student.

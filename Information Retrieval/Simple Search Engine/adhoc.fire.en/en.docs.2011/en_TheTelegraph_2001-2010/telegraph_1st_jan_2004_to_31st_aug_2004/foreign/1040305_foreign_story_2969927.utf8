 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Govt gains grip on Haiti, rebels to leave capital 
				 	 An Aristide supporter is detained in Petit Goave, 50 km south of Port-au-Prince. (Reuters)																								Port-au-Prince, March 4 (Reuters): The government and foreign military forces gained a tentative grip on chaotic Haiti today as US and French troops stepped up patrols and armed rebels who helped oust the President prepared to leave the capital.																								Banks reopened after two weeks of gun battles, looting and barricades in the capital forced President Jean-Bertrand Aristide into exile. The government says a month-long rebel uprising cost Haiti about $300 million, roughly equivalent to its yearly budget.																								But many city slums, strongholds of feared pro-Aristide supporters known as chimeres who are armed with automatic weapons and machetes, were still too dangerous to enter. Many feared reprisals and there were reports of several lynchings of Aristide supporters.																								Gun battles erupted yesterday after police and some rebels hunted for Aristide supporters in La Saline shantytown. Local radio reported three people were killed. Prime Minister Yvon Neptune has declared a state of emergency, allowing the government to suspend certain constitutional rights such as press freedoms and the right to demonstrate.																								Under US pressure, rebel leader Guy Philippe said he would disarm his army and return to Cap Haitien today or tomorrow. Haitis second biggest city was one of his rebel strongholds.																								Many residents, terrorised by an uprising that left at least 100 people dead, said the new law and order was too little too late.																								They should have sent the (US) military before Aristide fled. Now (looters) have burned everything, Walter St Fort, a 31-year-old auto parts dealer, said standing by the smouldering ruins of a government building.																								Nearby, French military jeeps mounted with machine guns patrolled downtown, where streets were ankle deep in sewage and garbage in places. US light-armoured vehicles guarded the National Palace. For a second day, US forces patrolled in Humvees equipped with machine guns and rocket launchers.

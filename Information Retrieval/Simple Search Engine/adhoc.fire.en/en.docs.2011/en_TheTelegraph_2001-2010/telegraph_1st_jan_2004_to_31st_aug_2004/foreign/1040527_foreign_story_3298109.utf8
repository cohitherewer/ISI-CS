 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Hair speaks volumes about an individual
																								London, May 26 (Reuters): Hair speaks volumes about an individual, revealing ethnic origin, environment, diet and even lifestyle, scientists said today.																								Although like finger and toe nails the hair itself is dead, it acts like an Arctic ice core, trapping within its physical and chemical structure an accurate record of whatever has been ingested or applied to it externally.																								Your hair tells what you eat, where you live, your lifestyle and habits, said Emma Freeman from Londons Natural History Museum. Your hair is what you do.																								It can tell if you smoke, drink or take drugs and, growing at 0.3 to 0.5 millimetres a day, it keeps a record for months if not years  which is why some people taking illegal substances shave their heads. 																								Because different races have different hair structures, analysis can also tell ethnic origin although it cannot reveal sex.																								Starting on Saturday and running till September the museum is opening to the public an exhibition detailing the remarkable story of hair. 																								This tells the incredible biology of hair and the place of hair in different cultures, Freeman said.																								The average person has up to 150,000 hairs on the head and a single strand can support 100 grammes in weight. A whole head of hair could, therefore, in theory support the weight of two African elephants.

 Fine Print
				 				 				 																Bleed for bucks
																																	 Los Angeles, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Selling yourself might be second nature for wannabe movie stars or aspiring screenwriters looking for a lucky break in California.
																																	But now anyone can get lessons in how to, literally, sell their bodies and make big bucks. Body Bucks: How to Sell Your Body to Science While Youre Still Alive, is the latest and weirdest course offered by the year-old online New Canoe University, based in Sausalito, just north of San Francisco.
																																	By selling bodily fluids and participating in medical experiments, a human being can earn $20,000 or more per year, said course instructor Bob Heyman on Thursday. This is literally the only business out there where you can always carry your assets with you and theyre renewable to boot.
																																	Using Internet-based learning modules with titles like Bleeding for Bucks, the course teaches students how to make money by legally selling their blood, sperm, eggs, hair and bone marrow, and by taking part in paid medical trials and research. The sale of vital organs is illegal in the US. 
																													 																Sweet side
 Oslo (Reuters): Norways finance minister 
 showed a sweeter side on Thursday by penning a poem to calm 
 chocolate factory workers protests against high taxes. 
 In a novel form of fiscal argument, Per-Kristian Foss presented 
 a debut poem on the governments website along with a tempting 
 introduction saying it could freely be enjoyed, sucked, 
 swallowed or copied. In the poem, in Norwegian, Foss laments 
 his duty to balance the budget but gives no hope of lower 
 taxes on chocolate and candy production. He concludes: Live 
 sweet in the hope of a fee-less fest/ Tax-free chocolate 
 probably tastes the best. Everyone from producers to sweet-toothed 
 children complain that Norwegian candy prices are higher 
 than elsewhere in Europe. Foss entitled his 32-line poem 
 Per-Kristian and the Chocolate Factory, a play on 
 Roald Dahls childrens book Charlie and the Chocolate 
 Factory.
																													 																Sick scent
																																	 Jerusalem (Reuters): Israeli police had to close an entire floor of their station because the pungent scent of tonnes of confiscated marijuana was making them high, an Israeli newspaper said on Friday. The drugs, smuggled from Egypt, are kept in a storeroom of a police station in the southern town of Dimona. Police have confiscated so much, that the room is filled up almost immediately after its contents are sent to be incinerated. Every time I came to work I felt... like I was high, the Maariv newspaper quoted one officer as saying. The smell of marijuana was killing us  it was impossible to work.

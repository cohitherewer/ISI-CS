(Reuters)																								Washington, March 30 (Reuters): President George W. Bush reversed course today and agreed to let his national security adviser give sworn public testimony before the 9/11 commission, while he and Vice-President Dick Cheney will meet privately the full panel in a separate session. 																								The dramatic about-face on the two questions came in a March 30 letter to the bipartisan panel from White House counsel Alberto Gonzalez, who said the appearances could take place if the panel agreed they would not set a precedent under the constitutional separation of executive and legislative powers.																								The President recognises the truly unique and extraordinary circumstances underlying the commissions responsibility to prepare a detailed report on the facts and circumstances of the horrific attacks on September 11, 2001, Gonzalez wrote to the commission chairman, Republican Thomas Kean, and vice chairman, Democrat Lee Hamilton. The commission quickly agreed, while the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, US House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate majority leader Bill Frist, gave similar assurances.																								These decisions represent a significant contribution by the President to the work of the commission, consistent with our mandate, the panel said in a statement, promising to promptly schedule both sessions.																								The move was a stunning reversal for the White House, which after initially resisting creation of the commission, had adamantly refused to allow Rice to testify in public and said Bush would speak only to Kean and Hamilton inside of all 10 members  five Republicans and five Democrats.																								Bush came under increasing pressure with counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarkes bombshell allegations that the administration ignored the urgency of an al Qaida threat before September 11, 2001, and then focused on Iraq as a likely culprit afterward.																								The allegations from Clarke, who served four US Presidents, challenged Bushs image as a strong leader on homeland security and the US war on terrorism, which the President has been showcasing in his re-election campaign.																								We applaud the decision of the President to allow the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, to testify, Hastert and Frist said in a statement noting the unique nature of the hijacked airliner attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people.																								Rice, who was at the forefront of a furious public White House counterattack against Clarke last week, met the panel privately for four hours in February, but was not under oath.																								Though she asked to return before the commission to refute Clarkes allegations, the White House refused to let her testify publicly citing a long-standing position that presidential advisers who have not been confirmed by the US Senate cannot give public testimony. But after hearing from Clarke under oath last week, panel members insisted unanimously that Rice testify in public and under oath.																								Rice also faced the demand from Democrats, who have suggested that the White House refusal meant the administration had something to hide.																								Democrats decried as an abuse of power the furious assault on Clarkes credibility that sought to cast the long-time staff member as a disgruntled employee seeking to undermine Bush with politically motivated accusations. We now all wait with baited breath to hear what Condoleezza Rice will testify to under oath, said Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York.

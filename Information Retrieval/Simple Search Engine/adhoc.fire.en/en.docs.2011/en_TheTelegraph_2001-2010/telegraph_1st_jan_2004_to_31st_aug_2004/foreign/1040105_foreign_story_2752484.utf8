 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Libya -bomb finger at Pak
																								London, Jan. 4 (PTI): Libya bought plans to make a nuclear bomb from Pakistani scientists for millions of pounds, Saif al-Islam Gadaffi, son of Libyan chief colonel Muammar Gadaffi, has admitted.																								In an interview published in the Sunday Times today, 32-year-old Saif said his country had spent $40 million on its quest to acquire nuclear capability. Some of the five-star Libyan scientists working on the bomb had trained in Britain, he claimed. He confirmed that Libya had bought nuclear components, including centrifuges, from a variety of black market dealers.																								Some of the material came from Malaysia and various Asian countries, he said. Other components had been bought on the black market in South Africa. We dealt with an underground network of middle men and secret work-shops, he said. This piece from here, that piece from there.																								According to the report, revelations of the extent of Pakistani involvement will certainly increase American and British pressure on Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, who is already accused of failing to prevent the illicit sale of nuclear material to Iran. 																								Pakistan admitted last week that rogue scientists may have peddled technology for individual gain. It said several had been questioned, among them Abdul Qadeer Khan, regarded as the father of the countrys nuclear bomb. 																								British and American experts who went to inspect Libyan weapons sites were taken aback when they found that nuclear scientists working for Gadaffi had what one western official described as a full bomb dossier from the Pakistanis.																								Western officials said the Pakistani scientists had received payments from Libya  which they said could have been substantially higher, even as much as $100 million  over several years, starting in the late 1990s. 																								They appeared to have been working on their own account, without the knowledge of the authorities in Islamabad, the report said.

Rafah (Gaza Strip), May 18 (Reuters): Surveying the blood-stained ruins of her daughters home in the Rafah refugee camp, Miriam Abu Jazzar wondered aloud today whether she should now flee like hundreds of her neighbours in Gaza.																								Israeli missiles crashed into her part of the camp overnight, flattening a house next door to her own and killing three men, including her nephew, described by residents as a Palestinian intelligence officer moonlighting as a militant.																								Emerging into nearly deserted streets during a break in the fighting, Abu Jazzar gave thanks that her daughter and grandchildren had escaped unscathed, seeking refuge at a local school. But she cursed the Israelis for killing her nephew.																								They said they were going after wanted people. Its all lies, she said near the destroyed house, where a bloodied cinderblock lay amid the rubble.																								Abu Jazzar had not joined panicking neighbours who abandoned the area on Monday, piling mattresses and belongings on donkey carts and rickety old trucks. She thought her neighbourhood was far enough from the army-controlled Philadelphi road to be out of harms way. Today she appeared to be rethinking her decision. We are afraid, she said. Every hour there is shooting.

 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 W. Asia foes to swap prisoners
																								Beirut/Jerusalem, Jan. 25 (Reuters): Two of the most bitter enemies in West Asia, Israel and Hizbollah, will carry out the first stage of a German-mediated prisoner swap on Thursday, the leader of the Lebanese guerrilla group said today.																								Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, defending the exchange against criticism in Israel that it would strengthen Hizbollah and Palestinian militants, called the agreement a correct, moral and responsible decision.																								The deal, three years in the making, includes the release of 400 Palestinian, 23 Lebanese and 12 other Arab prisoners as well as a German citizen, in return for an abducted Israeli businessman and three soldiers, presumed dead.																								Hizbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said a second stage of negotiations would deal with the fate of Israeli airman Ron Arad, missing in Lebanon since 1986, and four Iranian diplomats kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 during the Israeli invasion.																								Defence minister Shaul Mofaz said in a speech in Tel Aviv today that Israel was paying a very heavy price for the deal but was now closer than ever to resolving the mystery surrounding Arad. 																								Sharon has been accused by Arads family and other Israelis who have mounted a campaign to keep him in the public eye of abandoning the airman, who has become a national hero in Israel.																								Thursday will be the date of the exchange of prisoners who are alive, Nasrallah told a news conference in Beirut. He said Israel would return the bodies of 59 Lebanese and Palestinian guerrillas on Friday.																								Hizbollah, which is backed by Iran and Syria, was a driving force behind Israels troop withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 after a 22-year occupation. 																								Nasrallah said the Lebanese and some Arab prisoners would be flown to Beirut while the Palestinians would return to Gaza and the West Bank. Some freed Syrians would go back to their homes in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.																								He said Hizbollah would hand the four Israelis to a German mediator in Beirut on Thursday.

 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 US entry checks draw ally fire
London, April 3 (Reuters): The British travel industry warned the US yesterday its plan to fingerprint and photograph travellers on arrival in America could hurt tourism amid concerns of lengthening airport delays.																								These new moves clearly will not help to encourage UK citizens to travel to the USA, and we would urge very strongly that the American authorities reconsider their actions, said a spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents.																								The US introduced a new travel policy yesterday requiring citizens of 27 nations, including close allies such as Britain, Japan and Australia, to be photographed and fingerprinted in a measure to begin by September 30.																								Two digital index finger scans and a digital photograph will be required of all travellers from the countries, a plan designed to boost airport security and avoid attacks like those of September 11, 2001.																								While US officials tried to ease the publics practical concerns over time delays, some British travellers questioned its necessity. I am perturbed by the decision. It is an invasion of privacy and an over reaction on the behalf of the US government, Matthew Richardson, a frequent business traveller from London, said. British officials said they were working closely with the US on enhancing air travel security measures, but the government said there were no immediate plans to introduce a similar plan for incoming travellers.																								Britain is investing in a host of new technologies including iris scanning devices to keep delays to a minimum and security tight.																								We need to balance strict controls with allowing low risk passengers to pass quickly through the airports into the UK, he said. The countries named are part of Americas Visa Waiver Programme. Photos and fingerprints are already required from citizens of other nations for whom US visas are required for entry.British author detained																								The case of a renowned British author denied US entry for 36 hours this week for lack of a work visa was handled properly, homeland security officials said yesterday, deflecting complaints about murky immigration rules.																								Ian McEwan, whose latest novel Atonement was nominated for Britains Book of the Year award, was stopped in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Tuesday morning as he prepared to enter the US for a series of paid lectures and a hiking trip. I consider this a win-win situation, said James Michie, a spokesman for the US department of homeland security. He was apparently unaware of the need for a visa, but he was able to get one and complete his trip.																								The US allows citizens of 29 nations, including Britain, to visit as tourists without a visa. Journalists and others on business trips typically need special visas. McEwan was receiving honorariums of $5,000 per speech and attendees had paid as much as $100 each for tickets to hear him on his current speaking tour in the US.																								It doesnt matter how much he was getting paid. A visa is required. That is the law and there is no way to get around that, Michie said.

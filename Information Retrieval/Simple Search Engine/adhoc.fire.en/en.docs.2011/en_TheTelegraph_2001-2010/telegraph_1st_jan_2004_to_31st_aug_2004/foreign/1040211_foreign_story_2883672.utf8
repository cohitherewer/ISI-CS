 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 New worm targets Microsoft
																								Seattle, Feb. 10 (Reuters): A new worm dubbed Doomjuice targeting Microsoft Corps website emerged on the Internet yesterday, which security experts said slowed parts of the software makers home page.																								Doomjuice, which some are describing as a variant of the MyDoom worm, spreads via e-mail systems already infected with the first version, which became the fastest-spreading virus ever when it was unleashed on the Internet at the end of January.																								Its only looking for machines that are compromised by MyDoom A or B, said Vincent Gullotto, vice-president of the anti-virus emergency response team at Network Associates Inc. 																								Because Doomjuice spreads directly between infected computers, rather than via e-mail, experts said that it would not be accurate to call it a variant of MyDoom.

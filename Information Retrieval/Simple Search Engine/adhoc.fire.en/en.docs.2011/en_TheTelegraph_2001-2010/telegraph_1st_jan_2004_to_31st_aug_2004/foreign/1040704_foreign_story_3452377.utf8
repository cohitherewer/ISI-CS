 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Police raid Yukos offices in Moscow
																								Moscow, July 3 (Reuters): Russian officials swamped the Moscow headquarters of oil company Yukos today to take over the building, two days after a court froze its assets and gave it until next week to pay a $3.4 billion tax bill.																								The OMON (police special forces) arrived, they are going to take over our central office, said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. They are waiting for the prosecutor. Shadrin said oil production could stop after police confiscated vital computer servers during the raid.																								Our central dispatch unit responsible for oil production is in this building. Confiscating servers means damaging the coordination of production in our core regions (in Siberia). This means output may stop as soon as today, said Shadrin. 																								Up to 40 officials in plainclothes arrived at the firms steel and glass office block in south central Moscow in the early afternoon. Security guards at the building allowed them to come and go freely, but barred journalists from entering.																								NTV television said they came from the ministry of interior and the prosecutors office, 																								Many officials milled around in the lobby, barely visible behind the dark-tinted windows.																								The investigative actions are being undertaken as part of a criminal case into fraud and tax evasion by entities controlled by Yukos, a spokesman for the general prosecutors office was quoted as saying by Russias Interfax news agency.																								The raid only adds to the uncertainty surrounding the future of Yukos and its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.

(AFP)																								Islamabad, Jan. 9: Four army soldiers were killed and two critically injured in a rocket attack overnight on a military base in South Waziristan, bordering Afghanistan.																								The rocket attack is not, however, linked with the search for foreign terrorists in the area which concluded late last night, Pakistan army Spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan said.																								However, he said there were no casualties during the search operation conducted with 20 Cobra helicopter gunships and other combat helicopters.																								Reports from Waziristan, said there were four dead and five injured in the attack.																								An inquiry has already been ordered into the rocket attack, Sultan said but refused to disclose the location from where the rocket was fired. The offensive was launched after a tip-off three days ago that a group of armed men, believed to be foreign terrorists, were hiding in the area. Tribal elders were contacted but the militants refused to surrender.																								We had confirmed intelligence reports about the presence of foreign terrorists, Sultan said but did not disclose their nationalities, saying it will jeopardise whatever progress has been achieved so far.																								The army troops arrested at least 15 persons during the house-to-house search in the area, bordering Afghanistans Patkia province. General Sultan did not rule out more searches and high profile military operations in the area. Such operations can be launched any time, he added.																								The army and paramilitary troops had surrounded the hamlet Kaloo Shah, 20 km west of Wana. They had sealed off all access routes to the village of about 20 houses as they continued the search for militants they believe were hiding there, sources said. The spokesman denied reports that US forces also took part in the search operation in the border region. Whenever an operation is launched in Pakistani territory, it is conducted by our forces, he said.																								The border region comprises of seven semi-autonomous tribal regions  each called an agency. The central government has limited authority on agency territory and can intervene only through a special set of laws. Musharraf security																								Pakistans security establishment went into a tizzy after a private van made a vain bid to break the security cordon around President Pervez Musharrafs convoy as it passed through the Islamabad highway yesterday.																								 A van tried to move out of a petrol station and headed towards the presidential convoy when it was on the Islamabad-Rawalpindi highway, the daily Dawn said.

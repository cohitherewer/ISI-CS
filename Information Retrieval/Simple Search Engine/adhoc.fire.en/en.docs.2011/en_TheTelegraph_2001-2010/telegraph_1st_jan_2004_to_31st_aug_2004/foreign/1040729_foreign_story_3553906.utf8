 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Harvard to return UAE Presidents $2.5-m gift
				 	 Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan																								Boston, July 28 (AP): Harvard Divinity School said it will return a gift of $2.5 million from the President of the United Arab Emirates after the donor, criticised for possible links to anti-semitism, asked for his money back.																								The return of the gift ends years of controversy surrounding the connection between the President, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan, to an Abu Dhabi-based think tank.																								Recently, representatives of the UAE informed Harvard of the donors desire to withdraw the gift for the Zayed professorship, the school said in a statement.																								In 1998, the university proposed that the gift be used for a divinity school professorship in Islamic religious studies. Zayed signed off on the donation in 2000. A number of students and faculty objected to the gift and urged Harvard to return the funds. 																								They said the Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-up, which was established in Abu Dhabi with the aim of promoting Arab unity, had sponsored speeches and published writing from people accused of anti-semitism. And the centres executive director had also been documented as making anti-semitic statements.																								The UAE closed the centre last August, and Harvard put the gift on hold as it reviewed whether to return it.

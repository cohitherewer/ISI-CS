				 	 Morrocans Jamal Zougam (left) and Mohamed Bekkali																								Madrid, March 19 (Reuters): Three Moroccan and two Indian men detained over the Madrid bombings were accused of terrorist crimes in court today, but denied any links to al Qaida and said they were asleep at the time of the attacks.																								During a gruelling seven-hour overnight hearing at Madrids High Court, the three Moroccans were accused of 190 murders and belonging to a terrorist group. The Indians were accused of cooperating with a terrorist group, court sources said.																								Under the Spanish legal system, the accusations made against the five means the court considers there is a case to answer, providing grounds to keep them in custody. A decision on formal charges is taken later. One of the Moroccans considered a main suspect  Jamal Zougam  wept in court before returning to pray in his cell, the sources said. The five detainees have denied any involvement... They have all said that when the attack took place on March 11 they were sleeping in their respective homes, a source said.																								They say they dont have any link with al Qaida or any terrorist organisation. All five were ordered held in custody after their initial appearance, which ended at 0300 GMT today morning. They were taken to Soto de Real jail, just north of Madrid.																								Bombs exploded on four packed commuter trains in Madrid on March 11, killing 202 people. The attacks, the bloodiest since the Bali bombings in 2002, have been claimed by a militant Islamic group aligning itself to al Qaida.																								There was no immediate explanation of why the men were accused of 190 murders. It could relate to the number of bodies formally identified. Investigators have said an unexploded bomb found on one of the trains, containing a mobile phone that would have been used to activate the bomb, provided valuable evidence.																								As well as Zougam, the other two Moroccans have been named as his brother Mohamed Chaoui and Mohamed Bekkali. The three were all detained in a telephone shop run by Zougam in Madrid. 																								As well as cooperating with extremists, the two Indians, Suresh Kumar and Vinay Khohy, were accused of forging documents.																								Sources said the five were being held in solitary confinement, though they can see a court-appointed lawyer.																								Five more people  four North Africans and a Spaniard  were arrested on Thursday as part of the investigation. Judge Juan Del Olmo is expected to question them by next Tuesday.																								The Spaniard, captured near Oviedo in northern Spain, is suspected of stealing the locally-made explosives used.																								At 202, the Madrid death toll has matched that of the 2002 Bali attack, the worst of its kind since the September 11 attacks on Washington and New York. Some 1,816 people were wounded in the Madrid bombings.

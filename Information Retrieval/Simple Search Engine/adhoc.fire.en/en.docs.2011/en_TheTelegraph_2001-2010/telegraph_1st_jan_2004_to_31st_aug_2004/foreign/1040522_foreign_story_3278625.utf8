(AFP) 																								Dhaka, May 21 (Agencies): A powerful bomb exploded at a Muslim shrine in Bangladesh today, killing two men and injuring nearly 60 people, including the British ambassador.																								Police and officials said British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury was hit below the knees by splinters when the bomb went off as he participated in noon prayers at the Hazrat Shahjalal shrine in the northeastern town of Sylhet.																								It was the second blast at the shrine this year after an explosion killed three people in January. District officials said they had no immediate idea who caused todays blast. We still do not have any clear suspect but surely someone used the device with ulterior motives, said Sardar Rakibul Islam, additional superintendent of police in Sylhet, a town of 2.5 million people. We are investigating. No one has been arrested so far.																								Choudhury, who was born near Sylhet and went to Britain at the age of seven or eight before returning as a diplomat, was flown to Dhaka by military helicopter and then taken to a military hospital.																								Our priority is to get him in for immediate check up and further treatment, a military spokesman said.																								In Sylhet, torn slippers, shoes, caps and blood-stained shirts littered the exit of the shrine, where the bomb exploded as prayers were ending, local reporters said, adding that shrine officials and devotees had been shattered by the events.																								We knew the ambassador would be coming here to revisit his home and meet the people, who are very proud to have one of us as Britains high commissioner, said Towfiq Anam, a teacher.																								But the visit ended in tragedy. We are shocked and very sad.																								As Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia urged officials to immediately find and punish those involved, the foreign ministry said in a statement that the government had expressed the deepest shock and anger at the mindless act of violence.																								In a statement, British foreign secretary Jack Straw said: I am deeply shocked by news of this bomb and I extend my sympathies to all the victims and their families.																								Details of exactly what happened and the nature of injuries are not clear, he said in a statement. We are grateful for the support we are receiving from the Bangladeshi authorities.																								Paramilitary soldiers fanned out to guard Sylhet, from which come most of the Bangladeshis who live in Britain.																								This is a hell of a scene with dozens of injured lying in the emergency ward and on the corridors, a reporter at the Sylhet Medical College Hospital said.																								About 60 wounded people were brought to the hospital, Abdus Salam, a doctor in the emergency ward, said. Some were released after receiving first aid.																								Salam said Chowdhury was treated for splinters in his legs below the knees but his condition was not serious.																								Police and reporters said two men died, one of them a student at a local university.																								Police said they believed the bomb had been carried in by someone attending the prayers. But a shrine official said it could have been thrown into the compound from outside. The impact of the powerful bomb caused a huge crater in the ground, private TV channel NTV reported.																								It said a man suspected of hurling the bomb was handed over to police by witnesses.																								Choudhury, who took up his post only last week, hails from Sunamganj, a district neighbouring Sylhet. 																								He was on a three-day trip to the area to visit his ancestral home and attend a civic reception in his honour, local officials and media said. He appeared to be in excruciating pain while being assisted to board a vehicle leaving the hospital for the helipad, a witness in Sylhet said.																								Authorities have yet to complete investigations into the January blast at the shrine, which also injured about 50 people.

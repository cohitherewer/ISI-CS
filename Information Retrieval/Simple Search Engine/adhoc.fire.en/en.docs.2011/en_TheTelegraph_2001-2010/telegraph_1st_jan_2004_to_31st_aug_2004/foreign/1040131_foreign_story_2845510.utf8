																								Tehran, Jan. 30 (Reuters): Irans hardline Guardian Council has withstood an onslaught of appeals from irate reformists and today reversed candidacy bans on only one-third of hopefuls for next months parliamentary poll.																								The hardline watchdog also said it would not postpone the February 20 parliamentary election, despite a call to do so from the interior ministry. The council had banned almost half of the 8,200 hopefuls for the February 20 vote, mainly allies of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, including 80 deputies from the 290-seat parliament.																								More than 1,160 were reinstated, said a Guardian Council statement read out on state television. Some 3,300 out of 3,600 banned candidates had appealed. The issue of postponement was discussed and was not agreed, said Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of the conservative watchdog in a statement on the Guardian Council website.																								Parliamentarian Ali Tajernia said none the famous liberal firebrands had been cleared to run.Those who have been approved are those who will not aid a competitive election, he said.

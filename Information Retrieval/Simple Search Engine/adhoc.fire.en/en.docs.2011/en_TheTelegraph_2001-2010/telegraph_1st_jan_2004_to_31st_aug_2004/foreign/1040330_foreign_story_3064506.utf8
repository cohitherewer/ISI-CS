The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Clarke card boomerangs on Bush
				 	 National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. (Reuters)																								Washington, March 29 (Reuters): The White House may have mishandled accusations levelled by their former counter-terrorism adviser Richard Clarke by attacking his credibility, keeping the controversy firmly in the headlines into a second week, political analysts said.																								Clarkes charge that the Bush administration did not regard the threat posed by the al Qaida organisation as an urgent matter in the run-up to September 11, 2001, has been superseded by a secondary issue of whether National Security adviser Condoleezza Rice should testify under oath before the national commission investigating that days attacks.																								The administrations attempts to discredit Clarke have backfired. They have merely given the story legs and hurt the administration. The issue of whether Rice should testify should keep the story alive for several more news cycles, said University of Chicago political scientist Robert Pape.																								The Bush administration and its allies have certainly not helped the story go away, said Howard Opinsky, a Republican operative who ran media relations for Arizona Senatr John McCain during his 2000 presidential bid. Instead, they adopted the risky strategy of trying to refute his charges, which makes it appear that they have something to hide, he said.																								Clarke accuses Bush, who is running for re-election on his record of fighting terrorism, of being obsessed with ousting Iraqs President Saddam Hussein at the expense of fully focusing on the war against terrorism.																								The White House at first questioned an assertion by Clarke that President George W. Bush asked him immediately after September 11 to investigate whether Saddam was involved but yesterday it confirmed that the conversation had taken place.																								When Republicans said they would seek to declassify testimony Clarke gave to Congress in July 2002 to demonstrate differences to what he is saying now, Clarke told them to go ahead. If that occurs, the issue will remain in the headlines even longer.																								Polls have shown that 90 per cent of US voters were following the issue and that it was beginning to hurt Bush. A Newsweek poll released yesterday found that 57 per cent of voters approved of the way he had handled terrorism and homeland security, down from 70 per cent two months ago. But two thirds said Clarkes testimony had not influenced their overall view of Bush. Half said they thought Clarke was acting for personal and political reasons.																								Looming over the summer is the commissions final report, due to be delivered in late July, when the presidential campaign will be at fever pitch.																								Pressure for Rice to testify in public has come from family members of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks as well as members of the commission, including all five Republican members.																								Rice has said she would like to testify but had to respect the precedent that national security advisers do not testify under oath before Congress as this could inhibit their ability to give candid advice to the President. She has spent four hours answering commissioners questions in private.																								Republican political consultant Scott Reed said the administration had succeeded in discrediting Clarkes motives to some extent. But the issue of Rice testifying was continuing to hurt the White House since many Americans wanted to hear what she had to say.

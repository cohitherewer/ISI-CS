(AFP)																								Lahore, August 3 (Reuters): Pakistan will not send troops to Iraq, information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said today, hours after the Prime Minister said a decision would depend on what his people wanted.																								We are not sending troops. Other countries are withdrawing troops so how can we send them? Ahmed, the governments chief spokesman, told a news conference in Lahore.																								The government has long been undecided on sending troops to Iraq, an explosive issue in the Islamic nation where conservative religious groups strongly oppose President Pervez Musharrafs support for the US-led war on terror.																								The issue has become even more sensitive since the execution of two Pakistani migrant workers in Iraq last week. 																								Critics have blamed the government for failing to make a categorical statement that it was not sending troops to Iraq. Such a statement could have saved the mens lives, they said.																								The official APP news agency earlier quoted Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain as saying in Lahore that nobody was going to take a decision against the aspirations of the people of Pakistan.																								Hussain did not specify what he meant, but many commentators say the proposal could be put before parliament, where it would face a fierce challenge from the Islamic Opposition bloc.																								But Rashid categorically ruled out such a move, saying that approaching parliament was not an option now.																								India has already said it would not send troops to Iraq, while Spain and the Philippines have withdrawn soldiers posted there.																								Pakistans foreign ministry yesterday attempted to deflect criticism over the deaths of the two hostages.																								Right now, the President of Pakistan has said this categorically, and we have been saying very categorically, that we are not sending any troops under the present circumstances, spokesman Masood Khan told a news conference.																								And what are the present circumstances? The situation in Iraq is volatile and unstable, he added. Pakistan says it is still waiting to see the reaction of other Muslim countries to a Saudi Arabian proposal to send troops from Muslim countries to Iraq.																								Pakistan has said in the past it would only send troops to Iraq in a peacekeeping role, under the UN umbrella, and if the Iraqis welcomed them.																								The Saudi proposal has won some backing in Washington, which is trying to involve Muslim countries in providing security for Iraq as its forces are bogged down by a bloody insurgency since Saddam Husseins government was overthrown last year.

 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Maoists seize 300 students, says witness
																								Kathmandu, Feb. 20 (AFP): Maoist rebels in Nepal have abducted about 300 school students and half-a-dozen teachers from a school in midwestern Rolpa district, a teacher who witnessed the incident said today.																								The kidnappings occurred on Wednesday from Saiwang Secondary School at Holeri village, teacher Khem Bahadur Budha said by telephone. 																								Armed Maoists forced the students from grade six to 10 and teachers to go with them, Budha said, adding that he feared the abductees would be forced to undergo military training by the rebels and be drafted into their rebellion against the Nepalese authorities.																								The incident has terrified other students and teachers who have stopped going to schools, forcing the school management to close down hundreds of schools in the area, Budha said.																								 Maoists last week abducted more than 700 students and teachers in western Achham district, but released most of them after first enforcing their attendance at celebrations marking the 8th anniverary of the launch of their peoples war. 																								Elsewhere, security forces today killed seven Maoists during a clash in Bankatwa village in Banke district, southwest of here, an army source said.

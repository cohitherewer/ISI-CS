 RICHARD SAVILL				 	 Arthur Conan Doyle																								London, June 1: Solving the mystery of the Hound of the Baskervilles may have been the easy part for Sherlock Holmes. For even the detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle might find it hard to reach a conclusion about new claims on the origins of the ghostly beast.																								Tradition has always had it that Holmes most famous case was set on foggy Dartmoor and the inspiration for the story came from the areas people, places and folklore.																								However, the thriller writer Phil Rickman believes that Herefordshire may also have played a part. And his claims, which are due to be published this week in the magazine Sherlock, have provoked a furore in Devon. Speculation that some of the story originated in Herefordshire began 50 years ago. Rickman claims to have linked everything together  and to have been convinced by a coincidence of related names.																								The medieval Baskervilles had a castle at Eardisley, near Kington, Herefordshire, he wrote. Consider also Dr Mortimer, who first enlists the aid of Sherlock Holmes in the affair of the hound. The Mortimers were the powerful Norman barons who controlled the Welsh Marches around Kington. 																								Then there is Stapleton [the naturalist]. A few miles from Kington, complete with a ruined castle on a hill, is the hamlet of Stapleton. Rickman believes that Conan Doyle may have drawn some of his inspiration for the character of the wicked Hugo Baskerville from the legend of Black Vaughan of Kington and his dog.																								Black Vaughan, a lord living about five centuries ago, was supposed to have appeared in Kington market place after his death in the Wars of the Roses as a black bull and to have devastated the church. Many local people still refuse to walk near his home of Hergest Croft at night for fear of seeing his ghost and that of his black dog. 																								Rickman made his claims after researching his latest book, The Prayer of the Night Shepherd. He said: The ghostly hound legend is well established around Kington and stories about Conan Doyle being related to the descendants of the Baskerville family and visiting on a regular basis are firmly rooted in the area. I believe the story is based on the Hergest hound but Conan Doyle blurred the sources by adding elements from Devon. The hound may have been a bit of a mongrel.																								Guidebooks to Devon point to the ghostly hound connected with the death of Dartmoors Sir Richard Cabell as the model for Hugo Baskerville. The story is firmly set on Dartmoor and the fact that Conan Doyle may have found inspiration from stories in other parts of the country does not alter that fact, a spokesman for Dartmoor National Park said.

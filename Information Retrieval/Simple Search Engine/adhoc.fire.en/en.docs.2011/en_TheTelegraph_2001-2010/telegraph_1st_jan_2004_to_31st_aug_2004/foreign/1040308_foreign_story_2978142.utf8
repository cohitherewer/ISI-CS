				 	 Stewart in court. (AFP)																								New York, March 7 (Reuters): Martha Stewart, who built a media empire on tips for gracious living, has been found guilty of lying to investigators over a suspicious stock sale and could now face prison time.																								Stewart, 62, stood stone still in the courtroom on Friday and showed no emotion as she heard the verdict, which ended a seven-week trial. She later said she would appeal.																								The eight women and four men returned their verdict on the third day of deliberations. Stewart was found guilty of one count of conspiracy, two counts of making false statements and one count of obstruction of agency proceedings.																								Wearing a black pantsuit, Stewart solemnly left the courthouse among a throng of hundreds of people and a small group chanting We Love you Martha.																								I will appeal the verdict and continue to fight to clear my name. I believe in the fairness of the judicial system and remain confident that I will ultimately prevail, she said in a letter posted on her personal website, www.marthatalks.com.

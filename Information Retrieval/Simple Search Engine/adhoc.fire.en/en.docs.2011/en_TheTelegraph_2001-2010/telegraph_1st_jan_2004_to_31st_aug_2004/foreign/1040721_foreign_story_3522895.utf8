 Wednesday, July 21, 2004 				 Unrepentant Blair opts for spy agency reforms
																								London, July 20 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced reforms to government and spy agencies today to try to quell a furore over a damning report into flawed intelligence on Iraqi weapons.																								But Blair, whose public trust ratings have plunged in the wars aftermath, was again forced to defend himself against the charge he duped parliament and the country over Iraqs weapons of mass destruction the primary reason he gave for war.																								The intelligence really left little doubt about Saddam (Hussein) and weapons of mass destruction, Blair said in a final debate on Iraq before parliament breaks for summer on Thursday. I dont accept it was a mistake to go to war. I think it was the right thing to do. I still believe it was the right thing to do, he added.																								Blair had hoped to draw a line under the Iraq debacle with the report on intelligence, published last week by former civil servant Lord Butler.																								Instead, Butlers findings have revived the row over the US-led conflict and given Blairs critics fresh ammunition to question his credibility  an issue they hope will feature prominently in next years expected general election.																								Blairs Labour Party has suffered a string of embarrassing electoral losses in past months, partly due to an Iraq backlash. Opinion polls put him on track to lead Labour to a third general election victory but his trust ratings continue to suffer.																								Butler cleared Blair of distorting spies assessments on Iraq but exposed faulty intelligence. He criticised Blairs informal style of government and its closeness to secret agents.																								In response, Blair said in any future document, like a now notorious September 2002 dossier on Iraqs weapons, intelligence would be presented separately from the political case.																								He also signalled a change to the informal meetings he held with senior ministers, intelligence chiefs and officials in the run-up to war  excluding his whole cabinet of senior ministers. In any future situation, such a group ... would operate formally as an ad hoc committee of cabinet, he said.																								The Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, has appointed a senior officer to work through Butlers recommendations, Blair said. Those steps failed to silence his critics. Intelligence was sporadic, patchy, little and limited. Why did the Prime Minister say it was extensive, detailed and authoritative? asked Michael Howard, leader of the Opposition Conservative Party, which supported the war. The country was given a misleading impression of what the intelligence services said, Howard added. But Howards own credibility came under attack after he said he would not have backed the war in a crucial vote in March 2003 if he had known then what he knows now about intelligence. He spent much of the debate explaining his position.Filipino hostage freed																								A Filipino truck driver held hostage in Iraq for two weeks was freed unhurt today, a day after Manila withdrew its troops in response to demands from kidnappers. The kidnappers of Angelo de la Cruz dropped him at the UAE embassy in Baghdad this morning.																								 He was taken to the Philippine embassy, where he looked tired and occasionally brushed away tears.

 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Ireland fumes as smoking ban looms
																								Dublin, March 24 (Reuters): Ireland is set to stamp out smoking in bars and restaurants from Monday in the biggest such crackdown yet seen in Europe but one which has angered the owners of some of the countrys renowned pubs.																								The ban is being viewed a test case for the rest of the EU and comes in the wake of similar campaigns in several US cities. From midnight on Sunday, it will be illegal to smoke in virtually all workplaces, closed public spaces and on public transport, with fines of up to 3,000 euros for transgressors.																								The government says the ban will help save some of the 7,000 lives lost to smoking-related diseases in Ireland each year. But critics say it will diminish Irelands famous pub culture, drive tourists from the Emerald Isle and cost hundreds of jobs in the catering, entertainment and tobacco industries.

 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 5 Pak tribal suspects ready to surrender 
				 	 A soldier on patrol in Wana. (Reuters)																								Wana, April 22 (Reuters): Five wanted tribesmen involved in fierce clashes with Pakistani forces last month are ready to hand in their guns, and may give the government a list of foreign militants in the area, officials said today.																								Intelligence officials said that the government was seeking to apprehend 25 senior al Qaida and Taliban suspects.																								Other than these 25, foreigners involved in fighting the Soviets in neighbouring Afghanistan during the 1980s and in supporting the ousted Taliban militia would be allowed to stay in the region as long as they registered their presence.																								More than 120 people were killed in March when Pakistani forces clashed with foreign militants and their local allies in the remote, semi-autonomous tribal belt bordering Afghanistan.																								Pakistan, keen to avoid a repeat of the botched operation, want to find a political solution through tribal elders.																								Some 500 to 600 foreign fighters, including Arabs and Central Asians, are said to be in the area.																								The US military suspects al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden, his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri and former Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar are somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Yes, they have shown readiness to surrender, said Mahmood Shah, security chief of the tribal belt, referring to five locals accused of harbouring al Qaida militants.																								He said negotiations were now focusing on a list the government wants the five tribal suspects to produce of foreign militants living in the area. Maulana Mairajuddin, an Islamic cleric mediating between the authorities and the tribal suspects, said the wanted men had given assurances they would cooperate.

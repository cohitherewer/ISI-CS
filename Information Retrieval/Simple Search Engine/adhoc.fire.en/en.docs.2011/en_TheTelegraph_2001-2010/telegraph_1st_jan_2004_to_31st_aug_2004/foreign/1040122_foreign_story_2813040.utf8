 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Kelly saw weapons threat from Iraq: BBC
				 	 David Kelly 																								London, Jan. 21 (Reuters): David Kelly, the weapons expert whose suicide rocked the British government, believed Iraq did pose an immediate threat, the BBC said today, just days before a critical report into his death.																								Kelly told the BBC before the war that Iraqs weapons could have taken days or weeks to deploy. But he did not back Prime Minister Tony Blairs notorious claim that they could be fired in 45 minutes.																								The failure to find Iraqs weapons of mass destruction  the primary Anglo-American motive for war  has eroded public trust in Blair, putting him in the most precarious position of his six-and-a-half-year premiership.																								Next week is crunch time for the beleaguered Prime Minister.																								Judge Lord Hutton will release his potentially explosive report into Kellys suicide on January 28, one day after a make-or-break parliamentary vote that Blair could lose.																								Kelly slashed his wrist in a deserted copse last July after being revealed as the source for a BBC reporters claim that Blairs team inflated the threat posed by Iraq, to justify war.																								Blair was again forced to defend his motives for the Iraq war before parliament today.																								Charles Kennedy, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, accused Blair and President George W. Bush of downgrading their assessment of Iraqs armament from weapons to weapons programmes and now to weapons of mass destruction-related programme activities  a phrase used by Bush yesterday.																								But a defiant Blair responded: There can be no doubt at all that those weapons existed, absolutely no doubt. Nevertheless, he has acknowledged that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in Iraq. 																								Kellys comments on Iraqs weapons  never previously broadcast  were to be aired later today in a BBC Panorama programme that reconstructed the run-up to his death and Huttons inquiry. Asked if Iraq was an immediate threat, Kelly, a former UN weapons inspector, said: Yes. 																								Even if theyre not actually filled and deployed today, the capability exists to get them filled and deployed within a matter of days and weeks, he said in the October 2002 interview with the BBC, which was submitted to Hutton. Kelly was outed last July as the source behind an explosive report by BBC correspondent Andrew Gilligan. Gilligan reported that the government included in a September 2002 dossier on Iraqs weapons the claim that some weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes of an order to do so, knowing it to be wrong.

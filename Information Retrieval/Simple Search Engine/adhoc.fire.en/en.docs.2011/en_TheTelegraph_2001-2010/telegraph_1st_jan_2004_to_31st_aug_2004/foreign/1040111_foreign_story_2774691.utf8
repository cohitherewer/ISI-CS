The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Pervez attack suspects identified
				 	 Pervez Musharraf																								Islamabad, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Pakistans information minister said today police had identified almost all the suspects behind recent attempts on President Pervez Musharrafs life but were still seeking the masterminds.																								We have reached their entire network and almost the whole case is in its final stage, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said. He declined to say how many people had been arrested so far.																								The minister told a news conference that police had reached almost all the suspects believed to be involved in the attacks on Musharraf in Rawalpindi in December.																								It is not possible that they did not have links to people outside the country. This is what we are working on. Who were their masterminds? he added.																								Musharraf survived two major attempts on his life in the space of two weeks. The first was made by blowing up a bridge his motorcade had used moments before and the second involved two cars loaded with explosives ramming into his motorcade.																								Ahmed said the government had approved an amendment to an anti-terrorism law raising the prison term to four to 10 years for financing of terrorism, up from six months to five years.																								The financing of terrorism has also been made an offence for which bail is not possible, he added. Pakistan is a key ally of the US in its so-called war on terror. Government officials say so far they have arrested more than 500 al Qaida members and Taliban remnants in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.  Waziristan deadline																								The army today set a 48-hour deadline to tribal leaders in the mountainous region near the border with Afghanistan to surrender al Qaida terror suspects or face military action.																								Brigadier Mehmood Shah gave the deadline after addressing local elders in South Waziristan on the fourth day of operation against al Qaida suspects.

 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Sharon threatens polls
																								Jerusalem, April 30 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, stung by opinion poll predictions his Likud party would reject his proposed Gaza pullout, said today voting the plan down could force new elections.																								Its hard for me to think about the problems Israel would have to face if the disengagement plan fails, Sharon told Israels Channel 10. I think it will cause the country to deteriorate to (new) elections.																								Sharon stopped short of threatening to resign, a move that would bring down his government, but told Channel 2 television: I dont know how possible it will be to run the countrys affairs if the disengagement plan doesnt pass.																								The plan calls for evacuating all Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip and some from the West Bank. However, Israel would retain the larger West Bank settlement blocs, a move Palestinians regard as a land grab. Sharon has argued that voting down the pullout would hurt Israels vital US ties. In backing the plan, President George W. Bush drew Arab outrage by saying Israel could not be expected to give up all occupied land in a final peace deal.																								However, a Sharon aide said rejection in Sundays ballot would not necessarily kill the US-endorsed proposal to carry out Israels first evacuation of Jewish settlements since it returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt in 1982.. He (Sharon) will accept the results of the referendum, but also try to use the means at his disposal to move the plan forward, aide Lior Horev told army radio.																								Some 7,500 Israelis live in the hard-to-defend settlements in Gaza, home to 1.3 million Palestinians. There are more than 200,000 settlers in the West Bank, which has a Palestinian population of two million.																								Many in the traditionally pro-settler Likud have branded a Gaza withdrawal a Palestinian reward for terror. Settlers have been lobbying Likud members intensively to vote no.																								Leaders need public confidence in critical times and I need your trust in me and in the disengagement plan I formulated with all of Israels security authorities, Sharon wrote in a personal appeal to Likud voters in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily. A poll in the paper showed 47 per cent of Likud against a pullout and 40.5 per cent in favour, results almost identical to those in its previous survey on Wednesday.																								Gambling on Likud support against a chorus of Far-Right critics, Sharon originally described the party vote as binding. He now says it will have only moral standing.																								Sharon has already signalled he would present the plan to his Cabinet and Parliament  where his chances of success are higher  even if the party vote does not go his way.																								In his newspaper appeal, Sharon warned Likud that rejection of his initiative, which also includes the uprooting of four of Israels 120 West Bank settlements, would strengthen the partys opponents and weaken its grip on power.																								At the same time, Sharon  who stunned friend and foe alike by backtracking on his decades-old call to settle Israelis on all land captured in war with the Arabs  reaffirmed a pledge to keep large West Bank settlement blocs forever.

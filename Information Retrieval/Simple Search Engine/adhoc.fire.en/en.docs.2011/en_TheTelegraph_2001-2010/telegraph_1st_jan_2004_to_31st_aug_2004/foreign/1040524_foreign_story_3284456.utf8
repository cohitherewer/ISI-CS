The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, May 24, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Mad for 49 years																																	 Aachen, May 23: For the first time in his life Willi Kapes says that he knows what happiness is, but he is still beset by nightmares every time he goes to sleep.																																	At the age of 49, Willi is finally getting to know a family he never knew he had, after a cousin rescued him from a German psychiatric hospital. 																																	Before he was traced, Willi had spent his entire life locked away  often in isolation  after a series of medical experts failed to diagnose that there was nothing wrong with him.																																	Willis ordeal in 1955 began when he was a few weeks old. He was forcibly removed from the care of his mother, who was deemed morally corrupt because she had three illegitimate children, and sent to the first of the institutions in which he would be condemned to spend nearly 50 years.																																	He never celebrated Christmas or had a birthday party. He did not know how to switch on a television or use a telephone. 																																	He had never been hugged until his cousin, Hermine Schneider, tracked him down at last 11 months ago, and flung her arms around him.She has now launched a civil claim for damages on Willis behalf. What they have done to me can never be undone, Willi says. It has destroyed my life.																						Souvenir run																						 Madrid (Reuters): Thousands of Spaniards flocked today to the cathedral where heir to the throne Prince Felipe wed the day before, with some slicing up the red carpet leading into the church with scissors to take souvenirs.																																	Television pictures showed thousands lining up to visit the Almudena Cathedral, still decked out in flowers for the heirs wedding to former television journalist Letizia Ortiz  the first royal wedding in almost a century.																																	Tens of thousands of well-wishers took to the streets of Madrid yesterday for a glimpse of the couple, undeterred by pouring rain and thunder which rattled through the cathedral as the couple said I do.																						Royalty from around the world tread the red carpet at the ceremony.

																								Cairo, Jan. 7 (Reuters): When Iran and Egypt restore relations  a seemingly imminent event  two political poles of West Asia will meet again, closing a circle broken for decades by disputes over Israel and US foreign policy.																								One element in the reconciliation is the shared perception that the Muslim world is on the defensive and must come together, analysts said yesterday.																								It was really high time that they restored diplomatic relations. Everyone was wondering why they dont, especially when the Islamic world is passing through such a crisis, said Hussein Amin, a former Egyptian ambassador and academic.																								We (Arabs and Muslims) dont have any cause to stay apart or nurse our grievances against each other, because we are all suffering together, he added. The two countries are West Asia giants, heirs to ancient civilisations which have clashed as often as they cooperate.																								The last quarter of a century has been a time of particular hostility, Egypt following the lead of the US while Iran stood as a bastion of resistance to American policy. 																								Tehran broke relations with Cairo after the Islamic revolution in 1979, in response to Egypts peace treaty with Israel and the decision of the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to let the deposed Shah live out his days in Egypt. Iran celebrated when Islamists assassinated Sadat at a military parade in 1981 and named a Tehran street after the army officer who led the operation, Khaled Islambouli.																								Egyptian analysts said such acrimony was now ancient history and common interests were pushing the two countries together in a way that would have been unthinkable as late as the mid-1990s.																								Egypt has begun to distance itself from US policy under the conservative Bush administration just as Iran is looking for friends in the region to counter the threatening rhetoric from Washington, which describes Iran as part of an axis of evil.																								It is defensive solidarity on the part of both countries, said Mohamed al-Sayid Said, deputy director of the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. There is an entirely new environment in which differences over the legitimacy of Camp David no longer have any significance, he added.																								Camp David, the US presidential retreat where Israel and Egypt decided to make peace in 1978, is shorthand in West Asia for Sadats unilateral and divisive approach to Israel.																								It took Sadats successor, current President Hosni Mubarak, much of the 1980s to overcome a legacy of isolation and win back his countrys traditional role as an Arab political leader.

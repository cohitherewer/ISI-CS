 MASSOUD ANSARI 				 	 Daniel Pearl: Looked death in the face Karachi, May 9: Horrifying new details of how Daniel Pearl, the murdered Wall Street Journal reporter, met his death have emerged from the interrogation of new suspects by Pakistani police.																								Pearl, who was kidnapped in Karachi in January 2002, knew for several hours that he was about to be killed, but resisted repeated attempts to sedate him, police now believe. 																								He was fully aware of what was happening when the Arab extremists who took control during his final days cut his throat, according to information gleaned from Pakistani militants now in police custody. Shocking video film of Pearls murder, seen around the world via the internet, was in fact a partial reconstruction of what had happened a few moments earlier. 																								The camera operator made a mistake and missed the moment of his death, which his murderers then re-enacted, before decapitating the reporter.																								Ahmed Omar Sheikh, the mastermind of the kidnapping, set the trap which lured Pearl to his captors. He put the reporter in touch with a man who, he pretended, would introduce him to an extremist leader whom Pearl wished to interview. 																								Contrary to evidence given during Sheikhs trial, police now believe he may not have been present when Pearl met Sajid Jabbar, the go-between, at a Karachi restaurant. It was after the meeting that Pearl disappeared.																								Police have pieced together new details of how Pearl was held in captivity for two weeks, and eventually killed, from those involved  including two who witnessed his final hours. 																								They now believe Pearl was not forcibly abducted from the restaurant, but went willingly with Sajid in his car, while four other militants followed. 																								On the day Pearl died, two of his Pakistani guards were present: Ali Khan, arrested just two weeks ago, and Fazal Karim, an employee of Saud Memon, al Qaidas chief financier in Pakistan. One recently told interrogators how the captors tried to sedate Pearl, first by injection, then by doctoring his tea. I think he understood he was going to be killed and refused to accept tea or to gulp pills. He even did not allow himself to be injected.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

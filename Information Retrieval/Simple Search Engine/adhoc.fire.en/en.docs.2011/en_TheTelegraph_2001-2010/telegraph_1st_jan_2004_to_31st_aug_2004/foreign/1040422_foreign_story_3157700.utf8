 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Bush, Cheney to appear before 9/11 panel
				 	 Dick Cheney (left) and George W. Bush																								Washington, April 21 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney will answer questions together and in private before the commission investigating the September 11, 2001, attacks on April 29, the White House said today.																								They will meet at the White House with the five Republican and five Democratic members of the commission. Their appearance had been planned but a specific date had not been announced.																								The President looks forward to meeting with the commission and answering any questions, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. The two will not testify under oath.																								The commission has been hearing testimony, both in public and private, from various top administration officials to determine whether the September 11 hijacked airliner attacks could have been avoided.																								It is unusual for such investigations to hear from two officials at one time, which could eliminate the possibility of contradictory testimony and allow the two to defer to each other in the questioning. But the panel chairman, former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean, a Republican, said the commission accepted the unusual arrangement to hear from the President, noting that sitting Presidents rarely appear before investigative panels or congressional committees.																								Bush, who initially opposed creation of the independent commission, had earlier insisted he meet with just the chairman and vice-chairman and for only one hour. Under pressure from the panel, however, he agreed to meet all 10 members and answer questions for as long as necessary. The commissions pressure also forced the White House to allow Bushs national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, to give public, sworn testimony to the panel two weeks ago, after former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke accused Bush of having failed to consider terrorism an urgent priority when he took office.																								Bush was given an August 6, 2001, intelligence document that said the FBI had detected patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.																								He said in reaction to the public release of the memo earlier this month that it was not a warning the September 11 attacks were about to take place, and it did not point to a specific target. More British raids																								British anti-terror police raided four more addresses in northern England today as part of an operation which saw 10 terror suspects arrested in swoops today.																								Police said they had carried out searches under the Terrorism Act 2000 at homes in Tameside, near Manchester.																								It is part of the ongoing operation which led to 10 people being arrested on Monday, said assistant chief constable Dave Whatton, of Greater Manchester Police. Searches are continuing at a number of addresses as part of this operation, he added in a statement.																								Last night, police obtained warrants to allow them more time to quiz the 10 held on Monday in a series of dawn raids involving 400 police across northern England. Newspapers said those raids had foiled a series of suicide bomb attacks at Manchester Uniteds Old Trafford soccer stadium although police and the home office (interior ministry) declined to comment on the reports.																								London police chief Sir John Stevens has repeatedly said an attack in Britain, most likely a suicide bombing, is inevitable. Earlier this month, five British men and a teenaged boy were charged with terror offences after police seized half-a-ton of fertiliser, often used in bomb-making, in major anti-terror raids across southern England.Air security hurdle																								The US air security strategy hit a legal hurdle today as the European Parliament asked a court to judge whether a plan to pass on passengers data to Washington breached EU privacy law.																								The European Parliament voted by a narrow majority to seek the opinion of the European Court of Justice on the accord, under which US agencies can collect personal data such as credit card and phone numbers to spot potential terrorists. What we are seeking is the advice of the Court of Justice on whether this is compatible with our own laws, said Liberal Democrat leader Graham Watson.

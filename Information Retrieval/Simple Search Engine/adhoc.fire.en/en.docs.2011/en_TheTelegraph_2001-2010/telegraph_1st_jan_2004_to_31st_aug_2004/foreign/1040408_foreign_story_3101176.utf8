 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Lanka deal-making on
																								Colombo, April 7 (Reuters): Sri Lankas cabinet could be sworn in tomorrow with President Chandrika Kumaratunga likely to keep top posts for herself, and with deal-making still under way after Fridays vote left her party shy of a majority.																								Kumaratunga, who as executive President was not up for re-election, sacked the defence minister last November and has held the post since. Sources said she was likely to keep it and take over as finance minister too.																								They are sorting out the ministry allocations now. What is important is to get the right secretaries, said one presidential aide.																								New Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse said Kumaratunga would also take charge of the peace process to end a 20-year civil war with Tamil Tiger rebels, but the faces in the new cabinet could also give hints on a future negotiating team.																								A two-year ceasefire remains in place, but direct talks with the rebels broke down last April and restarting them will be the new governments foremost challenge  a task complicated by the election of an ethnically polarised parliament.																								Former foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar  a Tamil who is a hardline foe of the Tigers  was expected to take up his old post after being narrowly edged out of the Prime Ministers job, and was likely to be involved in strategy for the peace process.

 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Pak launches operation to hunt al Qaida fugitives
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Jan. 8: Pakistan army and paramilitary troops today hunted for al Qaida and Taliban fugitives in the South Waziristan area bordering Afghanistan.																								The operation was launched, west of Wana, headquarters of South Waziristan tribal agency, early today as they (terrorists) refused to surrender, Pakistan army spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told Pakistans Geo TV.																								About 20 helicopters were being used in the operation, he said, adding that it will continue till we accomplish the mission.																								The Pakistan army had launched a crackdown in South Waziristan in October last year. Eight suspects were killed and 18 injured in a shootout in Angor Adda during the bloodiest operation since the fall of the Taliban government in December 2001. Since then over three dozens houses have been razed to the ground and a large number of vehicles confiscated during the operation.																								Eyewitnesses in Wana said that a house belonging to two tribesmen, Naik and Sharif, was demolished as they were suspected to be sheltering al Qaida operatives.																								Intermittent explosions were heard and helicopters were seen patrolling the area. Paramilitary troops have been posted on a number of mountain peaks to beef up the security in Wana.																								The army and paramilitary troops have also surrounded Kaloo Shah, 20 km west of Wana, and sealed all access routes to the hamlet as they search for foreigners they believe are hiding there, sources said.																								The search operation kicked off in the backdrop of allegations by Afghan authorities that remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaida were regrouping in the border region and planning operations against Afghan government targets.																								The claim was in direct contrast to Pakistans assurance that it had not allowed the Taliban to re-group in the border region and the intense operation against the terrorists had broken the back of the fugitives.																								The border region comprises of seven semi-autonomous tribal regions  each called an agency  where the central governments authority is limited and can intervene only through a special set of laws.																								Pakistan has arrested and handed over more than 500 Taliban and al Qaida fighters to Washington since the US-led war on terror began in Afghanistan in 2001.																								A bus fell in an irrigation canal in central Pakistan today, killing at least 28 people, police said.																								They said the death toll could rise as the bus, which plunged in the canal near the remote Bhakkar town in Pakistans Punjab province, was believed to be carrying more than 40 people.

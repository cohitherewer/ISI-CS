 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Aziz files nomination papers
																								Attock (Pakistan), July 6 (Reuters): Pakistans Prime Minister-in-waiting Shaukat Aziz today began his quest for the democratic credentials needed to qualify for a job most say has been bestowed on him by President Pervez Musharraf.																								Aziz travelled to Attock, a town west of Islamabad on the bank of the Indus river, where he filed nomination papers to contest a byelection for a parliamentary seat he must win before he can become Prime Minister.																								We are starting a new era, with fair, free and transparent governance, Aziz, dressed in salwar kameez and a black waistcoat, said after filing his papers in a court house.																								The political game of musical chairs, which involves a pro-Musharraf interim leader being installed temporarily, has been widely criticised as another blow to democracy in a country where the military is in charge of crucial policy decisions.																								The perception of the common man is that he is the agent of America, Abdullah, a man in his thirties who sells cricket bats and soccer balls in Attock, said of Aziz. I think he is imposed on us. We are never free. The silver-haired finance minister represents the kind of moderate professionalism Musharraf wants to promote in a country racked by Islamic militancy.

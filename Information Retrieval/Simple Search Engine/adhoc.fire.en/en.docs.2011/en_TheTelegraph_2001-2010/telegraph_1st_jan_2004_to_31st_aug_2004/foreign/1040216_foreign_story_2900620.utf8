 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 New JFKs scandal pot boils again
 ADRIAN BLOMFELD AND ANDREW ALDERSON				 	 John F. Kerry																								Nairobi, Feb. 15: Alex Polier, the 24-year-old journalist who could end Senator John Kerrys hopes of becoming the next President of the US, is alleged to have had a two-year affair with the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.																								On Saturday night, the rumours were in danger of becoming a full-blown scandal. This is not going to go away, an American friend of Polier said. What actually happened is much nastier than is being reported.																								The allegations come at a crucial time for the Senator. Polls showed him leading Bush by 52 per cent to 42 per cent, and aides will be anxious to see if the apparent scandal affects his standing among voters.																								Polier, a former intern who also spent some time in 1998 doing work experience at the Houses of Parliament in London, is in Kenya staying with Yaron Schwartzman, her fiance and a member of the countrys fashionable young set. The couple have refused to make any comment on her alleged links with Senator Kerry, who is married to Teresa Heinz Kerry, an heiress to the food empire.																								Senator Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran dubbed the new JFK, has vehemently denied any relationship with Polier, and shrugged off allegations that he had a two-year affair with her from 2001. I just deny it categorically. Its a rumour. Its untrue. Period, he said. 																								Kerry, 60, has won 12 out of the 14 Democratic primaries and has looked all but certain to seal the nomination to take on President George W. Bush in Novembers elections. His aides have blamed a dirty tricks campaign for bringing the allegations about Polier into the public eye; they first surfaced last week on a Right-wing internet site, the Drudge Report, which famously broke the news of Bill Clintons affair with Monica Lewinsky. 																								Poliers parents, Terry and Donna, from Malvern, Pennsylvania, added fuel to the fire by claiming that Kerry did pursue their daughter. I think hes a sleazeball. I did wonder if she didnt get that feeling herself, said Polier. Hes not the sort of guy Id choose to be with my daughter. John Kerry called my daughter and invited her to be on his re-election committee. She talked to him and decided against it.																								The Drudge website also quoted retired Gen Wesley Clark, one of Kerrys rivals for the nomination, as having told journalists off the record: Kerry will implode over an intern issue. Clark later dropped out of the race and endorsed Kerry.																								Polier, a journalist who once worked for Associated Press, is a graduate of Columbia University, New York. She apparently met the Senator as she was beginning her media career. Polier and her fiance were believed to be hiding yesterday at the Nairobi home of Schwartzmans parents, who moved to Kenya from Israel.																								She appears to have few friends of her own in Kenya: she has never lived in the country and makes only occasional visits.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

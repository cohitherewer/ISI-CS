 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Nepal parties silent on PM 
 PRANAY SHARMAKathmandu, May 9: The five-party alliance today demanded that King Gyanendra return most of the executive and legislative powers he had taken away and pave the way for an all-party government. But it did not announce its Prime Ministerial candidate .																								The alliance, largely responsible for bringing an end to the Surya Bahadur Thapa government, set the framework under which possible talks between its leaders and the king can be held. To indicate that it was still united, the alliance announced that leaders of all five parties would meet the king if and when there was an invitation from the palace for talks. 																								The parties perhaps want more time before they agree on a common candidate for the Prime Ministers post and they are waiting for the kings reaction.																								After a meeting between key alliance leaders this evening, they agreed that the king should create conditions similar to 1990 when an interim government headed by K.P. Bhattarai was formed with participation by all major parties.																								The alliance said the king can use Article 128 (b) of the constitution to give back most of the executive and legislative powers he had taken away under Article 127, which allows him to intervene to remove any obstacle that the country faces. 																								King Gyanendra has used this provision to the hilt to strengthen his position.																								The alliance demanded today that the king accept constitutional monarchy and give up mediating in the running of the country, which should be left to elected representatives.																								The king had hinted after Thapa stepped down that he wanted someone with a clean image to be the next Prime Minister. This has raised concerns among the democratic forces who feel the king wants to hand pick a candidate so that he can continue to exercise control over the running of the country.																								It is not yet clear if the alliance will arrive at a consensus on its nominee for the Prime Ministers post. The name of Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) leader Madhav Nepal was being taken in this regard a few months ago. The alliance has not withdrawn his name officially but there are indications that Nepali Congress chief G.P. Koirala is also keen on the post.																								The alliance wants the king to accept whomever it names as its nominee. If this happens, it will be its first victory against the palace. 																								If the king refuses to accept the parties proposal and comes up with a name of his choice  that of parliament speaker Tarachand Bhat for example  then Nepal may face another round of political unrest and instability. 																								It remains to be seen if the alliance can set aside its differences and fight unitedly for the restoration of democracy.

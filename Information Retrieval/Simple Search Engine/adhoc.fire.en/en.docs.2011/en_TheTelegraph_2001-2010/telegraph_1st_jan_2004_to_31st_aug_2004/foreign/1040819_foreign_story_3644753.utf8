The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 PM-designate Aziz on course in bypoll 
				 	 Tribal women hold their identity cards outside a polling station in Mithi, 320 km from Karachi. (Reuters)																								Sanjawal (Pakistan), Aug. 18 (Reuters): Pakistan finance minister Shaukat Aziz appeared to have taken an early lead in a byelection today, clearing his way to head the government weeks after surviving an assassination bid blamed on Islamic militants.																								After polls closed, early unofficial results from more than a dozen polling stations in one of the two constituencies contested by the former Citibank employee showed him ahead by a big margin.																								Private television channel Geo said Aziz was ahead by more than 3,000 votes from 15 of the 253 polling stations in the Attock district of central Punjab province, where he narrowly survived a suicide bombing on July 30.																								Aziz, 55, designated to be Prime Minister by President Pervez Musharraf in June after the abrupt resignation of the incumbent, also stood in another byelection in Tharparkar, an impoverished part of the southern province of Sindh.																								Aziz needs to win a seat to lead the government, something political analysts say should be a formality. Election commission officials said the official results from both constituencies would be announced later in the week.																								Aziz, who has steered a sharp turnaround in Pakistans financial fortunes since taking charge after Musharrafs 1999 military coup when the country was virtually bankrupt, waged a low-key campaign after the assassination bid.																								In Sanjawal, a village in Attock on Punjabs western fringe, many men and women voiced support for Aziz, although local guidance appeared to be a deciding factor. Our village elder Chaudhry is a supporter of Aziz, so whatever he says, we follow him, said Nisar Ahmed.

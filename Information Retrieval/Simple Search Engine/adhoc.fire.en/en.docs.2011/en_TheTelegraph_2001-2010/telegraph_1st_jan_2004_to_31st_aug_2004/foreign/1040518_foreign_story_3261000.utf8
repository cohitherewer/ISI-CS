The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Panicky Palestinians flee homes
Rafah (Gaza Strip), May 17 (Reuters): Panicked Palestinians fled their homes today as Israeli forces surrounded a Gaza refugee camp to carry out a threatened mass demolition despite an international outcry.																								Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie pleaded for US intervention in rare talks with a top White House policymaker but received little more than expressions of concern.																								Shaken by ambushes that killed 13 Israeli soldiers in Gaza, the West Asias strongest army said it planned first to hit militants and then raze hundreds of houses it says serve as gun nests and possibly dig a moat to block arms-smuggling tunnels.																								The plan has drawn UN and EU condemnation as it could uproot thousands of Palestinians. 																								The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) says 12,600 Rafah Palestinians have been made homeless by the destruction of homes by Israeli forces since an uprising began in 2000.																								Angry Palestinian leaders charged that the demolition drive contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharons plan to withdraw from the occupied Gaza Strip.																								With scores of Israeli tanks and combat troop carriers ringing the teeming camp in southern Gaza, hundreds of residents piled bedding, furniture, clothes, floor tiles and other items on donkey carts and rickety old trucks and moved out.

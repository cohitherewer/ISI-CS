 RICHARD SAVILL				 	 Madonna London, May 3: Madonna and her film director husband Guy Ritchie begin a fight this week in a nimby protest  not in my backyard  against public rights of access to their estate in Wiltshire.																								They will object at a public inquiry to the opening up of part of their 1,132-acre Ashcombe estate, near the village of Tollard Royal, under the new right to roam legislation. 																								The couple say free access for walkers would violate private and family life and their home under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Countryside Agency, the government body implementing the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, has begun mapping areas of open country, giving access to about 8 per cent of England, classed as mountain, moorland, heath and downland.																								Land in the first two mapping areas, the south-east and the lower north-west, will be opened in September. The singer and her husband, described as Mr and Mrs Ritchie in documentation, are appealing to the planning inspectorate against the inclusion of 17 parcels of their land on the maps.																								Their estate  which they bought for 9 million two years ago  is run as a commercial sporting business. Madonna, who has two children Lourdes and Rocco, divides her time between the Grade II-listed Georgian Ashcombe House, the former home of society photographer Cecil Beaton, and houses in Beverly Hills and London.																								The singer  she had a hit with the single This Used To Be My Playground and starred in a film Body of Evidence in the nineties  is not expected to attend the hearing. Her spokesperson said: She will not be making any comment.																								Madonnas time at the estate has not been without problems. She has complained about low-flying aircraft, suffered an attempted burglary and was ordered to take down 12ft-high security gates after neglecting to apply for planning permission.																								She was later granted retrospective permission.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

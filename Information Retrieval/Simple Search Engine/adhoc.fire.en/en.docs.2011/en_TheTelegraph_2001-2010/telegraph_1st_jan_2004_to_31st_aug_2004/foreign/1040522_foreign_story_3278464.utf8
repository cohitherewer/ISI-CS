 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 US pounds Shia militia targets in Karbala
																								Baghdad, May 21 (Reuters): Fresh images including graphic video of American soldiers beating and humiliating Iraqis rocked the US mission in Iraq again today, days before President George W. Bush lays out his plan to hand back power to Iraqis.																								US aircraft with devastating firepower pounded Shia militia in the holy city of Karbala, killing an unknown number, in a bid to crush insurgents whose demands for Americans to go are gaining support among Iraqis frustrated with the occupation.																								Marking a growing rift between Washington and its closest Iraqi allies, the Iraq governing council roundly condemned the US authority that appointed them for a raid by US troops and Iraqi police on the offices of council member Ahmad Chalabi.																								Bush, who is campaigning for re-election in November, will spell out in a speech on Monday a clear strategy for the process under which Washington will hand over power, with some limitations, to what it hopes will be a pro-American Iraqi government on June 30. Elections are due in the new year.																								The US army said it was investigating accounts that an air strike on a desert hamlet on Wednesday killed not 40 or so foreign guerrillas, as US officers say, but a wedding party.																								Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, a military spokesman, said four to six women may have died in the incident.																								The top UN human rights official, Bertand Ramcharan, condemned the attack, however, whatever the reasons for it:																								The acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed shock over the deaths of some 40 civilians at a wedding party in Iraq near the Syrian border, his office said in a statement. 																								Even if there are security-related concerns, there can be no licence to commit carnage.																								Despite pressure on his Mehdi Army fighters in Karbala that included the use of a devastating AC-130 airborne gunship, militant Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr slipped from his refuge among the shrines of nearby Najaf to deliver a defiant sermon. 																								Dont let my death end your resistance. Continue and God will give you victory, Sadr told worshippers at Kufa mosque, as his fighters skirmished with American soldiers nearby.																								Among those killed during hours of heavy fighting in Karbala was an Iraqi working for Arab television channel al Jazeera.

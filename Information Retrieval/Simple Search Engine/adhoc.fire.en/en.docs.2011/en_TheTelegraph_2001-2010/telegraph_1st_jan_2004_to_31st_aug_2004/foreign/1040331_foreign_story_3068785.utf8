 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Mystery of museums missing teeth
																								Mettman (Germany), March 30 (AFP): The Neanderthal Museum in this western German town made an urgent appeal today to the thief who took a priceless pair of caveman teeth from one of its prized exhibitions.																								 The museum said in a statement that the robbery of a milk tooth and a molar belonging to an early man, discovered yesterday, was highly mysterious and pleaded for the robber to return them. The museum said it also had no explanation why only two from a total of 32 bone and tooth fragments from the hominid, unearthed in 2000, were taken.																								 Museum workers had noticed days ago that one of the teeth was missing but assumed they had been taken for cleaning.																								 It was only yesterday when the second tooth vanished that employees alerted police. The museum said it believed the crime was planned in advance and that the culprits had detailed information about the layout of the exhibition.

 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Captors run into Saddam stonewall
																								London, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is refusing to cooperate with his American captors, who are taking a gentle approach to prise intelligence from him, Washingtons chief ally Britain said today.																								But documents found with him after his mid-December capture in a hole near his home town of Tikrit have provided better than expected information, a senior British official also said.																								The results of the capture of Saddam were greater than we were ever expecting, the official, who requested anonymity, said at a briefing for reporters.																								He has not talked himself, but the papers found with him led to further information that led to further operations.																								Saddams capture in mid-December was a massive boost for the US-led occupiers of Iraq but has not ended guerrilla activity.																								US interrogators were taking their time, trying to get him to feel comfortable that he can talk in captivity, the official said. But so far, he is not offering information of a useful operational kind, he added.																								Washington and London blame former Saddam loyalists and foreign terrorists for ongoing violence in Iraq. 																								The British official conceded security problems will continue for as long as US and British troops remain in the country they invaded in March.																								However, with Saddam gone and intelligence-gathering improving, guerrilla cells were finding it harder to communicate and coordinate large pre-planned attacks, he said.																								But individual cells continued to pose a serious threat.																								The British official warned of trained jihadists who see Iraq as a theatre in which to fight against the West, and who have more sophisticated means than the local groups.																								We are going to take punishment now and again but we are just going to keep going, the British official said.																								Tackling the situation was do-able and British troops would continue to make their best possible efforts to counter insurgent violence.																								The occupation of Iraq is scheduled to end on June 30, when Washington and London want a transitional Iraqi authority to take over guiding the country towards full elections in 2005. Japan order																								Japanese defence minister Shigeru Ishiba today ordered an advance team of ground troops to be sent to Iraq, launching what could be Japans biggest and riskiest overseas military mission since World War Two.																								The team, which Japanese media said would include about 30 members of Japans Ground Self-Defence Force (GSDF), is expected to leave for Samawa in southern Iraq via Kuwait around January 16, although no date has been announced.

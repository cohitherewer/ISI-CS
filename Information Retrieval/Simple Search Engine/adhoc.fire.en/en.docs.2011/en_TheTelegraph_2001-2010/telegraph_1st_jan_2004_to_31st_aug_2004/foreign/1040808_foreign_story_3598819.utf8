The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Beheaded American speaks up
				 	 Benjamin Vanderford after the beheading in his hoax video. (Reuters)San Francisco, Aug. 7 (Reuters): A tech-savvy young San Francisco man who staged his own mock beheading on the Internet duped international media today into believing Islamist kidnappers had executed an American hostage in Iraq.																								The video, which appeared on a website used by Islamic militants, showed a man who identified himself as Benjamin Vanderford appealing to the US to leave Iraq. The Web format was that used by al Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and was introduced by a headline that said it showed Zarqawi killing an American.																								If we dont (leave Iraq), everyone is gonna be killed in this way ... I have been offered for exchange for prisoners here in Iraq, the terrified-looking man said, rocking back and forth in his chair, his hands tied behind his back. The video showed a hand with a large knife apparently slicing through the neck of a limp body.But it was all a hoax.																								The blood was dye, the setting was a friends garage, the Quran reading was a tape and the knife was held by a friend. Mutilated bodies and sound effects were edited in from photos on websites and the video was purposefully blurred to make it seem even more amateur, Vanderford said.																								A major motivation for his action, an unrepentant Vanderford said, was to see how the world media would react and to see if they would be fooled. It really illustrates the potential that this kind of thing would happen, he said. Vanderford, 22, said he worked at branch of Wells Fargo bank. A college drop-out, he was a candidate for the local city council earlier this year but had since dropped out of the race. His website also says he is a video game programmer.

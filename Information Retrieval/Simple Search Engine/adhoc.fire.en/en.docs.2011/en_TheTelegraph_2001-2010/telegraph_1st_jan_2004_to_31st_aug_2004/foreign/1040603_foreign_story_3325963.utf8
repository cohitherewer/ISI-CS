 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Loos TV career lurches to swift end
				 	 Rebecca Loos																								Amsterdam, June 2 (Reuters): The woman who said she had an affair with football star David Beckham has seen her career as a showbiz presenter on Dutch television come to a swift end after just two weeks.																								Dutch private broadcaster SBS 6 hired Beckhams former personal assistant Rebecca Loos as a presenter last month when she was at the centre of a tabloid frenzy after claiming she had a fling with the England football captain. Beckham has publicly dismissed as ludicrous reports he had sex with and sent raunchy text messages to Loos.																								We thought that she just wasnt made to be a presenter. She didnt have the necessary skills, the stations spokesman said today.																								Loos publicist said she only ever signed a two-week contract to serve as a presenter, which has been fulfilled entirely to SBS satisfaction.																								The SBS spokesman dismissed media reports that the decision on the 26-year-old Dutch diplomats daughter was linked to her heavy English accent. He added that SBS and Loos were discussing other possible on-air positions at the stations.																								The broadcaster denied Loos contract had been a ploy to land the only Dutch television interview with her last month. Loos was reported to have been paid a six-figure sum for her story by British media outlets.

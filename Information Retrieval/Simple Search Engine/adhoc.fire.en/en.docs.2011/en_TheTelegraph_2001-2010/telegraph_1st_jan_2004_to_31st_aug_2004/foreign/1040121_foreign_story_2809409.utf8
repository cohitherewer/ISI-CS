 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Shias hit streets for Saddam trial, polls
																								Baghdad, Jan. 20 (Reuters): Thousands of Shias hit the streets in four Iraqi cities today, calling on the US to hand over Saddam Hussein to be tried as a war criminal and demanding a bigger say in their political future.																								The fresh rallies followed a march through Baghdad yesterday by tens of thousands of Shias demanding direct elections to decide who controls Iraq when the US hands back power in June. Many of todays protesters were supporters of Moqtada al-Sadr, a firebrand religious leader who has expressed support for Iraqs most revered Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.																								Sistani and his followers, long persecuted by Saddam, have proven a thorn for the US by opposing its plans to let regional caucuses appoint a transitional authority to take power at the end of June, instead of letting all Iraqis vote.																								Ordinary Iraqis today said they welcomed the prospect of the UN playing a role, but many insisted the process must include early elections. In Basra, several thousand protesters demanded Saddam be executed. We want Saddam dead or alive. We demand Saddams execution, they chanted. Annan decision soon																								In New York, diplomats said UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was expected to decide within a week whether to send a political team to Iraq to tackle the Shia demands.																								But a UN official said Annan needed to wait until a four-member security team, about to go to Iraq, assessed the situation before announcing his decision.

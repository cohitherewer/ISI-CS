 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Wana troops push
																								Wana, April 15 (Reuters): The Pakistani army sent more troops to prepare for a fresh push against hundreds of al Qaida militants on the Afghan border as tribesmen made last ditch efforts today to avoid more bloodshed.																								More than 100 people were killed in fighting between Pakistani troops and al Qaida militants and their Pakistani tribal allies near Wana last month. Residents said many fresh troops had been moving into the dusty town in recent days. Troops equipped with heavy weapons have been coming into Wana for the past three days, one resident said. We have never seen such a big deployment of troops in our area. Tribal elders sought to persuade fellow tribesmen to give up any foreign militants they might be sheltering in the region.

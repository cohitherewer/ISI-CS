 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Falluja still fumes: They got what they deserved
				 	 A US soldier in Mosul. (AFP)																								Falluja, April 1 (Reuters): The burned and mutilated bodies of four Americans paraded on the streets have gone but they are still stirring up angry residents of this bitter town who say more bloody killings should be expected.																								The Americans may think it is unusual but this is what they should expect. They show up in places and shoot civilians so why cant they be killed? Falluja shop worker Amir said today.																								A day after the bodies of four mutilated Americans were burned and dragged through Fallujas main street in broad daylight, there is one sentiment gripping Falluja  they got what they deserved. 																								The gruesome scenes shocked the outside world.																								But locals said the violence, in which the US contractors were left at the mercy of a crowd after a guerrilla attack, was perfectly normal in an occupation.																								It is understandable. We are glad this happened, said Amir, his friends nodding in agreement. 																								Guerrillas opened fire on two vehicles carrying the contractors down Fallujas main street, leaving few escape routes as residents emerged from car repair shops, kebab restaurants and small grocery stores to watch and participate. Iraqis insist the men were either CIA agents or American soldiers in civilian clothing, dismissing reports they were security contractors for the US-led occupying power.																								Locals recalled how a crowd descended on the Americans after the bullets were fired by guerrillas, who they praised as well-organised heroes.																								One bystander pulled one of the Americans out of the car still alive. The crowd slammed his head into the street, said Amir, the auto shop worker.																								One of the Americans pointed a gun but he was killed by a guerrilla. As he spoke the crowd swelled, each person recalling details of the attack and the subsequent orgy of violence. One man focused on the AK-47s used while another said the guerrillas seized identification cards from the Americans.																								US troops and Iraqi police apparently thought it was too risky to enter Falluja, 50 km west of Baghdad, to try and impose order, suggesting the city is now a no-go zone. So Iraqis had free rein to burn the bodies, tie them to cars and drag them across the city before hanging them from a bridge spanning the Euphrates river.																								It was not clear if the men had business in Falluja or were forced to drive through it by a highway detour.																								US troops today vowed to use overwhelming force to enter Falluja and hunt down those who killed the contractors. Marines took up positions on the outskirts of the town. However, the US armys deputy director of operations Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt said they would return. Coalition forces will respond, Kimmitt said.																								Military officials insist the people who carry out such violence are a small minority loyal to toppled Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and bent on undermining progress in postwar Iraq. But the still seething anti-Americanism on the streets of a city once showered with privileges under Saddam suggests otherwise.																								Falluja has been a hotbed of anti-Americanism ever since the US-led war to overthrow Saddam. 																								While the city is almost always violent, incidents have increased in regularity and intensity in recent weeks.

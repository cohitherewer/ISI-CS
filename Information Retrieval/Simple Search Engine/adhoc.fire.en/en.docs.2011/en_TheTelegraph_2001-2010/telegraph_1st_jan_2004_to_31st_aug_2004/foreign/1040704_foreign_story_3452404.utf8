I am confident that the ARD will agree to fielding joint candidates, MMA secretary general and leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Maulana Fazal-ur Rehman said in Peshawar today.																								However, the ARD, which consists of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim league (Nawaz), will consider the MMA offer in a meeting in Islamabad on Monday.PML (N) secretary information Siddique-ul-Farooque said electoral cooperation with the MMA for the byelection was possible, adding that we would like all political forces in and outside parliament to field joint candidates in order to give a tough fight to the President Pervez Musharraf-backed candidate.Doctors in custody																								A Pakistan court today remanded to police custody two doctors accused of having links with al- Qaida and a local terror group involved in last months attack on a military convoy which killed 11 people, officials said.

They were produced before an anti-terrorism court and the court has remanded them in police custody until July 15 for interrogation, chief police investigator Fayyaz Leghari said.

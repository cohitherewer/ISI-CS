 K.P.NAYAR																								Big Sur (California), April 7: This remote American coastal town of 800 people is distressed by the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal. A part of it, at the very least, but a very vital part.																								At the Henry Miller Library here, this towns popular centre for the arts, Magnus Toren cannot believe what he has heard about the loss of the Tagore memorabilia.																								Toren is from Sweden. He now lives in this unconventional, largely anti-establishment town and is executive director of the library, the former home of Millers long-time friend Emil White, which White converted into a memorial for one of the most famous-and-infamous writers of the 20th century after Millers death in 1980.																								For Toren, the theft at Shantiniketan is a personal loss. 																								His paternal great grandmother, Ebba Malmborg, escorted Tagore when the poet was in Stockholm on December 10, 1913 to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature from Harald Hjarne, chairman of the committee which made the awards that year.																								Toren hastened to call his mother in Sweden when he heard the news. 																								The mother treasures newspaper clippings of the award and sepia-tinted souvenirs from the 1913 ceremony which have been handed down the family through successive generations since Malmborg died at her apartment near Stockholms landmark castle in 1963.Toren hopes the lost items would be recovered. At any rate, the theft has reinforced his resolve to claim his great grandmothers Tagore souvenirs as family heirlooms from his mother.____________________________________________________																								Big Sur is the sort of place where news such as the theft at Shantiniketan spreads quickly because India has been shining in Big Sur long before India Shining became a campaign theme in polls back home. A quarter mile from the Henry Miller Library, north on the Pacific Coastal Highway towards San Francisco, is the Hawthorne Gallery, another centre for artists on this edge of what could be Americas most picturesque location.____________________________________________________																								It would not be long before Toby Rowland-Jones and his wife Linda hear about the tragedy at Uttarayan. 																								Not because Big Sur is the sort of place where everyone knows everyone else, or because news travels faster in small communities. 																								Evan Rowland-Jones, Tobys father was an officer in the Sikh Regiment until Indias independence in 1947. 																								Now 90, he lives in Englands Cotswolds, but he undertook a difficult journey to India four years ago for a reunion of the regiment.The younger Rowland-Jones, who moved from England to Big Sur 25 years ago, says his father met his mother, the daughter of a British businessman in India, in Lahore and they married in undivided India in 1942.____________________________________________________																								Do not be taken by surprise if you are in one of Big Sur areas breathtaking beaches and you hear someone shouting out for India. 																								There is at least one girl in Big Sur who is called India. 																								An American heiress who has opted for a life away from the rat race and her husband, who live their lives in oriental spirituality on this coast have named their daughter India. Much like hundreds of Soviet citizens from the Urals to Vladivostok who named their daughters Indira in the 1970s.																								India is everywhere in Big Sur. Walk into Phoenix, a spectacular bookstore and shop located on the edge of the western hemisphere, looking down on the Pacific on one side and dwarfed by the Santa Lucia mountains on the other, and you are suddenly greeted by a 90 year-old sculpture of an Indian dancer, exquisitely hand-painted furniture from India, or solid brass Ganesha statues.																								A Dharmapala CD of mantras plays softly in the background. 																								Dharmapala Records is an independent music label created by David Gregoli, who studied sitar with Ustad Shujaat Khan and sarod under a western instructor. 																								Recently, Gregoli co-produced Mondo Rama, which means World is Rama, with Jai Uttal, who grew up in New York and studied music under Ali Akbar Khan.																								Mondo Rama was nominated for a Grammy in 2002 as the Best New Age Album. Uttals music is deeply influenced by the street music tradition of the bauls, the wandering minstrels of Bengal.

																								Stockholm, April 8 (AFP): A new Swedish invention for measuring respiratory passage inflammations makes it easier for asthmatics to take the right dose of medication and helps them prevent attacks, Swedish media reported today.																								The Swedish-patented machine, Niox, or the no-metre, allows asthma patients to measure how serious their respiratory passage inflammation is at any given time, and to adjust their dose of cortisone accordingly, Swedish daily Sagens Nyheter reported. The no-meter is easy to use and gives an indication of how much anti-inflammation medication with cortisone is needed, said Gunnar Byline, the head of lung and allergy research at the Karolinska hospital in Stockholm.

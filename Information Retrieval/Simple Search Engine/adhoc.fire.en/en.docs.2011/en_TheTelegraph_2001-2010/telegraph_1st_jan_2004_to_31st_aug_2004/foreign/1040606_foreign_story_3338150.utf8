 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Spymaster victim of Albania curse
Tirana, June 5 (Reuters): While heavyweight pundits ponder the real reasons behind CIA director George Tenets sudden resignation, a Tirana newspaper yesterday offered a typically whimsical explanation; he fell victim to an ancient Albanian curse.																								The Korrieri daily said the CIA chiefs resignation on Thursday fell a day before he had been due to visit Albania.																								If he had not planned a visit to Albania, probably he would have not been struck by the curse of the Pojan jinx, editor Alfred Peza said in his column, citing a supposed evil spirit that jinxed the villagers of Pojan back in the mists of time.																								Tenet was clearly felled by the jinx, wrote Peza, as was the late Soviet army Marshal Georgy Zhukov who was demoted after becoming involved with Albania. Tenets resignation, the paper said, had prevented him visiting the Albanian birthplace of his mother who, by his own account, escaped from southern Albania on a British submarine just as the Iron Curtain was closing after World War Two.

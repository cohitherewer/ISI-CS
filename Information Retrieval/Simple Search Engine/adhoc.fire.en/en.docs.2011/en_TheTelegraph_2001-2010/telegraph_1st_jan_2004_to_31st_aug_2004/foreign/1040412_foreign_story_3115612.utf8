 KAMRAN HAIDER Bomb scare: Sonu Nigam 																								Karachi, April 11: Pakistan authorities suspect Islamic militant outfit Harkatul Mujahideen al Alami to be behind yesterdays blast near the concert venue of singer Sonu Nigam in Karachi.																								Late last night, a powerful bomb in a stolen car went off at Karachis popular Marina Club when Nigam was giving his first-ever performance there, killing one person and injuring six.																								However, the show went ahead. Despite the blast, the musical concert that began at 21.45 IST went ahead in full swing and the participants were unaware of the bombing, local daily The News reported today.																								It (al-Alami) could be behind this blastand the attack could be a backlash of recent arrests which included the organisations key members, Fayyaz Laghari, the deputy inspector-general (investigation) told The Telegraph today.																								Laghari said his department made a sketch of one of the culprits who had snatched the car two hours before the incident from eastern Gulshan-e-Iqbal locality. Another official said the attack was meant to send a message from religious fanatics that they are still strong despite the governments crackdowns in Karachi. They are infuriated and are going for soft targets now, he said.																								After the blast, Pakistan police and troops stepped up security at key western installations and blocked roads to the US consulate. Security forces were also screening all vehicles for explosives. Yesterday, Pakistani soldiers had seized weapons, including a rocket launcher and mortar shells, allegedly belonging to a militant group planning a terrorist attack in the town. This is the first time ever that we have seized a 82 mm mortar gun in Karachi, said senior ranger officer Colonel Zafar Iqbal Awan.																								Karachi is not a stranger to violence. The city has been hit by sectarian, ethnic and religious violence. Now, the religious militants are unhappy over President Perfuse Musharrafs pro-US policies and have been attacking US and western targets in Karachi and elsewhere in Pakistan.																								For the last few months, several cultural troupes of India and Pakistan have exchanged visits as part of a thaw in the estranged ties between the two countries and observers believe incidents of terrorism will have a negative impact on such activities.																								However, Fakhr-e-Alam, the organiser of another upcoming concert featuring former Miss Universe Sushmita Sen, termed this a misperception. Our May 1 program is intact, said Alam, himself a famous vocalist and anchorperson.

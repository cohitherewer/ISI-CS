 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Under fire, CIA boss resigns Im sorry hes leaving: Bush
 George Tenet																								Washington, June 3 (Reuters): CIA director George Tenet, who presided over spectacular lapses in US national security, including the September 11, 2001, attacks on America, has resigned and will leave in July, President George W. Bush announced today.																								Tenet, who also faced fierce criticism over his agencys handling of Iraqi intelligence, including a now famous prediction that the case for war against Iraq was a slam dunk, broke the news to Bush at the White House last night. He told me he was resigning for personal reasons. I told him Im sorry hes leaving, Bush said.																								The announcement came as a surprise in Washington, shortly before Bush headed to Italy and France. He very quickly lauded Tenet for his seven-year tenure at the spy agency. Hes strong. Hes resolute, Bush said. He has been a strong and able leader at the agency. Hes been a strong leader in the war on terror.																								Tenets departure follows mounting criticism of the White House over its handling of intelligence reports on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and warnings of possible terror strikes in the months before the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.																								Saddam Husseins reported stockpiling of banned weapons was used as a main justification for the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq, where more than 800 US soldiers have died since March 2003.  A US soldier arranges grenades bought from Iraqi civilians in Najaf, 120 km south of Baghdad. Arms worth $30,000 have been bought from the civilians, including 200 rifles at $100 each, 50 mortar rockets at $200 a piece and nearly 100 rocket-propelled grenade launchers at $200 a piece. (AFP) 																								No chemical, biological or nuclear weapons have been found.																								Tenet drew notoriety recently when journalist Bob Woodward said the CIA chief had confidently assured Bush that US forces would find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Dont worry, its a slam dunk, the book, titled Plan of Attack, quoted Tenet as saying.																								The failure to find weapons and continuing insurgent violence in Iraq has helped push Bushs job approval ratings to new lows as he faces a tight re-election battle against Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.																								Tenet will continue as CIA director until mid-July, when his deputy John McLaughlin will become acting director, Bush said.																								Hes done a superb job on behalf of the American people, Bush said. And I will miss him.

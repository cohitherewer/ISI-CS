 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Harrison doctor to quit hospital
				 	 George Harrison																								New York, Jan. 9 (Reuters): The doctor accused of forcing Beatle George Harrison to autograph his guitar as he lay dying is leaving his top post at a New York hospital, a spokesman said today.																								The move to replace Dr Gilbert Lederman as head of the radiation oncology department at Staten Island University Hospital had been planned for two years and is not directly related to the controversy involving the late Harrison, a hospital spokeswoman said.																								Harrisons family filed a $10 million lawsuit this week claiming Lederman, who treated the musician, violated patient confidentiality and misused his relationship to procure souvenirs.																								The federal lawsuit claimed Lederman coerced a failing Harrison to autograph his sons guitar and sign autographs for his two daughters.																								It also charged Lederman with using Harrisons treatment to gain publicity for himself and the hospital against the express wishes of Harrison, who died of cancer on November 29, 2001, about two weeks after he had left Staten Island for California. 																								Harrison was treated for about three weeks in New York.																								Lederman will retain his privileges to practice medicine at the hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Arleen Ryback, who said a search committee began seeking his successor two years ago. There is no direct cause and effect with that particular situation, Ryback said of the Harrison lawsuit. 																								According to the suit, the doctor had Harrison listen to his son play a guitar, placed it in his lap and asked him to autograph it. When Harrison resisted, the suit claims, Lederman reached out to hold his hand to help him write.																								The doctor denies the accusations, according to his lawyer, Wayne Roth. The doctor has offered to donate the guitar to charity but Harrisons family rejected the settlement offer.																								The suit says that after Harrisons death, Lederman gave a story about the guitar to the National Enquirer, which featured a photograph of the doctors son holding the instrument.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Benegal Netaji fits into Cannes political theme
 AMIT ROY																								Cannes, May 15: This year films with a strong political content are much in vogue at Cannes, which makes the Indian offering on Subhas Chandra Bose all the more appropriate.																								The Telegraph was today given an advance peek at a four-minute promo of Shyam Benegals oddly named Netaji Subhas: The Last Hero, which at 3 hours 48 minutes is at least 90 minutes longer than normal fare western audiences are willing to tolerate.																								Justifying the length, Ashoke Aggrwal, senior commissioning editor at Sahara India Parivar, which has produced the film, said today: Its an epic.. On the basis of a promo, it is not possible to make a sensible judgment about the film, though Aggrwal said that to enhance authenticity, the 30 crore movie, starring the Sachin Khedekar, in the title role, has been shot in India, Russia, Germany.																								But one can be reasonably confident that however good the movie, Benegal will get a fair amount of grief over his treatment of one of the icons of Bengal. We have a release date for the film worldwide  its August 15, added Aggrwal, who is trying to interest potential buyers in the Cannes market.																								One undertaking Aggrwal gave was: The film is in Hindi, with English dialogue in sub-titles, but theres no singing and dancing. Its not Bollywood. You know what Shyam Benegal is like.																								 The music, though, is by A.R. Rahman. The promo, shown exclusively to The Telegraph by Akash Deep, Saharas creative head, depicts Bose wearing a natty line in western suits and, at one point, a Lenin-like beard (it was a disguise when he was trying to escape).																								Benegal himself has expressed his irritation with critics who have not bothered to wait for the release of what will clearly a highly controversial movie. 																								He said: There is a tendency in some parts of Bengal to go wild and possessive about him (Netaji), he has said. 																								I would not have considered it a problem till I received letters from some who were seeking clarifications on certain scenes I filmed. This is trying as it amounts to more than curiosity.																								There are no Indian films in competition this year but in the market, producers, directors and distributors from are busy. If film posters are anything to go by, Bollywood posters are now tending towards either the lurid or the downright sleazy. A typical poster showed a woman in knickers with her legs wide open.																								Sahara, though, is offering a movie on Mother Teresa, called Beatification of Mother Teresa, which is due for release in September. 																								The Indian star count is not high but Aishwarya Rai has been and gone  she opened the Confederation of Indian Industry pavilion. She also visited the Sahara stall and left an autograph with a sketch of a heart.																								Shes on our board, said Aggrwal, pointing out her photograph in the company brochure.																								The Indian scene will be livened up when Shah Rukh Khan hits the Croisette. For now, the stall hired by Eros International, well known distributors, is making do with a life size cardboard cut-out of the great man.																								This year, the theme of the reception hosted by the CII is Goan to symbolise Indias commitment to build a Cannes in Goa.																								The Goa government apparently booked a stall but has not so far bothered to send anyone. 																								You can see how serious they are, commented Aggrwal sarcastically. Its Hamlet without the Prince.																								 The efforts by some Indians to produce movies with a political edge fits in with the general climate at Cannes and especially with what the Americans are doing.																								 Todays Variety magazine makes the point: Michael Moores Fahrenheit 9/11 may have the highest profile, but its only one of several incendiary documentaries that are helping to give this 12-day bacchanal a sharply political slant.																								Variety added: The ongoing fighting in Iraq, terrorist threats and Novembers US presidential election have injected an added measure of politics into the usual Cannes discussions of art and commerce.																								This suggests that with suitable marketing, Benegals biopic on Bose may find a market beyond diaspora Indians.

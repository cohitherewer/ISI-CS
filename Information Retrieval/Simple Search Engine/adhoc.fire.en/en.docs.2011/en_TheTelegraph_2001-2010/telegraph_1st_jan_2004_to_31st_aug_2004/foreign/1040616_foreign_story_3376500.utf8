 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Ogre races ahead of Nemo 
Los Angeles, June 15 (Reuters): Shrek 2, the movie about the big green ogre and his princess bride Fiona, topped last years Finding Nemo to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time in the US and Canada, DreamWorks said yesterday.																								Through Sunday, the computer-animated film had sold $354 million worth of tickets at US and Canadian box offices, according to box office tracking service Exhibitor Relations Inc.																								That beats Nemo, last years big hit from Pixar Animation Studios Inc. and the Walt Disney Co., which had earned $339.8 million on a comparable basis as well as 1994s Disney hit The Lion King, which for years reigned as the leading animated box office hit with collections of $328.4 million.																								Shrek 2 is now No. 9 on the list of all-time box office hits in North America, ahead of No. 10 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers ($340 million) and poised to overtake No. 8 Jurassic Park (356.7 million).

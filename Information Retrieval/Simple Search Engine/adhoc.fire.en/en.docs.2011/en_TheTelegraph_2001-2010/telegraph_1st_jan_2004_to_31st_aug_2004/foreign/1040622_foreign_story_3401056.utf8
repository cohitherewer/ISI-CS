 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Musharraf convenes security council
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, June 21: President Pervez Musharraf today convened the first-ever meeting of the countrys highest decision- making body  the National Security Council (NSC), an official statement said.																								Musharraf had to face stiff resistance from the Opposition over the formation of the NSC after the October 2002 elections. It came into being only after a deal between the government and the Opposition. 																								The NSC will discuss in detail internal security as well as matters relating to the countrys sovereignty, defence and crisis management.																								Headed by President Musharraf, members of the council include Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, key federal ministers, provincial governors and chief ministers, speaker of the National Assembly, chairman of the Senate, leader of the Opposition, chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and chiefs of the army, navy and air force. 																								Formation of the NSC was part of an understanding reached between the government and the six-party religious alliance Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal last year. The Legal Framework Order, which became part of the constitution after the 17th Amendment Bill was approved by the parliament earlier this year, conferred sweeping powers on the office of the President and rendered the elected parliament secondary. Security beefed up																								Security has been beefed up across Pakistan amid fears of retaliation by Islamic militants after a recent crackdown on al Qaida-linked fighters and their Pakistani tribal allies, the interior minister said today. There was no specific threat, but reprisal attacks could not be ruled out.

 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Russian engineers helped Iraq on missiles
																								Washington, March 5: A group of Russian engineers secretly aided Saddam Husseins long-range ballistic missile programme, providing technical assistance for prohibited Iraqi weapons projects even in the years just before the war that ousted him from power, American government officials say.																								Iraqis who were involved in the missile work told American investigators that the technicians had not been working for the Russian government, but for a private company. 																								But any such work on Iraqs banned missiles would have violated UN sanctions, even as the Security Council sought to enforce them.																								Although Iraq ultimately failed to develop and produce long-range ballistic missiles and though even its permitted short-range missile projects were fraught with problems, its missile programme is now seen as the main prohibited weapons effort that Iraq continued right up until the war was imminent. 																								After the first Persian Gulf war in 1991, Iraq was allowed only to keep crude missiles that could travel up to 150 km but the Russian engineers were aiding Baghdads secret efforts illegally to develop longer-range missiles. 																								Since the invasion last March, American investigators have discovered that the Russian engineers had worked on the Iraqi programme both in Moscow and in Baghdad, and that some of them were in the Iraqi capital as recently as 2001.																								Because some of the Russian experts were said to have formerly worked for one of Russias aerospace design centres, their work for Iraq has raised questions about whether Russian government officials knew of their involvement in forbidden missile programmes.

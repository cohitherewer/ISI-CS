 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Police, militants in Jeddah shootout
																								Jeddah, June 5 (Reuters): Saudi police and suspected Muslim militants exchanged fire in the Red Sea city of Jeddah today and the gunmen were still on the run after an hours-long pursuit, security sources said.																								The shooting between police and the militants, who were firing from moving cars, came nearly a week after a major al Qaida attack in the worlds biggest oil-exporting country killed 22 people in the city of Khobar.																								Police pursued the militants but they managed to escape, one source said. They are still hunting them down.																								After initial investigations based on the car licence plates, police believed the gunmen were known security suspects but were not thought to be on a central list of 26 wanted militants.																								Fears about the security situation in the worlds biggest oil exporter helped push world oil prices to record highs last week before producers pledged to hike output.																								Yesterday, al Qaidas top leader in the kingdom, Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, called on Saudis to support the militants campaign to topple the US-allied Saudi monarchy. He praised an al Qaida attack in the Saudi city of Yanbu in early May, the killing of a German in Riyadh two weeks ago and Wednesdays shooting on US military personnel near Riyadh. He also rejected a Saudi claim that two militants killed near the western city of Taif on Wednesday had links to the Khobar attack. Saudi Arabia has been battling al Qaida militants for over a year.

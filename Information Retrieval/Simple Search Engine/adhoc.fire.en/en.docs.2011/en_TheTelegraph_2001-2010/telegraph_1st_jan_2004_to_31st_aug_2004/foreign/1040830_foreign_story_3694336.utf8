 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 Pak blasts kill two soldiers
																								Wana, Aug. 29 (Reuters): A rocket attack and a remote control bomb killed two Pakistani paramilitary soldiers and wounded 11 in the western tribal regions where troops are hunting al Qaida-linked militants, officials said today.																								Two rockets were fired at a camp in the semi-autonomous South Waziristan region early today. 																								One landed inside the compound killing one paramilitary soldier and wounding eight more, an official said.																								Pakistani forces fired mortars in the direction from which the missiles had come, said residents of Wana, about 400 km southwest of the capital, Islamabad.																								In a separate attack, a roadside remote controlled bomb exploded near the town of Razmak, 50 km north of Wana, killing one paramilitary soldier and wounding three as they travelled in a military vehicle today, officials said.																								The Pakistani military has been pursuing hundreds of foreign militants, including Arabs, Chechens and Uzbeks linked to al Qaida, and their tribal allies in South Waziristan. New cabinet 																								Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and his mentor President Pervez Musharraf have launched the exercise of piecing together a new cabinet, which will be sworn-in tomorrow.																								Aziz, who was brought into politics and made finance minister by Musharraf after the 1999 military coup, has a tough task of formulating the cabinet unlike his predecessors, Shujaat Hussain and Zafarullah Khan Jamali, as he has to accommodate the growing list of pro-Musharraf politicians in parliament.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Royal outrage over Harry disgrace
				 	 Prince Harry																								London, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Britains royal family rounded on a columnist today who had branded Prince Harry a national disgrace, lazing his way through a year off in Australia and Africa and touching up girls in nightclubs.																								The office of Harrys father, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, sent a furious letter to the Daily Express saying Carol Sarlers attack on his son was unfair and nonsense.																								I understand that columnists are paid to express their opinions vigorously and with style, but the piece entitled Spoiled and lazy Harry is one of a kind was grossly inaccurate and ill-informed, Charles new communications secretary Paddy Harverson wrote.																								Harry, 19, is no stranger to controversy after dabbling in drink and drugs a couple of years ago. The youngest son of Charles and the late Princess Diana, he is currently in Lesotho following three months in Australia on a gap year after school.																								In an extraordinary tirade against the prince, Sarler began her column on Wednesday: That Prince Harry is a national disgrace is scarcely news.																								His exploits have been making headlines for years: the drinking, the drugging, the yobbing, the waste of the costliest education in the land, the explicit disdain for the lower orders, the increasingly sexual public romps  weve seen it all, weve heard it all. Calling him a thoroughly horrible young man, Sarler said Harry has rarely lifted a finger unless its to feel up a cheap tart in a nightclub.																								The columnist said Harry spent his time in Australia slumped in front of a TV waiting to behave badly at the next rugby match, while in Africa he has reluctantly agreed to spend a bit of the trip staring at poor people. 																								A newcomer to the frequent spats between the royals and Britains feisty tabloid press, having just been poached from Manchester United soccer club to run Charles PR efforts, Harverson took on the Express point-by-point.																								In Australia, Harry spent most of his time working long days in high temperatures on cattle farms, where his employers found him to be a hard and conscientious worker, Harverson wrote. 																								In Africa, Harry has insisted on working on projects for disadvantaged children and their families rather than just making VIP-style visits, Harverson added. Like any other 19-year-old fortunate enough to be able to spend time travelling and working abroad, Harry should be allowed to enjoy and benefit from his experiences without being subject to the kind of insensitive criticism made in your paper by Ms Sarler, he wrote.

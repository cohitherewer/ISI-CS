 							 - 39 junior ministers sacked				 	 Chandrika Kumaratunga																								Colombo, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Sri Lankas President sacked 39 junior ministers today, tightening the screws on the Prime Minister in the run-up to general elections that will be fought over how to make peace with Tamil Tiger rebels.																								Slashing the positions and removing the privileges of 12 deputy ministers and 27 non-cabinet rank ministers could cripple her rival Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes government as he prepares to fight what will likely be a close race.																								In view of the dissolution of parliament, the President has decided to remove their posts, said Janadasa Peiris, a spokesman for President Chandrika Kumaratunga. 																								We had requests to remove their vehicles, since it is unfair for them to contest the election with these facilities.																								The Left-leaning Kumaratunga  who as executive President is not up for re-election  called the April 2 poll at the weekend to end a stalemate with Wickremesinghe over how to proceed with a peace process to end the islands 20-year civil war.																								The government and the Tigers have been observing a truce for nearly two years, but Kumaratungas party takes a harder line on the rebels and she has accused Wickremesinghe of compromising security in his bid to make peace. 																								The sacked ministers did not attend cabinet meetings and headed minor departments, but by removing them Kumaratunga reduces the access of her rival to government facilities. She has no moral right to do this, said a spokesman for Wickremesinghes United National Party.																								Appointing and sacking ministers is the Presidents constitutional right, and she showed her willingness to use it when she seized the defence, interior and media ministries in November, opening the feud with Wickremesinghe. 																								Kumaratungas party also has the election race advantage of the state media, which she has controlled since then.

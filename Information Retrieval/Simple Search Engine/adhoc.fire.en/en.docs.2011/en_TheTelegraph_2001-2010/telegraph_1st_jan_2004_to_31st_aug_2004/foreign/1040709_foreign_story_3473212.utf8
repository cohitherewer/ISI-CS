 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Former Enron chief surrenders
																								Houston, July 8 (Reuters): Former Enron Corp. chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay surrendered to federal agents today after being indicted on criminal charges of fraud and making false statements while the energy powerhouse collapsed into bankruptcy.																								In a 65-page federal grand jury indictment unsealed by the US justice department today, Lay was charged with 11 criminal counts, including securities and bank fraud. Lay, a friend to President George W. Bush  who called him Kenny Boy  has steadfastly denied all wrongdoing. He appeared calm and relaxed as he entered FBI offices in Houston.																								You guys are up early, the 62-year-old Lay said as he strode past a pack of about 50 reporters and news cameras gathered in front of the FBI offices. Nice of you all to show up this morning. 																								After about 20 minutes inside the FBI offices, where he was fingerprinted and processed, Lay emerged in handcuffs and was taken to a federal court house. He was scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate judge at 11.30 am local time.																								The 11 counts against Lay were added to an earlier indictment against Jeff Skilling, who was Lays hand-picked successor as CEO, and former chief accounting officer Rick Causey, indicating that they would be tried together. Lays attorney, Mike Ramsey, said he would seek a speedy trial for his client and may try to separate his case from those of Skilling and Causey.

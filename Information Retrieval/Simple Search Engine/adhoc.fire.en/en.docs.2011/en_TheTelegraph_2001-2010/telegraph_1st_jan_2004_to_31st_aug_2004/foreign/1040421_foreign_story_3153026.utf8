 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Pak tribesmen call off militant hunt 
																								Azam Warsak (Pakistan), April 20 (Reuters): Pakistani tribesmen searching for al Qaida and Taliban militants and their local allies called off the hunt today after some of the men they had targeted asked for time to surrender or flee.																								The government said it would not insist on todays deadline to tribal elders to hand over the militants and the local men who are harbouring them.																								A militia of around 2,000 of the fiercely independent tribesmen is searching for the militants and their local hosts. Five local men who were being sought asked a tribal council to give them time to give themselves up or leave the area.																								We will halt our activities for three days but will not vacate the area, tribal elder Malik Noor Ali told the jirga in the remote village of Azam Warsak attended by hundreds of tribesmen, most of them wearing big yellow turbans and carrying weapons.																								The tribal fighters, armed with assault rifles and other light weapons, have spread across the semi-autonomous tribal belt near the Afghan border, setting up makeshift camps and pickets. They want to apprehend tribesmen who are harbouring the militants to avoid allowing the army into the area to do the job.																								The government, keen to avoid a repeat of bloody clashes with militants last month in which more than 120 people were killed, said it was ready to give the tribesmen more time, although a deadline to hand over the militants expired today.																								We have not set any new deadline, said Rehmatullah Wazir, a senior government official in Wana, the main town in the South Waziristan tribal area 380 km southwest of Islamabad. Azam Warsak is 20 km west of Wana.																								The lashkar (tribal militia) is working in a very positive manner, and because of that there is no need (for a military operation), he said. If it proceeds well and they hand over the men and can control their area, then there is no need for any action.																								Residents in Azam Warsak said five local tribesmen harbouring foreign militants had asked elders for time to decide whether to surrender or vacate the area. They have asked for some time, but it is now up to the tribe to decide on it, said Rehmatullah Wazir.																								In line with a centuries-old custom, the tribal militia has burned down the house of one tribesman suspected of harbouring militants, and has threatened to demolish three more.																								We are poor people, but we are doing this to satisfy the government that we do not support and provide shelter to the wrong kind of people, said Khanzada Wazir, a resident of Azam Warsak, explaining why tribesmen had turned against their kin.

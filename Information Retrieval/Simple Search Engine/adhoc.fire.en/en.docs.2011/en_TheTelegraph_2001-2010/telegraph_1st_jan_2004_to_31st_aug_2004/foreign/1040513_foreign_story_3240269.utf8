 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Powell to sport coat of arms
 TOM PETERKIN				 	 Colin PowellLondon, May 12: Colin Powell, the US secretary of state, has commemorated his Scottish roots by having a coat of arms commissioned by Scotlands heraldic authority.																								The Lord Lyon King of Arms is likely to hand over the coat of arms, which also illustrates his distinguished military career, at a ceremony in Washington in September.																								The Lord Lyon, Scotlands equivalent of the College of Arms in London, will bestow the coat of arms in memory of Powells late father, Luther.																								The Heraldry Society of Scotland helped with the design of the arms, which depict two swords arranged in a diagonal cross to mark Powells military career.																								Also included are a lion, a symbol traditionally associated with the Powell surname, and an eagle, which signifies America and is also a reference to the badge of the 101st Airborne Division, which Powell commanded. Four mullets [stars] Argent arranged around the swords refer to Powells status as a four-star general.																								The motto: Devoted to public services has been written across the top of the design, which Powell will be entitled to stamp on letterheads, books, flags and pennants.																								Arms cannot be given directly to those who are not British subjects so Powell applied for the coat of arms on behalf of his father, who was brought up in Jamaica.																								Luther Theophilus Powell was born in Jamaica in 1901 and is eligible for arms through the islands membership of the Commonwealth. It is understood that Powell applied to the Lord Lyon rather than the College of Arms because the family of his mother, Maud Ariel McKoy, came from Scotland.																								Powell made his request after speaking to a former colleague in the army, General Jack Nicholson, whose ancestors came from the island of Arran. His parents emigrated separately from Jamaica in the early 1920s and met after settling among the West Indian community in New Yorks Harlem district. His father worked as a shipping clerk, while his mother was a seamstress. Yesterday, Elizabeth Roads, the Lyon Clerk at the Court of the Lord Lyon, said: He has made the petition to remember his father.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

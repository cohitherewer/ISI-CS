 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Putin revives Stalingrad
				 	 Josef Stalin																								Moscow, July 23 (Reuters): A reference to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin is to appear on a Russian monument for the first time in more than 40 years, on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin made public today.																								 Putin ordered the word Stalingrad engraved on a memorial complex by the Kremlin wall in Moscow, replacing Volgograd, the current name of the city where one of the bloodiest battles of World War Two was fought. Less than two years ago Putin said reviving the name of Stalingrad would do us no good.																								But his latest order, posted on the presidential website www.kremlin.ru today, said restoring Stalins name on the monument was to pay tribute to the heroism of the defenders of Stalingrad and to preserve the history of the Russian state.																								In 1961 Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev publicly accused Stalin, who died in 1953, of killing millions of innocent people in political purges and ordered his name removed from most official records. 																								Stalingrad, named after the dictator in the late 1930s, was one of hundreds of cities, towns, villages, factories and collective farms renamed under Khrushchevs orders.

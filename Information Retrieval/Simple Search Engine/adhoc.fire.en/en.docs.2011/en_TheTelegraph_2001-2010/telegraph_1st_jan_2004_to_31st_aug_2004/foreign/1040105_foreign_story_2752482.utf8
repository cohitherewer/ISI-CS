 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Afghanistan stands up for free elections
				 	 Women delegates to Afghanistans constitutional Loya Jirga read newspapers at the venue tent prior to the start of the days session in Kabul on Sunday. (Reuters)																								Kabul, Jan. 4 (Reuters): Afghanistans Loya Jirga, or Grand Assembly, passed a new constitution by consensus today, paving the way for the countrys first full democratic elections later this year.																								After weeks of wrangling over the powers of the President, assembly chairman Sibghatullah Mojaddidi asked delegates to stand to show their endorsement of the constitution. An overwhelming majority did so, signifying its adoption.																								We wanted consensus on the constitution, not voting, Afghan Vice-President Nematuallah Shahrani, the head of constitutional drafting committee, told the assembly.																								We came close to a major problem, but it was resolved by the people of Afghanistan, Mojaddidi told the 502 delegates meeting under a giant white tent on a college campus in Kabul. 																								We are hoping to be able to unite together as one nation and to be able to overcome challenges of the future.																								He did not give details on how the deadlock was resolved but said the full assembly would approve the charter later in the day, ending three weeks of debate on the role of Islam, rights of women and the political system in post-Taliban Afghanistan.																								Afghanistans last constitution was drawn up in 1964. Since then, the country has lived through Soviet occupation, catastrophic civil war and five years of hardline Taliban rule, leaving it in desperate need of stability.																								The assembly has run for 22 days instead of the 10 envisaged by President Hamid Karzai, with UN and US officials working behind the scenes to broker a deal.																								The threat of violence against a woman delegate and accusations of meddling by ministers marred the proceedings. A low point came on Thursday, when nearly half the 502 delegates boycotted the first and only ballot, complaining the pro-Karzai bloc had dropped their proposed amendments.																								Karzai, a Pashtun, who like his backers in Washington argued for sweeping powers to rebuild his war-weary country, will get his wish of a strong presidency, but one that will answer to parliament on certain issues. 																								Opposition to Karzai at the Loya Jirga was orchestrated by members of the mainly Tajik North Alliance that helped the US military topple the Taliban in late 2001 and which remains the backbone of his government.

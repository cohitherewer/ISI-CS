The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Defiant Sadr forces oil halt
				 	 Moqtada al-Sadr at Najafs Imam Ali shrine on Monday. (Reuters) Najaf, Aug. 9 (Reuters): A  firebrand Shia cleric today defied demands from Iraqs interim  government that his militia pull out of Najaf and threats  from his fighters forced a halt to oil output in the south.																								Despite a brief lull to evacuate casualties, there was no sign that fighting would ease after days of fierce clashes with US marines who claim to have killed 360 of his fighters.																								Moqtada al-Sadrs men hit the oil industry for the first time, raising fears about a sector already plagued by sabotage. Pumping from the southern oilfields to storage tanks at Basra was stopped today after threats made by al-Sadr, said an Iraqi oil official. He said militiamen from Sadrs Mehdi Army had threatened to sabotage production by the state Southern Oil Company, based in Basra.																								He said storage at the Gulf Basra terminal was sufficient to keep exports running for about two days. Iraq has been exporting about 1.9 million barrels a day.																								Battles in several cities tested the wills of the firebrand Sadr and the interim government of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, which has vowed to impose stability and lead an economic recovery which would depend heavily on oil exports.																								The fresh Shia uprising poses the most serious test for Allawi since he took over from US-led occupiers on June 28. Heavily armed marines backed by aircraft tightened their noose around the holy city of Najaf in heavy battles today, but a senior US military official denied coalition forces were hunting the young cleric. Sadr thundered defiance during a news conference at Najafs holiest shrine, the Imam Ali mosque.																								The Mehdi Army and I will keep resisting. I will stay in holy Najaf and will never leave, Sadr said.

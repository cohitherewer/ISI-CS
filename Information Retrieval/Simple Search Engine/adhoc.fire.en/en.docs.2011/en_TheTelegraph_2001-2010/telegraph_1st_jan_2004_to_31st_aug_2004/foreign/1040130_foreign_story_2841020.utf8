 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Iran urged to put off unfair polls
																								Tehran, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Iranian state governors, who play a key role in organising elections, called on the government to postpone next months parliamentary election, arguing the mass disqualification of candidates meant the vote would not be fair.																								The governors call, reported by the official Irna news agency today, comes a day before the hardline Guardian Council was due to announce how many of the thousands of candidates it barred from the race have been reinstated.																								Bearing in mind the current conditions, it will not be possible to hold the... elections on February 20 as previously scheduled, the governors said in a letter to interior minister Abdolvahed Mousavi-Lari, Irna reported.																								The mass disqualifications handed down by the council has plunged Iran into its worst political crisis for years.

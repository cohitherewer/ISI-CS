 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Disband deal not to cover Sadr
Baghdad, June 7 (Reuters): Nine of Iraqs militias, constituting more than 100,000 armed men, agreed to disband today as part of a rewards and retraining programme, but the deal does not cover rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadrs fighters.																								Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi announced the deal, which will see most of the militia fighters reintegrated into Iraqs new security forces while others are retrained for jobs in civilian life or go into retirement with a pension.																								I am happy to announce today the successful completion of negotiations on the nationwide transition and reintegration of militias and other armed forces previously outside of state control, the Prime Minister said.																								The deal includes Iraqs largest private political armies, including the Peshmerga fighters of the countrys two Kurdish parties, the main Shia militia and several smaller ones, but pointedly does not include Sadrs Mehdi Army.

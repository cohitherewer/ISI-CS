 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Impeachment sparks South Korea crisis
																								Seoul, March 12 (Reuters): South Koreas parliament impeached President Roh Moo-hyun today, suspending him from office amid chaotic scenes and thrusting the country into unprecedented economic and political uncertainty.																								Some 12,000 Roh supporters, many holding candles and chanting slogans, protested peacefully near the National Assembly parliament building and the headquarters of the main opposition Grand National Party. Riot police stood at the ready.																								All Rohs powers are in limbo until the Constitutional Court rules on the vote, which the Opposition called after he broke an election law. That process could take up to six months, during which time Prime Minister Goh Kun will run the country.																								The world is watching us with anxiety and concern, Goh told ministers in a nod to the unseemly brawling in parliament as well as the geo-political ramifications of impeachment for a country that borders North Korea and has Asias fourth-largest economy.																								We should do our best to change those anxieties and concerns into belief and trust in our country, he said as he presided over his first cabinet meeting as acting President. US and South Korean military officials will meet tomorrow to discuss security  there are 37,000 US troops in South Korea.																								South Korean financial markets reacted sharply to the historic vote, which took place as members of parliament brawled and wept. Burly plainclothes guards had had to prise grimacing deputies hands off the speakers microphone.Investors sought the safe haven of bonds, shares closed at a five-week low and the won shed 1 per cent against the dollar. Finance minister Lee Hun-jai sent 1,000 letters to international agencies, global banks and fund managers to reassure them the economy would remain stable.																								The economy is just emerging from a downturn and the nation faces an April 15 parliamentary election. Seoul is also crucial in six-way talks on North Koreas nuclear ambitions.																								This is the day our nations democracy died, said the pro-Roh Uri Party that had sought to block the vote with a sit-in. Its members of parliament said they would all resign.

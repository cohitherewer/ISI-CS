				 Bird flu leaps into humans in Thailand

																								Bangkok, Jan. 23 (Reuters): The bird flu eruption in Asia, which the WHO says could set off an epidemic worse than Sars, has leapt into humans in Thailand and appeared in Cambodia, officials said today.
																								A chicken butcher, one of six Thais being tested for the disease, died of pneumonia, said Charal Trinwuthipong, director-general of the department of disease control. After days of declaring the country free of the bird flu which killed five Vietnamese, the Thai government said two boys, aged six and seven and from different provinces west of Bangkok, were critical but stable with the disease.
																								Three more people are being tested and the Bangkok government issued an urgent warning to anyone suffering from fever and bronchitis after being around poultry to rush to the doctor. 
																								Those who have contacted chicken and have high fever and bronchitis should report themselves to doctors immediately, health minister Sudarat Keyuraphan said. Children appear most at risk. No one knows why, but four of the five killed in Vietnam were children.
																								The announcement that bird flu had struck threatened to devastate the Thai chicken industry, the worlds fourth-largest. The EU, the second biggest buyer of chicken from a country which earns more than $1 billion a year from poultry exports, promptly joined Japan, Thailands biggest customer, in banning imports of Thai chicken.
																								Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra shrugged off the bans, saying they would have only a trivial impact on exports which he expects to help the economy to grow eight per cent this year. GDP will be hit by only 0.1 per cent and exports will be hit by 0.4 per cent, he said. But the WHO was clearly alarmed.
																								It said in a statement the near simultaneous bird flu outbreaks in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and now Thailand and Cambodia were historically unprecedented and it was worried a new, virulent strain of influenza could sweep around the world.
																								That could happen, it said, if someone got human and bird flu at the same time, allowing the viruses to exchange genes and form a new strain which could pass easily from person to person.So far, there is no evidence that has happened, with all the known cases being infected by direct contact with chickens.

 Saturday, August 21, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Bald battle																																	 Rome, Aug. 20 (Reuters): Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will win the battle against baldness after a hair transplant earlier this month, the doctor who performed the surgery said in an interview published today.																																	After days of speculation sparked by a white bandanna that Berlusconi has donned in recent appearances while on holiday in Sardinia, Piero Rosati confirmed he had operated on the Prime Minister and that the results would show in a couple of months.																																	Yes, it was me, he told the Corriere della Sera daily, just a day after denying the rumours to another newspaper. Nobody can do miracles ... but there will definitely be an improvement, Rosati said, adding that the first hairs should appear in a month or two. When asked if Berlusconi had won the battle against baldness, Rosati said: I really think so.																																	The bandanna worn by Berlusconi during a visit from British Prime Minister Tony Blair first prompted debates about fashion faux pas, but talk quickly turned to a rumoured hair transplant.

 Tuesday, April 06, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Joyce letter																																	 London, April 5 (Reuters): A tentative letter from Irish wordsmith James Joyce offering Dubliners to publisher William Heinemann in September 1905 goes under the hammer on Wednesday with a price tag of up to 30,000. He was right to be tentative. Heinemann had only just turned down his Chamber Music and went on to reject Dubliners too.																																	 the end, the book, a series of short stories illustrating various aspects of life in the Irish capital and one of Joyces most accessible works, was not published until 1914.																																	The letter is part of a vast collection of travel documents, books and manuscripts being auctioned on Wednesday and Thursday by Christies in London.																																	Among other letters up for sale is one from African explorer David Livingstone dated May 1865 which contains a sharp attack on fellow explorer Richard Burton who had previously vilified his one-time colleague John Speke over the source of the Nile. Burton is an awful ruffian  I must keep quite clear of his spoor (tracks), Livingstone wrote to Sir Thomas Maclear, Royal Astronomer at the observatory in Cape Town.																													 																Drunk driver Berlin (Reuters): A German man was forced  to invite the police to his wedding after they arrested  him for drink driving the day of his marriage and had to  escort him to the registry office, authorities said on Monday.  The police escort also offered the bridal pair his most  heartfelt congratulations, said police from the northern  city of Bremen. Police arrested the inebriated 36-year-old  after he crashed his car and failed to disguise that he  had been drinking heavily. He told police he had been out  on his stag night and was on the way to pick up wedding  flowers for his bride. All parties refrained from taking  the obligatory glass of champagne after the ceremony, said  police. While the wedding guests went on to the reception,  the new husband accompanied police to the station and provided  a blood sample, before being collected by his mother. Hell  have to do without his driving licence for a bit, but at  least he has a brand new marriage licence now, said police.																													 																Rescue record																																	 Santa Maria Del Orinoco (Venezuela), (Reuters): Venezuelas government has established what it believes is a record for releasing an endangered species back into the wild by setting free tens of thousands of protected Arrau turtles into the Orinoco River. Weve been doing this for 10 years now and with this part we have released a total of 166,000 turtles. Its a historic release of a protected species, environment minister Ana Elisa Osorio said as turtles bobbed in the brownish waters. The program takes tiny, new-born Arrau from the river banks to raise them in a refuge for a year before releasing them back into the wild.

 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Iraq shadow on deadly UN brawl
				 	 Officials observe a minutes silence in memory of the victims at the UN headquarters in Pristina on Saturday. (Reuters)																								Kosovska Mitrovica (Serbia and Montenegro), April 18 (Reuters): Two Americans and a Jordanian were shot dead in Kosovo yesterday when emotions on Iraq apparently boiled over into a gunbattle between members of the UN law enforcement mission.																								UN police spokesperson Neeraj Singh said two US police officers and a Jordanian were killed and 10 Americans and one Austrian wounded in the shooting.																								Four Jordanians were detained yesterday after the incident and they are in custody, UN police commissioner Stefan Feller said in the provincial capital Pristina. We dont know the motive, he said in response to questions about a report that emotions over Iraq was behind the clash. I cannot say the reasons for the incident, he added, calling it a reckless attack. 																								Singh said the UN was still investigating the possible motive. 																								Whatever the cause, a lethal firefight is unprecedented between two of the 30 or so national contingents of the Kosovo UN law enforcement mission, which numbers some 3,500 officers.																								Feller, a German officer, said the shooting began when a convoy of 21 US officers along with an Austrian and two Turks was leaving Mitrovica detention centre in the compound after routine training.																								He said at least one of five Jordanians opened fire on the convoy and officers from the convoy returned fire. In the exchange, three officers were killed and 11 others wounded, 10 of whom were Americans including five women. Feller said one was in critical condition. He added that a request had been sent to the UN in New York that the immunity of the Jordanian officers be lifted so they could be investigated and interrogated.																								Police sources at the scene of yesterdays firefight said hostility over Iraq or West Asia had sparked the fight. A UN spokesperson denied the shooting had been preceded by a verbal clash. But a US policeman who declined to be named said the attack had been organised.

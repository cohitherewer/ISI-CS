 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Rumsfeld on sudden visit to key prison
Abu Ghraib (Iraq), May 13 (Reuters): US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld flew into the eye of an Iraqi storm today, dropping in unannounced at Abu Ghraib jail to tell troops a prisoner abuse scandal would not wreck Americas mission in Iraq.																								Tackling head-on an issue that threatens his own future and President George W. Bushs efforts to ensure a stable, pro-US government in Baghdad, Rumsfeld spent seven hours in the Iraqi capital and toured Saddam Husseins notorious former jail where seven US soldiers have been accused of abusing detainees. The affair has shredded US credibility among Iraqis. Some now question whether American rule is much better than Saddams.																								In recent days theres been a focus on a few who have betrayed our values and sullied the reputation of our country, Rumsfeld told a town hall meeting on the main US base where whooping soldiers responded to his efforts to bolster morale. 																								Rumsfeld, Bush and others are trying to confine the damage to the seven military police reservists charged over photographs showing soldiers sexually and physically tormenting detainees																								But the Red Cross and others say they warned the Pentagon months ago about systematic torture in Iraq. A new Red Cross report has also criticised the US treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, a Pentagon official said during Rumsfelds trip.																								Rumsfeld sought to allay concerns among the troops about extended tours of duty, mounting combat losses and fears the war might in the end be unwinnable; though no one in uniform uttered the word, some critics are already comparing Iraq to Vietnam.Bush blamed																								The father of Nick Berg, the Pennsylvania contractor beheaded in Iraq, today directly blamed President George W. Bush and Rumsfeld for his sons death. My son died for the sins of George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld. This administration did this, Berg said in an interview in Philadelphia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 Hope takes root in violent Iraq
 JACK FAIRWEATHERBaghdad, March 20: One year to the day since the beginning of the invasion, Iraqis offered a cautiously positive view of the future yesterday.																								Yet few have been untouched by the violence ushered in with the arrival of the coalition. Bomb blasts continue to rock Baghdad and travelling after dark is still considered too dangerous despite the lifting of a night curfew in December. But most say freedom from Saddam Hussein is worth the troubles, as The Daily Telegraph found in a tour of the capital yesterday. Mohammed Karim, 50, is a former government employee turned used car salesman who lives in the heavily fortified US compound in the centre of Baghdad, otherwise known as the green zone.																								It takes him four hours each day to drive a mile to his workplace, one of the reasons, he says, why he rarely leaves home any more. His location near to the headquarters of Iraqs US-led government has also placed his family under the threat of mortar attack. 																								When I heard the bombs falling on Saddams palace a year ago I thanked God because I knew the Americans were coming to get rid of him, he said. But they did very little when they got here. Now I realise just how long its going to take for Iraq to recover  many years. I am hopeful for the future.																								On the other side of the city, in the Shia slums once called Saddam City, Rhiad Hadi was also upbeat. He is an unemployed labourer whose brother provides for a household of seven by working at a bakery for 50 pence a day. He had spent most of the previous evening playing pool at a community centre set up by an American military unit, although he is trying to find work as a security guard. The streets are cleaner, the water works and so does the electricity, sometimes, and I can worship freely, he said. I would be happy for the Americans to stay if they continue to work for improving Iraq. 																								But beneath such surface optimism there are deeper problems. Attitudes towards the Americans, joyous in the first days of liberation, were soon tempered by the slow pace of rebuilding. Relations are now cordial at best. There are also the scars of 12 months of terrorist attacks  attacks Iraqis have taken to blaming on the US, which is accused of creating instability to prolong its stay. Under Saddam there was little crime, Iraqis say. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

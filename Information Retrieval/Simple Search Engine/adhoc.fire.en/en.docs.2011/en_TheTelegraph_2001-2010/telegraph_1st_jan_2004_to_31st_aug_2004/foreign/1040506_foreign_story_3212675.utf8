The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, May 06, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Gutsy gorilla																																	Johannesburg, May 5 (Reuters): A gorilla who became a cult figure in crime-ridden South Africa, after he was shot confronting an armed robber on the run, died today, the Johannesburg Zoo said.																																	Max, a 200-kg ape, rose to fame in 1997 after being wounded by a terrified gunman who made the mistake of jumping a moat into his zoo enclosure while fleeing police.																																	Max was shot as he fiercely defended his territory. He also vented his anger on two policemen in pursuit, biting one on the buttocks and arm.																																	Max died in his sleep in the early hours of this morning, the Johannesburg Zoo said in a brief statement. Max became a hero in a city blighted by violent crime and police used him as a mascot in crime prevention programmes. Police also presented Max with a bulletproof vest  which was several sizes too small.																													 																Sweet toothLondon (Reuters): A woman with an apparently insatiable sweet tooth stunned staff at a British shop when she bought more than 10,000 chocolate bars and had them loaded into her chauffeur-driven limousine. The woman asked staff at a north London Woolworths branch for every single Mars bar in stock  10,656 of them packed in 220 boxes  and paid for them in cash with 50 notes, a Woolworths spokesman said on Wednesday. The total bill was 2,131. It was very, very strange but nobody thought to ask her why she wanted so many, he said. Perhaps she has a sweet tooth.																													 																Lost lion																																	 Columbus (Ohio) (Reuters): Police in the suburbs of Ohios capital, Columbus, called in a helicopter and big-game experts on Tuesday to help search for what could be a lion. The large animal was first noticed by a police officer on Monday as it crossed a road in the town of Gahanna. Hours later a courier service employee said he saw it as he returned to his office. The employee, Jack Dingess, 41, said he thought he was tripping out when he saw the animal crouching under a semitrailer in the parking lot. Mayor Becky Stinchcomb said she was a bit skeptical about the initial report because in another recent reported sighting of a lion, the animal turned out to be a Great Dane.																													 																Pop the corn New York (Reuters): To mark the premiere on Tuesday of a film about his life as a competitive eater, Crazy Legs Conti is trying to eat his way out of a telephone booth-size structure filled with popcorn. Conti, 33, donned a diving mask and snorkel inside the lobby of the Manhattan movie theatre that will show the film and lowered himself into a popcorn sarcophagus, a wooden, windowed structure, to begin munching. 																																	He vowed to eat his way through the 50 cubic feet (1.4 cubic metres) of salted, buttered popcorn in about eight hours, in time for the movies premiere on Tuesday evening.																																	Conti, who runs marathons and is built like a wrestler, is no neophyte to nibbling, having won the world oyster-eating championship. His dream is to defeat Japans Takeru Kobayashi in the Fourth of July hot dog eating contest on New Yorks Coney Island, regarded as the Super Bowl of competitive eating.																																	This guy is completely genuine. He is taking every action he needs to make his dream a reality, the films director, Chris Kenneally, said of Conti, who is from Massachusetts.																																	The documentary,Crazy Legs Conti: Zen and the Art of Competitive Eating, is part of the Tribeca Film Festival.

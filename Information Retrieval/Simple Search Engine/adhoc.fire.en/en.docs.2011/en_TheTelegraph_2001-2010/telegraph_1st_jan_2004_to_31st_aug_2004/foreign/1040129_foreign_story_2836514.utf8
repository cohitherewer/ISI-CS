 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Judge plans legal action against report leak
				 	 The front page of Wednesdays edition of The Sun. (AFP)																								London, Jan. 28: Lord Hutton said today that he would consider legal action into the leaking of selective parts of his report to a tabloid newspaper. 																								The retired law lord took unprecedented security measures in an attempt to ensure that the findings of his inquiry were not made public before today. Throughout he has tried to be sympathetic to the feelings of the late David Kellys family, who have shunned publicity and appealed for the media to respect their privacy. But Lord Huttons measures, including the use of private printers, seemed to have failed as The Sun published apparent extracts from his report.																								Various theories on the source of the leak were circulating at Westminster. One possibility was that a copy had been provided by somebody working at the printers.																								Another was that someone close to the government briefed The Sun particularly as the leaked sections appear to clear the Prime Minister and Alastair Campbell while attacking the BBC. Dr Liam Fox, the Conservative co-chairman, echoed the suspicions of many in Parliament when he said: The governments fingerprints are all over the leaking of this document. It is a despicable act from a morally bankrupt government. 																								If the government or No 10 is implicated it could backfire on Blair because media manipulation is at the heart of a lack of trust in him personally and the government. But the timing is extremely fortunate for Blair. The extracts were obtained at a time when ministers believed Labour was about to suffer a humiliating Commons defeat.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 US agrees to Sadr truce offer
				 	 Militants loyal to radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr hold his portrait in al-Majar, 25 km south of Najaf. (AFP)																								Najaf, May 27 (Reuters): US forces agreed to a truce offered by Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in Najaf today, suspending their attacks and allowing Sadrs Mehdi Army fighters to pull out of the city.																								Ending a day of uncertainty following the ceasefire offer, a spokesman for the US-led coalition in Iraq said the Americans would pull back to bases but continue patrols in the city until Iraqi police and other local forces could ensure security.																								But US officials were resisting a condition from Sadr that an arrest warrant on a murder charge against him be suspended. We are cautiously optimistic. This is a good first step, coalition spokesman Dan Senor told a news conference.																								As soon as the Iraqi security forces have assumed responsibility for public security and re-established law and order, coalition forces will reposition to their bases outside Najaf, while maintaining protective units at the CPA (coalition) offices and the governorate building and Iraqi police stations.																								Until that time coalition forces will suspend offensive operations but will continue to provide security by carrying out presence patrols. Throughout the process coalition forces will retain the inherent right to self-defence.																								A deal with the radical young preacher could staunch a major source of trouble for US troops as Washington prepares to hand over to an Iraqi interim government on June 30.																								It remains to be seen if the truce marks the end of Sadrs ambitions or rather a bid to survive and keep his forces intact to influence the course of Iraqi politics after the occupation. US commanders have rejected previous ceasefires and demand that he give himself up for arrest and disband his guerrillas.																								Hundreds of Mehdi Army fighters left frontline positions where they have suffered heavy losses in recent weeks under the guns of American tanks and aircraft. Many piled mortars and other heavy weapons into trucks while keeping their rifles.																								Three Shia members of Iraqs governing council, including Ahmad Chalabi, held talks with aides to Sadr in an attempt to negotiate an end to fighting.																								Chalabi, a former US favourite who has criticised the military offensive in Najaf, said he expected more negotiations with local commanders of the US 1st Armored Divison.																								Sadr had agreed that fighters not normally resident in Najaf would return home and had demanded in return the suspension of the murder warrant against him. He said US troops should stay in bases, leaving security on the streets to Iraqi police.																								Sadr said: To end the tragic situation in Najaf and the violation... of the holy places, I announce my agreement to the following: an end to all armed demonstrations, the evacuation of government buildings... and the withdrawal of all Mehdi Army fighters.More British troops																								Britain said today it was sending 370 more soldiers and extra firepower to the southern zone it controls in Iraq, a stop-gap that may be followed by a larger despatch to counter a likely upsurge in violence.																								Defence secretary Geoff Hoon said the deployment was not a strategic change in Britains role but would give its forces extra protection from militants. 																								Hoon said talks continued with military partners over the need for further deployments.

(Reuters)																								Washington, June 11 (AP): George W. Bush has said he ordered officials to follow the law while interrogating suspected terrorists, but he sidestepped an opportunity to flatly denounce the use of torture. 																								Bushs comments came as a two-year-old state department document surfaced warning the White House that failing to apply international standards against torture could put US troops at risk. What Ive authorised is that we stay within US law, Bush said yesterday at the close of the Group of Eight summit of industrialised nations in Savannah, Georgia. Asked if torture is ever justified, Bush replied: Look, Im going to say it one more time... The instructions went out to our people to adhere to law. That ought to comfort you. 																								Bushs comments follow disclosure of justice department memos to the White House advising the President that he could suspend international treaties prohibiting torture. 																								 Bush said he doesnt recall seeing any of the justice department advice. Democrats say that by suggesting that Bush could legally authorise torture, the memos laid the legal foundation for abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US forces at Abu Ghraib prison.

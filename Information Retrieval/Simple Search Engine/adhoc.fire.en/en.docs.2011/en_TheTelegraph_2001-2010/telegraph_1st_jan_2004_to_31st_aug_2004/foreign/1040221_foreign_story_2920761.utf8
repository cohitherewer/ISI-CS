 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Australian drug hope in war against flu
																								Sydney, Feb. 20 (Reuters): An Australian-made drug is effective in treating the bird flu that has killed at least 22 people in Asia, a government research body said today.																								Shares in Australian drug developer Biota Holdings Ltd surged 51 per cent after the group said the firms Relenza flu drug had been shown to be effective. Drugs based on CSIROs research into the influenza virus have been shown to be effective in laboratory tests against a sample of an H5N1 influenza virus currently infecting chickens in Asia, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) said in a statement.																								Government scientists tested the ability of Biotas flu drug, Relenza, to inhibit the virus that has also killed millions of wild and farmed birds in Asia. Scientists in Bangkok said today two domestic cats had died of the same bird flu.																								The tests, used to monitor virus sensitivity to drugs, have shown that the drug Relenza is as effective, in laboratory experiments, against this bird flu as it is against other strains of flu that affect humans, the organisation said.																								GlaxoSmithKline Plc produces and markets the drug under licence. Shares in Biota surged to their highest level in more than two years, climbing as high as Australian $0.80 before ending the day up 51 per cent at Australian $0.77.																								The Asian bird flu had not been shown to be passed from human to human and all those who had died from the disease had caught it directly from infected birds, the CSIRO said in the statement.																								China confirmed two more suspected outbreaks of the influenza H5N1 virus in two provinces today, and Thai officials said the virus had reappeared in two provinces that had been declared under control.																								In two reports in the Lancet medical journal, Koopmans and Prof. Malik Peiris of the University of Hong Kong described why the current avian outbreak is so dangerous. 																								Koopmans said it is possible the virus may not be completely controlled in poultry because it is so widespread.

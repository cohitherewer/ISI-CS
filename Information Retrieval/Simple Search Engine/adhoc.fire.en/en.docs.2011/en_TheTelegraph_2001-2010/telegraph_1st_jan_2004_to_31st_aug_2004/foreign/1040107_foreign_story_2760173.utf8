 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Quickie marriages alive and kicking in Sin City 
 BOOTH MOORE  From top: Carmen  Electra, Drew Barrymore, Shannon Doherty and Demi Moore 																								Pop tart Britney Spears is single again after a wild weekend that could only have happened in Las Vegas, where she wed her childhood pal in a madcap ceremony perfectly scripted for Hollywood lore. 																								Although the marriage to Jason Allen Alexander was annulled yesterday just 36 hours after saying I do (a statement issued by her record label, Jive Records, claimed the whole thing was a joke that went too far), its a relief to see the tradition of the quickie celebrity wedding is still intact. 																								Spears, reportedly wearing torn jeans and a baseball cap, and Alexander, both 22, were married at about 5 am on Saturday at the Little White Wedding Chapel, an establishment that boasts a tribute to Elvis package and a drive-through chapel. Its where Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, and Michael Jordan and Juanita Vanoy also got hitched. When impetuous celebrities are looking to elope, Sin City  the nexus of a million lifetimes of bad decisions  is all too happy to oblige. The Clark County Marriage Licence Bureau distributes more than 120,000 licences annually at $55 each. 																								There is no blood test required, no waiting period, and the licence bureau is open 24 hours on weekends and holidays, and till midnight on weekdays.																								For ceremonies, there are roughly 350 places to choose from, ranging from a replica of the Sistine Chapel to Victorian garden chapels. 																								Historically, the marriage and divorce rackets in Las Vegas were a function of the fact that the state had no other source of revenue, according to Hal Rothman, chairman of the history department at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 																								Vegas remains a popular destination for famous couples looking to tie the knot in a hurry as celebrities are not subject to the same kind of pressure as they are in other cities. They can go to clubs. People are used to them, he said. No wonder they get married here. 																								Perhaps Spears and Alexander have seen one too many episodes of Friends. 																								Spears and Alexanders day-and-a-half marriage now takes its place in a long line of short-lived celebrity unions. 																								A night of boozing and gambling put basketball bad boy Dennis Rodman and Baywatch babe Carmen Electra in the mood for matrimony in 1998, when they tied the knot at the Little Chapel of the Flowers. 																								Just nine days later, Rodman was trying to wiggle his way out of it by seeking an annulment. (Instead, they had to remain Mr and Mrs another five months, when they divorced.) 																								But theirs was a matrimonial marathon compared with Zsa Zsa Gabors 24-hour marriage in 1982 to her seventh husband, Felipe de Alba, a Mexican lawyer. 																								Mike Tysons ex-wife Robin Givens ended her marriage to Yugoslav tennis star Svetozar Marinkovic in 1997 after one day, although the groom told the media at the time that it was really more like seven hours. 																								After actor Dennis Hopper exchanged vows with Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas fame in 1970, in Taos, New Mexico, they enjoyed wedded bliss for all of eight days. 																								In 1994 at age 19, Drew Barrymore proposed to bar owner Jeremy Thomas in an alley and married him three weeks later in Hollywood. 																								The marriage lasted just six weeks. Her second attempt, with comedian Tom Green in Malibu, California, lasted a whopping five months. In 1993, with two broken engagements in two years, Shannon Doherty, then 22, wed George Hamiltons son, Ashley, 18, at her Santa Monica, California house. She wore a silk nightgown and walked down a backyard aisle. 																								For their honeymoon, the couple flew to New York, where the Beverly Hills, 90210 bad girl hosted Saturday Night Live.																								Five months later, she handed Hamilton his walking papers. A subsequent quickie wedding to Rick Solomon in Vegas (yes, the same Rick Solomon who was involved with Paris Hilton in the infamous sex tape) lasted nine months. Speaking of Paris Hilton, word has it that Spears has been showing friends her wedding video. Can an Internet download be far behind? 					 LOS ANGELES TIMES- WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

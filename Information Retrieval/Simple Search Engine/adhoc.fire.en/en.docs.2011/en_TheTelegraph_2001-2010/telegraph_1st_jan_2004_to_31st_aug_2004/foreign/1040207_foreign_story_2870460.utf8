 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 UN finds a friend in Barrymore 
				 	 Drew Barrymore																								United Nations, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Actress Drew Barrymore yesterday became the first person to be named A Friend of the UN by a new organization called Artists for the UN.																								We wake up every morning thinking, like, what more can we do in this world to make it a better, happier, more peaceful and beautiful place, Barrymore told a standing-room-only crowd at a UN news conference. 																								Artists for the UN, a partnership between the UN and Global Vision for Peace, hopes to encourage artists to support the ideals, vision and mandate of the UN in seeking global solutions to world problems, say organisers. As part of its programme, 30 to 40 actors and entertainment executives will wear a Dove of Peace pin to the February 29 telecast of this years Academy Awards, organizers said.																								To be philanthropic is weirdly not as easy as you want it to be because the information and the resources arent as available as they should be. So when you do get an opportunity, it is so exciting, because it is not a day wasted, its a day when you actually did something important and it feels bigger than you, she said.

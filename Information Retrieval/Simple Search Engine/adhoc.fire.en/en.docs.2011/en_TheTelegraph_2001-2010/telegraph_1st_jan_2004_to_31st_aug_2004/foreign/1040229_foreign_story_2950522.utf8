 Sunday, February 29, 2004 				 Iraq to miss constitution deadline
																								Baghdad, Feb. 28 (Reuters): Iraqs governing council looked almost sure to miss a midnight deadline to approve an interim constitution today, but could reach agreement within a day or two, officials in the US-led administration said.																								Under a US-Iraqi plan agreed in November, a transitional constitution was to have been completed by February 28. Wrangles over the role of Islam and Kurdish demands for autonomy have so far prevented a deal.																								A brief delay is unlikely to affect a June 30 deadline for the handover of sovereignty to an Iraqi government, but the disagreements illustrate problems that could lie ahead as Iraqis struggle to organise elections by the end of the year as the countrys top Shia cleric has demanded. Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish independent, said many issues remained to be resolved and debate had been heated.																								He said he favoured allowing more time if that meant a satisfactory overall deal could be reached, rather than meeting the deadline by announcing an agreement in principle that would defer the toughest issues, as some Council members had proposed.																								This is a law, it is not a political communique, Othman told Reuters.The law should be announced only when all issues are settled, when the document is complete and written in a way that there arent any mistakes.																								He said the Council might decide to give a progress report later on Saturday, but gave no indication of when negotiations might be concluded.If we have to work through the night to reach an agreement, then we are ready to do that, he said. SHIITES RETURN AFTER  WALKOUT																								Council members said some Shiite participants left the negotiating table on Friday after the cancellation of a previous Governing Council decree giving religious law precedence in divorce, inheritance and otherpersonal status issues.																								They rejoined discussions on Saturday, and a full session of the Governing Council was under way in the evening after talks among smaller groups earlier in the day.																								Today they were forced to come back and make the climate better, said Rowsch Shways, who represents Kurdish Council member Masoud Barzani in talks on the constitution.																								Shways said the Kurds wanted the constitution to reflect the democratic and secular nature of the future Iraq  putting them at odds with some Shiites in the Council who want guarantees about the status and role of Islam.																								Another controversial issue is the extent of Kurdish autonomy. Shways said the Council would agree a document which included guarantees on Kurdish self-rule.																								There will be paragraphs on the fact that the Kurdistan regional government with its parliament and judiciary will be recognised as the government of Iraqi Kurdistan and will continue to exist and exert its authority in local matters, Shways said. Some Arabs view such a prospect with alarm.																								Any lengthy delay in agreeing an interim constitution would deal yet another blow to U.S. plans to hand sovereignty to Iraqis on schedule, well ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.																								The United States has received U.. backing for its view that proper elections cannot be held before the handover. It has said it will be flexible on the details of the transition that will end its formal occupation of Iraq, but not on the date.																								Council members and officials of the U.S.-led occupation authority suggest the only quick way to conclude an interim constitution that gives some guidelines for the next government may be to agree to disagree on details of some issues.																								That would leave the thorniest ones to be hammered out by the parties in the writing of a permanent constitution after elections due next year, according to the original U.S. plan.

 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 More Sars cases to emerge, says WHO
																								Guangzhou, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Many more suspected Sars cases are likely to emerge because the symptoms match those of common winter diseases, the World Health Organisation said today as it investigated the latest case to surface in China.																								A 20-year-old waitress in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, is suspected of having deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Her case surfaced days after China confirmed its first Sars infection since last year.																								Health authorities have been worrying for months about the reappearance of Sars this winter. The disease has the same symptoms, including a relentless fever and dry cough, as several other respiratory diseases.																								Some of these diseases may also give rise to atypical pneumonia. It is likely that numerous other suspected (Sars) cases will be reported over the coming weeks, the WHO said on its web site.																								The WHO has sent a team of four doctors to Guangzhou to investigate the disease, particularly its transmission. A spokesman said their investigation would be sweeping, with all possibilities considered.																								Were on alert anyway, team spokesman Roy Wadia said today .You get one case and you have to keep watching out for possible others. Sars first appeared in southern China in late 2002 and killed about 800 people worldwide last year, nearly 350 of them in China.																								A Guangzhou health expert said he did not believe Sars would re-emerge on the scale of last year. 																								I do not think the confirmed case means that Sars will return on a large scale, Zhong Nanshan, head of the Guangzhou Respiratory Illness Research Institute, said. To say it will trigger the huge spread of SARS is absurd.

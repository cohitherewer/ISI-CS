 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Pak row over honour killings
 Assembly split over tribal custom																								Islamabad, July 23 (Reuters): A heated row in Pakistans parliament over honour killings this week underlined the difficulty the government faces in changing attitudes to a crime steeped in tribal customs and dating back centuries.																								The National Assemblys session was suspended after a woman lawmaker denounced the often unpunished practice of murdering someone who brings shame to the family, a statement which drew an angry response from a male deputy who defended the custom.																								Kashmala Tariq spoke out in support of love matches, after a couple was threatened with death by relatives incensed over their decision not to agree to arranged marriages. How can they stop a couple marrying of their own free will when Islam permits them? she asked.																								But Sardar Salim Jan Mazari, a member from Jacobabad in the southern province of Sindh, appeared to defend honour killings.																								We should respect cultural traditions of our society before making any laws to check such killings in the country, he said, sparking fury among women and liberals but drawing cheers from members of the conservative Islamic Opposition.																								While defending his remarks, he said yesterday he did not mean to condone honour killings. I would never encourage any kind of murder, whether it is an honour killing or over land, he said. These traditions need to be changed, but how? Through education and public awareness. But the brutal practice does have a role to play, he said. The tribal custom came into being centuries ago to put a check on adultery and to protect the weak against the stronger and wealthy																								In the latest incident of honour killings, 15-year-old Zakia was hacked to death on Wednesday by two brothers in Punjab when they discovered she was having a relationship with her cousin, Khadim Hussain.																								In another case, two doctors from the southern province of Sindh who married after falling in love have moved to Islamabad to escape relatives who vowed to kill them. When the couple visited Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain last weekend, he repeated promises to introduce laws to check the practice, but set no date.

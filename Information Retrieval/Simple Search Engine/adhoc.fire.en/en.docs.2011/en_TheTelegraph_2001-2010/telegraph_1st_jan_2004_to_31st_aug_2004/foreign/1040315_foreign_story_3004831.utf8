 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Labour in unity attempt
																								Manchester, March 14 (Reuters): Britains ruling Labour party showed this weekend it may be ready to unite behind leader Tony Blair and bury differences over the Iraq war ahead of June local elections and a bid for a third term next year.																								In an attempt to revive popular support, Labours leading figures moved to steer debate at the partys spring conference away from Iraq and onto domestic issues, including public service reform and economic progress.																								The Iraq war, deeply unpopular here, left Blair with battered personal trust ratings in opinion polls and opened divisions within the party and several high-level resignations.																								Lets be the first generation of Labour people who refuse to tear themselves apart and by default saddle the British people with yet another Tory (conservative) government, deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told the conference today.																								Many of the 2,500 delegates in Manchester, chastened by the emergence of a stronger Conservative Opposition leader in Michael Howard, heeded the call.																								There is a commitment to unite, people can see the difference between dialogue and fracas and they want to have a dialogue, said junior government minister David Miliband.

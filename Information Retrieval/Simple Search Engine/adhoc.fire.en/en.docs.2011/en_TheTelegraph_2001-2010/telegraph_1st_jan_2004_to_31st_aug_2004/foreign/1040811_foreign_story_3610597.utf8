The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Old faces pack new Singapore govt
				 	 Goh Chok Tong																								Singapore, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Lee Hsien Loong, Singapores Prime Minister-designate, today appointed a new government of mostly old faces to tackle pressing problems ranging from a low birth rate to the loss of jobs to fast-growing China.																								His 80-year-old father, founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, stays in the cabinet with a new title of minister mentor while outgoing Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will take his place as senior minister  the number two position of power  while also heading the Central Bank.																								The reshuffle mostly swaps existing ministers around without drawing on much new blood, surprising many political analysts and economists who had expected the 52-year-old Lee to usher in a new generation of younger leaders. Lee, who will be sworn in as leader on Thursday, remains finance minister.																								There are no key changes in the ministries at all. There is a lot of continuity in the change of power. So there will be continuity in policy, said Nizam Idris, an economist at consultancy IDEAGlobal.com. It is so uneventful.																								The elder Lee, who spearheaded Singapores separation from Malaysia in 1965 and steered the nation from post-colonial backwater to regional dynamo in a generation, has insisted that his sons political rise was based on merit, not nepotism.																								The son was formally invited by President S.R. Nathan to head the next government at a meeting today after Goh submitted his cabinets resignation. The President has accepted the resignations which will take effect immediately before the new Prime Minister is appointed on August 12, a statement from the Prime Ministers office said.																								The reshuffle marks one of the final steps in an elaborately scripted succession that has been expected since Goh became Prime Minister and Lee his deputy in 1990.

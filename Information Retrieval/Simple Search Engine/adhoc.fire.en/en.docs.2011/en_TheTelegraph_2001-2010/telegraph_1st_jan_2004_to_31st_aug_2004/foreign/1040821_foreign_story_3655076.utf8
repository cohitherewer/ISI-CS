 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Kennedy or George, US wont take a chance
				 	 Ted Kennedy																								Washington, Aug. 20 (Reuters): Senator Ted Kennedy, the archetypal liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, is often called names by Republicans. But until this year he had never been viewed as a threat to US air travel.																								Kennedy  one of the most recognisable figures in American politics  told a Senate committee hearing yesterday he had been blocked several times from boarding commercial airline flights because his name was on a no-fly list intended to exclude potential terrorists.																								(The revelation will carry a familiar ring for George Fernandes, who was strip-searched in an American airport when he was Indias defence minister.) 																								Kennedy was eventually allowed on the flights, but it took numerous calls to clear up the mistake and get his name off the list. Noting it had taken him weeks to resolve the matter, Kennedy wondered aloud how difficult it might be for ordinary Americans to have their names removed if they were also mistakenly placed on the watch list.																								A Kennedy spokesman said the whole thing had resulted from a simple error and had not been politically motivated. Homeland security secretary Tom Ridge called Kennedy to make sure that the situation was remedied.Pork problem																								Muslim inmates, including terror suspects, at a UK jail are refusing to eat meat after receiving a menu with pork,																								The prison service acknowledged there had been a mistake in the labelling of food as Halal, or suitable for Muslims, at Londons Belmarsh prison last month. It said the problem had been fixed and the prison governor had apologised to the prisoners.

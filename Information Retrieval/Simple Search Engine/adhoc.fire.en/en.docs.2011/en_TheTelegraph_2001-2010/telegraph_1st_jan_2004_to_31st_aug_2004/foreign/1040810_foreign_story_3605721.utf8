 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Saddam trial twist in warrants for Chalabis
 Salem (top) and Ahmad  Chalabi 																								Baghdad, Aug. 9 (Reuters): A US-appointed Iraqi judge said yesterday he had issued an arrest warrant for leading Iraqi politician Ahmad Chalabi and his nephew, who is heading the tribunal trying former President Saddam Hussein.																								Chalabi, a former darling of the Pentagon who helped lead the US into war in Iraq, said he would fight the charges against him which he described as outrageous.																								Zuhair al-Maliki, chief investigative judge of the Central Criminal Court of Iraq, said an arrest warrant had been issued against Ahmad Chalabi in connection with counterfeiting money and against Salem Chalabi for playing a role in the murder of a finance ministry official. 																								Ahmad Chalabi, a former head of Iraqs previous governing council, said he and his nephew had only heard of the charges through the media and that they were politically motivated.																								There is no case here and I will go to meet those charges head on, he told CNN, speaking from Tehran. I have been fighting Saddam for many years and we survived that and we are certainly not going to be intimidated by this judge ...																								He said he had grave reservations about the court, but added: Nobody is above the law and I am certainly not.																								The former exile is the head of the Iraqi National Congress and was once seen as a potential Iraqi leader. But he has fallen from favour in recent months, spurned by Washington and many in the new Iraqi government.																								Salem Chalabi, a lawyer, is leading the work of the Iraqi Special Tribunal which will try Saddam Hussein, caught last year by US troops.																								He told CNN the charges appeared to be very strange.																								The one against my uncle seems very weird because it has to do with counterfeit money and I was told that when they raided his house a couple of months ago they found the equivalent of a few dollars in counterfeit money that he was given as head of the financial committee of the governing council, he said.																								The warrant for me has to do with the fact that apparently I threatened somebody, I have no recollection of ever meeting that person, but apparently I threatened somebody who subsequently was killed ....																								He said today the murder charges against him were aimed at undermining the trial of the former dictator.																								The fact that it was leaked means there was some element of a smear campaign against me, and therefore against the tribunal, trying to discredit the tribunal, which I think has happened now, he said. 																								Thats what is troubling me. I want to go back and continue the work. There are a large number of staff still working, trying to do the investigations. But under these kind of allegations it makes it more difficult.																								Chalabi, on a private visit to London, said he was in contact with Iraqi officials, but was worried for his safety if he were jailed. I plan on returning. I just want to get assurances that I will not be killed in jail or anything.																								London said Iraqi authorities had not approached the government about possible extradition proceedings.																								Whatever the case, the arrest warrant is likely to hand political ammunition to hardcore supporters of Saddam, who have described the special tribunal as a show trial.																								The murder charges throw a bizarre twist into Saddams trial, seen as a chance for Iraqis to put decades of torture and murder of thousands behind them. Saddam is expected to face trial on charges of crimes against humanity.																								They will also complicate the task of a court faced with the painstaking challenge of proving a chain of command between Saddam and agents accused of crimes ranging from chemical attacks to torture. Iraqi commentators and lawyers said today even though Chalabi was only the administrator of the Special Iraqi Tribunal and not a judge, the arrest warrant could be damaging because he has been the public face of efforts to try Saddam.																								This will have a deep psychological and social impact on the trial. All supporters of Saddam will now ask how can he have a fair trial if the chief administrator of the court is charged with murder, said Sadoun al-Dulaimi, director of the Iraq Centre for Research and Strategic Studies.

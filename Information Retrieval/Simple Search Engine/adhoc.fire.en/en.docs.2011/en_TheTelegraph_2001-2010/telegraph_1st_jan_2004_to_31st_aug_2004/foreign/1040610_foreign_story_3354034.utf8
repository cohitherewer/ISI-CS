 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Militants planned raid on Nato hub: Paper
																								Milan, June 9 (Reuters): A group of suspected Islamic militants arrested in Italy and Belgium may have been planning an attack on Nato headquarters or the European Parliament, Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said today.																								According to an Italian detention warrant seen by Reuters today, the militants appeared to have been planning a suicide attack in Paris. The 27-page warrant includes transcribed telephone conversations in which the suspects discussed the Paris metro system, security arrangements and a martyr referred to as Mohammed.																								Quoting Italian investigators, Corriere said a suspected planner of the Madrid bombings in March  among those arrested yesterday  had intended to travel from Italy to Belgium possibly to take part in an attack on a symbolic target.																								Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, known as Mohamed the Egyptian, was seized yesterday with a fellow suspect in Milan, and Belgian police, acting on information from Italy, arrested 15 people they said had been gearing up for an attack. Italian interior minister Giuseppe Pisanu said yesterday that Ahmed was part of a dangerous group of terrorists close to al Qaida which had been planning attacks.																								Corriere said Italian investigators believed the symbolic target might have been the headquarters of Nato in Brussels or the European Parliament, which has its main building in Strasbourg, France, and offices in Brussels. Investigators in Milan and Brussels were not available for comment. A spokesman for the US-dominated Nato alliance declined to comment on the Corriere report.																								The safety of this headquarters is ensured by the Belgian authorities, not by Nato, he said. If they have any information that there is a higher risk then they would warn Nato and Nato security measures would be upgraded appropriately. 																								The newspaper quoted Belgian prosecutor Daniel Bernard as saying he believed the suspects arrested in Belgium were probably planning an attack outside the country.																								Corriere published excerpts from telephone conversations intercepted by police in which Ahmed purportedly urged others to carry out suicide attacks and claimed responsibility for organising the Madrid train bombings which killed 191 people. Cologne blast																								A suspected bomb exploded in a residential building in Cologne today, injuring at least 17 people, one of them critically, emergency services said. Authorities said they could not rule out a terrorist link to the explosion in the citys Muelheim district, which has a large Turkish population. However, motives might be found in other areas, such as organised crime.

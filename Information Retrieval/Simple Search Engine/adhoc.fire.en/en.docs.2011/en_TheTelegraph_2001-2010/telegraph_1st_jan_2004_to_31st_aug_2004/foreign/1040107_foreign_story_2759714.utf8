 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Assad defends arms build-up
 BENEDICT BROGAN 				 	 Bashar Assad																								Damascus, Jan. 6: Syria is entitled to defend itself by acquiring its own chemical and biological deterrent, President Bashar Assad said last night as he rejected American and British demands for concessions on weapons of mass destruction.																								In his first major statement since Libyas decision last month to scrap its nuclear and chemical programmes, he came closer than ever before to admitting that his country possessed stockpiles of WMD. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Assad said that any deal to destroy Syrias chemical and biological capability would come about only if Israel agreed to abandon its undeclared nuclear arsenal.																								Since the capture of Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafis decision to dismantle his WMD programme, Assad has risen towards the top of Americas target list.																								The White House and Downing Street have been waiting for his response to Gaddafis appeal for other Arab leaders to follow his example or risk inflicting a tragedy on their people.																								President Assad spoke for more than 90 minutes at his discreet villa, which he prefers to the grand palace overlooking Damascus built by his father, the late Hafez Assad. Asked about American and British claims that Syria had a WMD capability, he stopped short of the categorical denial that has been his governments stock response until now. Instead, he pointed to the Israelis recent attack on alleged Palestinian bases in Syria and the occupation of the Golan Heights as evidence that Syria needed a deterrent. We are a country which is [partly] occupied and from time to time we are exposed to Israeli aggression, he said. It is natural for us to look for means to defend ourselves. It is not difficult to get most of these weapons anywhere in the world and they can be obtained at any time.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

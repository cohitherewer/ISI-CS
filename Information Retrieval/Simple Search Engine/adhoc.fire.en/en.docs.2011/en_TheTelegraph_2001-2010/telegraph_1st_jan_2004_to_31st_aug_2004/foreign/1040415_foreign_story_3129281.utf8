 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Tigers on the prowl for Karuna
																								Colombo, April 14 (PTI): Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka have launched a search for renegade commander V. Muralitharan, who was forced to flee after losing his territory to the main rebel group in a four-day internecine war that ended on Monday.																								The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are searching the eastern district of Batticaloa where Muralitharan, also known as Karuna, mounted a mutiny, but was unable to face the onslaught of the main rebel group. 																								There was no trace of Karuna, who had ordered his band of 5,000-6,000 fighters to disperse as the LTTEs fighters cornered the renegade group over the weekend, a pro-rebel website said.

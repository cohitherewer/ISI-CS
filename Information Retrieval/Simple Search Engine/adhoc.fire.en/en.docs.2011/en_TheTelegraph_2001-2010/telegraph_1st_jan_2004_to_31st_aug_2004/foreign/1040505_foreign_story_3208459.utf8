 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Worm weaves its way across the Internet
																								London/New York, May 4 (Reuters): The rapidly evolving Sasser computer worm tore across the Internet today, claiming new scalps among corporate and home computer users as others scrambled to fortify their machines against attack.																								First detected over the weekend, the worm has already infected, by some estimates, over one million PCs running on Microsoft Windows 2000, NT and XP operating systems.																								Among its victims are banks, travel-booking systems, European Commission offices and Britains 19 Coastguard stations.																								Weve had to go back to plotting on paper charts rather than using the computer mapping system, said a Maritime and Coastguard spokeswoman. But search and rescue operations have not been affected.																								Unlike most previous Internet outbreaks, Sasser infects vulnerable PCs without any action by the user like opening attachments, allowing it to spread very quickly.																								Computer worms tend to spread faster than the typical e-mail borne virus as they are usually programmed to continuously scan the Internets global network to hunt for PCs to infect.																								Experts said while corporate network technicians had by and large moved to block its further spread by today, infection among home users was spreading.																								Among corporate computer users the impact has dropped off because network administrators have taken time to put patches in place, said Joe Hartmann, director of the virus research group for Trend Micro Inc. in Cupertino, California.																								Thats not true for many home computer users where this virus can spread exponentially, Hartmann said. I dont think this virus has reached its full potential yet.																								Businesses in parts of Europe returning from the long holiday weekend gave Sasser an extra boost today. 																								Its still going steady. It will be a big problem for a day or two, then it will linger on the Internet for weeks, and likely years, said Mikko Hypponen, anti-virus research director at Finnish data security firm F-Secure.																								We do know that once you connect a computer to the Internet you risk being hit in a matter of minutes, said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for anti-virus firm Sophos. Even a new computer you buy in the coming months is vulnerable to infection. This is a real nuisance.																								Home users would likely first notice an infection if their computer mysteriously rebooted or their Internet connection slowed dramatically. Security experts were warning users to update their PCs with the latest Microsoft patches and install a firewall to keep out future infections.																								In the space of three days, four variants have emerged, each capable of causing machines that run on Microsofts Windows operating systems XP, NT and 2000 to reboot without warning.																								Victims so far include Goldman Sachs, Australias Westpac Bank and Finnish financial copany Sampo. It has also hit about 300,000 computers at Germanys Deutsche Post and 1,200 PCs at the European Commission in Brussels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Munich tragedy soon to be film 
				 	 Steven Spielberg																								Los Angeles, April 22 (Reuters): Filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who won his first Oscar for the Holocaust drama Schindlers List, has taken on another tragic moment in modern Jewish history as his next project  the 1972 Munich Olympics.																								Spielberg plans to start production in June and is eyeing actor Ben Kingsley for a role in the upcoming drama, which will chronicle the Summer Games marred by the kidnapping and slaying of Israeli athletes by Palestinian militants, a DreamWorks studio spokeswoman said yesterday.																								In all, 11 Israelis lost their lives in the bloody 1972 tragedy, including nine hostages killed in a botched rescue attempt at a military air base outside Munich, all while Olympics officials carried on with the competition. Five of the gunmen and a German policeman also died. Three of the militants were captured alive.																								The spectre of the massacre 32 years ago has haunted authorities in Greece preparing security for the upcoming Summer Olympics in Athens amid heightened concerns of potential attacks by extremists linked to the al Qaida terror network.																								Details of the as-yet-untitled film have been kept shrouded in secrecy as Spielberg pins down European locations for the production, the studio spokeswoman said. She said the screenplay will be written by Eric Roth, who won an Oscar for his Forrest Gump script and was nominated for The Insider. 																								It was not clear what role Kingsley might take. He previously co-starred in Schindlers List, which earned Spielberg Academy Awards for best picture and best director. Spielberg won his second directing Oscar for the World War II film, Saving Private Ryan.

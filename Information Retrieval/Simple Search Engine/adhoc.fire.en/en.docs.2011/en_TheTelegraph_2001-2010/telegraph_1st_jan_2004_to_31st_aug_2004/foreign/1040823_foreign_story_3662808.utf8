 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Deng soccer kick to Jiang
 RICHARD SPENCER 				 	 An orchestra performs before a picture of Deng Xiaoping to mark his birth centenary on Sunday. (AFP)																								Beijing, Aug. 22: If you spent the summer of 1990 slumped in your armchair watching Lineker score and Gazza cry, you were not alone: so did the octogenarian leader of the biggest nation on earth.																								In a television interview to mark the 100th anniversary of Deng Xiaopings birth today, his younger sister, Xianqun, reveals that he managed to watch all but two of the 52 games in the World Cup finals in Italy that year.																								Even though China had failed to qualify, coming fourth behind South Korea and the United Arab Emirates during the group stages, Deng was a devoted spectator. 																								He watched some matches live on television, while others were recorded for the Chinese leader to watch later. His family were warned not to spoil the suspense by telling him the scores.																								Not surprisingly, Xianqun fails to mention that the World Cup took place 12 months after Chinas then paramount leader oversaw the Tiananmen Square massacre. Instead, she delicately says as Deng  who died in 1997  had by then retired from his formal political posts, he had more leisure time. He could then visit places as freely as he liked, she said. Whats more, he could spend more time watching football.																								A little incredulously, the interviewer asks if it was true that he had watched 50 of the 1990 World Cups 52 matches. Thats right, she says. He watched all the World Cup matches. Almost all.																								Deng Lin, Dengs eldest daughter, adds: He tried to watch them live. Those he could not, he asked Pufang (his son) to record. But he did not let us tell him the result, as it was less exciting if he knew the final score. Such homely touches offered by family members are a common feature of anniversary programmes on Chinese state media.																								The Dengs do not record for whom the patriarch cheered in Chinas absence, nor what he made of Stuart Pearces miss in Englands penalty shoot-out with Germany.																								Footballing favourites apart, experienced China hands believe that Deng Lins descriptions of her fathers behaviour in retirement are a coded rebuke of his successor, Jiang Zemin, whom the Deng family is known to dislike.																								She singles out Deng for praise for taking it easy after he retired, concentrating on his hobbies, and not interfering with politics. Although these comments are demonstrably untrue, they have nonetheless been interpreted as a criticism of Jiang Zemin.																								Jiang has formally retired from his civilian role as Communist Party leader, as Deng did in 1989, but is said to pull strings behind the scenes.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

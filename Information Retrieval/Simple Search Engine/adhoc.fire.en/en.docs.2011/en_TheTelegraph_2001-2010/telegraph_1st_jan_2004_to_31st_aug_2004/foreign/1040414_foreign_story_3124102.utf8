 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Pervez rejects call to stay on as army chief
				 	 Police take the captured militants to a Karachi court. (Reuters)																								Islamabad, April 13 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf today rejected a call from within his ruling coalition to stay on as head of the army despite a pledge to step down by the end of the year.																								Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, agreed last year to quit the army post by the end of 2004 in a deal with an Opposition Islamic alliance that will keep him in power as President until 2007.																								The deal, sealed by a constitutional amendment, ended a standoff with the Opposition that had virtually paralysed parliament after the October 2002 elections.																								A group made up of politicians who broke away from former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos party after the polls urged Musharraf, an important ally in the US-led war on terror, to review his decision. But information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said Musharraf would stand by his promise.																								I am speaking on behalf of the President, who has said that he will stand by the 17th Amendment, Ahmed said, referring to a constitutional provision that binds Musharraf to quit either as President or army chief by the end of 2004.																								The President has categorically said... he will retain one office by the end of December 2004, Ahmed said. Defence minister Rao Sikandar Iqbal and several other former allies of Bhutto met Musharraf yesterday and urged him not to stand down as army chief.																								Keeping in view the international situation, particularly the hunt against al Qaida, we think he should continue as chief of army staff, Iqbal said. Iqbals stance has drawn strong criticism from the Opposition. Ahmed quoted Musharraf as describing the debate as unnecessary and unfortunate.																								Analysts say a severing of Musharrafs links to the military could weaken his position at a time when he faces Opposition from Islamists over his support for the US-led war on terror and from secular parties angered about being shut out of politics.																								The Opposition earlier vowed to oppose any move by Musharraf to continue as head of the military.																								It is unconstitutional, said Liaquat Baluch, a leader of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal Islamic alliance. We will oppose it inside the parliament and will also put pressure from outside the parliament.  Militants arreste																								Pakistani police have arrested six Islamic militants in Karachi and seized weapons from them, including grenades, officials said today.																								The arrests were carried out yesterday evening during a raid in a southern neighbourhood of the city, Fayyaz Leghari, a deputy inspector general of police, said. Police seized hand grenades, automatic weapons and some bomb-making material, he said. These six men were the newly recruited volunteers, Leghari said.																								, adding the militants belong to the shadowy Harkat-ul Mujahideen al-Alami network, which is blamed by police for a number of high-profile terror attacks in Karachi.																								These attacks include a failed assassination bid on President Pervez Musharraf, a suicide attack outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi that killed 12 Pakistanis and a similar suicide assault killing 11 French nationals -- all in 2002.

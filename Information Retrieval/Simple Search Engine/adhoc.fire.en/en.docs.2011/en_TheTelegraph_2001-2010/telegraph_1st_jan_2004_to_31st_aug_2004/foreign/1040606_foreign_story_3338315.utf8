																								Washington, June 5 (Reuters): Poor memory and brain function is an important but overlooked side effect of diabetes, but controlling blood sugar helps, researchers said today.																								Patients with type-2 diabetes are likely to have trouble remembering, multi-tasking and learning new things, said Dr Richard Nesto, chairman of Cardiovascular Medicine Department, at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Massachusetts.																								Cognitive decline is often a precursor to Alzheimers disease and other types of dementia, and even mild cognitive impairment can negatively impact learning and memory and may impact the ability to perform learning tasks efficiently, Nesto said.																								Dr Christopher Ryan, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh and Dr Mark Strachan of Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, Britain, tested a group of diabetic patients and found that controlling their blood sugar with drugs helped considerably. 																								They found 141 volunteers with an average age of 60 who had type-2 diabetes but no other serious medical issues. 																								All took drugs such as metformin to help control their blood sugar.

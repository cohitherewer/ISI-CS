(Reuters) 																								Rome, May 17 (Reuters): A star-studded cast assembled by We Are the World producer Quincy Jones rocked Romes ancient chariot track yesterday in a concert to raise money for children in war-scarred cities.																								Nearly 20 years after recording his hit charity album, Jones hopes his latest venture, broadcast live on the Internet, will jog the global conscience.																								We all know the world is a total mess at the moment and doing nothing is not an option, Jones told hundreds of thousands of fans as dusk fell over Romes Circus Maximus.																								Were asking you to be in the army of right and goodwill to help these kids get on their feet and create a life that is worth living, he said, before making way for Iraqi singer Kazem Al Sahir to set the tone for the multi-ethnic, four-hour show. Among other performers lined up for the concert were Carlos Santana, Alicia Keys, Norah Jones, Herbie Hancock, tenor Andrea Bocelli and the cast of the musical stage show Stomp.																								Oprah Winfrey and Naomi Campbell helped compere proceedings along with sports stars such as Brazilian soccer great Pele and former boxing heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield. Organisers hope the concert will raise up to $10 million through sponsorship, music sales and charitable donations  money that will be used to finance the children centres.																								But its not just about money and its not just about a concert either. The concert is... a global outcry, its a scream, you know, to pay attention, Jones told Reuters Television in a recent interview. The child centres are the brain child of the Glocal Forum  an organisation created three years ago to forge grassroots links between world cities that circumvent national governments.																								The first child centre has already opened in Kigali, Rwanda, and the others are due to start later this year in Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Afghanistan and the West Bank.																								Uri Savir, a chief negotiator for the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo peace accords and a leading light in the Glocal Forum, says first world cities will be twinned with the six cities in developing countries to help them overcome their turbulent past.																								There is no guarantee that the Global Forum is going to succeed but everything else is failing so badly its worth a go, Savir said. Yesterdays open air concert will raise the groups profile, and Savir hopes a single unveiled during the event will have the same success as the 1985 hit We Are the World.																								That song was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and recorded by them and 40 other performers including Bruce Springsteen, Tina Turner and Billy Joel. None of those names appeared on yesterdays bill in an apparently conscious effort to break with the past.																								Everybody says lets do another We are the World, Jones said. Im not interested in that because its just repetition, so you try to find something which is different and which has more impact. The concert was broadcast live on Italian MTV and will then be screened at a later date in 42 other countries.

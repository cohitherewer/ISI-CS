																								Paris, July 4 (Reuters): Libyan secret services have found a desert operations camp belonging to an al Qaida-linked group called the GSPC after intercepting members of the group near the border with Chad, a French newspaper said today.

The French newspaper said that the GSPC  the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat  was recruiting actively in the Tibesti region and buying arms and vehicles with German ransom money paid for the release of tourists in the Sahara in 2003. The GSPC, whose acronym is based on the French spelling of its name, is a militant group founded in 1998 in Algeria.

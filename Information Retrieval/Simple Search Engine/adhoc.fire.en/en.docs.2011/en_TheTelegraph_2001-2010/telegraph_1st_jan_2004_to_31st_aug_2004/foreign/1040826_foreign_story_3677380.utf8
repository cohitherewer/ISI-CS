(Reuters)																								Najaf, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Iraqs top Shia cleric made a sudden return to the country today and said he had a plan to end an uprising in the burning city of Najaf, where fighting is creeping ever closer to its holiest shrine.																								Aides to Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said the cleric, the most powerful voice of moderation in the tormented country, would unveil an initiative to get Shia rebels out of the Imam Ali mosque. They gave no details.																								Sistani also called for Iraqis to march on Najaf, something that could escalate passions among majority Shias. Sistani arrived in the southern city of Basra from Kuwait, having undergone heart treatment in London for three weeks. Tomorrow he plans to head to Najaf, his adopted home. His return came as US and Iraqi forces tightened their grip around Mehdi Army militants loyal to radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr holed up in the mosque, advancing to within 300 metres of the rebel-held shrine.																								We ask all believers to volunteer to go with us to Najaf, Sistani said in a statement read out on his behalf in Basra by his aide Hayder al-Safi.I have come for the sake of Najaf and I will stay in Najaf until the crisis ends.																								Sistanis aides said he would depart for Najaf at 0300 GMT tomorrow with his supporters. They urged US forces encircling the gold-domed mosque to leave.																								Sistani, 73, reached Basra from Kuwait in a convoy of more than a dozen vehicles led by police cars with sirens wailing. His hospitalisation in London coincided with the outbreak of the three-week revolt by Sadr, a young cleric who has challenged the collegiate leadership of the Najaf clergy headed by Sistani.

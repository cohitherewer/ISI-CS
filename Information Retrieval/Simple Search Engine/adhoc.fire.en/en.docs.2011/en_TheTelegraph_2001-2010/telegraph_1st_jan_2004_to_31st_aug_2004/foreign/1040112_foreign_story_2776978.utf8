 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Brazil fingerprints
																								Rio de Janeiro, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Brazil said yesterday that it would continue fingerprinting and photographing US visitors for at least 30 days in retaliation for new US anti-terrorism controls.																								The foreign ministry said in a statement that the government has approved a measure, to be published tomorrow, that will keep the security system in place while a government panel reviews immigration rules. The move comes three days before Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and President George W. Bush discuss the issue at a regional meeting in Mexico.																								We respect and understand the US security problems, but we must find a solution that also respects the dignified treatment of citizens from all countries, Brazils foreign minister Celso Amorim said before meeting President Lula in Brasilia.																								The US on January 5 started fingerprinting and photographing visitors including Brazilians who need visas to enter the country. It exempts citizens of 27 mainly European nations who do not need visas for short trips.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, January 22, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Beer battle																																	 Moscow, Jan. 21 (Reuters): Russia has sent in the army to bolster a week-long struggle to rescue 10 tonnes of beer trapped under Siberian ice, Itar-Tass news agency said yesterday. 																																	A lorry carrying the beer sank when trying to cross the frozen Irtysh river. A rescue team of six divers, 10 workers and a modified T-72 tank from the emergencies ministry have so far failed to save the load.																																	Temperatures were around minus 27 degrees Celsius in the region, near the Siberian city of Omsk and around 2,200 km from Moscow. A week-long effort to cut a 100-metre corridor to the river bank to pull the truck to dry land failed when the vehicle was swept away from the rescue site, Tass said.																						But it said the soldiers were confident it would take them just a day to retrieve the beer.																													 																Thief trick Berlin (Reuters): A crafty German thief  escaped police after his arrest by faking a heart attack  and fleeing when his handcuffs were removed for treatment,  authorities in Duesseldorf said on Wednesday. He started  complaining of chest pains in custody and said he was having  a heart attack, a police spokeswoman said. It seems he  gave quite a convincing performance, and you cant be too  careful in these situations. The 40-year-olds condition  improved dramatically as soon as his hands were freed for  a scan in hospital and he ran half naked to the nearest  emergency exit.

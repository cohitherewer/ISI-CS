 IRENE ZOECH																								Two heavy snorers desperate to improve their sleep  and their partners lives  have undergone pioneering surgery in a Viennese hospital to have their tongues tethered to their lower jaw.																								One of the patients, Regine Kotsis, 50, had suffered disrupted sleep for five years as the result of chronic sleep apnoea syndrome, in which the soft parts of the throat move and restrict breathing. Because her sleep was constantly disrupted, she felt tired and irritable during the day and her work suffered. A few days after the operation, however, she already feels better.																								Although the wound has not entirely healed yet, I notice a difference, Kotsis, a shoe-shop manager, said. I feel much more relaxed in the mornings. For the first time in a long time I have slept well and deeply again. I still have a few problems speaking but that is passing and eventually, I am told, it will be back to normal.																								Dr Michael Arnoldner, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Viennas Wilhelminen Hospital who performed the operation, described it as a minor procedure. The operation isnt a big deal. It takes about one hour but enhances the patients quality of life considerably, he said.																								A nylon thread is inserted through a patients tongue from one side to the other, and another thread is placed around the tongue bone  which is actually a U-shaped bone lying between the mandible (jaw) and the larynx.																								Both threads are then attached to a titanium screw only 1 mm in diameter and 4 mm in length. This screw is fixed in the lower jaw. The threads are tightened in such a way that the tongue is in the right place to tackle sleep apnoea syndrome.																								The hospital has now been bombarded by other snorers seeking help for their condition. Several are lined up for surgery this week. While most adults snore occasionally, chronic snorers sleep for an average of only four hours a night. Sufferers of obstructive sleep apnoea can stop breathing up to 30 times an hour, leading to serious respiratory problems. In the UK an estimated 3.5 million people have the condition.																								Sufferers wake up not only feeling tired but also facing a range of related health problems. A reduction in blood oxygen levels pumped to tissue in obstructive sleep apnoea sufferers can lead to high blood pressure and cause a strain on the heart, Dr Arnoldner said.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Brazil treads on US fingers
 Brasilia, Jan. 6 (Reuters):  A Brazilian federal judges order to fingerprint US visitors  in retaliation for new American anti-terrorism controls  is popular on the nations streets but is straining diplomatic  relations with the US.																								Brazils Centre-Left government, while not shy of confrontations with Washington, met yesterday to consider revoking the order by federal judge Julier Sebastiao da Silva after receiving complaints from the US state department.																								Ordinary Brazilians, tired of struggling for visas to enter the US and tough checks when they arrive, supported the order to reciprocate a new US system to fingerprint and photograph visitors who need a visa to enter the US.																								One newspaper survey showed 98 per cent in favour of the identical controls on US visitors, which began on January 1.																								After a successful 2003 White House meeting with President George W. Bush, and advances in global trade talks, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has signalled he may not want to waste bargaining power on the issue. We are looking at the consequences of this order, said a foreign ministry spokesman, adding that the government could appeal the ruling in Brazils justice system.																								The US has cheered Brazils new role as a leader of poor nations, even though Lulas one-year-old government is leading them in a fight against American farm trade barriers.																								Indeed, former factory worker Lula was welcomed at the White House for his push to cut global hunger, even though he says the world must fight terrorism with food, rather than bullets  a subtle criticism of the US war on terror. 																								Washington has been upset by Brazils tit-for-tat reaction to the US-VISIT system that went into force yesterday with digital technology after a year of preparation. US travellers have complained of up to nine-hour delays at Rio de Janeiro airport where Brazilian immigration authorities, only told of the order last week, are using inkpads and paper.																								We regret the way in which new procedures have suddenly been put in place that single out US citizens, said a statement by the US embassy in Brazil. Brazil is not being singled out.																								Brazils government has tried to make it clear the move to fingerprint and photograph all US visitors is the decision of a 34-year-old regional federal judge, not foreign policy.

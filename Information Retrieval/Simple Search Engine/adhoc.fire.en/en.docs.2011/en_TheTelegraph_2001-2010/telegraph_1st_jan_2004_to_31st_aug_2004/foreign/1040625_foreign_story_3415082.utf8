				 	 George W. Bush: Turk trauma																								Istanbul, June 24 (Reuters): Bombs exploded in Turkeys two main cities today before a visit by President George W. Bush to Ankara and a Nato summit in Istanbul, killing three people and injuring at least 18 others.																								The White House said there would be no change to Bushs schedule despite the blasts.																								Istanbul governor Muammer Guler said the bomber in the commercial capital of Istanbul was a woman carrying the device in her lap when it exploded on board a bus outside a hospital in the mainly residential Fatih district. The bus was not the target. The bomb was being carried from one place to another... We suspect a Marxist-Leninist group.																								The blast killed three people, including the bomber, and injured 15, said surgeon Korhan Taviloglu at the hospital treating casualties.																								Police detained three suspects in connection with the bus explosion, the state-run Anatolian news agency said, adding the two men and a woman were believed to have been aboard the bus when the explosion occurred.																								A small explosive device went off earlier today outside the Hilton Hotel in Ankara where Bush is due to stay on Saturday before he leaves on Sunday for Istanbul.																								A leftist group called MLKP-FESK claimed responsibility for the explosion, one television station said. Ankara police chief Ercument Yilmaz told CNN Turk two policemen and an unidentified third person were injured in that blast.																								The Istanbul explosion exacerbated security concerns in financial markets, sending the dollar reeling against the Swiss franc and boosting demand for safe-haven government bonds.																								The Turkish government, which hosts the Nato summit in Istanbul on June 28-29, offered swift reassurance after the Ankara explosion that security for the summit was adequate.																								Turkey is a sufficiently strong and secure country. Such incidents happen everywhere  in London, in Paris, everywhere, foreign minister Abdullah Gul said. David Claridge, an analyst with Janusian Security Risk Management in London, said militants would see it as a big victory if they could force Bush to cancel his visit.																								The worrying concern is this may be one of a series of attacks planned over the next few days, he said.																								Turkey has taken drastic security precautions in Istanbul, fearing a repetition of four devastating truck bombs in November that killed more than 60 people. Al Qaida claimed responsibility for those attacks.

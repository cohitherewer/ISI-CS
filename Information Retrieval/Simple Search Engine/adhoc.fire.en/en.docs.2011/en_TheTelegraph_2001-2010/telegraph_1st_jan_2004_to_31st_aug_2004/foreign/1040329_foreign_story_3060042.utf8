 LEE GORDON 				 	 The statue of Saddam Hussein being toppled in Baghdad.																								Baghdad, March 28: When Saddams statue was famously toppled from the middle of Firdaus Square in Baghdad last April, it turned out to be Iraqs weightlifting champion who swung the first symbolic blow against the former dictator.																								Armed with a mighty sledgehammer, Khadom Sharif Hassan started pounding away at the statue, to cheers from the jubilant crowd and praise from President George W. Bush, watching the action unfold on the White House television. 																								They got it down, the President said approvingly.																								Now, however, the beefy hero of the hour is languishing in jail, accused of looting Baghdads National Army Museum of one of the former dictators most treasured exhibits: the 50-year-old black Norton motorcyle on which the young Saddam claimed he fled to Syria in 1959 after a botched assassination attempt on Iraqs then Prime Minister.																								Hassan explained that he felt he had a legitimate claim to the bike, which until the looting frenzy had stood on a plinth in the museum, but was found in his workshop a fortnight ago during a raid by Iraqs special crimes squad. As the chief motorbike mechanic to Uday Hussein  Saddams elder son  Hassan had spent countless hours lavishing care on the Norton. Whats more, he said, Uday used to cherry-pick the best motorcycles that he imported into Iraq, paying him just a fraction of their value.																								From the special police headquarters in Baghdad, Hassan denied stealing the bike. I bought the Norton from a looter, he said. I knew he had stolen it, but I had a duty to take it and look after it. I love that bike. Of course, I hate Saddam, but what he did wasnt the bikes fault. It is a special thing in Iraqs history.																								Saddam was 22 when he took part in the attempt to kill Prime Minister, Gen Abd al-Karim Qasim, who a year earlier had overthrown the British-backed monarchy to seize power. Though the plan failed, it sparked the Baath partys rise to power.																								In the American-sponsored ambush, Saddam was installed in a Baghdad flat to monitor Qasims motorcade but lost his nerve and began firing too soon, killing a driver but only wounding the Prime Minister. Another would-be assassin was equipped with bullets that did not fit his gun; a third had a hand grenade which got stuck in the lining of his coat. Saddam, who was slightly injured by a fellow plotter, escaped.																								The story of what happened next was changed and embellished considerably by Saddam over the years. While the other conspirators took a train to Damascus, Saddam originally claimed to have ridden a horse across the desert and swum the Tigris before making his way to Syria. By the time Saddam had decided to make a film of his exploits in the 1970s  Omar Sharif turned down the lead role  he claimed that he had escaped on the Norton.																								Hassan, 50, who is married with three children, said he had looked after more than 100 motorbikes belonging to Uday for 16 years, working on them round the clock. I would be ordered to tune a bike at 3am if Uday decided after a night out that he wanted to ride the next day, he said. His favourite was a red Honda 750cc bike which he used for jumping because he was tall and strong enough to drive a big bike.																								Uday preferred Japanese models to American Harley-Davidsons, Hassan said, but also liked a BMW that was a present from King Abdullah of Jordan. At the time of his arrest, Hassan was training for a weightlifting tournament in the Czech Republic in May  in which he now has little chance of taking part.																								Hassan has already served time for theft after being jailed when money went missing during Udays aborted attempt two years ago to win the 2012 Olympics for Iraq. This time he can expect an even longer sentence, officials from the serious crimes squad said, describing the case against Hassan as open and shut. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

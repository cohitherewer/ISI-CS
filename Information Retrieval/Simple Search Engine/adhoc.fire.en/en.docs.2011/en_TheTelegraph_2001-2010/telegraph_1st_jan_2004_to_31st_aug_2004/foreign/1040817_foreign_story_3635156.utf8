 							 - Bombs thrown at Soaltee				 	 The Soaltee Crowne Plaza in Kathmandu																								Kathmandu, Aug. 16 (Agencies): A man on a bicycle threw at least four bombs into the compound of the Soaltee Crowne Plaza hotel in Nepals capital today but no one was injured.																								Six multinational firms, including Indo-Nepal joint venture Surya Nepal, announced closure of their operations in view of Maoist rebels threats.																								The attack in Kathmandu came on the eve of a deadline by the Maoists to shut down 10 companies, including the luxury hotel, accusing them of unfair labour practices in the Himalayan state.																								Hours after the blasts, the hotel, which had earlier refused to bow to the rebel threat, said it would be closed tomorrow and its guests would be moved to other hotels in Kathmandu.																								The explosions took place within a gap of a few minutes, an interior ministry official said. The bombs fell near the empty tennis court at the back of the hotel. So no one was injured. Police said the bombs had caused two big craters in the ground near the tennis court.																								There were no claims of responsibility for the blasts. The official blamed Maoist insurgents who have been fighting since 1996 to replace the constitutional monarchy with communist rule. The Maoist revolt has killed more than 10,000 people in Nepal. Todays attack was the first targeting a luxury hotel in the Nepali capital, popular with tourists.																								The security of our guests is of prime concern, a Soaltee manager, who did not want to be identified, said. Due to security concerns, we are closing down the hotel from tomorrow.																								The hotel, which is managed by a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of Britains InterContinental Hotels Group, is particularly popular with Indian tourists.																								A trade union affiliated to the rebels last week asked 10 companies across the country to shut down indefinitely from Tuesday saying they exploited their workers.

 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 BBC host defends Arab remark
																								London, Jan. 11 (AP): A talk-show host suspended for penning an anti-Arab newspaper article criticised the bullying ethos of political correctness and defended his right to free speech today.																								The British Broadcasting Corporation has pulled the long-running Kilroy show off the air while it investigates a column published last week in the Today Express in which host Robert Kilroy-Silk said that few Arab countries make much contribution to the welfare of the rest of the world. The column, headlined We owe Arabs nothing, also referred to Arabs as suicide bombers, limb amputators, women repressors.																								In an interview in Sunday Express, Kilroy-Silk, 61, said he regretted causing offence but said he reserved the right to criticise despotic West Asian regimes. That was a perfectly fair, reasonable and justifiable thing to do, he said. I didnt intend to say that all Arabs are uncivilised because clearly I dont believe that. Thats stupid. Thats nonsense. He added he was disappointed the BBC didnt feel able to stand by him. On Friday, the BBC said it strongly disassociates itself from the sentiments expressed in the newspaper and suspended the 17-year-old daytime chat show pending an inquiry.

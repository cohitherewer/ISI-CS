 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Court seals Taiwan ballots
																								Taipei, March 21 (Reuters): Taiwans high court sealed election ballot boxes today as protesters massed to contest President Chen Shui-bians victory after a mysterious assassination attempt and the discovery of many spoiled ballots.																								Defeated Nationalist Party contender Lien Chan called for a recount and a special inquiry into the shooting of incumbent Chen on the eve of yesterdays poll that swung the vote in the islands closest-ever presidential election. 																								The court could select a judge to decide on a recount as early as tomorrow after Lien questioned how more than 330,000 votes had been ruled invalid. He lost to Chen by about 29,000 votes out of nearly 13 million cast. A decision on a recount could cause political turmoil and would be severe test for the young democracy of Taiwan, which lies within range of missiles deployed by arch-foe China that claims the island as a breakaway province.																								Joining thousands of cheering supporters staging a sit-in outside the presidential palace, Lien demanded answers to the many questions surrounding Fridays shooting in which Chen and Vice-President Annette Lu were slightly wounded.																								Why dont we trust the government? Because there are too many things under a cloud of suspicion, Lien, the scion of one of Taiwans wealthiest families, told his supporters. 																								There has been widespread speculation that the shooting may have been staged, but officials have denied this.																								Media surveys had pointed to a win for Lien and analysts said an 11th-hour sympathy vote may have given this narrowest of wins to Chen.

 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Pak House pleads for hostages
 IMTIAZ GUL				 	 Pakistani hostage Raja Azad Khans daughter Fozia holds a picture of her father in Islamabad. (Reuters)																								Islamabad, July 27: Hours after an Islamic militant group in Iraq claimed responsibility for kidnapping two Pakistani nationals, the National Assembly today hoped the government would try to secure the immediate release of the hostages.																								The group, which calls itself the Islamic Army of Iraq, yesterday said in a videotape, aired by Al Jazeera, that it had evidence the Pakistani hostages were collaborators of the US. The group have threatened to also kill the Pakistanis.																								This House expresses deep concern over the kidnapping of the two Pakistanis in Iraq and threats to their lives and hopes the government will make all possible efforts for their release, the resolution said. It was unanimously adopted by the 342-member Assembly and read out by Opposition member Raja Pervaiz Ashraf.																								The resolution followed a fresh appeal by foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, urging the kidnappers to immediately release Raja Azad Khan and Sajjad Naeem, both residents of Rawalakot in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.																								Hussein and Naeem, who worked for the Kuwaiti branch of a Saudi company Al Tamimi, had disappeared on Friday from Mahmudiya, 45 km from Baghdad. The militant group, however, claimed that one Pakistani hostage worked as a technician for US forces while the other worked as a driver. 																								We appeal to the kidnappers to free the two men to honour the principles of Islamic brotherhood and international human values, Kasuri said while speaking in the National Assembly.																								There is no change in the governments policy on deploying its forces in the troubled Gulf state, Kasuri said in reference to a militant groups demand that Pakistan should guarantee it would not send troops to Iraq.																								The militants said in the video that statements by President Pervez Musharraf hinting at the possibility of deploying troops in Iraq was another reason justifying the killing of the hostages. Pakistan has said it would dispatch troops to Iraq only under the authorisation of the UN or the Organisation of Islamic Conference.

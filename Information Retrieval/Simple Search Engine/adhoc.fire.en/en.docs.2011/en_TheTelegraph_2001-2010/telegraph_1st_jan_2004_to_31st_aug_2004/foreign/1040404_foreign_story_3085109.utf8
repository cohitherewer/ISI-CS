				 	 Aung San Suu Kyi																								Bangkok, April 3 (Reuters): Myanmar democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi will be freed from house arrest and her National League for Democracy invited to a constitutional conference next month, Myanmars foreign minister told NHK television today.																								Original members who attended, including the NLD, will be invited, foreign minister Win Aung told Japans NHK television in Bangkok, where he was due to meet his Thai counterpart. Asked if Suu Kyi would be released before the May 17 start of the conference, Win Aung said: Yes. He added it was too early to give a precise date.																								The military government, under pressure to show it is sincere about its road map to democracy announced with few details last August, set the date for the constitutional meeting last week.

(AFP)																								Baghdad, May 18 (Reuters): Iraqs leaders, flexing muscles as the US prepares to cede sovereignty, are sending a delegation to the UNto demand control of their oil and an end to reparations they pay for Saddam Husseins wars.																								Deputy foreign minister Hamid Bayati said today that the embryonic government in Baghdad would demand a say this week in a new UN resolution on the countrys affairs. Iraqs interior minister said he believed his security forces would be in a position to replace Americans for most tasks within months.																								Following yesterdays car bomb assassination outside the US headquarters of the head of their governing council, Iraqis who will be running the country after the handover of power on June 30 are increasingly dismayed not only at the US failure to provide security but also at limits on their new sovereignty.																								US ally Italy, whose troops are under fire from insurgents in southern Iraq, added its voice. On his way for talks with President George W. Bush, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said he wanted a clear breakthrough on giving Iraqis real power.																								Berlusconi, under pressure to distance himself from the US administration, also urged public trials in the US soldiers accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners. 																								Staunch US ally Poland, with 2,400 troops in Iraq, also expressed concerns and called on Washington to speed up the handover of power to the Iraqi people. And in another ally, Ukraine, the Opposition forced a debate in parliament this week on whether to withdraw its 1,600 troops from Iraq.																								Iraq must have a say in the next UN resolution, Bayati said. We will negotiate on the basis that Iraq must be fully in charge of its resource wealth, and the five per cent of oil revenues we pay (in war reparations) must be reduced further.																								Washington wants an international board that monitors Iraqs oil accounts to remain in place after the June 30 handover.																								Iraq also still owes some $280 billion in reparations for Saddams 1990 invasion of Kuwait, a vast sum compared to the $9 billion its ravaged oil industry earned since the US invasion.																								Planning minister Mehdi al-Hafedh, a candidate for Prime Minister in the interim government, said: It is unjust for Iraq to pay for the crimes of Saddam with its future.																								Debate over a new resolution to give a UN seal of approval to the handover plan and to the new Iraqi administration has given critics of the US invasion, and indeed some allies, a chance to criticise Washington as half-hearted on the transfer.																								Deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz was due later to face a Senate grilling on the same issue. Growing numbers of Americans are keen to see prospects of an end to US involvement in a country where its soldiers die daily.																								The 135,000 US troops in the country, still battling a variety of guerrilla enemies, will remain for the time being, with control over Iraqi police and defence forces. Elections are due in January to choose a fully fledged Iraqi government.																								Bush, who is running for re-election in November, has said troops will stay no longer than necessary. 																								But even Iraqis who are beginning to see US troops as more of a problem than a solution fear a rapid withdrawal would leave anarchy in the ethnically and religiously divided nation of 26 million.																								But Washingtons authority in Iraq, 14 months after an invasion that many Iraqis welcomed as a relief from Saddam, has been undermined by insecurity, poverty and a burgeoning scandal over the torture of Iraqi detainees by US soldiers.																								In a very public demonstration of its determination to put right the US abuses at Abu Ghraib, Saddams old torture centre near Baghdad, the US army will tomorrow court-martial the first of seven military police charged over the affair.

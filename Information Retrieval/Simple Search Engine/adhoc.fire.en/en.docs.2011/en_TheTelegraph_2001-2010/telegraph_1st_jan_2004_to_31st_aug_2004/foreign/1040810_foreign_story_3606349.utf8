 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Shariat bank debuts in UK 
 London, Aug. 9 (Reuters):  Islamic Bank of Britain said today it was the first bank  licensed by Britain that operates entirely in line with  Shariat law, under which Muslims must not pay or receive  interest.																								Britains Financial Services Authority (FSA) authorised the bank on Friday to accept deposits and deal in investments.																								The Muslim Council of Britain said the FSA approval was a watershed event in the history of Islamic finance in the UK as it marks the beginning of the launch of fully regulated Shariat-compliant products for the Muslim community.																								Shariat law requires profits to be shared and bans investment in industries related to alcohol, gambling or weapons, as well as prohibiting interest.																								Nevertheless, Islamic banking has emerged as a growing market in the past decade, although analysts say it is being held back because Muslim scholars have yet to define how compatible the newest financial products are with Islam.																								Islamic real estate funds and liquid real estate funds  investments in listed property companies  have also stirred interest among investors, as have Shariat-compliant mortgages whereby a bank buys a property and sells it to the new home owner at a premium using fixed monthly instalments.																								Michael Hanlon, managing director of the Islamic Bank of Britain, said the bank would employ a group of Islamic scholars to carry out regular audits ensuring its products were Shariat-compliant. Eddie George, former governor of Britains central bank, the Bank of England, said the provision of a wide range of Shariat products will provide real comfort to the many devout Muslim members of our society.																								The first branch will open in September on Edgware Road, a wealthy Arab neighbourhood on the fringes of central London, quickly followed by branches in Birmingham and Leicester, both with large Muslim populations.

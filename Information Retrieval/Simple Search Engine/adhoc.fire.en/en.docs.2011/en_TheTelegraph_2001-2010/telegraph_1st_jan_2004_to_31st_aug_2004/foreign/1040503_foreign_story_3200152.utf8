 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Ex-Saddam aide not in charge of Falluja
																								Washington, May 2 (Reuters): Gen. Jasim Mohamed Saleh, a former general in Saddam Husseins elite Republican Guard, is unlikely to take charge in the volatile Iraqi city of Falluja and is still being vetted to lead a possible Iraqi peacekeeping force, the senior US military commander said today.																								Theres another general theyre looking at, Gen. Richard B. Myers told ABCs This Week. My guess is, it will not be Gen. Saleh. ... He will not be their leader ... He may have a role to play, but that vetting has yet to take place, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff added.																								At the Marines camp outside Falluja, Lt Gen. James Conway said another former senior Iraqi officer, Mohamed Latif, was also working with the Marines in a mentoring capacity and was being considered as a possible commander for the overall brigade, once it was established.																								Nine US servicemen were killed in Iraq today  six of them in a mortar attack. But US commanders also announced civilian Thomas Hamill had escaped after being held hostage for three weeks by gunmen.																								Three Italian civilians and a US soldier remain hostages. No new kidnappings have been reported for nearly two weeks.																								After April became the bloodiest month for US troops in Iraq with 129 combat deaths, American commanders were able to report good news when Hamill, a trucker, ran into the arms of a US patrol close to Saddam Husseins home town of Tikrit. 																								He had an opportunity to escape, saw some US forces and made his dash, Myers said.																								Hamills wife Kellie said: I feel wonderful. Its the best feeling Ive had. I am so ecstatic and I just want to thank everybody that has prayed and sent their prayers to us.																								Film of Hamill free may help offset the latest bad news photographs from Iraq  US soldiers abusing prisoners at a Baghdad jail  that has outraged opinion in the Arab world.

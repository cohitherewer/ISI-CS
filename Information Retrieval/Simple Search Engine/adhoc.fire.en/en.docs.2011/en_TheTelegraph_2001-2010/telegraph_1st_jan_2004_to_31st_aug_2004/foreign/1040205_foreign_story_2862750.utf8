 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Lonely Jack yearns for a partner
				 	 Jack Nicholson London, Feb. 4 (Reuters):  Jack Nicholson says periods of loneliness and yearning for  a partner have replaced his hellraising days as one of Hollywoods  most notorious womanisers.																								I think it is very unattractive for me to be seen fawning over little, tiny girls, the Oscar-winning actor said. 																								I didnt feel that for a long time in my life, but now I do. 																								The 66-year-old said in a newspaper interview in Britain that he still wants a sex life, but cant be bothered to play the dating game.																								Of course I get lonely. Not lonely the way I might have been when I was 25 and it would have filled me with angst. I have learned to enjoy times alone. But I wish I had a partner, he told the Daily Telegraph newspaper in an interview published today to promote his film Somethings Gotta Give.																								Asked whether he could remember his carousing days in the Sixties, he replied: Honey, I am one of those who can remember the Forties.																								Although he admits his wildest days are gone, he isnt ready to give up all his old habits and can still cut the mustard between the sheets.																								I only take Viagra when Im with more than one woman, he quipped.																								Nicholson said he wanted to look like he did when he made The Shining horror film in 1980. I am always a little bit shocked when I look in the mirror. I expect to see some earlier version of myself staring back, he said, adding that he expects to see a 42-year-old Jack.																								Nicholson, who divorced actress Sandra Knight in 1968, had a long relationship with Anjelica Huston and more recently dated Lara Flynn Boyle, said he doesnt miss dating.																								Dating just does not happen to be my scene at the moment. You know, I dont want to queue up, I dont want to get in line.																								Asked if his life had passed quickly, he replied: Its been like smoke through a keyhole.

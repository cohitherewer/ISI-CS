 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Poland mulls pullout but not without US approval
Warsaw, April 21 (Reuters): Poland said today it was reviewing its position in Iraq but would not pull its troops out suddenly or without Washingtons approval.																								We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that Spain and others are leaving, Prime Minister Leszek Miller, who stands down on May 2, said.																								I cannot say when we will leave (Iraq), but Im sure the new Prime Minister will say something more precise.																								He said his successor Marek Belka would map out a strategy for the troops in his first policy speech next month. We will not make any rash gestures. A final decision about the pullout date will be agreed and well thought over, Miller said.																								A government official, who asked not to be named, said Poland was ready to keep its troops in Iraq until the end of 2004 but wanted to cut numbers from the current 2,500.																								Miller said Poland would not follow Spains example and pull its troops out of Iraq quickly, as this could destabilise the situation.																								Poland, a staunch US ally in the war to topple Saddam Hussein, leads a 9,500-strong multinational force in south-central Iraq. Miller suggested Nato assume command of the force, but the alliance has said it had no such plans. His government faces growing pressure from some Opposition parties to pull out troops from Iraq as public opinion is increasingly sceptical about Polands mission in the country.																								A decision by Spains new Left-wing Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to withdraw his 1,400 troops from the force left Poland scrambling for ways to keep peace in the increasingly violent Iraqi region.Miller  who plans to resign on May 2, a day after Poland joins the EU  said a UN resolution authorising an international peacekeeping operation in Iraq would help solve the conflict there.																								This conflict should be solved by political means, preferably under UN auspices. Many countries would get engaged (in Iraq) under UN auspices, he said. Politicians say Belka, who has so far pledged full commitment to the US-led coalition in Iraq, will do nothing to upset Washington.

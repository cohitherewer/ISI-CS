Santa Maria (California), Aug. 20 (AFP): Investigators drew back the veil on the frenetic opulence of Michael Jacksons Neverland ranch, revealing a mansion filled with a breathtaking mix of classic taste and theme-park folly.																								 The secret glimpse behind the gates of 1,260 square -metre Tudor mansion came in a video shot when police and prosecutors searched the house last year that was shown to a court hearing child molestation charges against the superstar.																								 The video, showing the team of 40 investigators swooping on the house on November 18, showed Jacksons eclectic juxtaposition of dark wood panelling, elegant chandeliers and suits of armour with giant and luridly-coloured models of cartoon and movie characters. Surprised officers gasped as they caught sight of a life-size statue of Superman and the Star Wars robot R2-D2 in part of the house that contained a childrens classroom and a room seemingly filled to the brim with dolls.																								 A dolls house the size of a large armoire dominated one of the toy rooms, while a model of a large baby holding both its hands up in the air grasping at rattles rose up in another part of the room.																								 A small childs bed littered with toys and dolls was nearby, as were rocking horses and an artwork made up of huge wooden building blocks marked with the letters of the alphabet.																								The stepfather of the boy who accused Michael Jackson of sex abuse testified yesterday that Jacksons associates offered the family a house and college funds to help fix the singers damaged reputation. But the man, called to the witness stand by Jacksons lawyers during a pre-trial hearing in the case and identified in court only as Mr. Doe, said he sought even more compensation from the pop star.																								Doe said the discussions followed a worldwide furore over a 2003 British documentary  filmed largely at Jacksons Neverland Valley Ranch in central California  in which the 45-year-old entertainer holds hands with the boy and says that he sees nothing wrong with sharing his bed with children.																								Doe, who married the mother of Jacksons accuser last May, said he got a call from a gentleman at Neverland who asked the family to submit to a taped interview which would portray Jackson in a more positive light.																								He said he asked the caller what he was offering in exchange for the familys participation and was told that Jacksons representatives would provide security for the family, college education and buy them a house.

 Monday, June 14, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Mad over mice																																	Sydney, June 13 (Reuters): Two men in their 20s are expected to be charged with animal cruelty after chewing live mice in a jackass competition in an Australian bar.																																	The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the men engaged in an outrageous act of cruelty by accepting a challenge in front of a cheering crowd to place the mice in their mouths and bite off their tails.																																	RSPCA chief inspector Byron Hall told ABC TV the men were then challenged to chew up the mice, and they did.																																	The men were competing for a A$500 ($345) holiday weekend on Queenslands Gold Coast. They now face fines of up to A$75,000 or two years in prison.																													 																Space slice Wellington (Reuters): A grapefruit-sized meteorite smashed through the roof of a New Zealand house, hitting a couch and bouncing off the ceiling before coming to rest under a computer. The 1.3 kg chunk of space debris dropped out of the sky and plummeted through the tiled roof of the Auckland home on Saturday. I was in the kitchen doing breakfast and there was this almighty explosion, owner Brenda Archer told the Sunday Star-Times newspaper. It was like a bomb had gone off. I couldnt see anything, there was just dust. Archers one-year-old grandson had been playing nearby minutes before it hit.

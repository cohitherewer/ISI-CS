 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Fresh blow to Arafat authority
																								Rafah (Gaza Strip), July 18 (Reuters): Palestinian militants attacked a Palestinian security post in Gaza today, stepping up pressure on President Yasser Arafat to stamp out corruption in a crisis deepened by the resignation of his Prime Minister.																								Hundreds of gunmen, many of them masked, exchanged heavy fire with forces loyal to Arafats cousin Moussa Arafat, whom he appointed as Gazas new security chief following a series of high-profile abductions in the strip over the weekend.																								The standoff stepped up pressure on Arafat to wipe out alleged widespread corruption that sparked the crisis which was deepened by the resignation of his Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie. 																								Arafat has not seen such turmoil since his Palestinian Authority took control over most of the Gaza Strip in 1994 under interim peace accords with Israel.																								In a show of force, thousands of gunmen marched across the Gaza Strip demanding that Arafat fire Moussa Arafat, a member of an old guard widely viewed as corrupt. 																								Calls for reform have multiplied amid a brewing factional power struggle in the Gaza Strip in anticipation of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharons planned withdrawal of troops and settlers from the occupied territory by the end of 2005.																								Sharon said Palestinian in-fighting showed he was right to take unilateral action rather than negotiate with Arafat. 																								What is happening in the Palestinian Authority proves that all the contrived efforts to show that there is someone to talk to on the Palestinian side are motivated by personal interests and are unrealistic, Sharon was quoted as telling his cabinet.

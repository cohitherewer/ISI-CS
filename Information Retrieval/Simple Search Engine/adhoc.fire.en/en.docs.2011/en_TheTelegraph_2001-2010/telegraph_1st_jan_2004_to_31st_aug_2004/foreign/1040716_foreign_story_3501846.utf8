 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 NZ freezes Israel ties over fraud
																								Auckland, July 15 (Reuters): New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark suspended all high-level contacts with Israel today after two Israelis suspected of being spies for Mossad were jailed for trying to obtain a passport by fraud.																								The government said there were very strong reasons to suspect the two men were acting on behalf of Israels intelligence services and froze all high-level official contact with Israel. The Israeli government was asked for an explanation and an apology three months ago. Neither has been received, Clark said in a statement. 																								She said the actions of the Israeli intelligence agents were utterly unacceptable.																								As a result, New Zealand would suspend all high-level diplomatic contacts with Israel, not allow a visit by Israeli President Moshe Katzav after he goes to Australia next month and delay the approval and accreditation of a new ambassador to New Zealand, she said.

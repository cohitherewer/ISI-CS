 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Sandra confronts her builder in court
 MARCUS WARREN 				 	 Sandra Bullock: Bullish																								Austin, Aug. 24: Sandra Bullock confronted her builder in court yesterday in a dispute over work on her house.																								The Hollywood actor accuses her builder and developer of cheating her out of a dream Texas home and falsely billing her for millions of dollars of labour.																								The lakeside property stands empty to this day, seven years after the work was commissioned.																								The showdown has degenerated into a long-running legal grudge match. The trial, held before a 12-member jury, is likely to last at least a month and the courtroom is piled high with boxes of case documents. Pictures of the unfinished house and its turrets, fireplaces and a spiral staircase have been flashed on to a huge screen in court as though they were evidence from a crime scene.																								The actor and her father and business manager, John Bullock, were sinking about $1 million a month into the house at the end of the 1990s, the court heard yesterday. The 40-year-old star of the Speed movies and romantic comedies such as Miss Congeniality claims that her chateau-style mansion outside Austin suffers a leaky and structurally unsound roof as well as flaws in its windows and stone.																								She is suing her builder, M.B. Benny Daneshjou, for $4 million to repair the property, and a further $6 million for work paid for but allegedly not carried out.																								Bullock, dressed in black cardigan and slacks, and Daneshjou were in court but both studiously avoided each others gaze during yesterdays hearing.																								Daneshjous lawyer has argued that the Bullocks still owe the builder money and that the house is by no means the disaster portrayed.																								A modest colony of Hollywood stars has set up home in Austin, attracted by the citys zany ambience and thriving alternative scene. Apart from Bullock, other residents include fellow actors Dennis Quaid and Luke Wilson.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

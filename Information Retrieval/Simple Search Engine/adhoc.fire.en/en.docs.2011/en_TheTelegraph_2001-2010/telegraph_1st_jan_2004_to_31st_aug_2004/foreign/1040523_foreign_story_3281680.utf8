 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Libya pulls out of Arab meet over Israel issue
																								Tunis, May 22 (Reuters): Libya withdrew from an Arab summit in Tunis today in protest at the agenda and at the Arab Leagues failure to take up Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafis proposal for a single Israeli-Palestinian state.																								Unfortunately, Libya is forced to boycott the summit because it does not agree to the agenda of the Arab governments. Libya wants the agenda of the Arab peoples, Gaddafi told a news conference after walking out of the summit. He said he hoped Libyas basic peoples congresses, local councils which decide Libyan policy, would agree to Libyan withdrawal from the Arab League.																								Libya has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the 22-member league and Gaddafi was a reluctant participant in the Tunis meeting, which was meant to present a united Arab front on Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and political reform. Gaddafi criticised the secretariat of the Arab League for shelving his plan, known as a white paper, to revive a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.																								The one state, from the Mediterranean to the Jordan river, would include Israelis and Palestinians as equals. Most Arab states favour separate Israeli and Palestinian states living side-by- side.

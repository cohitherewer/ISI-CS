The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Virus spreads, cloud on Shanghai
				 	 WHO representative in the Philippines Jean-Marc Olive eats fried chicken in Manila to prove it is safe. (Reuters)																								Beijing/Bangkok, Jan. 30 (Reuters): China, home to a vast poultry industry, said today the deadly bird flu virus which has killed eight Asians had struck in three provinces, possibly two more and perhaps the sprawling financial capital of Shanghai.																								It said tests confirmed the H5N1 virus had got into chickens in Hubei and Hunan provinces as well as the southern region of Guanxi. Outbreaks were also suspected in Anhui and Guangdong, the southern province where Sars was born.																								Another suspected outbreak was reported in a Shanghai suburb and a mass slaughter of domestic fowl was under way around all three new outbreaks, the official Xinhua news agency said. Outbreaks in China  widely condemned for covering up Sars for several months  were the nightmare health officials had prayed they would not have to face.																								Experts fear the worlds most populous country could become a huge incubator for the virus if the new cases are confirmed.																								Especially in Guangdong, people live cheek by jowl with their chickens and other farm animals, raising the possibility the virus may combine with human flu to produce a strain that could sweep through a world where people have no immunity to it.																								The fresh outbreaks prompted Hong Kong, just south of Guangdong, to immediately ban imports of live birds and poultry meat from mainland China.																								So far, all eight people  seven of them children  known to have died from bird flu have caught it directly from infected chickens, victims of a virus probably spread by migrating birds. 																								But the generation of a new flu virus that can pass from person to person is the overwhelming fear, and while the possibility is small, every outbreak shortens the odds of a pandemic a little.																								Thailand reported today its first outbreak of bird flu in in the southern part of the country.																								A provincial government official said test results confirmed the outbreak yesterday in Phang Nga province, 90 km northeast of the popular tourist resort Phuket. Thousands of chickens were being slaughtered there, he said. The virus has now spread across more than a third of Thailand, so far the worst hit of 10 Asian countries struck by bird flu.																								Thai officials had earlier expressed hope the country may be turning the corner in the war against a disease that has seen governments accused of cover-ups and incompetence.																								Im confident the cull is nearly finished, agriculture minister Somsak Thepsuthin said at Bangkoks Chatuchak market, the worlds biggest, where infected fighting cockerels were found this week.																								On Sunday, we should have some good news. Well rub out areas which have been red areas, he added, referring to zones around outbreaks. But the UN Food and Agricultural  Organisation said mass slaughters, which it says are the  most effective way of stamping the virus out and preventing  a human flu pandemic, were not happening fast enough.

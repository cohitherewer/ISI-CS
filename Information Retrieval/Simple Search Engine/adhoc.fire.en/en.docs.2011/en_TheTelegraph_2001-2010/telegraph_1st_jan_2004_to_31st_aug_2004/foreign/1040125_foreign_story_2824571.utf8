 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Flu spreads as toll rises to six
				 	 A girl, suspected of suffering from bird flu, is treated by a nurse at Hanois National Pediatric Institute. (AFP)																								Bangkok/Hanoi, Jan. 24 (Reuters): UN officials said today the deadly bird flu that has jumped to humans in Vietnam and Thailand was spreading  a warning grimly underlined by confirmation of a sixth death from the disease.																								Experts fear the avian virus could set off an epidemic worse than Sars, another disease which crossed from animals to humans, killed 800 people and frightened the world last year.																								Theres no denying the disease is spreading, Anton Rychener, Vietnam representative for the Food and Agriculture Organisation, a UN body, said.																								The WHO said a 13-year-old Vietnamese boy had died on Thursday from the H5N1 strain of avian flu, and that an eight-year-old girl had tested positive for the virus. 																								She was critically ill in Ho Chi Minh City, the first confirmed cases of bird flu in southern Vietnam since four children and one adult died in the countrys north.																								In Thailand, a chicken butcher, one of six Thais being tested for the disease, is believed to have died of pneumonia yesterday, but more tests were being done, officials said. The WHO has said the near-simultaneous bird flu outbreaks in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and now Thailand and Cambodia were historically unprecedented.																								Thailand will host a meeting on Wednesday of senior health and agriculture officials from Asian countries and international agencies fighting the outbreak.																								Thailand denied today it had tried to cover up an outbreak of bird flu, saying it had had suspicions for weeks but had only known for certain when tests confirmed the disease. After weeks of declaring the country free of bird flu, the government confirmed today that two boys, aged six and seven, had contracted the highly infectious virus.																								The government never realised it was avian influenza before yesterday, but it was suspecting that it might be. Thats why some measures in extraordinary degrees had been put in place, said Jakrapob Penkair, the governments chief spokesman.																								Critics have accused the Thai government of trying to hide the outbreak by blaming the deaths of tens of thousands of chickens since November on poultry cholera. 																								The governments efforts to sweep the problem under the carpet has exploded in its face, leaving the poultry industry in tatters and the very safety of the public in jeopardy, the Bangkok Post newspaper said in an editorial today.																								The bird flu outbreak threatens to devastate the Thai chicken industry, the worlds fourth largest with exports worth $1.5 billion annually and employing hundreds of thousands of people.

 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Bush niece on UN hunger mission
				 	 Lauren Bush, niece of US President George W. Bush, at the United Nations. (AFP)United Nations, April 21 (Reuters): President George W. Bushs fashion model niece went to work for the UN yesterday to urge young Americans to do more to stop hunger around the world.																								Lauren Bush, 19, was named honorary spokeswoman for a new UN World Food Programme project aimed at students to organise anti-hunger campaigns, fundraising events and letter-writing appeals to elected officials, corporate and civic leaders. 																								My motivations are truly not political as hunger is an issue that crosses all political and national boundaries, Bush, a Princeton University student and Elite agency model, said at a news briefing at UN headquarters, where relations with her uncles administration have been tense over the US-led war in Iraq.																								The World Food Programme said a new website  http://www.WarOnHunger.org  had been established as a tool for high school and college students in the US to learn about humanitarian crises and how the lives of hundreds of millions of people have been threatened by hunger, wars and natural disasters.																								The WFP said it had no specific money-raising target for the campaign, but it hoped to expand it to reach students in other developed countries.																								I feel like if we can change the mindset of the next generation, that there will be solutions to this problem. ... Thats kind of my goal, said Bush, who last week made a three-day visit to Guatemala to learn about hunger there.																								Bush, the daughter of the Presidents brother Neil, said she hoped to visit Africa, where the need to feed people is greatest.																								She encouraged her American peers to join WFPs 19 cents a day campaign, the average amount it takes to feed a child in school. 																								The annual cost is $34, the price young people pay to buy two music CDs in the United States.

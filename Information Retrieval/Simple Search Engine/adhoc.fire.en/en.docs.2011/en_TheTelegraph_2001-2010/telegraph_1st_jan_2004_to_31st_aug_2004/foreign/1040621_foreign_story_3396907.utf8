 															- Former presidents famed disposition cracks before TV camera  CHRIS HASTINGS AND CHARLES LAURENCE				 	 Shoppers at a Washington bookstore walk past an advertising poster for former President Bill Clintons memoirs, My Life. (AFP)																								London, June 20: Bill Clinton loses his temper with David Dimbleby during a BBC television interview to be broadcast this week when he is repeatedly quizzed about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.																								The former President, famed for his amiable disposition, becomes angry and rattled, particularly when Dimbleby asks him whether his publicly declared contrition over the affair is genuine.																								His outrage at the line of questioning during the 50-minute interview, to be broadcast on Panorama on Tuesday night, lasts several minutes. 																								It is the first time the former President has been seen to lose his temper publicly over the issue of his sexual liaisons with Lewinsky.																								The President initially responds to Dimblebys questions by launching a general attack on media intrusion. When the broadcaster persists with the question of whether the politician was truly penitent, Clinton directs his anger towards Dimbleby.																								The atmosphere, which was initially warm, then turns decidedly chilly.																								One BBC executive who has seen the interview, which took place in a New York hotel last Wednesday, said: He is visibly angry with Dimblebys line of questioning and some of that anger gets directed at Dimbleby himself. As outbursts go, it is not just some flash that is over in an instant. It is something substantial and sustained.																								It is memorable television which will give the public a different insight into the Presidents character. It will leave them wondering whether he is as contrite as he says he is about past events. Dimbleby manages to remain calm and order is eventually restored.																								Clinton agreed to speak to Panorama as part of the publicity campaign for his autobiography My Life.War timing wrong																								In an interview with Time released today, Clinton said President George W. Bush made the right decision to go after Saddam Hussein but the timing of the invasion was wrong.																								I have repeatedly defended President Bush against the left on Iraq, even though I think he should have waited until the UN inspections were over, he said.																								I would not have done it until after (former UN chief weapons inspector) Hans Blix finished his job.																								I think right now, getting rid of Saddams tyranny, ironically, has made Iraq more vulnerable to terrorism coming from in the outside, Clinton said. But any open society is going to be more vulnerable than any tyranny to that.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND REUTERS

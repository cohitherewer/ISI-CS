Berlin, July 14 (Reuters): Blondes perform intelligence tests more slowly after reading jokes playing on their supposed stupidity, said psychologists in a newly published German study.																								Some 80 women of various hair colours were tested on their mental capacity to work quickly and precisely in a series of psychometric tests. Before sitting the tests, half the participants had to read dumb blonde jokes, such as: Why do blondes open yoghurt pots while still at the supermarket?  Because it says: Open Here on the lid.																								No blonde woman believes she is stupid, said Jens Foerster a social psychologist from the International University Bremen in northern Germany today. But after exposure to negative social-stereotypes about them, the fair-haired participants performed significantly more slowly in the tests. Foerster explained the result by saying that when people are told they cant perform a task well, they work more slowly but more cautiously.

 																											- Head of Forbes Russian edition walks into hail of bullets				 	 Khlebnikov																								Moscow, July 10 (Reuters): Gunmen have shot dead an investigative American journalist who headed the Russian edition of Forbes magazine, which publicised the names of the countrys richest people.																								Paul Khlebnikov, 41, had walked out of his office late yesterday in northeastern Moscow when a car pulled up and several shots were fired. He died on his way to hospital. Khlebnikov, a US citizen of Russian origin who was noted for having criticised exiled magnate Boris Berezovsky, had worked since 1989 for Forbes, a magazine that tracks the worlds wealthy.																								He was the latest victim of killings that have struck down officials, businessmen and journalists in post-Soviet Russia.																								An overnight explosion in the far eastern port of Vladivostok injured a candidate who was running for mayor against a pro-Kremlin contender. Media reports said Khlebnikov was shot four times with two different guns.																								I can offer no realistic version of why this happened. Paul was an investigative journalist. He did this for 17 years and probably had plenty of enemies, Leonid Bershidsky, publisher of both Forbes and Newsweek in Russia, said by telephone.																								Forbes started publication in Russia just three months ago with Khlebnikov as editor and listed its biggest fortunes in May. Dominated by oil and metals tycoons, the list revealed Moscow to be the city with the worlds most billionaires.																								The editor of Newsweeks Russian-language edition, Alexander Gordeyev, told Interfax news agency Khlebnikov told him as he was dying that he had no idea why he had been shot. Contract killings have been rife in Russia since the Soviet Union collapsed.																								Victims have included human rights advocate and member of parliament Galina Starovoitova in 1998, Valentin Tsvetkov, governor of mineral-rich Magadan region, in 2002 and liberal politician Sergei Yushenkov last year. Journalists have been frequent targets, particularly in the provinces. 																								Forbes has clashed with Berezovsky over an article and a book about the business magnate written by Khlebnikov and entitled: Godfather of the Kremlin.																								Berezovsky was close to Boris Yeltsin, post-Soviet Russias first President, but is a vocal opponent of Yeltsins successor Vladimir Putin. Accused of funnelling large sums out of Russia, he dropped an English libel suit after Forbes withdrew some allegations.																								Khlebnikov was for me, in a sense, a teacher. First, I learned that the western press could tell lies. I also learned about the English courts  that they are truly independent, not subject to any pressure, London-based Berezovsky said by telephone. Interviewed after the launch of Russian Forbes, Khlebnikov said some Russian magnates had been angry about the publication.

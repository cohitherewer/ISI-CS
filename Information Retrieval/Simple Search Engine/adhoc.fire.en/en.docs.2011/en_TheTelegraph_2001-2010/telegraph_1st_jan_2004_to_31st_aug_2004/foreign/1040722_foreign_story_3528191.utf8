 Thursday, July 22, 2004 				 Jenna Bushs truant tongue
																								George Bushs daughter Jenna (right) sticks her tongue out at photographers at Lambert airport in St Louis, Missouri. Jenna and sister Barbara, travelling together for the first time with their father, had traded Air Force One for the waiting presidential limousine as Bush talked to a group of people. After Bush got in the backseat beside Jenna, the 22-year-old graduate of the University of Texas at Austin started smiling through the window at photographers stationed on a platform. Then she stuck her tongue out and began to laugh. As everyone on the platform started to laugh and snap photographs, Jenna looked at them for a few more seconds, smiling and laughing. The woman on the left is a secret service agent. (AP)

 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Tigers vow to tame Karuna
Colombo, April 11 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers vowed today to reclaim territory held by a breakaway rebel commander after launching an offensive that shattered the calm brought by the islands two-year ceasefire.																								There has been no serious fighting since Friday when at least 10  and possibly many more  died in clashes between the rival rebel factions, and some 3,000 civilians fled their homes.																								But the northern-based Tigers said they would see through the operation to expel Karuna, the eastern commander whose split was a blow to the movements previously iron internal discipline and complicates peace efforts to end 20 years of civil war.																								We have begun a co-ordinated operation to expel Karuna from Tamil homeland, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said in a statement published on the pro-rebel Tamilnet website.																								We are taking all efforts to bring a closure to Karunas actions and the resulting disturbances and anxiety caused in the east, the statement said.																								The Tigers have in the past eliminated anyone who challenged their leadership and vowed last month to get rid of Karuna from our soil, but the task is complicated by the fact that he controls about 6,000 of the groups 15,000 fighters.																								Those include child soldiers, and the LTTEs statement urged parents of fighters under the control of Karuna  the movements name for V. Muralitharan  to take back their children.																								Karunas spokesperson Varathan confirmed yesterday it was the main LTTE that launched the attack, and said his group had retreated to re-organise its forces. 																								Tamilnet said the Tigers were encircling Karunas forces, having made inroads from the north in Fridays fighting, and adding that last night they moved into the southern part of his territory where his cadres left without resistance. But defence secretary Cyril Herath said there had been no reports of fresh fighting or problems in that area.

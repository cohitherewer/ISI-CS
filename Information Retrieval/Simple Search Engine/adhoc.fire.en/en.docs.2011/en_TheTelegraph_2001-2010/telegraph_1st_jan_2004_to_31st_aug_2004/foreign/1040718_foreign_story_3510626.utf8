 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 UK plans to relax rules on embryo screening
																								London, July 17 (Reuters): Britains fertility watchdog said today it might relax tough rules governing embryo screening and selection, but denied any legal change would open the door to an era of so-called designer babies.																								Current law allows fertility clinics to screen embryos for serious genetic disorders, but a number of recent cases have tested those legal boundaries and provoked a heated ethical debate on the merits and pitfalls of embryo selection. Some parents want the added right to screen in-vitro fertilisation embryos for tissue traits that could lead to their stem cells being transplanted into a sick sibling.																								A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which oversees the industry in Britain, said a review of tissue typing would be discussed as part of a general meeting on Wednesday.																								Its such a fast-moving area and they will look at how much the science has advanced as well as looking at whether the ethical and legal sides have moved on, the spokeswoman said. None of the policies are set in stone and they all have to be constantly reviewed, she added.

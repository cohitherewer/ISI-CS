 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Urban guerrilla nightmare stares at US
				 	 An armed militant walks past a burning vehicle in Baghdad. (Reuters)																								Baghdad, April 8 (Reuters): US-led forces in Iraq risk being drawn into an urban guerrilla conflict they are ill-prepared to fight and which will probably cost many more lives, military experts say.																								More than 1,400 US Marines have been sent in to quell insurgency in Ramadi and Falluja, two large Sunni towns west of Baghdad that have been the focal point of the anti-occupation guerrilla war for the past year. At the same time, British, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian and other forces within the US-led coalition are battling to put down a Shia uprising that is spreading through towns and cities throughout southern Iraq.																								The fighting in Falluja and Ramadi has been particularly intense, with witnesses reporting US troops, supported by helicopter gunships and warplanes, moving in groups on foot to engage masked guerrillas in street-to-street combat.																								Early in the operation, dubbed Vigilant Resolve, 12 Marines were killed and 20 wounded when well-armed insurgents launched a surprise attack on the Ramadi governors mansion, which was occupied by US forces.																								It was one of the heaviest tolls the Marines had suffered in a single day of combat since the war that toppled Saddam Hussein was launched a year ago.																								Urban warfare is the worst type of warfare any infantry can get drawn into and its something the Americans have wanted to avoid since the beginning, said Phillip Mitchell, an analyst at Londons International Institute for Strategic Studies. It means going street-to-street, house -to-house to defeat the enemy, and if thats going to happen then the Americans are going to take many, many more casualties, he said.																								In the past four days of fighting, not just in Ramadi and Falluja but in Shia districts of Baghdad and the southern towns of Nassiriya, Najaf, Kerbala, Kut, Basra and Amara, at least 35 American and allied soldiers have been killed. Hundreds of Iraqis have also died and many more been wounded in the most intense fighting since Saddam fell. The commander of US forces in Iraq, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, said today the operations in Ramadi and Falluja could go on for days or weeks.																								We knew before we started this campaign that that was a possibility, and the entire military and the US Marines are prepared to engage in this type of operation, he said.																								But some experts say the military is trained more for heavy combat operations using overwhelming force, not the intense cut and thrust of house-to-house combat, and may be underestimating the resolve of insurgents who have kept the 125,000 US troops deployed in Iraq on edge and guessing for more than a year. There are also concerns that unrestrained firing from edgy soldiers unable to distinguish friend from foe could have serious consequences may only incite more hatred and drive more people to take up arms.																								Neither in terms of doctrine nor training are the Americans likely to be very good at dealing with an urban insurgency, said William Hopkinson, a military specialist.																								The sort of fighting theyre engaging in is likely to draw more fighters into the insurgency, Hopkinson said. The American forces lack of feeling about the Iraq situation could show up to very bad effect if they are further drawn into an urban conflict.

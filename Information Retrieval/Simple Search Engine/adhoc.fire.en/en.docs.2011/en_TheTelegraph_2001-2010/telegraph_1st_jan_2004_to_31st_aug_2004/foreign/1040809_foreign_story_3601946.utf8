(Reuters)																								Baghdad, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Iraqs government reluctantly reinstated the death penalty for crimes including murder, kidnapping and drug running today, saying the move was a necessity and would last until stability was restored.																								Minister of state Adnan al-Janabi said the measure was effective immediately, but there was confusion about whether it could be applied retroactively, casting doubt on whether Saddam Hussein could be put to death if found guilty of crimes.																								This is the most difficult day of my life, Bakhtiar Amin, Iraqs human rights minister, said as he and Janabi unveiled the law. Amin, exiled under Saddam, has been an ardent campaigner against the death penalty for several decades.																								While extremely common during Saddams rule, capital punishment was suspended by the occupying US authorities last year. Since taking office on June 28 this year, Iraqs interim government has hinted repeatedly at reintroducing it. Janabi said the measure would not come into force until published in the official gazette, probably in the coming days.																								He said the measure was being imposed with a strong degree of reluctance, but was necessary in Iraqs highly unstable situation and was something many Iraqis favoured.																								This law is to help protect the Iraqi people in the face of an onslaught of indiscriminate murder. I think it may help, he said, adding that it would remain in force until the security situation was deemed more stable.																								Its introduction comes a day after the government announced an amnesty for guerrillas who have committed minor crimes, making it part of a two-pronged approach to staunching the 16-month uprising  a hard line coupled with accommodation.																								Amin emphasised that it could, like other laws, be overturned by a two-thirds majority in the National Council, a body due to be elected later this month.Allawi ultimatum																								Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. ordered Shia fighters to lay down their weapons and leave the holy city of Najaf today, but the militiamen fortified their positions around an ancient cemetery by laying mines.																								Witnesses said clashes erupted again today in Najaf and also the squalid Baghdad district of Sadr City, as the death toll from four days of fighting in several regions mounted. 																								There is no negotiation with any militia that bears arms against Iraq and the Iraqi people, a heavily guarded Allawi said in Najaf, 160 km south of Baghdad. I believe gunmen should leave the holy sites ... quickly, lay down their weapons and return to the rule of order and law.																								An aide to Sadr rejected Allawis demand and said the clerics Mehdi Army would never leave Najaf, Al Jazeera reported.

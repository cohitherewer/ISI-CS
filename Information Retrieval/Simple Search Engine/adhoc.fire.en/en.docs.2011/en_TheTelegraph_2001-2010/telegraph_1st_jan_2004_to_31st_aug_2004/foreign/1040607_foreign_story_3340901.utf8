 PHILIP SHERWELL 				 	 Raghad Amman, June 6: Hows the coffee? Raghad Hussein asks, with the charm of an attentive hostess. In her elegant villa in the Jordanian capital of Amman, Saddam Husseins eldest daughter has just served us small cups of sweet, Turkish coffee and glasses of orange juice on a silver tray.																								For light reading there is a copy of Hello! magazine and a Danielle Steele bodice-ripper. Most striking, however, are the countless family photographs on display in the government guesthouse where Raghad lives in exile with her five children. 																								The house is a shrine to Saddam. Although Raghad is reticent about her fathers plight, her youngest daughter, 10-year-old Banan, is not. Saddam Hussein is a good man, she said in confident English, picking up a photograph of her grandfather. He is in the American prison, but mom says thats not right.																								Raghad may be concerned about her father but evidently she is making the most of her new way of life. As Saddam undergoes daily interrogation by his CIA captors and Iraq is plagued by a bloody insurrection, the mother-of-five has undergone cosmetic surgery, works out several mornings a week at a smart ladies gym and is often seen in Ammans leading jewellery and clothes stores.																								Although Saddam is known to have secreted millions of dollars in bank accounts in neighbouring countries, including Jordan, before the war, the bill for Raghads extravagant life in Amman is being footed by her hosts  to the irritation of many Jordanians, and the anger of Iraqi exiles. 																								The family, however, is still struggling to recover what it believes is rightfully theirs. Raghad and her mother, Sajida, recently appointed an international team of lawyers to defend Saddam when he comes before Iraqs newly-created war crimes tribunals. Remarkably, one of their first instructions to the leading Jordanian lawyer, Mohamed Roshdan, was that he should write to John Ashcroft, the American attorney-general, requesting the return of jewels from the former presidential palaces, and even the wads of dollars found with Saddam at the time of his arrest. These were the familys personal wealth, they said, and not state property.																								Raghad is reluctant to discuss politics as she is wary of offending her hosts, the Jordanian royal family. I am sorry that Americans are being killed in Iraq, but they invaded our country and that is unfortunately the result, she said. 																								Raghads svelte figure is impressive for a woman who bore her first child when she was 16 and had had four more by the time she was 26. The look is, however, not all down to visits to the gym  it also owes something to surgery. 																								Jordanians who visited the Amman Surgical Hospital last summer were told Raghad had undergone cosmetic surgery on her breasts, and a tummy tuck last August, shortly after her brothers Uday and Qusay were killed in a shoot-out with US forces in Iraq. At the same time, survivors of the bomb attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad were being treated in nearby wards.																								Raghads interest in her looks at a time when her former country is reeling infuriates former Iraqi exiles in Amman. The woman has no shame, none at all, said one. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Robot goes for a spin on red planet
																								Pasadena (California), Jan. 15 (Reuters): Nasa scientists sent the robotic rover Spirit out for its first spin on martian soil today, commanding the six-wheeled vehicle to roll off its landing platform 12 days after it arrived on the red planet.																								Radio signals instructing Spirit to make its initial excursion were beamed to Mars at 0821 GMT, and confirmation that the rover had ventured onto the planets surface came with a return transmission about an hour and 40 minutes afterward. 																								Moments later, mission controllers received the first pictures taken by rover looking back at the lander, showing tracks left by Spirit in the Martian soil. The brief outing took Spirit only about 3 meters straight ahead but was cheered by project managers at the Pasadena-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a successful prelude to Spirits mobile search for signs of life-sustaining water. We are definitely on the surface  of Mars, declared Rob Manning, one of Nasas project managers.  The golf cart-sized explorer is to roam its surroundings  in Gusev Crater, a barren, wind-swept basin about the size  of Connecticut.

 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Adolescents who watch too much TV sleep badly
																								Chicago, June 8 (Reuters): Adolescents who watch a lot of television are more likely to develop sleeping problems than those who watch less, researchers said yesterday.																								Forty million Americans have chronic sleeping problems such as difficulty falling asleep or fitful sleeping, and the authors of an eight-year study of 759 families said the roots of the problem may be too much TV.																								A variety of factors, including heightened alertness, physiological arousal, the frightening or traumatic content of some television programmes, bright television light, and physical inactivity associated with extensive television viewing may all contribute to difficulty falling or staying asleep, wrote study author Jeffrey Johnson of the New York State Psychiatric Institute at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York.																								The study, published in The of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found that three hours or more of television viewing each day at age 14 was associated with difficulty sleeping in early adulthood.																								 Pre-school children who use a computer appear to develop better learning skills than peers who lack computer savvy, US researchers said. In a study, those exposed to a home or school computer either alone or with someone else three to four times a week scored higher on tests that gauge school readiness and cognitive development than non-users, said the study.

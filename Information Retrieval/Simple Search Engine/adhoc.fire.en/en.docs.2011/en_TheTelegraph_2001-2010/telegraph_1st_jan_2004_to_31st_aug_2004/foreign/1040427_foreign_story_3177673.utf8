 Tuesday, April 27, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Worrying Mona Lisa 																																	 Paris, April 26 (Reuters): The Mona Lisa is showing signs of wear and worried officials at the Louvre museum in Paris have ordered tests to check the condition of Leonardo da Vincis 500-year-old painting.																																	The thin panel of poplar wood, on which this mythical image is painted, is more warped than it was previously, the museum said in a statement today.																																	The Louvre has ordered an in-depth scientific and technical study of the masterpiece to determine the materials used and the state of the painting, which is particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, it said.																																	The portrait of the woman with the enigmatic smile will remain on public view throughout. The tests are due to begin in 2005, when the painting is scheduled to move to a gallery of its own following a $4.5-million refurbishment.																																	The Mona Lisa has taken on a brownish cast due to the accumulation of dust and dirt and chemical changes to the varnish covering its surface, but the museum has so far resisted pressure to restore the painting to its original colours.																													 																Shafts full of mummies Saqqara, Egypt (Reuters): French and Egyptian archaeologists said on Monday they had found more than 50 mummies buried in deep shafts south of Cairo and dating from the first millennium BC. Some of the mummies, wrapped in linen and sealed inside stone or wooden sarcophagi, are in an excellent state of preservation for the period, said Zahi Hawass, head of Egypts Supreme Antiquities Council. Hawass said Egyptians had used the network of shafts and corridors over several centuries. Its a maze of corridors with mummies everywhere, right and left, up and down. When people came, there was no more space so they put the coffins in the wall, or they cut another shaft, he said.

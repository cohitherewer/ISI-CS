 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Champ Putin returns Powell punch
				 	 Vladimir Putin trains with the Russian boxing team in Moscow. (Reuters)																								Moscow, March 15 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin swept to four more years in the Kremlin today after a runaway election triumph, but the party mood was soured by western criticism the poll had been undemocratic.																								After winning a landslide 71 per cent of the vote Putin shrugged off US charges that he had denied his rivals fair media access in the campaign for yesterdays election. But the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the human rights watchdog that has carped at Russian elections in the past, issued similar criticism to Washingtons.																								The election process overall did not adequately reflect the principle necessary for a healthy democratic election process, the head of the OSCEs Russian election mission, Julian Peel Yates, said.																								Yates criticised the role of state-controlled media, which opponents of Putin said was heavily biased in his favour, in the election run-up. Essential elements... such as vibrant political discourse and meaningful pluralism were lacking, he said.																								US secretary of state Colin Powell and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice had suggested in interviews ahead of the poll that Putins rivals had been denied fair media access.																								But Putin brushed aside such criticism as dictated by the domestic political balance in a US election year.																								In a post-vote appearance where he exuded calm control rather than triumph the former KGB spy conceded his first four-year term had not greatly improved the lives of his 145 million people and he pledged to work to raise living standards.																								What we have done has not made Russians prosperous, he said at his election headquarters. We havent brought prosperity. It is rather the dawn of prosperity.																								Putin pledged in his next term, which under the constitution will be his last, to pursue reforms that would bring tangible benefits to Russians, a quarter of whom live in poverty.																								Signalling business-as-usual, Putin said he would attend regular Monday meetings with his cabinet and would be talking by telephone with foreign governments. Markets showed little interest in his predictable victory over five rivals. But shares in Russias Gazprom, the worlds biggest gas company, opened up 1.28 per cent after Putin said the state should make it easier to trade company equity.																								With nearly all ballots counted, Putin won 71 per cent of votes  enough for an outright victory. His closest rival, communist Nikolai Kharitonov scored 13.8 per cent.																								Putin turned US criticism back at Washington, saying democracy in the US was far from perfect. We, nearly four years ago, saw in amazement how the American voting system suffered glitches.

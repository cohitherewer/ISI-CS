 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Beyonce returns to her Destiny
				 	 Beyonce Knowles Los Angeles, Jan. 10: Beyonce  will put her recently launched career as a solo artist on  the back burner as she returns to her role as lead singer  of Destinys Child and starts work on the trios next album. 																								As she had recorded close to four dozen songs while working on her hit solo debut album Dangerously in Love, there have been reports she would put out a second solo album this spring. 																								But a spokesman for her record label, Columbia Records, on Wednesday said the reports were inaccurate and that Destinys Child would begin recording its next album in March, with release targeted for late summer or early autumn. Dangerously in Love has sold almost 2.6 million copies in the US since it came out in June and generated six Grammy nominations, putting her in a four-way tie for the most nominations in this years competition.

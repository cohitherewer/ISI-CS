 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 US adoption ring guilty of fraud
				 	 Angelina Jolie																								Seattle, June 25 (Reuters): A Hawaii woman who helped Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie adopt a Cambodian boy pleaded guilty on Wednesday to visa fraud and money laundering as part of a ring that paid poor women as little as $100 for their children, her attorney said.																								Lauryn Galindo, 53, and her sister in Seattle, Lynn Devin, received fees of $10,000 or more to arrange adoptions by US residents of children described as orphans, even though many still had parents, according to the documents.																								Devin, who pleaded guilty in December, but has not yet been sentenced, and Galindo have agreed to surrender all property associated with the crimes.																								The sisters operated an agency called Seattle International Adoptions, which paired hundreds of children from Cambodia with adoptive parents from 1997 to 2001, when suspicious US immigration authorities halted adoptions from the impoverished Southeast Asian country.																								In one instance, Galindo faxed Devin documents with a notation saying: Father dead  mother very poor  Kampong Speu, referring to a 4-year-old girl who was with her birth mother in Cambodia, court documents show.																								Devin and Galindo then directed the adoptive parents to pay $100 to the birth mother and paid $3,500 to the Kampong Speu orphanage, described as Cambodian ministry clerks, employees or officials in the plea agreement.																								Jolie adopted her Cambodian-born son, Maddox, last year after meeting him in an orphanage in November 2001.

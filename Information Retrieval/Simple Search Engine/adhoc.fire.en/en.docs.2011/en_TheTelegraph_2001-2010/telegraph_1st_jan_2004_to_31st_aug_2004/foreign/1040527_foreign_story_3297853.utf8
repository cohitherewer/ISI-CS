 Thursday, May 27, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Fast and faithless																																	 Berlin, May 26 (Reuters): Dont trust a man with a fast car.																																	Porsche drivers are less faithful than any other group of car owners, with almost 50 per cent of them cheating on their partners, a survey published in German magazine Mens Car has revealed.																																	Among German men, Porsche drivers were the least faithful, with 49 per cent admitting infidelity, followed by BMW drivers at 46 per cent. Among women, Audi drivers were the least reliable, 41 per cent admitting to affairs.																																	The most faithful group were owners of Opel-Vauxhall cars, with only 31 per cent of male and 28 per cent of female drivers in Germany having committed adultery.																																	The survey was carried out by Hamburg-based opinion poll institute Gewis, which questioned 2,253 male and female drivers aged 20 to 50. The results follow similar findings from the same magazine showing that male BMW drivers had the most sex.

 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 Republicans dig up Clarkes past
				 	 Richard Clarke																								Washington, March 27 (Reuters): Republicans broadened their drive to discredit White House critic Richard Clarke yesterday by questioning whether the former counterterrorism official had lied in testifying two years ago about the September 11, 2001, attacks.																								The latest move in the fracas over President George W. Bushs anti-terror and Iraq war policies came as it was disclosed that congressional Republicans were trying to declassify closed-door testimony Clarke gave in July 2002 before Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees. Such declassification would be a rare step for Congress.																								Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican, charged that Clarkes testimony in 2002 conflicted with his appearance this week before a bipartisan commission investigating the September 11 attacks.																								Clarke testified on Wednesday that Bush had failed to heed threats that such attacks might be in the offing and, once they occurred, focused on Iraq rather al Qaida. Mr Clarke has told two entirely different stories under oath, Frist declared on the Senate floor, charging Clarke had said in 2002 that the administration had actively sought to address the threat posed by al Qaida before the attacks.																								It is one thing for Mr Clarke to dissemble in front of the media ... but if he lied under oath to the US Congress it is a far, far more serious matter, Frist said.																								The (House) intelligence committee is seeking to have Mr Clarkes testimony declassified to actually permit an examination of (his) two differing accounts. Loyalty to any administration will be no defence if it is found he lied. The decision to declassify would be made by the White House in consultation with federal agencies with a stake in the intelligence information involved.																								Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat who chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2002, backed the call to declassify, Clarkes testimony but added: To the best of my recollection, there is nothing inconsistent or contradictory in that testimony and what Mr Clarke has said this week.

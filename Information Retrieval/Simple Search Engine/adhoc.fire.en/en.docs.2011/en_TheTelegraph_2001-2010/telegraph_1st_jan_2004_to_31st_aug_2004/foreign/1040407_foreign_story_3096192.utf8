 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Pak arrests nine militants
																								Karachi, April 6 (Reuters): Pakistani police have arrested nine suspected Islamic militants in connection with a suicide bombing at a US mission in 2002 and a separate attack on a hotel that killed 11 French nationals, police said today.																								The men belonged to the shadowy Harkat-ul Mujahideen al-Alami and include the groups leader Syed Sohail Akhtar, known as Mustafa, said police chief Syed Kamal Shah. 																								They were detained in Karachi in overnight raids, he said.																								Its a huge success, said Shah. Their arrest should convey a message to all terrorists that one day they will have to face the law. Police found a large cache of weapons and bomb-making material with them, he added.																								The arrests come during Pakistans biggest crackdown on Islamic militants since joining the US-led war on terror in 2001 and follow a siege in Pakistans tribal region last month in which at least 167 militants were captured and 63 killed.																								Shah said the nine suspects were involved in a June 14, 2002, suicide bombing at the US consulate in Karachi that killed 12 Pakistanis. 																								The group also carried out a similar attack outside the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi in May 2002, he added.																								Eleven French technicians and three Pakistanis died when a suicide bomber blew up a car parked in front of the Sheraton, the deadliest attack on foreigners in Pakistan since President Pervez Musharraf allied himself with Washington.																								Police blame Harkat-ul Mujahideen al-Alami for at least 30 attacks in Karachi, including the bombing of the Macedonian consulate in December 2002 and explosions at 21 gas stations owned by two foreign oil companies, Shell Pakistan and Caltex.																								Mustafa is the man who dropped the suicide bombers both at the US consulate and at the Sheraton Hotel. He motivated the bombers, said Shah.																								Harkat-ul Mujahideen al Alami is a splinter faction of Harkat-ul Mujahideen, a key guerrilla group that fought against India in Kashmir.																								It changed its name from Harkat-ul Ansar after being declared a terrorist group by the US in the late 1990s.

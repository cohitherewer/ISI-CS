 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 William ponders services career
				 	 Prince William at the Prince of Wales farm in Gloucestershire, western England. (Reuters)																								London, May 29 (Reuters): Britains Prince William said today he may follow family tradition when he finishes university and pursue a career in the armed forces. 																								The 21-year-old student gave the broadest hint yet he would follow in the footsteps of his father, uncles and grandfather.																								A career in the armed services would be the best thing at the moment because it would be lovely to recognise all the hard work that the armed forces are doing, the prince told reporters during a photocall at his father the Prince of Wales farm in Gloucestershire. I wouldnt do it (go into the armed services) reluctantly because I really value all the efforts and the professionalism of those guys.																								I would do it wholeheartedly and enjoy doing it.																								Joining a branch of Britains armed forces is seen as a rite of passage for young male royals. Even the Queens youngest son, the Earl of Wessex, spent several months with the Royal Marines before quitting to make his way as a television producer.																								William, who is second in line to the throne after his father, said choosing a career was not the most pressing thing on his mind.																								I just want to graduate and pass my exams, said the prince who is studying geography at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.																								During a recent holiday in Swtzerland with his father Charles, William had said it was awesome to be back with his father, adding: Its been too long. 																								Prince William at 21 is a vastly different creation from his father at the same age. And that is largely owing to Charles insistence that, in so far as is possible, his elder son be allowed to grow up away from scrutiny.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 UK radical partys bank accounts closed
				 	 British National Party leader Nick Griffin. (Reuters)London, July 16 (Reuters): UK bank Barclays Plc is closing accounts held by the far-Right British National Party (BNP) after the BBC filmed party members saying they had assaulted Muslims, a source familiar with the matter said today.																								Barclays will shut about five accounts linked to the BNP, not all of which are registered in the partys name, the source added. Britains third-biggest bank by assets was already reviewing its position on the BNP before the BBCs film, the source said.																								The bank had been looking at the situation for some time, but the BBC documentary last night provided evidence enabling the bank to act, the source said. A Barclays spokeswoman declined to comment on the BNP.																								As a general rule, Barclays will provide a banking service to legally constituted political or campaigning organisations in regions where there is a democratic government and an effective legal and regulatory system, Barclays said in a statement.																								Barclays may make exceptions to the rule if a customer could damage the banks reputation or cause loss of other business, Barclays said.																								Who do these people think they are? a BNP spokesman said when asked by Reuters to comment. We are getting bigger and bigger. We will be watching them.																								When they (Barclays) banked with South Africa they dropped that pretty quickly, the cowards.																								Barclays shut its South African business in 1986 after UK students boycotted the bank, denying it potentially affluent customers.																								The BBC documentary, shown last night, has brought furious reactions from Britains Muslims and government, and has undercut the BNPs efforts to cultivate a more moderate image.																								In secretly recorded footage in the northern town of Keighley, BNP leader Nick Griffin  who recently hosted French National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen  railed against the Quran and acknowledged his views were legally dangerous.																								Thats the way that this wicked, vicious faith has expanded through a handful of cranky lunatics about 1,300 years ago until its now sweeping country after country, he said.																								Other footage in The Secret Agent showed a BNP member expressing a wish to blow up mosques with a rocket launcher and to machine-gun worshippers with about a million bullets. Another member told how he put dog faeces through an Asian shops letterbox, while a third describes how he beat up a Muslim man. 																								Im kicking away ... it was fantastic, he said.

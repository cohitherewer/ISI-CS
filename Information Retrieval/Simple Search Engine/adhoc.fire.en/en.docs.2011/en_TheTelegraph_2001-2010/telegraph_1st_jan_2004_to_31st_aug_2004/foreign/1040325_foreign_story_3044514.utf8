 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 At the end of the day, worst cliche is the best
 GRAHAM TIBBETTSAt the end of the day, there was basically no competition.																								The most irritating phrase in the English language, nominated by straight-talkers around the world, has been identified as that staple of the football managers post-match interview.																								At the end of the day was a clear winner over at this moment in time in a poll of 5,000 members of the Plain English Campaign. As part of its 25th anniversary, the organisation compiled a top ten of the most hackneyed expressions in the language. In third place was a four-letter word used as, like, a form of punctuation. 																								Other linguistic howlers that caused widespread annoyance include with all due respect (number four), to be honest (five), and  a particular favourite of unimaginative politicians  going forward (eight). Those stock phrases of the corporate world  lets touch base (six) and blue sky (thinking) (10)  also drew the ire of those who prefer to say what they mean. I hear what youre saying and absolutely were also in the top 10.																								Lying just beyond the top 10 was between a rock and a hard place and its not rocket science. These phrases are used so often they are used without thinking, said John Lister, a spokesperson for the Plain English Campaign.																								When readers come across tired expressions like these, they tune out and completely miss the message.																								When these phrases are first used a lot of them serve a purpose as they are a fresh new way of describing something, but when they are used over and over again for the wrong reasons they lose any meaning. He pinpointed to be honest as the phrase that most rankled with him: It means the next thing that will come out of their lips will not be honest. But the worst offenders are not confined to the Queens English. 																								We have members in over 70 countries and they say the same irritating phrases appear in their languages too, said Lister.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

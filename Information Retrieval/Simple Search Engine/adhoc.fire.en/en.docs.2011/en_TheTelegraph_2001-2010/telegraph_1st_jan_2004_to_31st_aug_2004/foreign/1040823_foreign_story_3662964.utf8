 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 US tanks close in on Shia shrine
				 	 An Iraqi Shia, part of a group of human shields at the shrine of Imam Ali in Najaf, prays for the protection of the holy site. (AFP)																								Najaf, Aug. 22 (Reuters): US helicopter gunships pounded Shia militias in the holy Iraqi city of Najaf today as tanks rumbled to within 800 metres of a holy shrine at the centre of a near three-week insurgency.																								With talks aimed at ending the siege of the Imam Ali mosque stalled, US forces appeared to have tightened their noose around the old city, a stronghold of rebels loyal to radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.																								Near Najaf, clashes between US troops and militias yesterday killed 40 people in the town of Kufa, a Shia bastion from where Sadr has led Friday prayers. Interior ministry officials said the dead were militias and civilians.																								Rounds of heavy-calibre fire from armoured vehicles rattled across the labyrinth of narrow streets that lead to the gold-domed mosque in Najaf, where Mehdi militias remain holed up in defiance of a government demand they disband and leave.																								A Reuters witness said US tanks advanced to their closest positions to the shrine since the siege began and drew mortar fire from Mehdi militias.																								There were no immediate reports of casualties from the latest fighting, which erupted after negotiators failed to agree on the terms of a handover of the mosque by Sadrs forces to Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraqs most respected Shia cleric.																								Earlier today, a US military gunship unleashed rapid cannon and howitzer fire on the rebels.																								Sadr, a young firebrand who has become a major headache for the US-backed interim government, has insisted Sistani send a delegation to take an inventory of precious items in the mosque  thought to include jewellery, relics and carpets  to head off any claim Sadrs men had stolen anything.																								Sistani, in London recovering from surgery, has said he cannot form the committee in the current circumstances. Speaking through his aides, the elusive Sadr, who has called for an end to the US military occupation, had earlier said his militia would continue to guard the mosque after any handover.																								The uprising, in which hundreds have died, has helped drive world oil prices to record highs and is a brazen challenge to the authority of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, who took over from US-led occupiers only two months ago.																								Allawi had threatened to storm the mosque, but any bloody takeover could infuriate Iraqs majority Shia population and further destabilise the country ahead of scheduled elections in January. The mosque is the holiest Shia shrine in Iraq.																								North of Baghdad, a suicide car bomb blew up near a convoy carrying Iraqi officials near the restive town of Baquba, killing two people and wounding eight, a police officer said. The car bomber appeared to have been targeting Ghasan al-Ghadren, the towns deputy mayor, police said. The official was slightly wounded, the health ministry said.																								An Indonesian worker and two Iraqis were killed during a road ambush in the northern city of Mosul in which a Filipino was also wounded, Iraqi police said. The Filipino said he and the Indonesian were engineers working for a unit of German conglomerate Siemens.

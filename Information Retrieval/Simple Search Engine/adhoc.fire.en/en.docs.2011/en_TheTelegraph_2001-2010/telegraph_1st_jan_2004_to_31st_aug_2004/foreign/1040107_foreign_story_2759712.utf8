The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Renamed road links Iran, Egypt
				 	 A cleric crosses Tehrans Khaled Islambouli street. (AFP)																								Tehran, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Iran and Egypt have agreed to restore diplomatic relations severed 25 years ago, Irans Vice-President Mohammad Ali Abtahi said today.																								The two countries have decided to restore ties. Its a definite move and right now they are making the preparations, Abtahi said.																								 By working together, Iran and Egypt can become an influential power in world issues, he added.																								An Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman said he could not confirm reports that Egypt and Iran had agreed to restore ties. 																								I advise you to stay tuned, said another Egyptian official, who asked not to be identified.																								Abtahis comments followed the decision today by Tehran City Council to rename a street that had honoured the assassin of Egypts late President Anwar Sadat, thus removing a major obstacle to the restoration of ties between the two countries.																								The official Irna news agency said the council had changed Khaled Islambouli street to Intifada street, after the Palestinian uprising, at the request of Irans foreign ministry.																								Iran and Egypt have expressed a desire in recent weeks to patch up their differences. Cairo had demanded Iran rename the street before it would contemplate restoring relations.																								This is a step in accordance with (Irans) detente policy and trust-building with all countries, especially Islamic countries, Irna quoted foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi as saying.																								For the same reasons that relations with Egypt were cut they should now be restored because it will help the Palestinians and they themselves (the Palestinians) want it, Asefi said.																								Iran broke ties with Egypt shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution for striking the Camp David peace deal with Israel and hosting Irans exiled shah, who died in Cairo in 1980 and remains buried there.																								Islambouli, an Islamic radical who opposed the Israeli-Egyptian peace deal, shot Sadat in 1981. He was later executed.																								Changing the name of Khaled Islambouli street was not a condition for restoring ties with Egypt, Asefi said.																								But because any name is symbolic it was necessary for us to respect some (Egyptian) concerns.																								By early afternoon, the street sign had not been changed and a huge mural of Islambouli on the side of a building overlooked the street. 																								A caption reads: In honour of Lieutenant Islambouli, the Revolutionary Execution Agent of Sadat.																								Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met on the sidelines of a conference in Geneva last month  the first such meeting for more than two decades.																								The renaming of the street by Khatamis reformist government faced some opposition from religious hardliners in Iran.																								The hardline Jomhuri-ye Eslami newspaper, in an editorial today, referred to Islambouli as a martyr and said changing the name of the street that honoured him was an insult to Islamic and revolutionary values and causes.																								Iran has used street names to score diplomatic points against several other countries.																								One street adjacent to the British embassy in Tehran, for example, is called Bobby Sands street after the Irish Republican Army prisoner who died on hunger strike in Belfast in 1981.

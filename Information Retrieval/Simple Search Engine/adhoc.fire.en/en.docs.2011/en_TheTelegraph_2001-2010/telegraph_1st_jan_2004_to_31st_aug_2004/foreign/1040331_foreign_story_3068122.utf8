 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Gunfire rocks Tashkent, 20 die
																								Tashkent, March 30 (Reuters): Uzbek special forces attacked a suspected Islamic militant hideout in a Tashkent suburb today killing 16 fighters, three police officers and one resident dead, a day after bomb blasts killed 19 in the former Soviet Central Asian country.																								Yesterdays blasts, two caused by female suicide bombers, raised concern in Washington which uses an airbase here for operations in Afghanistan. Uzbek forces today struck what they called a terrorist group in a city suburb. We have counted five bodies of the terrorists and police say there are seven more lying in the entrance hall, a local reporter allowed on the scene after fighting ended said.																								One Islamist group accused by the hardline secularist government of President Islam Karimov of carrying out yesterdays attack denied the charge. It said government had orchestrated the blasts in Tashkent and the ancient city of Bukhara to justify a crackdown on legitimate political opposition.																								Whoever carried out the attacks, the response came quickly.																								They are barricaded inside an apartment block and police fired several volleys from rocket-propelled grenades at them, a witness said as the attack was mounted in a residential area. The area has been heavily blocked by heavy army trucks reinforced by police cordons, he said.																								The former Soviet Central Asian state has drawn harsh criticism from western countries and rights groups for its tough tactics against Islamic opposition, including accusations of widespread torture.																								The region, also including Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, is regarded in Russia as the soft underbelly of the former Soviet Union. Moscow, fighting separatists in its mainly Muslim region of Chechnya, shares Tashkents concern about any Islamist activity or infiltration into the area from Afghanistan. Zakirov said the government had the situation in hand. Theres no panic among the population. All industrial enterprises and state institutions are working as usual. The situation is under the control of the authorities, he said.																								In Washington, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the US stood firmly behind its Central Asian ally.

 HENRY SAMUEL AND CAROLINE DAVIES				 	 File picture of President George W. Bush at the World War II Normandy American Cemetery. (AFP) Paris, Jan. 2: Germany  has been invited to join the D-Day anniversary commemoration  for the first time. The move is bound to stoke up painful  memories for former combatants in Britain, the US and Canada.  Almost 133,000 allied troops landed on D-Day and casualties  numbered more than 10,000.																								The decision to invite Germany, taken on the initiative of France, followed a behind-the-scenes debate before events to mark the 50th anniversary in 1994. Chancellor Helmut Kohl was known to have felt insulted by the decision to exclude Germany.																								Yesterday Chancellor Gerhard Schroders office said he was thrilled by the invitation, has accepted and will take part in the ceremonies to mark the 60th anniversary on June 6.																								France, the main organiser of the events, said the decision showed a determination to look to the future. 																								There is a strong will for a European defence force, in which Germany will play an integral role, an Elysee spokesperson said. 																								Inviting them to this 60th anniversary is a strong symbolic gesture that we must look toward the future.																								She said invitations had been sent to numerous countries which had not previously taken part in the ceremonies.																								We want this anniversary to have a universal character, she added, but said the presidential palace was still awaiting confirmation from other countries and that it was too early to give details about the events organisation.																								A spokesperson for the ministry of defence said that Britain had been consulted about the invitation to the Germans by the Paris-based committee co-ordinating the commemoration. The committee included British representatives and was in charge of the arrangements for the anniversary, he said.																								We are not disappointed about Chancellor Schroder coming. Germany is a close ally of ours now and the Germans have been involved in other Second World War commemoration, he said.																								Major General John Carpenter, a former president and chairman of the Dunkirk Veterans Association who also took part in D-Day, welcomed the move. I can only speak for myself, but time has marched on, he said.																								It has been 60 years. There will be some people, of course, who will be upset. But as for the majority, and they are in their eighties now, I think their attitude will be live and let live. I have no hard feelings. We were all doing our job. It is a new generation now and the more we can do to mend fences the better.																								But Lt Richard Camrass, 91, who was rescued at Dunkirk in 1940 and who later took part in the Salerno landings in Italy, said: I think it is quite out of order to invite top German politicians. We should remember that 60 years ago, although we maintain normal relations now with Germany, they were killing hundreds of British, Russian, American and other Allied servicemen. 																								I cannot see why German politicians should be involved in the mainly American and British commemorations. These invitations are, in my opinion, utterly uncalled for. I remember the terrible casualties we suffered at the Salerno beachhead and it is an insult to the memory of those British and Allied soldiers who were killed.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

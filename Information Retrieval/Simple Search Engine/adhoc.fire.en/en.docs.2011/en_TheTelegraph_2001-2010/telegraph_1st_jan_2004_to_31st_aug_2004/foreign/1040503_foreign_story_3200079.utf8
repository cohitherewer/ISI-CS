(Reuters)																								Bangkok, May 2 (Reuters): Separatism is not driving violence in southern Thailand, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said yesterday, but local media reported the military is probing the rebellions links with regional militant groups.																								No one has a very clear idea what motivated scores of machete-wielding Muslim youths to storm heavily armed security posts on Wednesday in three southern, Muslim-majority provinces. The uprising killed 108 suspected militants and injured six.																								The Prime Minister suggested in his weekly radio address the young attackers were being manipulated by drugs traffickers and smuggling syndicates. But his interior minister, Bhokin Balakula, said on Friday that while criminals and drug traffickers were involved, separatists are the main players here.																								Local newspapers quoted military intelligence officials as saying at least some of the insurgents had contacts with Jemaah Islamiah (JI), a Southeast Asian Muslim network that is seeking to establish an Islamic state across much of the region.																								One of the militants killed in Wednesdays violence had the letters JI emblazoned on the back of his green shirt.																								Authorities in the region say the group is linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network.																								The suspected militants were killed when they tried to steal weapons from security posts in early morning raids across the Muslim south. It was the latest and most serious incident of Muslim unrest that first flared up at the start of the year.																								Some claim that separatists were behind the violence, Thaksin said. There are mixed factors, but one thing for sure is that those insurgents were used.																								The Bangkok Post yesterday quoted a military source confirming the leaders of the uprising were linked to JI and likely had received training abroad. One of the accused leaders arrested after the uprising, Mama Mateeyoh, also reportedly wore a T-shirt with the letters JI on the front and back.																								The government has been under pressure because security forces, tipped off to expect the attacks, responded with massive firepower, including rocket-propelled grenades.																								In Geneva, the acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Bertrand Ramcharan called on Thai authorities to carry out swift and transparent investigations of the violence.																								Across the border in Muslim-majority Malaysia, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said his country was willing to offer refuge to Thais fleeing the trouble.																								Relations between the neighbours have been strained since Thai officials said in March militants behind renewed violence in the area had taken refuge in Malaysia.																								Some foreign countries seem to be trying to interfere in our internal affairs, but just let me handle it, Thaksin said in his radio address. If they do not understand us, never mind. We do not rely on them.																								Southern Thailand was quiet yesterday as stunned families tried to understand why children who had not exhibited signs of religious radicalism had so quickly transformed into militants.																								A senior general said the army, which quelled a low-key separatist insurgency in the hilly, impoverished region in the 1970s and 1980s, could face thousands more rebels.																								The army is deploying two more battalions in the south next week to provide security for schools in the restive provinces, which are due to reopen on May 17, the commander of the Southern Army Region said yesterday.																								A total of eight battalions, each with about 500 soldiers, have been sent to the south since the unrest began in January.																								Many of the fresh soldiers had experience in a UN peacekeeping force in East Timor. Some will be in plain clothes, mingling with the local population, and the force also includes snipers, Lieutenant General Pisan Wattanawongkeeree told a meeting of school executives in Narathiwat province bordering Malaysia. You can be sure that these guys are well trained. When they aim to shoot the eyes, they hit the eyes, Pisan said.																								Thailand is reeling from the worst case of separatist violence to hit a country that is more famous for its beach resorts and titillating night life.																								Security guards in Bangkok were inspecting cars for bombs at office buildings yesterday.

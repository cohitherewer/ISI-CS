 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Prescott the saviour
 NIGEL BUNYAN AND DAVID SAPSTED				 	 Cars lie piled on top of each other in Boscastle, England, after a flash flood sent a wall of water tearing through the tourist spot. Dozens of villagers were rescued. (AFP)																								London, Aug. 17: An injured kayaker spoke of his astonishment yesterday on discovering that the man who had rescued him from white-water rapids was the acting Prime Minister.																								John Prescott was on a trip to the National White Water Centre near Lake Bala, north Wales, when he saw Graham Cook get into difficulty.																								The experienced kayaker had just negotiated the course when he was struck by an inflatable raft used by onlookers. The collision forced him underwater with the raft pressing down on his kayak.																								When he eventually freed himself and struggled to the surface, bleeding profusely from a gash to his face, two men pulled him from the water. I got dragged along while still inside my craft, Cook, 35, a plumber, said yesterday. 																								I smashed my head against some rocks but managed to get out of the kayak. I had to swim over the next rapids fall with the raft still almost on top of me. It was a very frightening experience. We are talking about boiling white water here. After what seemed like ages, I managed to get close to the bank. There was no way I could hang on to the rocks at the side because the current was too strong.																								The next thing I knew, somebody had grabbed hold of the straps of my buoyancy aid and somehow managed to pull me out. I had blood pouring from my face and I was very dazed and confused.																								Someone wiped my face to get rid of some of the blood and they helped me along to the medical centre. 																								It was only later that Cook learned he had been rescued by the man standing in for Blair while he is on holiday.																								I honestly didnt recognise him, Cook said. When the staff at the medical centre told me it was a complete surprise. After all, its not every day that the man who runs the country rescues you from a dangerous predicament. Hes a bit of a hero, really.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

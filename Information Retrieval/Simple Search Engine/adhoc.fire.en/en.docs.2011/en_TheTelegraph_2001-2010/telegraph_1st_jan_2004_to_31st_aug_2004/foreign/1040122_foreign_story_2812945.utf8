 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Iran has no WMD, says Khatami
																								Davos (Switzerland), Jan. 21 (Reuters): Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said today that Tehran had never sought to acquire weapons of mass destruction.																								Iran has never been after weapons of mass destruction, Khatami said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.																								We vehemently oppose the manufacture and production of nuclear weapons. For this reason we extend sincere and honest cooperation with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), he said. In response to a question, Khatami said: I categorically deny that there was shipment of nuclear material by (North) Korea to Iran. We have nothing to hide. 																								Earlier in Tehran, Khatami today ruled out resigning over a ban on liberal candidates standing in parliamentary elections and said he would do all he could to ensure a free and fair vote next month. I have the intention to continue my task and my service to the people, Khatami said.																								Iranian Vice-President Mohammad Ali Abtahi had said Khatami and his reformist government were ready to quit over the hardline Guardian Councils decision to bar nearly half of 8,200 hopefuls from the February 20 vote. 																								Abtahi later clarified that his remarks repeated previous comments by Khatami that reformists should either stick together or leave together.

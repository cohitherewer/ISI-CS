 Friday, July 16, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Pierced practice																																	 Berlin, July 15 (Reuters): A German acupuncture patient was left pierced with needles in a clinic after a therapist forgot about her, locked up his practice and went home, police in Hanover said today.																																	The 41-year-old woman from the north German town had booked an afternoon session of the ancient Chinese therapy which involves inserting needles into the skin and is believed to prevent disease and relieve pain.																																	The doctor left her in the treatment room for what she assumed would be a short while, especially since she still had needles embedded in her body.																																	After 90 minutes the woman began to shout for attention. Getting no response, she realised she was alone and trapped in the building. She alerted police by phone and was later set free when the doctor returned.																													 																Extra energy London (Reuters): Britains Science Museum says it is considering a radical way of paying its hefty energy bills  using visitors excrement. The central London museum said it was considering taking the waste from its 14 toilet blocks and converting it into electricity. With free admission it would be a great way for visitors to give something back to the museum and help keep the overheads down, said the museums head Jon Tucker. We have almost 3 million visitors each year and have huge electricity bills. The museum said the plan would be to siphon off waste from the toilets, store it and then either burn it as fuel in a mini-power station or turn it into electricity using a microbial fuel cell.

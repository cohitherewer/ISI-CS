																								Washington, May 30 (Reuters): A handgun that Saddam Hussein was clutching when US forces captured him in a hole in Iraq last December is now kept by President George W. Bush at the White House, Time magazine reported today.																								The magazine quoted a visitor who had been shown the gun, which is kept in a small study off the Oval Office where Bush displays memorabilia. It is the same room where former President Bill Clinton had some of his encounters with former intern Monica Lewinsky. He really liked showing it off, Time quoted a visitor who had seen the gun as saying.

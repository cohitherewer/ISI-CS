 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Basra Shias march for direct polls
																								Basra, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of demonstrators shouting: No to America marched today in a huge show of strength by the Shia majority against US plans for a transitional Iraqi government.																								An aide to Iraqs most revered Shia cleric said Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani could issue an edict banning Iraqis from backing a US appointed interim cabinet if Washington did not hold direct elections for a sovereign Iraqi government.																								An edict by Sistani could turn many Shias  who make up about 60 per cent of Iraqis  against the US at a time when US-led occupation forces are battling insurgents in the centre of the country, known as the Sunni triangle. 																								In mainly Shia Basra, Iraqs second city, demonstrators chanted: Yes, yes for Islam; No America, No Saddam and slogans promoting unity with minority Sunnis.  Sistani has objected to US plans  for a transitional Iraqi assembly to be selected by regional  caucuses rather than an election.

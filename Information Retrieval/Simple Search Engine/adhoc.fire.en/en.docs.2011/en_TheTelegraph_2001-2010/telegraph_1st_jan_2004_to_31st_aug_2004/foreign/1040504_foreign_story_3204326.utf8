The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Warning on worm spreading its net
																								Helsinki, May 3 (Reuters): The fast-spreading Sasser computer worm has infected hundreds of thousands of PCs globally and the number could rise sharply, a top computer security official said on Monday.																								If you take a normal Windows PC and connect to the Internet, you will be infected in 10 minutes (without protection), Mikko Hypponen, anti-virus research director at Finnish data security firm F-Secure said.																								It seems to be gradually getting worse, but it could jump as the US wakes up, he said.																								F-Secure says the worm, which surfaced over the weekend, automatically spreads via the Internet to computers using the Microsoft Windows operating system, especially Windows 2000 and XP.																								The spread of the virus has been muted so far, Hypponen said, as it emerged on a weekend, and with holidays closing offices in places like the UK and Japan today. But the spread was expected to worsen as the work week hits its stride, Hypponen said, adding he believes the worm originated in Russia.																								It was not immediately known what impact the worm was having on computer networks of US companies as they started the business day.																								US carrier Delta Air Lines suffered a computer glitch on Saturday that caused delays and cancellations of certain flights across its system, but a spokesperson said there was no information yet as to the cause.																								A Microsoft representative was not immediately available for comment, but said in a statement that customers could protect themselves by erecting personal firewalls that separate internal networks from public networks, and by downloading Microsoft security patches.																								The company also said it was working with law enforcement officials, including the Northwest CyberCrime Taskforce, to analyse the worm and to identify those responsible for it. 																								With Sasser it seems that companies are (using software) patches better and more quickly than last year (with virus Blaster), but for those that are hit, they are hit hard, Hypponen said.																								The current worm does not need to be activated by double-clicking on an attachment, and can strike even if no one is using the PC at the time. When a machine is infected, error messages may appear and the computer may reboot repeatedly.

Brave babyBeijing (PTI): A premature baby, described as smaller than a kitten at birth has been discharged from hospital after 111 days of intensive treatment, which was believed by Chinese doctors to be a miracle. Born 15 weeks earlier than normal, the infant boy weighed just 900 grams at birth. He was smaller than a kitten and his blood vessels were as thin as a thread, a hospital staff with the No. 2 Peoples hospital of Shenzhen, south Chinas Guangdong province, said after the baby left for home. His life was threatened by suffocation, anaemia, electrolyte disturbance and apnoea syndromes and his weight fell to 750 grams. Normally babies weigh 2,500 grams after 40 weeks of pregnancy. It was very rare to save such a small and weak baby, doctor Li Qi said, adding that luckily the little hero survived. 																													 																Gymnast gut																																	Ljubljana (Slovenia), (Reuters): A British junior gymnastics team member fell from the fourth floor of a Ljubljana hotel but suffered only a broken ankle after putting his gymnastics skills into practice, the Slovenian press reported Tuesday. Probably my gymnastic knowledge and experience saved me, the Slovenske Novice newspaper quoted 17-year-old Steven Jehu as saying. There was a big window that could be opened. I leaned out over a metal bar, but the bar suddenly broke. I couldnt do anything. I fell, Jehu said. The gymnast did a somersault while falling from the window, which was more than 33 feet from the ground, and braced himself for a regular gymnastic landing. Jehu is one of five British junior athletes who traveled to Ljubljana last week for the European gymnastics championships on April 15-18. I got away with it all right, although the European championships for me ended before they even began, he said.

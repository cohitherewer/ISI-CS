 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Many faces of men for women
																								London, March 18 (Reuters): Women baffled by men may find enlightenment in a book which identifies 27 types of man, from heroic John Waynes to sexless teddy bears.																								Researcher Stephen Whitehead believes all men fit into one of his character types and hopes women will use the book to learn more about their husbands and boyfriends. Some of the faces may not seem too attractive, Dr Whitehead, senior lecturer at Keele University, central England, said. But a lot of women like the strength of the Rottweiler, Neanderthal or even the Mr Angry.																								Whitehead said he was inspired to write The Many Faces of Men after he met a strong Alpha male type who left him wondering what sort of man he had become. He drew from a 25-year career as an academic, sports coach and pub manager.																								Among the types he identified were the Achilles, a charming but flawed sophisticate named after Homers hero in the Iliad and illustrated in the book by former US President Bill Clinton. Achilles will particularly enjoy sex in risky situations and places, the book says. He is a man who could be truly special ... if only he could overcome his single flaw.																								The Adonis is handsome but vain, like his namesake in mythology, while the teddy bear is a good listener without much sex appeal.																								He is a world away from the Wayne  an old-fashioned, quiet and solid type named after the Wild West movie actor, John.

 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Militants father pleads for fair trial
				 	 Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan																								Islamabad, Aug. 17 (Reuters): The father of a computer engineer detained in Pakistan last month for suspected links with al Qaida filed a petition today calling for his son to be produced in court and urging authorities not to extradite him.																								According to Pakistani intelligence officials, Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan was seized on July 13, and has proved a key source of information on the identity of al Qaida operatives and plans the network had to launch attacks on British and US targets. Babar Awan, lawyer for Khans father Hidayat Noor Khan, filed the petition in the Rawalpindi branch of the Lahore High Court.																								Whatever the boy may be, he has a right to be defended and a right to be dealt with in accordance with law, Awan said, adding Khan should have been produced in court within 24 hours of his capture in order for his arrest to be regularised.																								He added that Khans father feared for his sons safety, since there was a large bounty on his head, and wanted assurances that he would not be handed over to US custody.																								He should be produced in court, said Awan. 																								Let them prove the allegations. The father says his son was made a scapegoat and they want a so-called confessional statement from his son.

 ROBIN WRIGHT AND BRADLEY GRAHAM				 	 Rumsfeld: Under attack																								May 6: President Bush privately admonished defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld yesterday, a senior White House official said, as other US officials blamed the Pentagon for failing to act on repeated recommendations to improve conditions for thousands of Iraqi detainees and release those not charged with crimes. 																								Bush is not satisfied and not happy with the way Rumsfeld informed him about the investigation into abuses by US soldiers at Baghdads Abu Ghraib prison or the quantity of information Rumsfeld provided, the senior White House official said. 																								The President was particularly disturbed at having had to learn from news reports this week about the scope of misconduct documented in an army investigative report completed in March, according to the official, who refused to be named so he could speak more candidly. 																								Other US officials said Rumsfeld and the Pentagon resisted appeals in recent months from the state department and the Coalition Provisional Authority to deal with problems relating to detainees. Secretary of state Colin Powell urged action in several White House meetings that included Rumsfeld, the officials said. 																								Its something Powell has raised repeatedly  to release as many detainees as possible  and, second, to ensure that those in custody are properly cared for and treated, said a senior state department official. 																								But the Pentagon repeatedly failed to act on both requests, said US officials, who are privately furious over a human rights disaster that they believe might have been averted if military officials had acted on their requests. 																								Defence officials sharply disputed suggestions that Rumsfeld or other senior Pentagon authorities turned a deaf ear to the appeals. They said there were no major differences between the departments of state and defence over the handling of detainees in Iraq, saying top administration officials had generally agreed on the need to reduce the number of prisoners in US military custody and ensure proper management of detention facilities. 																								It would be unfair to secretary Powell to portray the discussions among (national security) principals about this issue in the way some people seem to be trying to portray them, said Lawrence T. DiRita, the Pentagons chief spokesman.					 LOS ANGELES TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Flop auction of Lennon last sketch
London, June 18 (Reuters): An autographed sketch that John Lennon gave to a fan minutes before his 1980 murder in New York has failed to sell at auction after missing its reserve price, organisers said yesterday.																								Rock memorabilia auctioneers Cooper Owen had set a $150,000 minimum for the cartoon-style sketch. The master tape of Princes first professional recording as a 17-year- old also failed to sell.																								The highest-selling lot in the online Rock Legends auction, completed late on Wednesday, was the copyright on a series of 18 Jimi Hendrix artworks, which sold for $75,293.																								An early Hendrix studio tape, including a version of his Burning of the Midnight Lamp, went for 36,500. A red cotton shirt with puff sleeves and a ruffled front, worn by Elvis Presley in the early 1970s, sold for $4,500.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Australian star sent packing
 															- Jittery  US talks tough with pop star amp; prankster 																								Sydney, Jan. 21 (AFP): Australians were warned today to ensure they have the correct paperwork before trying to enter the US after the foreign minister found himself powerless to save a pop celebrity from deportation for having the wrong visa.																								The personal intervention of foreign minister Alexander Downer failed to save pop guru and television frontman Ian Molly Meldrum from being handcuffed, locked up for 12 hours and then unceremoniously sent packing after he arrived at Los Angeles airport without an I-visa.																								Meldrum, who has interviewed superstars such as Madonna and Michael Jackson, landed in California to interview Latin pop singer Enrique Iglesias for an Australian television station.																								But immigration officials detained him when they discovered he did not have the special visa for foreign journalists planning to work in America.																								Downer, who was already in Los Angeles for an Australia week promotion, and consular officials attempted to negotiate Meldrums release from custody but without success.																								Hes a well known Australian, hes a well-regarded Australian and is not a threat to anybody here in the US so we did what we could to try to encourage the Americans to accept Molly Meldrum, but they nevertheless decided to turn him around and we regret that, Downer told reporters in Los Angeles.																								Downer cautioned other Australians to ensure that they have the correct documentation before leaving Australia for America.

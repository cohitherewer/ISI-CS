 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Key Pak Qaida man arrested
																								Islamabad, Aug. 7 (Reuters): A senior al Qaida operative who knew Osama bin Laden and was linked to two assassination attempts on President Pervez Musharraf has been arrested in Dubai and handed over to Islamabad, Pakistani intelligence sources said today.																								Qari Saifullah Akhtar, a leader of the radical Islamic group Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami, was arrested by authorities in Dubai yesterday after Pakistan had requested his detention, and handed over today.																								Pakistans intelligence services used information gleaned from a spate of high-profile arrests of al Qaida operatives in recent weeks to track down Akhtar, described by one source as an operational head of al Qaida in Pakistan.																								He was with al Qaida chief bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar in Afghanistan at the time of the US-led war against the hardline Islamic militia late in 2001 and fled first to Saudi Arabia and then to United Arab Emirates.

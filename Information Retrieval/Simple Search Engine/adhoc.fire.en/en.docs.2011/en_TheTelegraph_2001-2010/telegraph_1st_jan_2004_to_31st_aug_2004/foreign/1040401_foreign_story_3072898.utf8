 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Spain issues warrant for wealthy Moroccan
				 	 Abdelkarim el Mejjati 																								Madrid, March 31 (Reuters): The Spanish judge investigating the Madrid train bombings issued a worldwide arrest warrant today for a wealthy Moroccan man also sought in connection with bombings in Casablanca and Riyadh last year.																								Judge Juan del Olmo issued five arrest warrants through the international police agency Interpol, and sources close to the investigation confirmed that one of them was for Abdelkarim el Mejjati. The other four suspects were not identified.																								Mejjati, 36, the son of a Moroccan father and a French mother, is described by Moroccan investigators as an Islamic holy warrior who fought in Bosnia and Afghanistan and who was last seen in Morocco shortly before September 11, 2001.																								The March 11 bombings of four Madrid commuter trains killed 191 people in the first attack in the West linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network since the September 11 strikes on New York and Washington. 																								 The attack was timed three days before Spains general election and played a role in helping the Opposition Socialists to a surprise victory that will remove a strongly pro-American party from power. 																								The five Spanish warrants were issued a day after the Spanish government identified the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group as the prime suspect in the Madrid blasts.																								Some news reports have identified Mejjati as the head of that shadowy group, also suspected of being connected to the Casablanca attacks of last May, in which 12 suicide bombers and 33 others were killed. Mejjati is also wanted by Saudi authorities in connection with suicide attacks on housing compounds in Riyadh last year. Last September the FBI issued a worldwide alert for Mejjati and three other suspects, linking them to al Qaida and saying it had intelligence they might be planning attacks against the US.																								In a separate development, Spanish authorities arrested two more people in connection to the Madrid blasts  raising the total held in the case to 20  and searched another home. Judge Del Olmo was due to question two people under arrest, including one of the two Spanish suspects.

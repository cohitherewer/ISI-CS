 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Pak anger over treatment
 AHMED RASHID																								Lahore, Feb. 2: Pakistans Opposition parties yesterday demanded nationwide protests after the government sacked the countrys leading nuclear scientist as part of an investigation into the suspected sale of nuclear technology to foreign powers.																								Abdul Qadeer Khan, 66, the architect of Pakistans nuclear programme, was sacked as a special adviser to Zafrullah Khan Jamali, the Prime Minister, on Saturday to facilitate the investigation into the suspected sale by local scientists of nuclear expertise to Iran, Libya and North Korea. 																								The decision, which came after a meeting of the countrys political and military leaders, chaired by President Pervez Musharraf, shocked a nation that reveres Khan.																								It is the ultimate insult to the people of Pakistan, said Senator Saadia Abbasi, of exiled Premier Nawaz Sharifs secular Pakistan Muslim League. The entire nation feels humiliated over the treatment being meted out to a national hero by the government.																								An alliance of six Islamic fundamentalist parties said that the West was trying to curb the nuclear capability of an Islamic nation.																								Qazi Hussain Ahmad, a leader of the alliance, said Musharraf would soon feel the wrath of the Pakistani people if he continued supporting America in its war on terror. Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistans largest religious party, called for nationwide protests to express solidarity with Khan and other nuclear officials caught up in the scandal. 																								By sacking the countrys top nuclear scientist, Musharraf is seeking to distance the army from accusations that Pakistan has been responsible for the illegal proliferation of nuclear technology.

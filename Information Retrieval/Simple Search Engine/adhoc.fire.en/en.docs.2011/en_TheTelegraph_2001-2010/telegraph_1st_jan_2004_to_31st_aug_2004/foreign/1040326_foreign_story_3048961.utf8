 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Former insider turns terror gun on Bush
																								Washington, March 25 (Reuters): Former US counterterrorism official Richard Clarke told the commission probing the September 11 attacks yesterday that President George W. Bush did not take the terrorism threat seriously enough, and the head of the CIA admitted more could have been done to foil the strikes.																								Clarke, who served the last four US Presidents, said the Clinton administration was active in tracking Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network but the Bush administration, which took office in January 2001, did not consider the issue urgent.																								I believe the Bush administration in the first eight months considered terrorism an important issue, but not an urgent issue, said Clarke, who shook Washington this week with his book directly criticising Bush.																								However, a fuming US national security adviser Condoleezza Rice hit back at Clarke yesterday and accused him shifting positions from backing Bushs war on terrorism to now questioning it. She said after his resignation 13 months ago, she invited him to lunch three weeks before the start of the US-led war against Iraq to thank him for his years of service.																								Clarke had not a word about concerns that Iraq was going to somehow take us off the path of the war on terrorism. It wouldve been easy to do, kick the others out, close the door, say: I just want you to know I think youre making a mistake. He didnt do it, she said.																								Clarke told the hearing that Bush had greatly undermined the war on terrorism after the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon by invading Iraq last year.																								Seeking to discredit Clarke, the White House released the transcript of a briefing he gave in early August 2002 praising the way the Bush team had taken over the war against al Qaida. 																								On the second of two dramatic days of open testimony, commissioner Tim Roemer, a former Democratic congressman, asked Clarke about a letter he wrote to Rice, a week before the September 11 attacks.You urge policymakers to imagine a day after hundreds of Americans lay dead at home and abroad after a terrorist attack and ask themselves what else they could have done. You write this on September 4, seven days before September 11, Roemer said. Rice said the letter from Clarke was a theoretical rather than an actual warning. Of course we all knew one day a catastrophic attack was possible.

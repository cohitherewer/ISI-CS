 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Kerry stand on abortion irks Vatican
Vatican City, April 23 (Reuters): In remarks that could influence the US presidential race, a top Vatican cardinal said today that a Catholic politician who unambiguously supports abortion should be denied communion at Mass.																								Cardinal Francis Arinze spoke amid a debate in the US over whether Democrat John Kerry should be denied communion, which Catholics believe is the body of Christ, because he supports abortion rights.																								At a news conference presenting a Vatican document restating standing rules about the celebration of Mass, Arinze was reminded of the Kerry case and asked if a priest should refuse communion to a politician who is unambiguously pro-abortion.																								Yes, he answered. If the person should not receive it, then it should not be given. Objectively, the answer is there.																								Kerry supports abortion rights and has said he would nominate only Supreme Court justices who support his position. Anti-abortion groups in the US, which is about 23 per cent Catholic, say Kerry has what they have called a perfect record of voting for legislation that allows abortion.

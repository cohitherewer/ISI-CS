 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 US, Taliban officials met before 9/11 over Osama
																								Berlin, June 4 (Reuters): US and Taliban officials met secretly in Frankfurt almost a year before the September 11 attacks to discuss terms for the Afghans to hand over Osama bin Laden, according to a German television documentary.																								But no agreement was reached and no further negotiations took place before the suicide hijackings in 2001, which bin Laden subsequently hailed in a videotape as the work of his al Qaida network.																								ZDF television quoted Kabir Mohabbat, an Afghan-American businessman, as saying he tried to broker a deal between the Americans and the purist Islamic Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, who were sheltering bin Laden. 																								He quoted the Taliban foreign minister, Mullah Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil, as saying: You can have him whenever the Americans are ready. Name us a country and we will extradite him.																								A German member of the European Parliament, Elmar Brok, confirmed to Reuters that he had helped Mohabbat in 1999 to establish initial contact with the Americans.																								I was told (by Mohabbat) that the Taliban had certain ideas about handing over bin Laden, not to the US but to a third country or to the Court of Justice in The Hague, Brok said.																								The message was: There is willingness to talk about handing over bin Laden, and the aim of the Taliban was clearly to win the recognition of the American government and the lifting of the boycott, he said, referring to the international isolation of the Taliban.

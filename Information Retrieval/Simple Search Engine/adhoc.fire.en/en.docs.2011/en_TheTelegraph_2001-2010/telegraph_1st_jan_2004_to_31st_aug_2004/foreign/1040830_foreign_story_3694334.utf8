 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 Dhaka reward for clues
																								Dhaka, Aug. 29 (PTI): Crude bombs were set off and buses torched here today ahead of the Opposition-called general strike even as the government announced a 10-million-taka reward for specific information or any clue on the grenade attack at an Awami League rally last week. 																								Several home-made bombs exploded and two parked passenger buses were torched by suspected pro-strikers here as the nation braces for another country-wide strike tomorrow, the fourth in a week, to protest the August 21 attack which killed 20 people and injured over 300. 																								The government announced the reward after a meeting of security officials. Anybody providing the investigators specific information or any clue to help unearth the matter will be given a 10 million taka reward, a home ministry official said after the meeting. The home ministry announcement came as a two-member Interpol team arrived here to probe the incident on the request of the Bangladesh government.																								Earlier, the women and youth wings of the Awami League called for a one-day nation-wide strike tomorrow to protest the attack in which its leader Sheikh Hasina escaped narrowly and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. It coincides with an earlier announced anti-bombing demonstration by the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led alliance.

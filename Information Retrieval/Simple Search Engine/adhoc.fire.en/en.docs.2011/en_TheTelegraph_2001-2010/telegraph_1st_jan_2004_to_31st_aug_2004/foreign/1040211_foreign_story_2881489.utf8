 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Widow fights for Atkins
																								New York, Feb. 10 (Reuters): The widow of diet guru Robert Atkins, who died last year after a fall, accused unscrupulous individuals yesterday of trying to use his history of heart disease to discredit his ideas about healthy eating.																								Veronica Atkins issued a statement acknowledging that her husband had been diagnosed with a heart condition known as cardiomyopathy about three years before he died, and that he had had a cardiac arrest in April 2002. But she said the condition was caused by a viral infection, and rejected any suggestion that he had died of a heart attack. 																								Dr Atkins, who championed a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, died in April last year at age 72 after slipping on an icy sidewalk and hitting his head. According to some estimates, about 10 million Americans follow the Atkins diet or some version of it.																								His widow said she was speaking out because otherwise unscrupulous individuals will continue to twist and pervert the truth in an attempt to destroy the reputation and great work of my late husband.																								These individuals have gone so far as to obtain my husbands personal and confidential medical information from the New York City medical examiners office for distribution to news organisations in direct and knowing violation of federal law, she said.

 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 HK protests test China patience
 							 - March of 10000 asks Beijing to return power to the people 				 	 Demonstrators in Hong Kong, some carrying inflatable dolls depicting Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, at the rally on Sunday. (Reuters) 																								Hong Kong, April 11 (Reuters): More than 10,000 people took to the streets of Hong Kong today to protest against Beijings ruling that it alone will determine the shape and timing of elections in the city.																								In a move sure to irk China, the protesters marched to Beijings representative office in Hong Kong chanting Return the power to the people and One man, One vote.																								The protesters, including women, children and people in wheelchairs, punched their fists in the air and waved banners that read One country, two systems fail completely and Return the power to the people. They also carried balloons with a caricature of Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa.																								The reason why Im doing this is for the future of my child, for her freedom, said housewife Bonnie Cheung, who brought her young daughter to the protest.																								It was the first mass protest organised after Chinas parliament revised clauses in Hong Kongs constitution last week, giving Beijing full control over how and when the city chooses its leaders and lawmakers.																								Its an attack on Hong Kongs legal system and its autonomy, Martin Lee, one of the citys leading democracy lawmakers, said of Bejings ruling.																								Organisers said about 20,000 people had joined the march. Police said they would not provide a number. The marchers dispersed peacefully after tying black ribbons to the gate of Beijings liaison office to symbolise their anger.																								The protest also drew hecklers. 																								All of you disgusting people, you should all be shot, one old man shouted at the marchers.																								Hong Kongs government said in a statement it had noted the concerns of the people over Chinas interpretation of the citys constitution.																								Last July, about 500,000 people took to the streets of Hong Kong over Beijings demand for an anti-subversion law. The protest, which forced the planned law to be shelved, shocked the Chinese leadership.

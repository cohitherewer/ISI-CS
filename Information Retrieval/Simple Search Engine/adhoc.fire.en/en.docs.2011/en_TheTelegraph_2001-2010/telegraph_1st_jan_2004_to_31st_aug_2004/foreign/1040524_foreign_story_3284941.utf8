The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Shadow as tour season nears
Paris, May 23 (Reuters): Terminal 2E at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport was built with a style and on a scale to match the airports fast-expanding ambitions.																								But the deaths of at least five people when a roof collapsed today has raised questions over its much vaunted design and the construction work, and left the busy international hub with a major headache as the main tourist season approaches.																								What they are going to have to find out very, very rapidly, is exactly what kind of failure this was, and then they are going to have to check elsewhere to see whether that kind of weakness exists, airline safety expert David Learmount of Flight International told Britains Sky television.																								Whether this was a construction error or... a design weakness, that has to be established right now. Is this a design weakness and they have to stop using it? Or was there actually a construction mistake?																								The terminal opened to the public last June after a commission delayed the granting of a safety certificate, and amid union complaints about working conditions during the push to finish the terminal.																								The result was a 750 million euro ($900 million) statement of French engineering style and panache: a glass, steel and concrete construction 650-m long.																								On final completion around 2007, the terminal should be able to handle 17 aircraft simultaneously, including two of the new 555-seat A380 Airbus superjumbos, say aviation experts.																								Pierre Graff, chairman of Aeroports de Paris, the Paris airports authority, said the alertness of passengers and prompt police action had helped avoid a worse tragedy.																								ADP has a five-year plan to expand boutique space by 20 per cent, a step that should enhance its attractiveness ahead of flotation in 2005.																								With 6,400 square metre of boutiques, terminal 2E has become ADPs model for its commercial expansion.																								Luxury firms Hermes and Richemonts jeweller Cartier have glassy spaces in 2Es commercial centre that also includes a cigar smoking room, a store for childrens gear, a Lafayette food hall and fashions from department store Printemps.

 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Al Jazeera plans public offer
																								Frankfurt, July 4 (Reuters): Arabic TV news channel Al Jazeera wants to sell shares to the public in two to three years and become profitable before that, a German newspaper reported its chief news editor as saying today.																								In two to three years, our shares shall be introduced at the stockmarket in Doha, Ahmed El Sheikh told German business daily Handelsblatt on the fringes of a conference in Berlin.																								The channel confirmed in Dubai that it was looking into the option of an initial public offering (IPO), but said it had not made a decision yet.																								I can confirm that the board of directors has commissioned a study into the viability of turning Al Jazeera into a private enterprise by inviting investors, a spokesperson for Al Jazeera said. This could entail a flotation at some stage.																								State-sponsored Jazeera won millions of viewers for its coverage of the US-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and after airing exclusive footage of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.																								It now plans to extend its coverage, El Sheikh told the paper. Having launched a sports channel, it wants to start a documentary channel within the next three to four months, and an English-language as well as a childrens channel next year.																								El Sheikh told the paper that Qatar-based Al Jazeera was still making losses but aimed to become profitable before the IPO. He could not say yet how much money the broadcaster would want to raise.

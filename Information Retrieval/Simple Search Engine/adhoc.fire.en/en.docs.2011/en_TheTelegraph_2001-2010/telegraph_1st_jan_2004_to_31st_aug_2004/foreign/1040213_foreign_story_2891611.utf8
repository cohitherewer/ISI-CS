 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Russia defies US on Iran deal
																								Moscow, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Russia said today it planned to sign a deal with Iran next month to ship nuclear fuel for Irans power plant, defying US pressure on Moscow to sever nuclear ties with the Islamic republic.																								Tehran and Moscow have been locked in months of tough talks over nuclear shipments for the $800 million Bushehr plant Russia has helped to build despite repeated US accusations that Iran is secretly trying to acquire nuclear arms.																								I think in about two weeks all outstanding issues will be settled, that is, by the end of February, atomic energy minister Alexander Rumyantsev said. The minister added that he hoped to sign the final document, which also requires Iran to return spent nuclear fuel to Russia, during a visit to Tehran in late March.																								The US has criticised us and will continue to criticise us, Rumyantsev said. They say Iran seeks nuclear weapons under the cover of our peaceful technology transfer.																								But we keep telling them theyve got that wrong. We think we abide by all international laws. Washington wants Moscow to withhold fuel for the reactor as long as Tehrans nuclear ambitions remain a matter of concern. 																								Minutes after Rumyantsevs briefing, top US arms control official John Bolton accused Iran of failing to comply with the commitment it made last year to suspend uranium enrichment and of pursuing efforts to acquire nuclear arms.																								Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi said Iran was developing nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and denied Boltons weapons charge. Certainly we are not following any programme to produce weapons, he said in Rome.																								Russias vast arsenal of nuclear technology, accumulated during the Cold War, is also of concern to both Washington and the UN nuclear watchdog as it remains open to theft and, theoretically, black market trade.																								There has been speculation that individual nuclear scientists, underpaid since the fall of Soviet rule, may be secretly transferring sensitive technology to what Washington calls rogue states for cash. 																								We havent supplied anything to (third parties) but we know what countries have and how they have done this, Rumyantsev said. 																								Weve offered to share this information with the US. They say they want to investigate things themselves. Putin re-election bid																								Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his bid for reelection today, saying he had ended uncertainty and fearful expectation and promising a better life for millions yet to benefit from postSoviet change.																								In a speech broadcast live on state television, he pledged to speed up reforms in his second four-year Kremlin term and provide the basis for a society with western-style social institutions.

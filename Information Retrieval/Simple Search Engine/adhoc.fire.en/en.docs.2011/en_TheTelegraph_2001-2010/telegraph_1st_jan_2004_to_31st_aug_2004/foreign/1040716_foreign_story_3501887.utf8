 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Teflon Tony faces byelection reversals
				 	 Queen Elizabeth with Prime Minister Tony Blair at a reception in Buckingham Palace. (AP)																								Leicester (England), July 15 (Reuters): Britons in two ethnically diverse cities voted today in byelections that could produce a backlash over Iraq, the day after a damning report exposed deep flaws in the case Tony Blair made for war.																								Birmingham Hodge Hill and Leicester South constituencies are strongholds of the Prime Ministers Labour Party and with a general election expected in less than a year, defeat would be unnerving and humiliating for Blair, who is also known as Teflon Tony for his ability to survive crises.																								With large Muslim communities in both areas, Opposition parties have sought to turn the vote into a referendum on Blairs Iraq policy, although domestic issues like schools, hospitals and crime have also featured prominently. Results are expected in the early hours tomorrow.																								At a polling station opposite a mosque in Leicester, central England, one voter said Iraq had changed his mind. I was a Labour voter for the last 10 years, from when Blair took over  I am no longer, said Ahmed Ravat, 54. There is no major politician who has not lied to us. For every child killed in Iraq, they are responsible. There is no justice.																								That message was repeated by many in the rundown residential area of terraced houses and travel agents offering package deals to Mecca. Islam is the third-biggest religion in the city.																								I always used to vote Labour, but not today, voter Yasmin Contractor, 24, said. They have failed to keep their promises and they took us to war. That was wrong. Innocent people are dying for no reason.																								Yesterdays scathing report into intelligence failings on Iraq gave Blairs anti-war critics fresh ammunition. 																								Former cabinet secretary Lord Butler absolved Blair of distorting the intelligence but said Baghdad had no significant stores of chemical or biological weapons ready for use, despite Blairs pre-war claim that it did.																								Once Labours best electoral asset, Blair has barely featured in the Birmingham and Leicester campaigns. Another Leicester voter said Blair had always been the trump card for her in previous elections.But not this time. This time I am backing Labour because of the local candidate because he knows about our local issues, said Razia Mir, 43.

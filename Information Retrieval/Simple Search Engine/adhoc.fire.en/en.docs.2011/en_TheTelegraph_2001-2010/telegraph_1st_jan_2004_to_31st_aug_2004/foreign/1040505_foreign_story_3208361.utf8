 Wednesday, May 05, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Frog fright																																	 Wellington, May 4 (Reuters): An airline passenger was given a nasty fright when a frog with a taste for adventure stowed away in her in-flight salad, New Zealand authorities said today.																																	The passenger discovered the airborne amphibian perched on a slice of cucumber while on a Qantas flight from Melbourne to Wellington in February.																																	Naturally there was a bit of consternation by the passenger who called back the attendant, ministry of agriculture and forestry quarantine general manager Fergus Small said.																																	The flight attendant removed the salad and the 4 cm whistling tree frog, which was killed by quarantine staff when the aircraft landed. 																																	Qantas was not immediately available for comment but a spokesman told The New Zealand Herald newspaper the airline had since changed its lettuce supplier and introduced additional procedures into the salad supply process.																													 																Cane trouble Kuala Lumpur (PTI): A Malaysian headmistress of a Tamil school here allegedly caned a male teacher for criticising her ideas on discipline. The headmistress, 50, was reportedly upset with the teacher for constantly opposing her proposals to improve discipline among students. She grabbed a cane and attacked the teacher in front of colleagues, a media report said. The teacher, 30, did not fight back and suffered bruises, the New Straits Times said. He lodged a complaint with police but later withdrew it after talks with the headmistress and district education officers.																													 																Sweet cops																																	 London (Reuters): Drunken brawlers beware  the weapon of choice for police in the southern England seaside town of Bournemouth is chocolate rather than truncheons and handcuffs. In an effort to reduce alcohol-related violence, police in the southern county of Dorset are handing out chocolate bars to late-night revelers as they leave the towns bars and clubs during the current three-day holiday weekend. The government has launched a crackdown on heavy drinking in towns and cities across the country, aimed particularly at the young. 																																	The reason for most alcohol-related violence in Bournemouth is that people get frustrated, then aggressive, waiting for either food or a taxi home, said police constable Ian Curtis. By giving them something to eat as they leave bars and clubs, we hope to distract people from causing trouble by fulfiling one of their main needs  food  and giving them something else to do.

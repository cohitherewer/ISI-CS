 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Spam-free domain name takes shape
																								London, March 22 (Reuters): Nine new Internet domain names, including .xxx for adult content and .mail for spam-free communications, could join the more familiar .com and .net website suffixes later this year.																								Internet governing body the Internet Corporation for the Assignment of Names and Numbers (ICANN) said 10 organisations had filed proposals for the new web domains in time for last weeks deadline. A month-long public comment period starts on April 1.																								The domains, which are sponsored by a variety of organisations and companies, will go through a two-month approval process before possible ratification later this year, the group said.																								If each is accepted, it would bring the number of top level domains to over 20.																								Among the new entrants is .mobi, proposed by nine top computer, telecoms and handset companies including Microsoft Corp, South Koreas Samsung Electronics and Finlands Nokia.																								The consortium, named Mobi JV, aims to create a new domain specifically for websites designed for mobile phones and Internet-ready devices. 																								The group hoped the new domain would be ratified in time to be operational next year.																								Other new domain candidates include: .asia, .jobs, .tel, .post and .travel, ICANN said.																								Expanding the list of top level domains to meet the needs of the mediums growing user base is one of ICANNs top initiatives. The new suffixes were proposed to help web surfers locate sector-specific information on, say, travel and employment.																								The London-based Anti-Spam Community Registry, meanwhile, proposed .mail to better identify the authenticity of online marketers in an effort to combat spam e-mails.Microsoft fine																								 An EU decision to fine Microsoft and force it to change how it does business in Europe may upset Microsoft, but is unlikely to threaten EU-US ties as some past decisions have done.																								This is in stark contrast to the sniping by US officials three years ago when the EU rejected General Electrics proposed buy of aerospace firm Honeywell International, marking a low point in transatlantic antitrust cooperation.

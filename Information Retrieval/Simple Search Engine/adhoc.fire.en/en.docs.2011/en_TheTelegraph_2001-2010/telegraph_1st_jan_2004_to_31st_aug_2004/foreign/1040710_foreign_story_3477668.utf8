 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 US fighter was minutes from attack on VIP plane
 ALEC RUSSELLWashington, July 9: US Air Force jets were only minutes away from shooting down an aircraft carrying a senior politician after it entered restricted airspace over Washington last month, officials said yesterday.																								It was the most serious incident of its kind since the September 11 attacks and triggered an emergency evacuation of Capitol Hill. The senior general at the North American Aerospace Defence Command, or Norad, was on the telephone and prepared to order an F16 fighter to bring down the aircraft after it crossed deep into a no-fly zone around Washington, officials told the Washington Post.																								He did not give the order because cloud cover initially prevented the fighter pilot from identifying the target, the officials said. The crisis was averted at the last minute when the aircraft turned to land at Reagan National Airport, just a few minutes flight time from the city centre. The Beechcraft was carrying Ernie Fletcher, the governor of Kentucky, to Ronald Reagans funeral.																								The drama was the focus of hearings on Capitol Hill yesterday and has led to renewed calls for a review of the air safety procedures over Washington and even an expansion of the no-fly zone around the capital.

 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Nothing to hide, Iran tells UN
																								Tehran, April 4 (Reuters): Iran, under renewed pressure to prove it is not seeking an atomic bomb, today said it had no clandestine nuclear sites hidden from UN inspectors. 																								A group of Western diplomats who follow the UN nuclear watchdog said recent intelligence provoked suspicion Tehran had not stopped enriching uranium but moved enrichment activities to smaller sites out of the UNs view. 																								There is no nuclear centre in Iran which we have hidden from inspectors, foreign ministry spokesperson Hamid Reza Asefi told a news conference. 																								Iran promised Britain, France and Germany last October it would suspend uranium enrichment and accept snap atomic checks.																								If enriched to a low level, uranium can be used to fuel nuclear power stations. But if enriched further, to weapons-grade, it can be deployed in warheads. 																								The US accuses Tehran of pursuing a nuclear weapons programme but Iran insists its ambitions are confined to fuelling power stations to generate electricity. 																								Last month, the UNs nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), passed a resolution deploring Irans failure to declare potentially arms-related activities.																								Irans omissions of key atomic technology from an October resolution included undeclared research on advanced P2 centrifuges that can make bomb-grade uranium.

 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Brad Pitt to host radio show on UK singer
				 	 Brad Pitt																								London, April 8 (Reuters): Hollywood heartthrob Brad Pitt is to present a music documentary on BBC Radio 2 in May on the life of British singer-songwriter Nick Drake.																								Pitt, one of Tinseltowns highest paid stars, will narrate the life story of Drake, who died in 1974 at the age of 26.																								I was introduced to Nick Drakes music about five years ago, and am a huge admirer of his records, Pitt said in a BBC statement.																								When Radio 2 approached me to get involved in this project, I was delighted to be asked. The programme, which airs on May 22, includes a Norah Jones version of Drakes song: Day is Done.																								Drake had little commercial success from the three albums he recorded during his lifetime, but in the years after his death  from an overdose of anti-depressant drugs  his music has become increasingly popular.																								Drake is regularly cited as an influence by some of Radio 2s core artists, including REM, Paul Weller and Badly Drawn Boy, said Lesley Douglas, Controller BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music.																								Drakes death was ruled a suicide by a coroner, but his family and friends believe his overdose of a prescribed drug was accidental.

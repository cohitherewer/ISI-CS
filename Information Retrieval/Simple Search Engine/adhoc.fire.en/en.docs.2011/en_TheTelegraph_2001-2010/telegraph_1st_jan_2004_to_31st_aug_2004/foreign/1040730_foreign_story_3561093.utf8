 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Meet on Iraq future put off

(AFP)																								Baghdad, July 29 (Reuters): A major political conference to chart Iraqs path to democracy has been postponed until August 15 under pressure from the UN, raising concerns that elections planned for early next year might also be delayed.																								The decision to postpone the event, billed as a crucial step ahead of the January polls, came two days before it was due to begin. There had been intense discussions among the organisers, Iraqs President and UN representative Jamal Benomar. Several members of the organising committee said the UN had threatened to withdraw its support for the event if it was not postponed.																								The UN said more time was needed and that it had to be delayed, committee member Sadeq Moussawi said shortly after Iraqs President, Ghazi al-Yawar, agreed to the delay. They said that awareness of the conference was weak, that 60 per cent of Iraqis didnt know it was going on, and argued that too many groups were outside the process. Benomar was not immediately available to comment, but earlier he said he favoured a delay, something he has been pushing for since last week, when he arrived in Iraq.																								Everybody is very much aware that the conference should take place in the best possible conditions, that it should be as inclusive as possible and that it should generate substantive debate on the countrys future, he said.																								The time is very short to organise such a big undertaking, and that is why the UN favours putting it off.

 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Hamas to target Sharon, but US not in firing line
				 	 A Palestinian boy with stones during clashes in the West Bank city of Hebron. (Reuters)																								Gaza, March 24 (Reuters): Palestinian militant group Hamas said today it had the right to target Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to avenge Israels killing of a Hamas leader but reassured the US it was not in the firing line.																								Israeli tanks thrust into a Gaza refugee camp, keeping up the pressure as Washington warned Americans in West Asia and North Africa of a heightened attack threat after Israels assassination of Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin today.																								Amplifying the mood of spiralling conflict, Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi, the Palestinian Islamic groups hardline replacement for Yassin in Gaza, urged attacks on Israelis everywhere. The Jewish state vowed to target him and other militant leaders for death.																								Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal was quoted as telling pan-Arab al-Hayat daily in Damascus that Hamas now had the right to hunt down the big Zionist heads including Sharon. But he added that any decision would depend on Hamas military wing.																								The state department told Americans that Hamas had threatened revenge on US interests after Yassins death, urging them to leave the Gaza Strip and also advising against travel to Israel or the West Bank.																								US President George W. Bush said in Washington: Whether it be an Hamas threat, or an al Qaida threat, we take them very seriously in this administration. But Hamas officials later sought to reassure the US, Israels chief ally, that they would confine their armed struggle to Israeli and Palestinian territory.																								Its not in our policy to target Americans or American interests, Hamas political leader Sayed Seyam said.																								Palestinian President Yasser Arafat  who has declared three days of mourning for Yassin  signalled an appeal for calm amid militants pledges of revenge attacks.																								I am against any attacks on civilians, on Israeli civilians and Palestinian civilians. We want peace, Arafat said at his headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Israel says Arafat foments violence, an accusation he denies. Keeping up pressure in Gaza, about 10 Israeli tanks backed by helicopter gunships rolled about 100 metres into Khan Younis refugee camp early today and bulldozers razed several homes overlooking a Jewish settlement, witnesses said.																								About 60 families fled as the tanks laid down covering fire, witnesses said. There were no reports of casualties. The army uprooted shrubbery and destroyed abandoned buildings used as cover by gunmen for shooting mortar bombs and anti-tank rockets, an Israeli military source said.																								Israel has pledged to keep targeting leaders of Hamas and other militant groups waging a campaign of suicide bombings.																								Yassins death in an Israeli missile strike sparked a shakeup in Hamas hierarchy that appeared to tilt toward the factions most hardline elements.																								Rantissi, 56, was named to head Hamas in its Gaza Strip powerbase, making him the pivotal figure in the Islamic group bent on destroying Israel. Rantissi will now answer to politburo chief Meshaal, the groups top political leader living in shadowy exile in Syria. Both have survived Israeli attempts on their lives.																								Some Palestinians considered Yassin, Hamas wheelchair-bound founder, a relative moderate within the group. Israel called him the Palestinian bin Laden. 																								Israel was on high alert for the painful payback Hamas has promised, and Israeli missions in the Arab League countries of Qatar and Mauritania were shut.

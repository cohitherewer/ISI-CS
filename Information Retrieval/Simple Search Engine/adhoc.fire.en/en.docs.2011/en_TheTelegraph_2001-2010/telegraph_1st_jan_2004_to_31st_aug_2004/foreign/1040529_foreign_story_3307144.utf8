 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Clashes end truce in Najaf
Najaf, May 28 (Reuters): Five Iraqis were killed and 14 wounded in clashes between US troops and Shia militiamen in Najaf and in nearby Kufa today, hospital sources said.																								An official at the hospital in Kufa said three people had died in gunfire and mortar shelling in the town, while eight were wounded. In Najaf, 5 km southwest of Kufa, two were killed and six hurt, hospital staff said.																								Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said today he would abide by a ceasefire in Najaf but his militia would fight to the last drop of blood if US forces encroached on holy sites. God willing, no matter how many forces the enemy has, we will continue to resist this crusader campaign against Islam and we will stand until the last drop of blood in our bodies to defend these holy sites and this blessed land, Sadr said. 																								Two US soldiers were also wounded in the clashes after their Humvee military vehicle came under fire from militia fighters in Kufa, a US military spokeswoman said. Their Humvee was completely destroyed and they were evacuated for treatment, the spokeswoman said. US forces and militiamen loyal to al-Sadr struck a tentative truce on Thursday. The agreement, struck via local clerics with no direct involvement of the US military, also involved US authorities holding off arresting Sadr.

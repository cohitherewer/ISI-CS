				 	 A painting of Prince Philip which was sold by Buckingham Palace for $45,000 to Robert Pritikin of San Francisco. Pritikin plans to sell it for $150,000. (Reuters)																								London, May 27 (Reuters): Britains late Princess Diana claimed Prince Charles made a secret pact with his father, allowing him to ditch her five years into their marriage, the Daily Mirror newspaper said today.																								The latest accusation against Britains heir to the throne comes from Dianas former butler Paul Burrell who has made a career from revealing lurid details of the private life of the late Princess. Burrell said he saw a note from Diana to her father in law, Prince Philip, confronting him over the alleged pact, which allowed Charles to return to his former love, Camilla Parker Bowles, if Diana did not make him happy.																								This made me feel as if I was being offered to your family on a sale-or-return basis, and there is nothing royal about that, Burrell quotes Diana as writing in the note, published in a new chapter to his book A Royal Duty.																								I have a husband who does not love me any more and, by his own admission, never has, she added. Burrell added: In her eyes, she had been sold to the royal family to produce an heir and a spare, in the form of William and Harry, and then returned to the wilderness.

 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Email fraud floods Bank of England
 JAMES MOORE AND ROBERT UHLIG																								London, Dec. 31: The Bank of England became the latest victim of email fraudsters yesterday when hundreds of thousands of people were sent hoax messages urging them to download software from what appeared to be a bank address.																								The emails, sent from adminbankofengland.co.uk, a fictitious address, urged recipients to open an attachment, which it said would help prevent credit card fraud. The bank immediately launched an inquiry with the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit to determine the contents of the attachment, concerned that it could contain a virus or a programme to harvest a users online banking passwords.																								It is the first time the bank has been the victim of such a fraudulent email campaign  known as phishing  which increased by 400 per cent over the Christmas period, according to Peter Dorrington, head of fraud solutions at SAS, a computer software and services company. 																								The bogus Bank of England email sent out yesterday said: Dear customer. The security of your personal and account information is extremely important to us. By practising good security habits, you can help us ensure that your private information is protected. Please install our special software, that will remove all the keyloggers and backdoors from your computer.																								The scam was uncovered after the Bank received more than 100,000 replies to the email, mostly responses sent automatically from corporate email addresses whose users were on holiday.

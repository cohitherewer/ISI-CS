 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Olympic relic found
																								Shipka (Bulgaria), Aug. 20 (Reuters): A Bulgarian archaeologist has unearthed an ancient gold mask and a ring featuring an Olympic rower in what he called an unrivalled find in the study of classical antiquity.																								Georgi Kitov said today the artifacts likely belonged to a fifth century BC leader of the Thracians, the dispersed tribes who once lived in parts of what is now modern-day Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Turkey, and Greece.																								The mask is a portrait of a Thracian king, from what I believe is the tomb of Teres, Kitov said. He said the portrait, found yesterday, may be a more significant find than the so-called Mask of Agamemnon, one of the most famous images of Greek antiquity and centrepiece of the National Archeological Museum in Athens.																								It is sensational and has no comparison in the world, he said. The Mask of Agamemnon was made of gold foil and weighs only 60g, while this mask weighs 690g and is of solid gold. Kitov said the ring, found near the mask, featured an Olympic rower in mid-stroke.

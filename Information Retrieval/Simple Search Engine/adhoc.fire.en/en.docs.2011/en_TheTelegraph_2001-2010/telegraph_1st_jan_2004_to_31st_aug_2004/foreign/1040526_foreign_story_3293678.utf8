(Reuters)																								New York, May 25 (Reuters): Playing the worlds most famous wizards is still a kick for Harry Potter stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, who are growing along with their characters.																								Radcliffe, who portrays the orphaned Harry Potter, and fellow 14-year-old Watson, who plays his brainy pal Hermione, have worked on the film series for some four years and said yesterday they were happily on board for production of the upcoming fourth film based on J.K. Rowlings books.																								It would be very hard to watch someone else playing the parts, conceded Radcliffe, who saw himself on screen at 6,000-seat Radio City Music Hall at Sundays world premiere of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which opens around the world on June 4.																								But Im just taking it one film at a time, he said.																								Watson concurred and presumably so would have Rupert Grint, who plays their partner in cinematic magic, Ron, were he not busy acting his age and taking school exams back in Britain.																								The latest film focuses on the search for identity, in a fast-moving, complicated adventure directed by Mexican Alfonso Cuaron, who has taken over the helm from Chris Columbus.																								The actors, like the characters they play, are entering their teenage years and coming to terms with some of the same urges and issues facing the young wizards of Hogwarts Academy.																								Hormones are interesting things, said Radcliffe with a chuckle. The slender actor talked about listening to loud rock music during down time on the movie set. I think the music does help me let off a lot of steam. Radcliffe said he can relate to Potter. Harry basically has the same feelings of any teenager, but because of his past he feels them more strongly, he said. 																								The world premiere audience roared with delight at a scene when Hermione punches Potters rival Draco Malfoy in the face. I loved every single second of it. Girl Power, said Watson. It was great. I would have done it for a whole week but we got it in a couple of takes.																								Both Radcliffe and Watson said they were thrilled to work with some of the actors brought in for Azkaban. I almost died I was so pleased when I heard that Emma Thompson was cast in the part of Prof. Trelawney, said Watson.I love her. Shes a great actress. She is hilarious.																								Radcliffe gushed over getting to work with a grizzly Gary Oldman, who plays an escapee from wizard prison.

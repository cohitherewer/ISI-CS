				 	 Nicky (left) and Paris Hilton																								Los Angeles, Aug. 7 (Reuters): The Hollywood home shared by celebrity socialites Paris and Nicky Hilton has been burglarised, police said yesterday, adding that jewellery, watches and a laptop were stolen.																								Nicky Hilton returned home early on Thursday morning to discover the break-in, which apparently occurred sometime after 9 pm on Wednesday night, a police spokeswoman said. Police did not put a dollar value on the items stolen, though the spokeswoman described it as substantial, a high amount. It was not immediately clear what was contained on the laptop.																								Nicky Hilton, 19, told officers that no suspects were seen, the spokeswoman said, and the case remained under investigation. Police could not confirm a report on syndicated celebrity news programme Access Hollywood that the home had been ransacked during the burglary. Paris Hilton stars alongside Nicole Richie in the Fox television hit The Simple Life. The 23-year-old heiress is also recording an album and recently finished work on her feature film debut, a remake of the horror film House of Wax. The Simple Life was originally intended to feature both Hilton sisters.

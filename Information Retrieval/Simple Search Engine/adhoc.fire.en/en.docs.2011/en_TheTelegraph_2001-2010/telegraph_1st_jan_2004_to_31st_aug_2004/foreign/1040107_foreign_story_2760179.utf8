 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 12 killed in Kandahar blasts
																								Kandahar, Jan. 6 (Reuters): A powerful explosion in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar today killed at least 12 people and wounded dozens, two days after the country adopted a new constitution aimed at healing the wounds from decades of bloodshed.																								President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack as an act of cruelty and barbarism and said it would only strengthen his resolve to fight terrorism in Afghanistan.																								A statement from his office said at least eight children were among the dead and 58 people were wounded in the explosion, which officials called a terrorist attack. But a spokesman for the ousted Taliban militia, linked to a wave of violence in recent months, denied involvement. A Reuters reporter at the scene saw the bodies of three young men. 																								At first there was a small explosion in which a child was injured, said local witness Gulalai. When people gathered to help the child, the big explosion happened. General Abdul Wasi, spokesman for the corps commander of Kandahar province, said the blast was a terrorist act.

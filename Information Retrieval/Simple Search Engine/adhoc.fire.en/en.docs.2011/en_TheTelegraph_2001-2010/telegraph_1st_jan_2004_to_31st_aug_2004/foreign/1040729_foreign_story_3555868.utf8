																								Islamabad, July 28 (Reuters): Pakistan has formally approved proposals to build a new nuclear power plant with help from longtime ally China, finance minister Shaukat Aziz said today.																								Aziz, who is expected to become Prime Minister next month, told state-run television the new nuclear plant would cost 51 billion rupees ($874 million).																								The 300 megawatt plant will be built at Chashma on the banks of the Indus river, around 280 km south of Islamabad, alongside the first plant that China helped build in 1999. An official statement said the project also envisaged the transfer of technology from China to enable the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) to run the plant itself. The project includes a nuclear steam supply system, a turbine generator and related equipment. The statement said the project will be completed in seven years but did not say when it will be started. PAEC and Chinas National Nuclear Corporation signed the deal on the construction of a new nuclear power plant in May. Pakistan says its new nuclear plant is for peaceful use only. 																								The country was at the centre of a nuclear proliferation scandal this year after its top nuclear scientist was found to have been involved in an illicit trade in nuclear parts. Pakistan built its first nuclear power station in 1972 in the port city of Karachi with Canadian help. But western countries, under pressure from the US, later halted nuclear cooperation with Pakistan amid suspicions Islamabad was secretly developing nuclear weapons.

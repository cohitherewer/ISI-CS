 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Whoopi axed after Bush joke
				 	 Whoopi Goldberg in the advertisement for Slim-Fast Foods. (Reuters)New York, July 15 (Reuters): Comedian Whoopi Goldberg will no longer appear in ads for diet aid maker Slim-Fast following her lewd riff on President George W. Bushs name at a fund-raiser last week, the company said yesterday.																								Florida-based Slim-Fast said it was disappointed in Goldbergs remarks at last Thursdays $7.5 million star-studded fundraiser at Radio City Music Hall in New York.																								Ads featuring Ms Goldberg will no longer be on the air, Slim-Fast general manager Terry Olson said in a statement, adding that the company regrets that Goldbergs remarks offended some customers. Republicans have expressed outrage over the fundraiser for presumptive Democratic nominee John F. Kerry and his vice-presidential running mate, John Edwards, in which entertainers lined up to skewer the President.																								The New York Post said of Goldbergs appearance at the event: Waving a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual wordplays on Bushs name in a riff about female genitalia. Slim-Fast is a unit of Anglo-Dutch food-to-detergent group Unilever Plc.																								Goldberg accepted the companys decision but said she had criticised Presidents of all persuasions. While I can appreciate what the Slim-Fast people need to do in order to protect their business, I must also do what I need to do as an artist, as a writer and as an American, not to mention as a comic, she said.																								Ive done material on every President in the past 20 years. It seems now that people from the other side are using this to further their agenda.

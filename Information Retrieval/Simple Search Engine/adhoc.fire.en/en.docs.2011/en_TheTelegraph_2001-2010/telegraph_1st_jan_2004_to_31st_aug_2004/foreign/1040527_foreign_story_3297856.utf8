 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Putins vision of better life
																								Moscow, May 26 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin offered a vision of prosperity for Russias masses today, pledging big increases in income and a better life for millions still to benefit from post-Soviet reforms.																								Putins annual state of the nation address set down broad economic aims two months after his landslide re-election. It was also clearly intended to appeal to average Russians in upholding the right to decent housing, health care and education.																								The 47-minute speech contained few policy initiatives.																								Rather, Putin vowed to build on the political stability he has established since he took over from Boris Yeltsin in 2000 and ensure that Russians had more to show from high growth rates.																								Our aims are absolutely clear. They are achieving high living standards in the country, a safe, comfortable and stable life, Putin told 800 members of parliament, ministers and leading public figures in the Kremlin.																								They are a stable democracy and developed civil society. They are the strengthening of Russias international positions. But the main thing, let me repeat it here, is substantial growth in the well-being of our citizens.																								Putin restated the aim, set out in his speech last year, of doubling gross domestic product within a decade and said per capita income could hit that target even sooner.																								Occasionally interrupted by polite applause, he pressed ministers to work harder to push inflation well below current levels and its 2004 objective of 10 per cent.																								 I think the government is able to reach a target of three per cent a year, he said.																								The address is a natural showcase, given near-record oil prices generating big export revenues. Growth was 7.3 per cent in 2003 and remains robust, with officials this week suggesting the final 2004 figure will exceed forecasts of 6.4 per cent. 																								Some analysts suggested Putin was too simple in approach. The Presidents speech smacked of populism...What raises eyebrows is that Putin called for a deepening of reforms, said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at NIKOIL bank. But he gave no clue as to how to achieve this.																								The enormous power concentrated in Putins hands, reinforced by a strongly pro-Kremlin parliament elected in December, has generated lethargy among many Russians. Many feel alienated after Putins re-election, seen as a walkover.																								Echoing Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevs vow at the outset of perestroika reforms to provide individual apartments for all by 2000, Putin said Russians deserved affordable housing.																								That meant introducing a proper mortgage finance system.

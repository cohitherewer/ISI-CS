 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Second Sars case ahead of key China holiday
																								Guangzhou (China), Jan. 8 (Reuters): A waitress in southern China was declared a suspected Sars case today, and in Hong Kong two members of a TV crew tested negative for the deadly virus, amid fears of an outbreak days ahead of Asias biggest holiday.																								Chinas health ministry said the 20-year-old waitress in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, was suspected of having Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome after having been in hospital for nearly two weeks. A seafood restaurant was besieged by reporters after media reports identified it as the establishment where she worked.																								Forty-eight people who had close contact with her have been isolated and 52 others who had normal contacts have been observed, the provincial health department said. None displayed Sars symptoms, which include a high fever and dry cough.																								A 32-year-old television producer confirmed this week as Chinas first Sars case since last year and identified only as Luo has recovered and left hospital today. 																								Three television workers from Hong Kong station TVB had visited an animal market and a hospital where Luo had been treated before they returned to Hong Kong on December 30 with fevers. They were held in hospital isolation wards.																								Two have since tested negative for Sars, a Hong Kong government spokesman said. Test results on the third were pending, he added. The Sars scare is emerging just ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, when an estimated 1.89 billion journeys are forecast to be made by rail, road, ship and air around China. Sars killed about 800 people worldwide last year, nearly 350 of them in China.																								Luos case has been linked to a coronavirus also found in wild civet cats, prized as a delicacy in southern China and sold in crowded markets. He denies eating civet and the source of his infection remains a mystery.																								They are still searching. They still have no answers, Beijing-based World Health Organisation spokesman Roy Wadia said. Media reports said the waitress from the central province of Henan had been serving wild game.																								The woman first reported a fever on December 26 and was receiving treatment under quarantine at the Guangzhou Number 8 Peoples Hospital, one of three city hospitals designated to handle Sars patients. Shopkeepers near the seafood restaurant reported seeing men in white protective gear moving into the downtown building and of co-workers being held in a nearby shophouse before being taken away by bus.

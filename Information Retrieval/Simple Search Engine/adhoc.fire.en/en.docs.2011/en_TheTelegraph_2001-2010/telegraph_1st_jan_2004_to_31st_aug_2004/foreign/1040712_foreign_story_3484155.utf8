 							 - Advice against Communion for pro-abortion candidate JULIAN COMAN John Kerry (top) and Pope John Paul 																								Washington, July 11: American Catholic bishops are trying to defy secret advice from Rome that Communion should not be given to John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate.																								The advice is contained in an explosive memo  clearly directed at Senator Kerry  by Cardinal Ratzinger, the Popes doctrinal advisor, who is head of the powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith  the institutional heir to the Inquisition.																								The memo was sent to the US Catholic Bishops conference last month. With formidable clarity and force, it states that pro-abortion Catholic politicians should be warned by priests that they are not eligible for Communion. If the politician then shows an obstinate persistence in grave sin, writes Cardinal Ratzinger, he or she should be turned away at the altar rail. Kerry has consistently voted in favour of maintaining abortion rights during his 30-year senatorial career.																								The tone and content of Cardinal Ratzingers memo, which was leaked to an Italian magazine last week, leave little room for misunderstanding. Some passages appear to have been drafted specifically with Senator Kerry in mind.																								Regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia, writes the Cardinal, when a persons formal co-operation becomes manifest (understood, in the case of a Catholic politician, as his consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws), his pastor should meet with him, informing him that he is not to present himself for Holy Communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin, and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the Eucharist.																								The judgements of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith are not binding on individual bishops, but Cardinal Ratzingers views are believed to be identical to those of the Pope on the subject of abortion. He is authentically representing the thoughts of the Holy Father, said a senior American Catholic commentator and frequent visitor to the Vatican.																								Last month the Pope delighted White House election strategists by agreeing to meet President Bush in Rome after repeated overtures from Washington. A senior religious advisor to the White House told The Daily Telegraph there was no doubt that the Pope preferred President Bush to Senator Kerry, though the Vatican was strongly against the war in Iraq and the Senator is a practising Catholic.																								I have been in Rome with the Pope and the President, said Deal Hudson, one of the most prominent Catholic laymen in the US and editor of the religious Crisis magazine. The Pope and his inner circle prefer pro-life Bush to pro-choice Kerry. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

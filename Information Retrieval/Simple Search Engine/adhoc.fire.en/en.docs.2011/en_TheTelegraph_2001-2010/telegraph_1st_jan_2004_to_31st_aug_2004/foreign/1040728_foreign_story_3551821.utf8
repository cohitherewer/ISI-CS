 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Jiang, Hu rivalry hots up ahead of key meet
				 	 Jiang Zemin (left) and Hu Jintao. (Reuters)																								Beijing, July 27 (Reuters): Behind-the-scenes rivalry between Chinese Communist Party chief Hu Jintao and his ageing predecessor is intensifying before a crucial party meeting when the elder statesman can expect pressure to give up his last post.																								The key question will be whether Jiang Zemin completes the succession by handing over chairmanship of the decision-making Central Military Commission to Hu during the fourth plenum of the partys elite 198-member Central Committee in September.																								Jiang did not tender his resignation at an expanded meeting of the military commission in June, two independent sources with knowledge of the session said, an indication he is bent on holding onto that job for as long as he possibly can.																								Jiang doesnt want to retire. He wants to complete his five-year term, one source said on condition of anonymity.																								He retains considerable influence as chairman of the military commission, the job that Jiangs late predecessor, Deng Xiaoping, kept for two years until 1989 after stepping down from the Politburo Standing Committee  to hold court from behind a screen as did the Empress Dowager in Chinas last dynasty, the Qing (1644-1911).																								Jiang, 77, is jostling to retain power and influence against the 61-year-old Hu, who replaced him as party chief in 2002 and as President in 2003.																								A debate is raging between Premier Wen Jiabao, a close associate of Hu, and government leaders loyal to Jiang  many hailing from the coastal boomtown of Shanghai  over whether curbs to cool the overheating economy are necessary.																								Jiangs faction opposes strong macroeconomic controls.																								A difference in opinion exists, but it is more conspicuous because the timing is sensitive with the approach of the fourth plenum, said Kou Chien-wen, a China watcher at Taiwans Institute of International Relations.																								The outcome of this rivalry could determine how quickly the authorities relax credit curbs and administrative orders that have sharply curtailed growth in a number of overheated industries such as real estate, steel and aluminium.																								 Investors can read a barrage of monthly statistics to track trends in the worlds seventh-biggest economy. 																								But they still have to read between the lines of dry communist reporting to try to work out which policy makers are in the ascendancy.

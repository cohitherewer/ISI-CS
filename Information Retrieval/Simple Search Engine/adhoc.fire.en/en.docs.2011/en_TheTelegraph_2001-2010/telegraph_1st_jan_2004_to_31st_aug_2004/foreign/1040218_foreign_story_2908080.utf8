 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 New flu case in Japan
																								Tokyo, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Japan confirmed a new outbreak of bird flu today, thwarting its plans to declare an end to the scourge there, while China confirmed two more outbreaks among poultry in a central province.																								The cases came a day after hard-hit Thailands hopes of declaring victory in its war against the disease were dashed after it reported fresh outbreaks of the virulent H5N1 strain in nine provinces.																								This thing is still not under control, Hans Wagner, a senior official with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), said in Bangkok. We have outbreaks in new geographical regions and recurring outbreaks where we had bird flu already. You cant expect to clear it up with one go.																								In Japan, an agriculture ministry official said the fresh outbreak was reported at the southern end of the main island of Honshu, just a day before Japan expected to declare its sole outbreak of the virus over.																								There was no immediate word on whether the deaths of seven chickens were, like the first outbreak, caused by the H5N1 virus that has killed at least 20 people in Thailand and Vietnam, the official said.																								China confirmed today two outbreaks of the H5N1 strain among poultry in central Hunan province. Fifteen of Chinas 31 provinces and major cities have confirmed outbreaks of the avian influenza.																								Officials had said Japan was tomorrow set to declare an end to its one confirmed outbreak of bird flu on a farm at the southern end of the main island of Honshu, if there were no new cases.																								Thailand had been similarly hopeful, saying it could declare victory by the end of this month over a virus that led to the slaughter of 80 million poultry in eight countries afflicted by H5N1, which can leap between species.																								But yesterday, it said the virus had been found in fighting cocks in areas of eight provinces where mass slaughters were carried out and in ducks in one not struck by the first wave of infections. The infected fighting cocks  valuable birds hidden or moved around by owners to avoid the cullers  were found in formerred zones where the government had ordered the slaughter of poultry within a five-km radius of an outbreak.

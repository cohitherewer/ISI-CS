 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Pak doctors held for militant ties
Karachi, July 2 (Reuters): Two Pakistani doctors have been arrested and charged with helping Islamic militants by giving them medical treatment and financial support, police said today.																								Doctors Akmal Waheed and Arshad Waheed, who are brothers, had been missing since June 17. Yes, they have been arrested, Karachi police chief Tariq Jameel said. Jameel did not give any more details, but a police source who asked to remain anonymous said the two had close ties with the militant group Jundullah.																								Jundullah is understood to be a new militant group with links to al Qaida. Eight members of the shadowy outfit, including ringleader Atta-ur Rehman, were arrested last month on suspicion of involvement in an attack on Karachis army chief. 																								Gunmen ambushed a convoy escorting Lieutenant-General Ahsan Saleem Hayat on a main road in Karachi. He escaped unharmed, but 10 people were killed. They not only treated wounded and ill members of the group, but also supported them financially, the police source said of the brothers.																								The two also treated a militant injured during last months attack on the citys army commander, he said. Police said at least one of the attackers was wounded in the convoy ambush when soldiers returned fire. Pakistani authorities say Jundullah members received military training in the tribal belt bordering Afghanistan where government forces have fought several fierce battles in recent months with foreign militants and their Pakistani tribal hosts.																								The doctors belong to the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA), an organisation run by the Jamaat-e-Islami, a key member of the countrys Opposition alliance of Islamic parties, the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal. 																								Sarfaraz Ahmad, a spokesman for Jamaat-e-Islami, said Akmal Waheed had travelled to Afghanistan, Bosnia and Iran as a member of PIMAs relief and aid teams.																								He said neither doctor had no ties with Jundullah. This is all part of the governments plan to ban Jamaat-e-Islami, he said. Since it cannot take this step directly, it has been trying to link the party with al Qaida from time to time. 																								Ahmad also denied that detained Jundullah ringleader Rehman was linked to his party.

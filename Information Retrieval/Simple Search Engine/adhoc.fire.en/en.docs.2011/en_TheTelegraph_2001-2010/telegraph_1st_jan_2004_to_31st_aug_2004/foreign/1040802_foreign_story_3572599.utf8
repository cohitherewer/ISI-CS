 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Threat to US money citadels
																								Washington, Aug. 1 (Reuters): The US raised the security alert level to high for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, the New York Stock Exchange and companies in the New York area today, after intelligence signaled a possible al Qaida attack.																								High, or code orange, is the second highest level of alert and this was the first time that specific buildings were cited in raising the alert level.																								Reports indicate al Qaida is targeting several specific buildings including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the District of Columbia, homeland security secretary Tom Ridge told a news conference.																								He added that the New York Stock Exchange, Citigroup buildings and the Prudential building in Newark, New Jersey, were also on the list.																								New York authorities, who plan their own news conference later, had said earlier they were studying reports of possible suicide attacks using trucks.																								The New York Police Department, responding to new information that terrorists may be planning to attack corporations or large public institutions in the city, advised building managers and corporate security personnel to step up their procedures to guard against vehicles rigged with explosives and against chemical agents placed in ventilation systems.																								The new information was first reported last night by ABC News, which said it had learned from several law enforcement agencies that an overseas source had provided information about suicide attacks being planned by al Qaida in the city. 																								Ridge said that there was no specific information indicating an imminent attack but a number of sources had indicated that al Qaida, which carried out the September 11, 2001, attacks, was aiming again for the worlds financial heart. The quality of this intelligence based on multiple reporting streams in multiple locations is rarely seen, he said.																								While declining to say where the information came from, Ridge mentioned Pakistan as a key ally and the White House said separately the intelligence had been received in the past 72 hours. The President made the final decision today, agreeing with the recommendation of (homeland security) secretary Ridge to go ahead and raise the threat level, White House spokeswoman Erin Healy said.																								She added that Bush had been briefed on the situation every day since Friday. 																								On Friday, Pakistan announced the capture of a top al Qaida operative, Tanzanian-born Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, wanted by the US in the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in East Africa that killed 224 people. A computer and several disks were seized when Ghailani and 13 others were seized last weekend southeast of Islamabad.																								IMF spokesperson Bill Murray said that the fund had been advised by US authorities of the possible threat and were taking all necessary precautions. 					 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE AND REUTERS

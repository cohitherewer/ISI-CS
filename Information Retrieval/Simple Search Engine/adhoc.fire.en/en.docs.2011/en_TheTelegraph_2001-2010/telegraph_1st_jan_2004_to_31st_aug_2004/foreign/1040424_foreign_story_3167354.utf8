 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Arafat immunity off: Sharon 
																								Jerusalem, April 23 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said today he was no longer bound by a pledge he gave President George W. Bush not to harm Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. 																								I said during our first meeting about three years ago that I accepted his request not to harm Arafat physically, Sharon told Israels Channel 2. But I am released from this committment. I release myself from this commitment regarding Arafat. Sharon gave no indication that any move against Arafat was imminent. 																								The US state department said today it stood by its opposition to Arafats assassination. Nothing has changed in the US position and I will look at the statement and see what we have to say, state department spokesman Richard Boucher said.																								An adviser for Arafat, Nabil Abu Rdainah, said Sharons statement would lead to increased tensions in the region.																								We reject Sharons statement and demand clarification from Bush on such a statement and hold Sharon responsible for such a dangerous statement, he said. 																								Sharon said he told this to Bush last week during a meeting with him at the White House.

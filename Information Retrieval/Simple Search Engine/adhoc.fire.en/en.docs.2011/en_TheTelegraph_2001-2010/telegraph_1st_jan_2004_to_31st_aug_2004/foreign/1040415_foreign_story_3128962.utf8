The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 More dirt on David saga
 															- From Spain to Britain, mistresses mar marriages 				 	 Too much on hand: David Beckham																								London, April 14 (Agencies): One woman who claims she had an affair with David Beckham insisted she had no reason to lie, while another was accused by a tabloid today of being a prostitute.																								Rebecca Loos, the former personal assistant to the Real Madrid and England soccer star, reportedly says in an upcoming television interview that the affair left her breathless and very happy. 																								She said what she did was wrong but insisted she was telling the truth.																								Sarah Marbeck, a model who also claims an affair with Beckham, was described in the Sun as a high-class hooker. Boardroom Escorts, based in Sydney, Australia, confirmed that Malaysian-born Marbeck worked for the agency in 2001, the year she claimed she had a sexual relationship with Beckham, the Australian Associated Press reported today.																								Boardroom Escorts spokesperson Graeme Edwards was quoted by the Sun as saying that Marbeck had been paid to visit dozens of executive clients in their hotel rooms. 																								Marbecks lawyer Michael Brereton declined to comment on the Sun report. I have heard of it but I havent seen it, he said.																								Britains number one celebrity couple, who command as much tabloid coverage as Princess Diana once did, have been the subject of media frenzy since the allegations broke.																								Beckham and his wife Victoria have put on a very public display of mutual affection since the stories erupted to dent their carefully nurtured image, have dismissed the claims as absurd and unsubstantiated. 																								They were photographed yesterday in Madrid on a shopping trip with sons Brooklyn and Romeo.																								The couple called in lawyers after a Sunday newspaper printed allegations from Marbeck  a 29-year-old lawyers daughter.																								But Loos insisted:I am 100 per cent sure of what I am talking about. There is no doubt in my mind.																								People are calling me a liar and calling me names and, you know, at the end of the day these are the facts, she said.																								This is what happened. This is the truth. I shouldnt be ashamed of it, she said in an interview with Sky Television, which aired excerpts today.																								I was wrong, I was wrong to have done what I did. I know that. But it did happen and I am not going to live with a lie for the rest of my life, said the 26-year-old daughter of a Dutch diplomat and an English mother.																								Sky refused to comment on reports in the British press that it paid 500,000 for the interview.																								Loos said that when she went home I felt very breathless, very happy, smiling. I got home and my mother said Where have you spent the night? and she could just tell by the look on my face.																								The Evening Standard newspaper quoted Loos as saying her mother was supportive but had told her: Be very careful. You are putting your job on the line. There is a family involved who could get hurt, as well as children etc.																								So I was very aware of what I was getting myself into, Loos said. But I just couldnt stop it.																								Beckham and his Real Madrid team-mates were forced out of the Spanish capital today after fans protested about reported bad behaviour by the players.																								For you, whores and money, for us, indignation and repression was the banner which greeted the Real players when they turned up for training.																								The squad today left Madrid for a secluded training camp in the south of Spain.

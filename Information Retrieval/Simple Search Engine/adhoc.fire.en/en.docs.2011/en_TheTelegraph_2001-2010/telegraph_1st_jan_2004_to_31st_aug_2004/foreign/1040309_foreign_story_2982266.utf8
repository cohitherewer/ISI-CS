The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Smiling face of Tiger atrocities
				 	 KarunaColombo, March 8 (Reuters): The renegade rebel whose split from the Tamil Tigers threatens Sri Lankas peace process was a close aide to the rebels top leader who has been accused of carrying out some of the worst atrocities in the civil war.																								Karuna, who said last week he had split from the LTTE, has transformed himself since the islands ceasefire from a jungle warrior into a peace negotiator who put on a suit to represent the rebels in world capitals. Karuna is highly disciplined, a very good military leader, said one official in Colombo who dealt with him often.																								I always found him very polite and he was always smiling. Hes broken the sound barrier, he speaks English more when he is on those trips, he said. 																								There is still confusion surrounding why V. Muralitharan  who is more widely known by his military name, Karuna  broke with Velupillai Prabhakaran. 																								The smiling Karuna, who took part in several rounds of peace talks with the government and even joined in a friendly snowball fight at one session in Oslo, was the public face of one of the LTTEs top military strategists. Karuna was one of a number of Tiger cadres trained in secret camps in India. He led seven counter-attacks to take control of the islands main north-south artery, dubbed the Highway of Death after 3,500 soldiers died fighting over it.

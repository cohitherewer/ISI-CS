 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Letter piles reform heat on Saudi prince
																								Riyadh, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Nearly 900 supporters of reform in Saudi Arabia have appealed to de facto ruler Crown Prince Abdullah to set a timetable for political change in the conservative Muslim kingdom.																								In a letter to the prince, seen by Reuters today, the signatories praised Abdullahs cautious public commitment to reform but said it was time to begin implementing promises.																								We trust there will be a start in transforming these recommendations into practical, tangible reality, according to a a set timetable, they said in the letter dated Saturday, which was the beginning of the Muslim New Year.																								Saudi Arabias rulers, battling a wave of militant violence and facing tough economic challenges, have come under pressure at home and abroad to liberalise their oil-rich economy and open up the absolute monarchy to political participation.																								Abdullah launched a national dialogue last year aimed at promoting diversity and tolerance in the kingdom, whose austere Wahhabi version of Islam has been blamed for fuelling militancy and marginalising the countrys minority Shias.																								The government also promised municipal elections will be held this year. No details have been announced and officials have not said whether women will be allowed to vote.																								The petitioners called a timetable for implementing what it said were recommendations from the national dialogue, including accelerated political reform, expanding popular participation, an elected consultative council and regional councils.																								It also called for establishment of unions and other foundations of civil society, combating extremism, ensuring freedom of expression and strengthening the role of women.																								The recommendations from the national dialogue are still just recommendations. They have not been implemented yet, said Ali al-Dumaini, a poet from eastern Saudi Arabia.																								He said the appeal was signed by 880 academics, professors, engineers and housewives, including Sunnis and minority Shias from across the kingdom. 																								But one prominent advocate of reform criticised the petitioners for submitting the letter at the same time as Washington is calling for greater democracy in West Asia. The timing is inappropriate because of the great US West Asia project, said writer Turki al-Hamad. It looks like an invitation to America to intervene in Saudi Arabia.																								Signatories to the letter dismissed Hamads criticism, saying their appeals for reform dated back to the 1991 Gulf War.																								Just because America is now calling for reform, that does not mean we should reject it, said Mohammad al-Mohaisen.																								Last month Prince Abdullah vowed to press ahead with change in Saudi Arabia, but also cautioned that the kingdom would steer clear of reckless adventure. 																								Foreign minister Prince Saud al-Faisal echoed his comments last week, saying reforms would be comprehensive in scope...and realised with deliberate speed.

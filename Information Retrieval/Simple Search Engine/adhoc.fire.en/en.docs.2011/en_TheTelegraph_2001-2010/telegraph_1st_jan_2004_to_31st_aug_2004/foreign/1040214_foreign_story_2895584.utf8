 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 UN urges Asians not to relax flu war
																								Bangkok, Feb. 13 (Reuters): The UN issued a sharp warning today to Asian countries not to relax in the war on a bird flu virus that has killed 19 people in the region because the epidemic was still spreading.																								The spread of the avian influenza virus in several Asian countries is still not under control, the Food and Agricultural Organisation said in a statement, and governments had to remain vigilant as further outbreaks continue to occur.																								Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Laos had reported new outbreaks of the H5N1 virus, it said, despite the slaughter of 80 million chickens  most of them in worst-hit Vietnam and Thailand, which had each killed 30 million.																								China confirmed outbreaks of bird flu in Shanghai, its financial centre, and in the northern city of Tianjin, near Beijing.																								It also confirmed six outbreaks in the southwestern province of Yunnan and Guangdong in the south as well as saying a black swan had died at a zoo in Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, of the H5N1 virus. China has now confirmed cases in 14 provinces. A tiger died of bird flu in a Thai zoo, but it was not yet clear whether the H5N1 virus was responsible,																								The FAO also said poorer Asian countries had neither the resources nor the organisation to eradicate the fast spreading H5N1 virus.

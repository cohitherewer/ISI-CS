The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Blasts echo across Baghdad
				 	 George W. Bush in the East Room of the White House. (Reuters)																								Baghdad, March 19 (Reuters): Blasts echoed across central Baghdad and warning sirens sounded in the headquarters of the US-led administration today, the eve of the anniversary of the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.																								At least two blasts followed the sound of mortars or rockets being fired. A US military spokesman said there were no immediate reports of any casualties or damage. The US headquarters compound, which is known as the Green Zone and is one of Saddams former palace complexes, has been targeted repeatedly by guerrillas firing rockets and mortars.																								Todays attack came less than an hour after US President George W. Bush ended a speech calling for unity and determination in the fight against terrorism. Iraqs US governor, Paul Bremer, spoke live to CNN from inside the Green Zone shortly after the blasts: We think they are outside the green zone but we just dont know yet. Its only just happened.																								US secretary of state Colin Powell had spent several hours in the headquarters compound earlier today before leaving for Saudi Arabia.																								Bush told officials from 83 nations today on the anniversary of the start of the Iraq war that differences over the conflict were in the past and urged no concessions in the broader war on terrorism. No concession will appease their hatred, Bush said of al Qaida and its supporters. No accommodation will satisfy their endless demands. Their ultimate ambitions are to control the peoples of West Asia and to blackmail the rest of the world with weapons of mass terror.																								Bush devoted much of a speech marking the anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq to the fight against terrorism. 																								Earlier, Iraqi journalists gave Powell a hostile reception in Baghdad today, walking out of his news conference in protest at the killing of two of their colleagues by US troops.																								Powell urged US allies to stay the course in Iraq after Spain vowed to pull out troops and South Korea refused to take on a combat role. About 30 Arab journalists quit the hall in anger over yesterdays shooting of two Iraqis who worked for the Dubai-based satellite television channel Al Arabiya.

 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Shootout outside Mandela home
																								Cape Town, March 17 (Reuters): South African police questioned two men today after their companion, a gun-wielding former soldier, was shot dead by guards outside the Cape Town home of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela.																								The shooting took place late yesterday after the three men approached guards outside Mandelas home and demanded to speak to him, police said. It came as campaigning heated up ahead of the countrys third democratic elections on April 14.																								Safety and security minister Charles Nqakula said the dead man, who officials identified as a former member of the military with a long history of discipline problems, appeared not to have a political agenda.																								It does not appear to us like he was involved with any unit which would want to harm our democracy and which would have wanted to harm our leaders...it appears like it was just this one person who was disgruntled, Nqakula said.																								Mandela, who was in Johannesburg at the time of the shooting, was described as shocked by the incident.																								The cabinets security cluster, which groups the ministers of safety, defence and intelligence, said the dead suspect had been identified as a former member of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and that questions had been raised about his state of mind.																								Even at the time he was being sought by the SANDF for an alleged theft of military weapons  one of which has been recovered at the scene, the group said in a statement. This is an isolated case and of a personal nature, the cabinet statement said, adding it would have no bearing on the elections.																								National police spokesman Selby Bokaba said police knew the identity of the dead man but could not reveal his details.

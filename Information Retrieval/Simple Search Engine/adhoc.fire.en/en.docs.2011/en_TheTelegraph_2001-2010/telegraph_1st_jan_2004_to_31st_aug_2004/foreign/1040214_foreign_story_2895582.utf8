 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Romance over for Barbie and Ken
																								New York, Feb. 13 (AP): Just like J.Lo and Ben, the romance is over for dolls Barbie and Ken.																								 After 43 years as one of the worlds prettiest pairs, the perfect plastic couple is breaking up. The couples business manager, Russell Arons, vice-president of marketing at Mattel, said that Barbie and Ken feel its time to spend some quality time apart.																								Like other celebrity couples, their Hollywood romance has come to an end, said Arons, who quickly added that the duo will remain friends.																								Arons denied that there was any truth to rumours that the breakup was linked to the Cali (as in California) girl Barbie, arriving in stores now. To better reflect her single status, Cali Barbie will wear board shorts and a bikini top, metal hoop earrings, and have a deeper tan.																								This new style already has attracted a new admirer, Blaine the Australian boogie boarder.																								Barbie  the most popular fashion doll in the world, according to toy maker Mattel  met Ken on the set of a TV commercial in 1961, and they have been inseparable ever since.																								Arons hinted on Wednesday that the separation may be partially due to Kens reluctance to getting married. All those bridal Barbie dolls in toy chests around the globe are really just examples of Barbies wishful thinking, she explained. Another possible factor is Barbies career. The doll who was born Barbie Millicent Roberts in 1959 has been everything from a rock star to military medic.

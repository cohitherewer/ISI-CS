 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Seagal boost to Arroyo poll bid
				 	 Steven Seagal 																								Manila, May 4 (AP): Hollywood action star Steven Seagal made headlines here today by giving the thumbs up for Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in next Mondays election.																								The actor visited the presidential palace to discuss shooting a movie in the Philippines, but ended up rooting for Arroyo  giving her campaign a bit of the star appeal that so far has been the advantage of her political opponents.																								Arroyo was away on the campaign trail, but Seagal described himself as a big fan of the President. Ive never met her, but my impression of her is that shes very straight, sincere, honest, a really talented President, and I hope she gets re-elected, newspapers quoted Seagal as saying.																								The statement drew criticism from the Opposition, ABS-CBN TV reported.																								Celebrities are nothing new to Philippine politics.																								Arroyos rival, Fernando Poe Jr., is a local movie legend, and so is Arroyos predecessor, former President Joseph Estrada, who was ousted in people power protests in January 2001.																								Seagal said actors can make good political leaders, citing former US President Ronald Reagan as his example.

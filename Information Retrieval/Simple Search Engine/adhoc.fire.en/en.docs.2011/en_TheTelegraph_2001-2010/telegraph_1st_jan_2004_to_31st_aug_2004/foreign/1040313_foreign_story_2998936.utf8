 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 US court brake on gay marriages
																								San Francisco, March 12 (Reuters): Californias Supreme Court yesterday ordered San Francisco to halt the same-sex marriages that have sparked a passionate nationwide debate on whether gay couples can wed legally.																								The decision, which will be reviewed again in May or June, comes exactly a month after San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom gave the green light to gay marriages, resulting in more than 4,000 homosexual pairings since then. 																								Newsom said he would comply with the ruling but city attorney Dennis Herrera said he had filed a new petition with the court late yesterday to determine whether same-sex marriage is constitutional in California.																								In its order, the states top court referred to the California code that defines marriage as a union of man and woman and told San Francisco to refrain from issuing marriage licences or certificates not authorised by such provisions.																								Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who had asked state Attorney General Bill Lockyer to seek a ruling on gay marriages from the Supreme Court, said he was pleased at the ruling. 																								I believe very strongly that the people should obey the laws that we have here in California, Schwarzenegger said in a statement. 																								Opponents of same-sex marriage hailed the courts decision.																								Gay rights advocates however said they would continue to fight for the right to wed.

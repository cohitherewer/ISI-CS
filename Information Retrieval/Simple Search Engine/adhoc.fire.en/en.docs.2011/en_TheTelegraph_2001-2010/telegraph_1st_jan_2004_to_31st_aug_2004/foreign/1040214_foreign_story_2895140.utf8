 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 2 militants nabbed for Pervez attack
 Peshawar, Feb. 13 (Reuters):  Two Islamic militants have been arrested in Pakistan on  suspicion of involvement in two recent assassination attempts  against President Pervez Musharraf, officials said today.																								An intelligence official identified the militants as Tunisian Khalifa bin Hussain and his Pakistani host, Adnan Afridi. They were arrested yesterday in a raid on Afridis house in a tribal region of North West Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan. Officials said security forces had also arrested two more foreign suspects, one an Afghan, after a shootout today in the same region.																								The second raid was conducted on the basis of information gleaned from Khalifa and Afridi but it was unclear whether the second pair had any role in attempts on Musharrafs life.																								One of the two latter suspects threw a hand grenade at the security forces, wounding two paramilitary soldiers and himself, said an official, who asked not to be identified.																								The intelligence official said Afridi was thought to be a member of the Jaish-e-Mohammad. He said security forces seized explosives, landmines and weapons from his house.																								The intelligence official said the security forces had also seized explosives, landmines and weapons from Afridis house. The types of explosives recovered from the house were similar to those used in the life attempts on the President, the official said. We suspect they might have links with these attempts.																								Preliminary investigations reveal that they have links with Jaish-e-Mohammad for operations and training purposes.																								Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terror, narrowly escaped two assassination attempts in Rawalpindi, close to Islamabad, in December. Both involved powerful explosives detonated close to his motorcade.

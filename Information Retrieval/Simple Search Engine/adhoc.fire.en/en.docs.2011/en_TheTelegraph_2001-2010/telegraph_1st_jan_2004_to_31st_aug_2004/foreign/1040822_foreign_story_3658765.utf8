 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Pak in fresh assault on terror hideouts
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Aug. 21: Pakistani security forces today attacked suspected terrorist hideouts in the border regions of South Waziristan after rocket attacks on military positions from different areas of Shakai valley.																								Reports from Wana, the administrative headquarters of South Waziristan, said security forces also used air power to attack terrorist positions on the Slair and Mashay mountains around the Shakai valley, 25 km north of Wana. However, military authorities denied such claims.																								Activities are going on in the area for the past many days and we are using all resources at our disposal as per operational requirement, but there is no air bombing, military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan said in Islamabad.																								He said aircraft were being used for reconnaissance and that may have confused the locals who linked it with ground fire.																								Sultan said the militants had been attacking military positions since June 11 but there have been no casualties on the militarys side. Earlier reports had said that four paramilitary troops had died in the clashes on Thursday.																								Sultan, however, said the body of a suspected foreign militant with a machinegun, an assault rifle and grenades was recovered from the Mantoi area yesterday. The military spokesman said added that security forces had identified the body but we cannot disclose identity of the militant due to security reasons.																								The latest attack on terrorists comes amid unconfirmed reports about the killing of Noor-ul-Islam, one of Pakistans most wanted militants accused of sheltering al Qaida terrorists. Islam was a close accomplice of pro-Taliban militant Nek Mohammad who was killed in a rocket attack in June this year.																								The rugged South Waziristan region continues to be the centre of anti-terror efforts since US-led military attacks ousted the radical Taliban regime in Afghanistan in late 2001. Two major operations in March and June this year killed more than 170 mainly foreign militants.

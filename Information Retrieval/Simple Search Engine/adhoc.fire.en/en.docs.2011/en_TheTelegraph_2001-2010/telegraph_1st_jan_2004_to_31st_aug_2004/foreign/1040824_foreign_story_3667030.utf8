 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Republican plan to reform US intelligence
																								Washington, Aug. 23 (Reuters): A leading Republican senator yesterday unveiled a plan to reform US intelligence operations, including giving increased budget and firing powers to a new director.																								Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he had yet to show it to the White House, the commission that investigated the September 11, 2001, attacks and suggested many reforms, or any Democratic lawmakers. Its called the 9/11 National Security Protection Act. We do give a lot of authority to the national intelligence director. We give him the line-item authority on budget. 																								We give him the authority in regards to personnel and to reprogramme funds and to transfer funds, Roberts told CBS Face the Nation.																								And we just sort of stepped back from the trees and, instead of worrying about boxes and agencies and turf, just said: What would you put together now that really represents an answer to what the 9/11 commission has recommended and what our Senate report has indicated?																								Roberts said he had the backing of seven other Republicans on the Senate intelligence panel and would put the plan before the Senate Government Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over intelligence agencies.																								Roberts said he expected and welcomed debate. The commission that investigated the September 11 attacks recommended creating a national intelligence director to oversee 15 spy agencies.

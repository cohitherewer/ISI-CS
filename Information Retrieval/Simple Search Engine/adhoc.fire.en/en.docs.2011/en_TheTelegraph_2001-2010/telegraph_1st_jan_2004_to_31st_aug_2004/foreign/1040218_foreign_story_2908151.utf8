 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Scribe denies Kerry affair
Nairobi, Feb. 17 (AP): A woman who has been the subject of rumours linking her to Senator John Kerry today denied that she ever had an affair with the Democratic presidential candidate.																								 Breaking her silence four days after the allegations surfaced on the Internet, Alexandra Polier issued a statement which said: I have never had a relationship with Senator Kerry and the rumours in the press are completely false.																								Kerry already has denied reports that he had an extramarital affair. His campaign said he would have no further comment.																								Poliers statement was released to the AP in Nairobi, where the 27-year-old freelance journalist is visiting the parents of her fiance, Yaron Schwartzman, an Israeli who was raised in Kenya. She previously worked as an editorial assistant for the AP in New York.																								Whoever is spreading these rumours and allegations does not know me, Polier said, appealing to the media to respect her privacy and the privacy of her fiancee and his family. Polier also took issue with reports that referred to her as a former Kerry intern. I never interned or worked for John Kerry, she told AP over the phone.																								 In a separate statement, Poliers parents, Terry and Donna Polier of Malvern, Pennsylvania, dismissed the completely false and unsubstantiated allegations about their daughter. 																								Voters headed to the polls in Wisconsin today, with Kerry looking for a win that could cement his grip on the nomination to challenge President George W. Bush in November.																								Kerry, a four-term senator from Massachusetts, has a commanding lead in the race for the Democratic nomination after winning 14 of the first 16 presidential contests. He has already begun looking ahead to a November matchup with Bush.																								But rivals Howard Dean and John Edwards are taking a final stab in Wisconsin at slowing Kerrys surge ahead of a March 2 round of 10 contests in states like New York and California that could put him over the top. The polls opened at 1300 GMT) today, with voting continuing until 0200 GMT tomorrow.																								The primary could amount to a final stand for Dean, the one-time front-runner who soared to the top of the polls and broke party fund-raising records in 2003 before crashing in January as Kerry surged. The former Vermont governor promised to make Wisconsin a make-or-break state in his fight against Kerry.

 															- Actor looks himself in new film 				 	 Robert Redford																								Robert Redford tells a story that illuminates the difference between how he sees himself  as a character actor  and the way Hollywood viewed him for decades, as a leading man with golden-boy looks.																								Back in 1970, he heard that the legendary producer Sam Spiegel was casting roles for Nicholas and Alexandra, a worthy, rather stolid mini-epic about the end of Russias Tsarist era. I wanted to play Rasputin, says Redford. I really did. So I flew all the way from Los Angeles to London to audition. Spiegel couldnt believe it. He let me fly all that way just to see if it was true. He said: You dont want to do this, youre crazy. No one took seriously the fact that I meant it. I got laughed out of the office.																								One sees Spiegels point. Bob Redford as Rasputin the mad monk? Redford, the blond, blue-eyed, square-jawed all-American hero? Not a chance. (The role went to Tom Baker of Dr Who fame.) Yet Redford has tried on other occasions to escape from his golden-boy stereotype: years ago he told me he had asked Andrew Lloyd Webber if he might play the Phantom of the Opera on film, only to be greeted with the same disbelief. 																								Attempts to preserve Redfords matinee-idol looks for the big screen assumed absurd proportions. In the Eighties he always seemed to appear back-lit in a golden haze; Glenn Close, his co-star in The Natural, tartly noted that far more time was spent making him look unlined than herself or Kim Basinger.																								Redford is 67 now, and it seems he is getting his wish at last. In his new film, The Clearing, he finally gets to look on screen as he does in real life. He plays Wayne Hayes, a car rental millionaire kidnapped by a vengeful loser (Willem Dafoe) who knew him slightly in their youth. While Wayne is held at gunpoint in a forest hideaway, FBI men are quizzing his wife Eileen (Helen Mirren), uncovering disturbing facts about their marriage.																								The Clearing is no ones idea of a great movie, and though Redford is given top billing, Mirren effectively takes the honours. Yet its significant in that he looks lined and fatigued on screen, and theres nothing heroic about Wayne: hes a passive victim throughout, subject to another mans whims.																								One thing that attracted me to the script was the chance to feel totally vulnerable and learn what that would that be like, he says. Im very claustrophobic. I dont like to be told to sit down or to stop doing something, yet suddenly this puts you out in a situation where you have no choices. Its the most vulnerable character Ive ever played. He reflected on this in a caf at Park City, home to the Sundance Festival that Redford founded over 20 years ago. These days Redford looks less like a screen icon and more like the outdoorsman he really is. His eyes remain a startling sky blue, but his skin is weathered and beaten from exposure to the sun, and his hands are red and raw, more suited to chopping wood than leafing through movie scripts.																								Curiously, The Clearing (directed by Pieter Jan Brugge, who is better known as a producer) is the first film involving Redford to appear at Sundance. Redford insists he has nothing to do with scheduling or choosing the festivals films: I dont have any problems with it, he growls. Just as long as no one thinks I jammed it down somebodys throat.																								If he sounds defensive, he has good reason. This last year has been tricky for him. His stewardship of the festival came under attack from author Peter Biskind, whose book Down and Dirty Pictures charged that he was a dithering micro-manager who sold out the ideals of the American independent film scene.

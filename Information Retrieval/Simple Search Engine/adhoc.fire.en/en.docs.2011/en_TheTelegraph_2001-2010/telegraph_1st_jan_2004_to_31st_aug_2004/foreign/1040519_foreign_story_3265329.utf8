 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Pope marks 84th birthday with launch of book
																								Vatican City, May 18 (Reuters): Pope John Paul marked his 84th birthday today with the launch of a book sure to become a bestseller, and a routine round of audiences for visitors.																								The pope, who was born Karol Jozef Wojtyla in a tiny flat in the poor southern Polish town of Wadowice in 1920, was spending the day in an Apostolic Palace whose rooms were painted by Renaissance masters.																								The leader of one billion Roman Catholics received Portugals Prime Minister and Polands President as well as 60 humble participants from a symposium on human migration. The Pope suffers from Parkinsons disease and severe arthritis, and for a while last autumn could not read his own speeches. 																								But his health has approved markedly in recent months and he plans to visit Switzerland in June and France in August.																								It is the Popes first birthday in years that has not provoked talk of a funeral or a resignation around the corner. 																								The Pope, now historys third-longest serving pontiff, shares his memories with the world in his new book Get up. Let us go!, which went on sale with an initial printing of 500,000 copies in Italy alone.

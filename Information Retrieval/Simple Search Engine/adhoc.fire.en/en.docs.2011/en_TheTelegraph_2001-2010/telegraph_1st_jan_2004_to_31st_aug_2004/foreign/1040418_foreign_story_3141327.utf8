The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, April 18, 2004 				 Suu Kyi party hub reopened 
Yangon, April 17 (Reuters): Military-ruled Myanmar has allowed Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy to reopen its headquarters nearly a year after it was closed in a crackdown against the Opposition, a party official said today.																								Other party offices across the country remained shut and there was no word on democracy icon Suu Kyi, who remains under house arrest at her Yangon home. Officials informed us that we can re-open our headquarters effective this morning, Than Tun, a member of the NLDs executive committee said.																								The move, which came after two senior party officials were freed from house arrest on Tuesday, has intensified speculation that Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi may be released soon. She and vice-chairman Tin Oo are the last senior party leaders still confined since a May 30 clash between NLD followers and government backers, which critics blamed on the junta.																								Yangon denied orchestrating the violence, but it has come under fierce international pressure to end the crackdown, release hundreds of political prisoners and move towards democracy. I do believe she will be set free very soon, one NLD member said outside Than Tuns home where the partys executive committee met hours after the junta removed a lock and chain from the shabby NLD office. In Bangkok, exiled dissidents were more sceptical, noting that only about 70 of 300 NLD offices were allowed to reopen the last time Suu Kyi was freed from house arrest in 2002.																								They must be free to carry out activities, not only by the NLD but all other political parties, if the (military) is serious about political reconciliation, said a spokesman.

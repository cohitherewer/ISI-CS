The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, January 19, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																End for Hubble																																	 Washington, Jan. 18 (AFP): The Hubble space telescope, the satellite whose pictures have revolutionized astronomers understanding of the universe, will die an early death due to budget problems and safety concerns, Nasa announced.																						Nasa canceled the telescopes next servicing mission, effectively cutting short its mission.																																	But space officials said the Hubble will remain in orbit as long as it can fulfill its duties, then be brought crashing back into earths atmosphere, with re-entry expected in 2011, officials said.																																	It is a sad day that we have to announce this, John Grunsfeld, chief scientist for Nasa said at a news conference late on Friday. We will get as much life as we can out of the Hubble telescope, and we will continue to support research and analysis even after re-entry, he said.																													 																Singer show Kabul (Reuters): A woman singer has  reappeared on Afghan state-run television, apparently signalling  that reformists have won a dispute with conservatives over  women entertainers. President Hamid Karzai said on Saturday  it should be left to the government to decided whether women  could be shown singing on television and hours later Kabul  Television aired a tape of a performance by 1980s star Ustad  Mahwash. The moderates have won. They are the winners of  the game, a senior Afghan government official said on Sunday.  The row between conservatives and moderates erupted last  week after Kabul Television lifted a long-running ban on  women singers and showed an old tape of Parasto, a popular  woman singer who now lives in the West, singing without  a head scarf. But the Supreme Court, which is dominated  by conservatives, protested against the broadcast and Kabul  TV reimposed the ban. Supreme Court officials were not available  for comment on Sunday. Moderate officials said showing women  singers on television was in line with the new Afghan constitution  as it gave equal rights to women.

 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Blair receives report day before opponents
																								London, July 13 (Reuters): Tony Blair received an advance copy today of a high-level report into British intelligence on Saddam Husseins weaponry, a deeply unwelcome reminder of the Iraq war which has so damaged his premiership.																								Officials said Blair saw the report at lunchtime, giving him almost a day longer than his opponents to digest the result of five months of inquiry by former top civil servant Lord Butler.																								It is likely to be uncomfortable reading for a leader who took his country into war against overwhelmingly negative public opinion and may cost him dearly in two elections on Thursday in which a large Muslim vote could turn against him.																								The report will be published at 1130 GMT tomorrow and Blair will respond with a statement to parliament, hoping it will help him draw a line and refocus on domestic politics. 																								With the history of Saddam ... we are better, safer, more secure without him in office, Blair told a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 																								He urged reporters to wait for the report before judging it but added: With the transfer of sovereignty a couple of weeks ago, you can feel the situation changing (in Iraq).																								Butlers probe mirrors a Senate inquiry in Washington which last week found US intelligence agencies overstated the threat of Iraqi weapons.																								British intelligence is widely expected to be criticised too though most observers doubt Butler will take political scalps.																								Blair persuaded parliament to back war on Iraq on the basis that Baghdad had biological and chemical weapons.																								A notorious UK dossier from September 2002 said some could have been fired within 45 minutes of an order to do so. Over a year after Saddam was ousted, no such weapons have been found. Blair admitted for the first time last week they may never be. Colleagues insist Blairs appetite for power is undimmed but senior ministers have been forced to quash rumours that he almost quit recently.																								Experts say the failure of intelligence was important but was dwarfed by the use the government made of it. 																								The big public issue is: Why did we go to war and did the Prime Minister misuse the intelligence that was fed to him? Oliver Miles, a former British ambassador in West Asia, said.

 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Irish ire over Madonnas Sunday concert
				 	 MadonnaDublin, April 9 (Reuters): Pop diva Madonna came under fire from Christians in Ireland today after it was confirmed she would play her first ever Irish concert on a Sunday.																								Madonna is due to play Slane Castle, 50 km north of Dublin, on Sunday, August 29, the castles owner Lord Henry Mount Charles confirmed.																								He denied that Madonna, who has developed an interest in Jewish mysticism recently, had refused to play on Saturday because it is the Jewish Sabbath. It is the only date and day feasible, he said.																								But Joe Deegan, Slanes parish priest, said the decision was insensitive in a country where 90 per cent of the population is Roman Catholic.																								The Lords Day for a lot of people around this part of the world is Sunday and it seems a bit inconsiderate and insensitive that our religious beliefs are not taken into account, he told RTE state radio today.																								The last time Slane Castle hosted a major concert on a Sunday  in 1984 when Bob Dylan played  it sparked riots.																								I knew people would stir up memories of 1984, Lord Mount Charles said. This year Bob Dylan is playing in Galway on Sunday, June 27. So if he can play there on a Sunday, I am puzzled why there is opposition to Madonna playing Slane on a Sunday.

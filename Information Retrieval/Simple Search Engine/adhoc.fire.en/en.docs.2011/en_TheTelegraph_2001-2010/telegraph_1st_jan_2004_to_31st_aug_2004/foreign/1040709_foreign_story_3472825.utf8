 RICHARD ALLEYNE																								London, July 8: Will defusing a bomb necessarily diffuse the situation? Is it correct to pedal a bicycle or pedal ideas?																								According to the editors of the new Concise Oxford Dictionary, up to half of us do not know the answers. As part of compiling the 11th edition of the reference book, which is out today, researchers discovered an increasing confusion over simple words and phrases. One in five believes we should tow the line when we should toe the line. A further 10 per cent pour over a book when we should pore over it.																								The alarming increase in mass dyslexia was picked up by the dictionarys 100 researchers across the world on the look out for new words. As they searched (or, perhaps, pored over) the Oxford English Corpus, a database of 400 million written words, they discovered that while spelling remains reasonably strong more and more writers are mixing up like-sounding words and phrases.																								The most common error was the use of the phrase diffuse the situation when it should be defuse the situation. Up to half the examples recorded were wrong. Similarly, a large number confused pedalling ideas with the correct peddling ideas.																								Angus Stevenson, the dictionarys co-editor, said: They are not so much spelling the words wrongly but using the wrong words.																								Stevenson said his team believes that the chief explanation was the use of the computer spell check which does not spot errors of meaning. He also thought that the explosion of the number of people writing, mainly due to the Internet, meant that more errors were bound to creep in. 																								People speak in fully made up phrases, just parroting what they hear on television, he said. They often end up spelling the words wrong.																								The dictionary includes 240,000 words, 2,000 of which are new. These include: Herbert  an undistinguished or foolish man as in a bunch of spotty herberts; Mentalist  an eccentric or mad person; Noogie  an instance of rubbing a persons head with ones knuckles as a prank or to express affection; Va-va-voom  the quality of being exciting, vigorous or sexually attractive.

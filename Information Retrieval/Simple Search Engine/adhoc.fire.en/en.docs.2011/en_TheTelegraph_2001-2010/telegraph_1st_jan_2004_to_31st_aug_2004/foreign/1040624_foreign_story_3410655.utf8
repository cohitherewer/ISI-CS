 DAVID SAPSTEDLondon, June 23: A teenager who has existed on a diet of jam sandwiches for more than a decade has been given a clean bill of health.																								Although Craig Flatman, 15, has eating habits that would make a nutritionist shudder, a dietician concluded last week that the youngster was getting adequate protein and some vitamins and minerals.																								But the dietician did tell his parents that the teenager should see a behavioural psychologist in an attempt to alter his eating habits.																								Craig would not eat solids as a baby until he ate a sugar sandwich. Aged four he started eating only sandwiches made from white, sliced bread, margarine and strawberry, raspberry or blackcurrant jam. He drinks two pints of semi-skimmed milk a day but the only other food he touches is chocolate cereal for breakfast and a daily slice of chocolate cake.																								I never get bored of jam because I like the taste so much, said Craig, of Stowmarket, Suffolk, yesterday. The doctors told me I would grow out of it, but I dont know if I will ever change.Muscleboy																								Doctors are studying a 5-year-old German boy whose upper arms and legs are almost twice the size of his peers to learn what happens when the body does not produce a protein that limits muscular development.																								The boy, whose mother is a professional athlete in Germany, is far stronger than other boys his age and lacks the protein, known as myostatin.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Chandrika cabinet 
Colombo, April 10 (Reuters): Sri Lankas President kept three portfolios including defence when the islands cabinet was named today, concentrating her power after saying she would also take charge of restarting a peace bid with Tamil rebels.																								Chandrika Kumaratunga, who takes a hard line on the rebel group that tried to kill her in a suicide bomb attack in 1999, said she wants to resume efforts to end 20 years of civil war, though talk of peace has been overshadowed by clashes between Tiger factions. The ministries of defence, constitutional affairs and education will come under the purview of the President herself, Kumaratungas office said in a statement.																								She had also been expected to keep the finance ministry, but that went to Sarath Amunugama, a party stalwart analysts said could be a balancing force between Kumaratungas wing of the Freedom Alliance and that led by the Leftist Peoples Liberation Front. I think he could play a balanced role. Policy-wise it could be much the same (as the old government) except on the privatisations, said Hasitha Premaratne, an analyst at HNB Stockbrokers.																								Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pursued a policy of privatising state assets to boost government revenue. Wickremesinghe also took a more conciliatory approach to talks with the LTTE, but that is likely to change with Kumaratunga at the helm, along with her adviser Lakshman Kadirgamar, who was named foreign minister from the minority Tamil community. He held the post earlier and earned the wrath of the rebels for his role in having them banned as a terrorist group in several foreign countries. 																								Kumaratunga has held the defence ministry since she seized it last November after accusing Wickremesinghe of compromising security by conceding too much to the Tigers. Todays swearing-in also underlined differences within the Freedom Alliance coalition that could complicate the peace bid, with the JVP missing the event.

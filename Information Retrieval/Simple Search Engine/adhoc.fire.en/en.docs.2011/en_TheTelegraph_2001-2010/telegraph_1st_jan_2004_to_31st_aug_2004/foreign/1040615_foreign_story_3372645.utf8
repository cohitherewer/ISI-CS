 Tuesday, June 15, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Proud Friend																																	 Los Angeles, June 14 (Reuters): Former Friends star Courteney Cox and her husband, actor David Arquette, became parents early on Sunday, after years of trying, People magazine reported.																																	Cox, who turns 40 tomorrow, gave birth to a girl in an unidentified Los Angeles hospital, according to a report on the website for People magazine, www.people.com.																																	The magazine said Cox checked into the hospital on Saturday, a week before the babys due date and was in labour throughout the night. The baby has yet to be named, it said.																																	Cox and Arquette, 32, have discussed their attempts to carry a baby to term, including in vitro fertilisations and Coxs miscarriages. Cox has just finished the 10th and final season of NBCs popular sitcom, Friends. The couple are co-producers of a home show, Mix It Up.																													 																Tokyo tops London (Reuters): Tokyo is still the worlds most expensive city, while London has moved up to second place, according to a lifestyle survey. Moscow was third followed by Osaka in Japan and Hong Kong, the survey by Mercer Human Resource Consulting found. Asuncion in Paraguay was the least expensive of the 144 cities to feature in the survey. There have been some dramatic movements in the rankings this year which are largely due to currency fluctuations, said a senior researcher at Mercer. The survey measures the comparative cost of 200 items in each city, including housing, food, clothing, entertainment and transport.

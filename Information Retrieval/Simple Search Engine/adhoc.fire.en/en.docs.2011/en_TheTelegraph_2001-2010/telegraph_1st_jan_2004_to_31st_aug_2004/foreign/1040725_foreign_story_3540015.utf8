 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Gunmen raid office, Arafat challenged
Gaza, July 24 (Reuters): Palestinian militants briefly commandeered a government building in the Gaza Strip today, demanding President Yasser Arafat reinstate comrades they said had been dismissed from the national security forces.																								The Arafat-led Palestinian Authority, which is reeling from widespread unrest at charges of corruption in its ranks, rejected as fabrication the charges by al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades gunmen who stormed the governorate of Khan Younis town at dawn.																								Hours earlier, unidentified Palestinians torched a two-storey police station in the nearby village of al-Zawaida.																								We are trying to determine who took advantage of the instability in the Palestinian territories to commit this crime, Mayor Ahmed Abu Zayyid said. 																								Dozens of militants barricaded in the Khan Younis office building had demanded the Palestinian President fire his nephew, Moussa Arafat. 																								By afternoon, the militants dispersed after announcing a deal under which 11 al-Aqsa men who they said had been dismissed by Moussa would be reinstated.

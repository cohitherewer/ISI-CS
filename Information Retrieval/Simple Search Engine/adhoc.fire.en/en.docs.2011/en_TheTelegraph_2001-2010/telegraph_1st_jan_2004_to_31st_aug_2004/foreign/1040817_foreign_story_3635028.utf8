 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Despite fraud slur, Chavez wins vote
				 	 President Hugo Chavez in Caracas, Venezuela. (Reuters) 																								Caracas (Venezuela), Aug. 16 (Reuters): Venezuelan Leftist President Hugo Chavez today declared victory in a referendum on his rule but the Opposition called the results a gigantic fraud.																								According to National Electoral Council President Francisco Carrasquero, Chavez won backing from 58 per cent of voters with 94 per cent of electoral rolls counted in the referendum on whether to recall him before his term ends. But the Opposition said it had won by almost the same margin and called the official results a fraud engineered through the use of electronic voting machines.																								We firmly and categorically reject the result ... were going to collect the evidence to prove to Venezuela and the world the gigantic fraud which has been committed against the will of the people, a senior Opposition leader, Henry Ramos Allup, said.																								He said the Opposition, a loose coalition of political parties, unions and business groups united by their distaste for Chavez, would ask international organisations to investigate.																								International observers, including former US President Jimmy Carter, praised proceedings as voting got underway yesterday but have still to give their final verdict on the referendum.																								Oil prices fell from record highs near $47 a barrel on news Chavez had won and would serve out his term until 2007. It calmed market fears of disruptions to supply from the worlds fifth-largest oil exporter.

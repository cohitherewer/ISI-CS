The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Arroyo win marred by slur
																								Manila, June 21 (Reuters): President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo prepared today for a new six-year term in which she has pledged to attack poverty faced by millions of Filipinos, saying she wanted to unite the nation after years of bitter disputes.																								However, doubts over her mandate caused by a drumbeat of cheating allegations from the Opposition threaten to undermine the US-trained economist from the start. 																								Financial markets were unwilling to give her a vote of confidence yet.																								We will continue the rule of law and the reconciliation process to consolidate our nation and prepare to meet the tough times ahead, Arroyo said in a speech in the northern Philippines, adding that it was too early to celebrate.																								A 13-day tally by a congressional panel that ended yesterday gave the daughter of a former President a narrow victory over film star rival Fernando Poe Jr in the May 10 elections, paving the way for her official proclamation later this week.																								The Opposition, which says Arroyo cheated her way to victory, can still contest the result in Congress in the next few days. But her inauguration was virtually certain given her majority in Congress, analysts said.																								The military is on alert for possible unrest, with memories still fresh of an attempted coup by army officers last July and thepeople power protests that turfed out Poes friend Joseph Estrada in 2001, paving the way for Arroyos first term.

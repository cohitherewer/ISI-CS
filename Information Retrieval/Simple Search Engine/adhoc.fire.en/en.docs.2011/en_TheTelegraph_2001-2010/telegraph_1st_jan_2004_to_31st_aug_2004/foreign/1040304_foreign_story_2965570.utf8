 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Plight of young girls in warzone
																								United Nations, March 3 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of young girls are fighting on front lines across the developing world and not just serving as cooks and sex slaves to male soldiers, according to a study released today.																								There is a tendency to overclassify girls in the countries where we worked as sex slaves when in fact they are more often front-line fighters, said Dyan Mazurana, one of the studys authors. Mazurana and fellow US-based researcher Susan McKay wrote Where are the Girls? after three years interviewing more than 300 girls under 18 in northern Uganda, Sierra Leone and Mozambique. Their study, funded by the Canadian government, also looked at wars from Nepal to West Asia to Colombia.																								Girls are in battle and also in domestic service as cooks, a job that often includes providing sex on demand to male fighters, Mazurana said in an interview on the sidelines of a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. To help such girls, who are usually kidnapped, international aid agencies must address their often-hidden presence and role as front-line fighters, the study said.

London, June 27: Bees are not as busy as they are made out to be. In fact the insects are lazy, work-shy and prone to sleeping on the job, new research says.																								Bees sleep for 80 per cent of the night and like to spend long periods resting their wings, a German zoologist has found. 																								Randolf Menzel, from the Free University in Berlin, said that the popular image of bees as the ultimate hard workers was inaccurate. 																								Bees are not particularly hard working. Instead they sleep a lot and are actually quite lazy, he said. They spend up to 80 per cent of the night sleeping rather than working in the hive  and during the day they often sit around in the hive resting their wings and doing not much else. 																								Menzel, a neurobiologist and zoologist who has studied bees for four decades, added: Bees have a sleep phase and dont just fly about all the time doing work. They do need sleep, for example. We know that. 																								But, of course, people only see bees when theyre out flying, or they look at a colony of bees and see thousands of them buzzing around. They dont get to pick them out as individuals and see ones that actually drop out of work to take a nap.																								The professor, who this month won a German Zoological Society award for his work on bees, added: Its the same as if someone looked down at London from the moon or somewhere and they would see millions of people rushing around and think that no one sleeps at all, which of course isnt true. 																								The suggestion that bees were not pulling their weight met with scepticism from British beekeepers. Glyn Davies, the President of the British Beekeepers Association, said bees were not lazy but efficient. 																								It is a mistake to assume that a bee doing nothing is being uneconomic. Perhaps humans should try to follow their example instead of running about like headless chickens. 																								The idea of the busy bee is several thousand years old, appearing in works by Xenophon, Virgil and Shakespeare. 																								In Shakespeares Henry V, the Archbishop of Canterbury makes a long analogy between a colony of honey bees and the ordering of human society. 																								One current author who has nothing but admiration for the bee is Paul Theroux, novelist, travel writer and part-time beekeeper. 																								Theroux, who keeps 85 hives each containing 30,000 bees in Hawaii, said Menzels research could have been affected by his national origins. 																								Perhaps in comparison to the German rate of work, the bee does look lazy, he said. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

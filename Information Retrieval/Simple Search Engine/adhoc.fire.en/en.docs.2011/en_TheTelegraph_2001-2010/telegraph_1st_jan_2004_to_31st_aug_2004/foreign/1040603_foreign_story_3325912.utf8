 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Saudi attack on US troops
																								Riyadh, June 2 (Reuters): Suspected militants shot at US military personnel in Saudi Arabia today, adding to fears over stability that have sent oil prices to record highs since 22 people, mostly foreigners, were killed in an al Qaida attack.																								Security sources and diplomats said no Americans were hurt in the shooting outside a US military compound in Riyadh.																								The incident exacerbated concern about security in Saudi Arabia, a key US ally and the worlds biggest oil exporter. Tensions are high after militants killed 19 foreigners and three Saudis in the eastern oil city of Khobar at the weekend in a shooting and hostage-taking spree.																								US light crude prices peaked at a record $42.45 a barrel  the highest since futures were launched in New York in 1983 before sliding around half-a-dollar as oil producers indicated they would increase their output.																								A Saudi diplomat said the authorities were upgrading, tightening and fortifying security, but did not want to launch a massive military action.																								Their (the militants) ultimate goal is to widen the scope of this, to push the government towards a position where it will carry out an action that will antagonise the population... But the authorities dont want to overreact, he said. 																								The US embassy in Riyadh said the gunmen had fired at two cars carrying American personnel along a highway outside Riyadh. It said the driver of one vehicle, a non-American, was slightly wounded, but the cars returned quickly to Iskan Village where a US training unit working with the Saudi National Guard is based.																								Security sources said the militants had automatic rifles and fled after the shooting. The US state department last month urged the 35,000 Americans living in Saudi Arabia to leave the kingdom.																								In a separate incident today, Saudi forces killed two militants the interior ministry said were linked to the Khobar attack. A ministry statement said police shot the men dead in a remote mountainous region near the western city of Taif, 1,100 km from Khobar, after clashes which began yesterday.																								Saudi forces had been hunting three militants who escaped after the Khobar carnage. None of the security forces were wounded in the incident, the statement added.

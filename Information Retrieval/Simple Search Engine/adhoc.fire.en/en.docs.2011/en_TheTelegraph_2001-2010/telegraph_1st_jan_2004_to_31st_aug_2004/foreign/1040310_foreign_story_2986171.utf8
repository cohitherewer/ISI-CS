 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Hint of reform in Russia reshuffle
																								Moscow, March 9 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin today strengthened the hand of economic modernisers in his government in a reshuffle just five days before his certain re-election.																								Putin kept finance minister Alexei Kudrin and economic development and trade minister German Gref  two key reformers  in their jobs. Viktor Khristenko, acting Prime Minister since last month, became energy minister with further responsibility for construction, industry, arms production and nuclear power. 																								Russias experienced UN envoy Sergei Lavrov was named foreign minister to replace Igor Ivanov, who was switched to become secretary of Russias Security Council.																								Putin, however, kept as defence minister Sergei Ivanov, a close confidant from his days in the KGB state security apparatus and who has been mooted by some analysts as possible heir to the Kremlin leader in 2008.																								The President, in a carefully choreographed presentation taking up 19 minutes in a mid-afternoon newscast, said he would make no further changes to his team after Sundays election. Putin, with popularity ratings of up to 80 per cent, is sure to win a second four-year term in office.																								This is the team which, after the election, will immediately and assuredly take up the job of strengthening the country and improving the quality of life of our citizens, he said.

 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Saudi first brush with polls
																								Riyadh, Aug. 5 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia plans to hold its first nationwide elections starting in November, seen as the first concrete political reforms in the countrys absolute monarchy, a government source said yesterday.																								The source from the municipal affairs ministry said the first stage of the local elections would be held in Riyadh after Ramazan ends in mid-November.																								The elections will elect half the members of the nearly 180 municipal councils nationwide, while the rest are expected to be appointed by the government. The conservative Gulf kingdom announced last October it would hold municipal elections  the first in four decades  after pressure from the US and domestic reformers to grant some political participation and freedom of expression.																								Saudi Arabia says it will not allow its cautious programme of political change to be influenced by outside pressure. An increase in violence from militants opposed to the monarchy over the last few years has also ratcheted up pressure on Saudi rulers to introduce political reforms.																								The source said an electoral roll had been drawn up, without saying whether women  who are forbidden to drive in Saudi Arabia  would be allowed to vote or what criteria such as minimum age would be used to determine who can vote.																								The US has encouraged its long-standing ally, the worlds biggest oil producer, to speed up change since the September 11, 2001, attacks which were carried out mainly by Saudi hijackers. The second stage of the polls will take place in the east and south of the kingdom before the annual Haj pilgrimage which begins around mid-January.																								The last stage will be held across the rest of the country  including the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the Red Sea port city of Jeddah  after Haj.																								Saudi Arabia has been under the dynastic rule of the house of Saud since its foundation in the 1930s. Local elections were held in parts of western Hejaz province until the early 1960s.																								The source said regulations for the elections were drawn up in cooperation with a visiting UN team.Critic detained																								An exiled Saudi whose father is an outspoken critic of his homelands royal family has been detained in Seattle by federal anti-terrorism agents and could be deported on criminal charges, his lawyer said on Tuesday.																								Majid al-Massari, a computer specialist working at the University of Washington, has been held under tight security since his arrest on July 17, and his supporters fear he is being punished for his fathers views.																								We are not blind to the issue that he might be guilty, and we are not fighting for his political statements or views. We want to ensure he gets due process and make sure this is not due to any association to his fathers views, co-worker David Hughes said.																								Majids father, Muhammad al-Massari, is an exile living in London and has been quoted in news reports advocating a fundamentalist Muslim takeover of Saudi Arabia and praising Osama bin Laden.																								Al-Massari was arrested by FBI agents assigned to the Seattle Joint Terrorism Task Force. A spokesman said al-Massari had a 2003 conviction for attempted drug possession.

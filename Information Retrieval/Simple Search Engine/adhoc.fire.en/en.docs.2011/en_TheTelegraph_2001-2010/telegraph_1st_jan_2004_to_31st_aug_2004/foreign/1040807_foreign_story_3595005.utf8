 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Pak terror alert for ministers
 IMTIAZ GUL 				 	 Pakistan interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat in Islamabad. (Reuters)																								Islamabad, Aug. 6: Pakistani security agencies today rang a new terror alert for government ministers, asking them to restrict their movements to avoid a backlash after the recent arrests of al Qaida terrorists. 																								Security advisory has been issued to several federal ministers, including information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad and interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat, advising them not to attend official engagements without adequate security cover, sources in the interior division said. 																								The authorities have arrested two dozen suspected al Qaida terrorists in the last few months. The biggest catch was Tanzanian-born Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani who has been linked to the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 																								Hours after the authorities confirmed Ghailanis arrest, Prime Minister-designate Shaukat Aziz, who was campaigning for the August 18 by-election, survived an assassination attempt when a suicide bomber blew himself up in Fateh Jang town in the Punjab province killing eight and wounding 40. 																								The authorities restricted Azizs movements after the July 30 attack and he has, since then, been confined to his heavily-guarded house and office. The security alert for the ministers comes two days after Pervez Musharraf warned of the possible fallout of his countrys successes in the war on terror.																								Nerve centres																								In a separate development, Hayat said Pakistan will intensify a crackdown on al Qaida terrorists in coming weeks, moving against nerve centres of Osama bin Ladens network in the country.																								He said a string of arrests of al Qaida operatives in Pakistan in recent weeks had helped security forces get a better picture of the network, but added it was not known where bin Laden was holed up.																								In the weeks and months to come we hope to further intensify our efforts in hitting at those nerve centres and at those crucial and sensitive areas where by hitting hard, al Qaida will certainly be hurt the most, Hayat said.																								Asked whether the recent arrests had brought Pakistan any closer to catching bin Laden or his deputy Ayman al Zawahri, the minister said security agencies were better placed than before.																								As far as these two top notches are concerned we do hope... we are certainly in a much better position today to have a better view of where al Qaida stands, the minister said.																								He added it had never been determined whether the two al Qaida leaders were hiding in Pakistan or over the border in Afghanistan where US-led forces are battling Taliban fighters, driven out of Kabul in late 2001 for sheltering al Qaida.

 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Qaida hunt
																								Wana, April 19 (Reuters): Pakistani tribesmen may get more time to hunt down al Qaida and Taliban militants on the border with Afghanistan before soldiers launch a fresh offensive against foreign fighters, a provincial official said today.																								A deadline for tribal elders to hand over foreign militants and Pakistani tribesmen sheltering them passes on April 20, and tens of thousands of troops have been deployed in the semi-autonomous territory ready for a fresh offensive.																								But the government wants to avoid a repeat of last months carnage when more than 100 people, including militants, soldiers and civilians, were killed in clashes with al Qaida fighters backed by tribal allies. You cannot just keep changing the deadline, but if there are results, I see no harm in extending the deadline, said Syed Iftikhar Hussain Shah, governor of the North West Frontier Province which oversees tribal areas. Lets give them time and see which direction they go. But it cannot be open-ended, he said in Peshawar.We want to avoid bloodshed. He spoke as tribesmen from a 2,000-strong lashkar, or army, formed yesterday, fanned out from Wana to hunt guerrillas in the badlands of South Waziristan.

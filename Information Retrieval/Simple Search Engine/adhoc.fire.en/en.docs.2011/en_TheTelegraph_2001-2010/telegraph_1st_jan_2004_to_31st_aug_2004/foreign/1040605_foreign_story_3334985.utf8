 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Tiananmen iron fist
																								Beijing, June 4 (Reuters): With cordons, vans and plainclothes police, China snuffed out dissent on the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown today, worried that even a minor protest could threaten the Communist Party.																								The prosperity brought by three decades of economic reform has dimmed political discontent and most of the few remaining activists from 1989 are under house arrest.																								Police cars criss-crossed the sprawling square and officers were seen shoving two men into the backs of vans and taking aside three photographers for questioning. Seven others were taken into police custody.

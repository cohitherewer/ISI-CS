 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Russia oil tycoons trial begins
				 	 Mikhail Khodorkovsky in a Moscow court. (AFP)																								Moscow, June 16 (Reuters): Russias richest man, oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, went on trial today charged with fraud and tax evasion in a case widely seen as initiated by the Kremlin and which even his own lawyers expect him to lose.																								Khodorkovsky, chief owner of oil giant Yukos, sat in the defendants cage in a small oak-panelled Moscow court next to Platon Lebedev, another major Yukos shareholder who faces similar charges.																								Just a few hours after it opened, judges postponed the hearing until an unspecified date because of the ill-health of a member of the defence team. They were also considering an appeal by the two defendants to be allowed home during their trial rather than be returned to their prison cells.																								It promises to be one of the most important trials since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, with Kremlin hardliners wanting to send a message to Russias fabulously rich oligarchs to toe the state line. 																								Khodorkovsky, 40, was the most successful of the young entrepreneurs to emerge from the ruins of the Soviet Union by snapping up state companies on the cheap. His battle with the state has cost him dear. Since his arrest in October, his company Yukos has lost nearly two-thirds of its market value though it is still worth nearly $14 billion.

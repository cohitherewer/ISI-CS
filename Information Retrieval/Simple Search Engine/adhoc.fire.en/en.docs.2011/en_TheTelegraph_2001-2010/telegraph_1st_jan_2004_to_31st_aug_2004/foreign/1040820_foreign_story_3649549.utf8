 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Rebel siege hikes Nepal food prices
																								Kathmandu, Aug. 19 (Reuters): Maoist rebels kept vehicles off roads leading to Nepals capital for a second day today as their unprecedented blockade of the city triggered fuel rationing and pushed food prices up.																								The guerrillas call for an indefinite blockade  and an implied threat to attack vehicles that violate it  has disrupted the supply of food and goods to Kathmandu, a city of 1.5 million people. The Maoists have not physically stopped movement of vehicles in and out of Kathmandu since the blockade began yesterday. The army is guarding the roads and there has been no violence.																								But still residents fear they could launch deadly hit-and-run attacks and that has kept all but a handful of vehicles that have army escorts off the roads. Even the few armed convoys cannot meet the citys demands of cooking oil, rice, sugar and vegetables. The city showed few signs of panic buying, but fuel wholesalers were rationing supplies.

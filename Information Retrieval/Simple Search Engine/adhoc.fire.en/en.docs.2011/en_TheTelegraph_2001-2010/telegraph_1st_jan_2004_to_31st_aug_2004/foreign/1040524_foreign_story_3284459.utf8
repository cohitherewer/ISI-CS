 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Blair security question mark
 MELISSA KITE				 	 Blair: Better safe than sorry																								London, May 23: The UK government has been told by security advisers to hold the Prime Ministers Question Time on a different day each week and at varying times to protect Tony Blair from the threat of a terrorist attack.																								The demand has been prompted by concern that the fixed timing of the half-hour session, which begins at noon each Wednesday in the House of Commons, is a serious risk because would-be terrorists can be certain of Blairs movements.																								Pressure to vary the scheduling of the questions intensified after Blair was hit by purple powder thrown by protesters from a public gallery. 																								An official said there was strong pressure from Blairs protection team for the time of the questions to be announced at the last minute. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Hollywood to dazzle at Venice
				 	 Steven Spielberg and Tom HanksRome, July 30 (Reuters): The stars are sure to dazzle at this years Venice Film Festival after the new artistic director Marco Muller unveiled a line-up yesterday that includes several Hollywood pictures in and out of competition.																								Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks will kick off the 61st edition of the worlds oldest film festival with the new romantic comedy Terminal about a foreigner stranded for nine months in New Yorks JFK airport.																								Nicole Kidman, Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington could also hit the red carpet as their new movies screen on the Lido.																								We are bringing the greatest films of the year to Venice, which is why there are so many American films, Muller said at a press conference in Rome, dispelling rumours he would give Venice more of an art-house focus in his first year at the helm. There were a lot of good European films on offer, but the American films were the kind that you just cant get out of your head. Theyre spectacular, he said.																								Muller, an Italian film historian and critic, has produced critically acclaimed movies including the Oscar-winning No Mans Land about the Balkan conflict. In the four months since his appointment, Muller and organisers have viewed almost 1,900 works, selecting just 170 feature films and shorts to participate in the many events.																								Among the 21 films vying for the coveted Golden Lion top prize will be Jonathan Glazers experimental Birth, starring Kidman and Lauren Bacall as well as Todd Solondzs Palindromes with Ellen Barkin and Jennifer Jason Leigh.																								British director John Boorman of Point Blank fame will head the main nine-person jury, which will also include Spike Lee and Lost in Translation star Scarlett Johansson.																								There will also be plenty of new talent and art-house favourites from Europe and Asia on display during the festival. The Spanish film Out to Sea directed by Alejandro Amenabar and starring heartthrob Javier Bardem will be in the main competition along with Vanity Fair by Mira Nair, whose film Monsoon Wedding won the top award at the festival three years ago.

 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Spain trains back on track
																								Madrid, April 3 (Reuters): High-speed trains to southern Spain began running again today after a bomb found on the line was defused but fears grew that Islamic extremists could strike again after the Madrid rail bombings.																								The 12-kg bomb found yesterday on the high-speed line from Madrid to the southern city of Seville revived tension that was just beginning to subside after suspected al Qaida-linked commuter train bombs killed 191 people on March 11.																								Interior minister Angel Acebes said the dynamite in yesterdays bomb was of the same Goma 2 Eco make as that used on March 11.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, April 29, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Kangaroo courage																																	 Canberra, April 28 (Reuters): A kangaroo named Lulu is to receive a national bravery award after raising the alarm to save an Australian farmer knocked unconscious by a fallen tree branch.																																	Hobby farmer Leonard Richards was checking for storm damage on his property at Tanjil South, 150 km east of Melbourne, last September when he was hit by a falling branch.																																	 a story reminiscent of the long-running Australian childrens television series Skippy, in which a kangaroo rescued people in distress in the Australian bush, Lulu began barking until Richards wife came to investigate.																																	She found her husband lying unconscious under a tree about 200 metres from the house, guarded by the kangaroo. Richards was taken to hospital to be treated for minor head injuries. Lulu was reared by the Richards family, who rescued her from her mothers pouch and fed her on bottles after her mother was killed by a car over four years ago.																													 																Poo bags Vienna (Reuters): Vienna has ordered its traditional carriage drivers to clean up their act and strap poo bags to their horses backsides to prevent them from fouling the historic capitals pristine streets. The carriages, or fiakers, have roamed Vienna for centuries. Today, their bowler-hatted drivers take visitors on tours of the citys sights. But the smelly mess has proven too much for Viennas city council, which ordered the move on Tuesday. I am sure that 100 or 150 years ago it stank as well but people in the city have come to expect a better quality of life, a spokesman for the ruling party said.																													 																Fat fleece																																	 Wellington (Reuters): When the time came, Shrek the wild and woolly sheep went as meekly as a lamb. After dodging the shearers blades for six years, the New Zealand hermit merino was shorn on Wednesday under blazing arc lights. The nine-year-old did not bat an eyelid during the 25-minute operation as former world champion shearer Peter Casserley used old-fashioned cutting blades, like a giant pair of scissors, to clip the heavily matted wool. The fleece, described as rock hard in places, was 380 mm long and weighed in at 27.5 kg. Shrek, named after the friendly ogre in the popular animated film of the same name, was virtually unrecognisable as a sheep when captured two weeks ago on a farm in Otago.

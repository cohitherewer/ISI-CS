 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Mad couple to build home from scratch in NY
New York, March 11 (Reuters): A British couple enamoured of Manhattans city living but eager to raise their children in a new house are building their dream home from scratch in New Yorks trendy Greenwich Village.																								The four-storey modern building is just the second single-family home to be built in the West Village in at least the last 14 years, according to its architect, Matthew Baird.																								But it is the projects contemporary design that has raised more than a few eyebrows in the neighbourhood, where residents shell out millions of dollars for homes that were built over 100-years-ago.																								We knew that a contemporary design was going to cause a stir there, Baird said in an interview. But it wasnt right to make something that was a fake. This isnt Disney World  were not making phoney 19th century architecture.																								Unlike other townhouses in the neighbourhood, Bairds design incorporates modern tastes and conveniences such as large, open spaces and high-tech wiring.																								More importantly to some neighbours, however, the houses austere facade will be made from a single 17.4-ton piece of recycled steel  a far cry from the red and brown brick structures surrounding it.																								For Baird, the use of materials like steel, concrete and plastic are in keeping with the houses most immediate surroundings  old warehouses that once functioned as the hub of New Yorks meatpacking industry.																								In fact, the garage door will even look like a closed-down storefront.																								Anticipating at least some neighbourly grumbling, the publicity-shy couple invited their future neighbours over for an informal chat and preview of Bairds design  a tactic the wife, Sasha, said made them more receptive to the plan.																								Its not that they dont like change. They just dont like to be shocked by it, Sasha, who declined to give her last name, said in an interview.																								When someone comes to your house and has a glass of wine they are going to loathe really disagreeing with you.																								Ultimately, several neighbours  including local restaurateur Florent Morellet  voiced their support of the design to the neighbourhoods community board and the New York City Landmarks Commission, both of which approved the plan.																								The family moved to New York from London three years ago, intending to stay just a couple of years. 																								But Sasha and her husband, who declined to be named, soon fell in love with the European feel of Greenwich Village and set about trying to buy a townhouse in which to raise their two small children.																								Little did they know they would end up building one. But in late 2002, after stumbling across a dilapidated old building that was for sale in precisely the neighbourhood they were looking to live in  they resolved to do just that.																								Who thinks that they will ever build? Sasha said. But when we saw the building I just knew we had to get it. It was really as simple as that.																								Perhaps most surprisingly, the couple is building its dream home  complete with a rooftop fireplace, seven metre ceilings, and a wine cellar  for far less than they would have paid for a fully-renovated townhouse.																								A search of New York real estate listings showed the cost of buying a renovated townhouse in the West Village runs as high as $10 million.																								Baird, meanwhile, put the cost of his construction at considerably less than $4 million. 																								Add to that about $1.6 million for the cost of the original building, and the dream home appears, by some standards, to be a bargain.																								If you walk into a brownstone you feel guilty if the bathroom has been done and its not your taste because youve paid for it, Sasha said.																								Now we can put what we want and have only ourselves to blame.																								So does this mean the Britons are ready to call New York home for good?																								We dont really plan much...we thought wed come and then wed be going, Sasha said.																								But were really happy here... its a great privilege to be able to build in one of the great cities of the world.																								Construction on the house began in December. 																								The family hopes to move in next spring, but not before the George Washington Bridge has to be shut down temporarily during shipment of the houses massive steel facade from Pennsylvania.																								Baird is expecting to attach the facade this spring, and is already planning to invite the neighbours to a party to honour the event.																								Isnt it mad? Sasha said, laughing. I look forward to that day.

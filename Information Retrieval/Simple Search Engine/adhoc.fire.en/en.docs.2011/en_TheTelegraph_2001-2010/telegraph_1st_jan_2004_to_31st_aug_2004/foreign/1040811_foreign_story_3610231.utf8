 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Pak braces for Qaida backlash
				 	 Pervez Musharraf in his office in Rawalpindi. (AFP)																								Islamabad, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Pakistan is bracing for a backlash from Islamic militants after its most successful crackdown on al Qaida and local allies to date, military and civilian officials said today.																								Around 20 al Qaida suspects, foreigners and locals, have been arrested in the past month in Pakistan, leading to a security alert in the US and the arrest in Britain of man believed to have been plotting an attack on Heathrow airport.																								Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terror, has already been targeted by Islamic militant groups and survived two assassination attempts in December linked by officials to al Qaida.																								Certainly, there would be some reaction. The government is mindful to that and is prepared to face it, said Major-General Shaukat Sultan, Pakistans main military spokesman. Pakistan is in a very, very tight-rope walk situation in the war on terror, he said. It is an action and reaction syndrome. We are prepared to pay the price of our decision, he added.																								Musharraf said 90 per cent of militants in Pakistan had been captured. Over 500 Taliban and al Qaida fighters had been handed to the US before the latest crackdown began. We have to eliminate al Qaida, which is (the) ultimate objective, Musharraf said in an interview with The News.																								But top government officials said some militants escaped the dragnet after a US official named Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan to the press, possibly compromising the computer engineers role in a sting operation.																								The exposure of Naeems name proved a blow to the investigations, a senior government official said, on condition of anonymity. Pakistani agencies are chasing four or five mid-level foreign militants in an attempt to smash al Qaida in Pakistan.																								As well as the attempts on Musharrafs life, a suicide bomber narrowly missed Prime Minister-designate Shaukat Aziz during a by-election rally in July. Nine people died in that attack.																								Karachis army chief escaped a gun attack in June in which 10 people died.																								The official said several ministers, including interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat and information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, were on alert for possible attacks. 																								Despite the success of the recent crackdown, al Qaida remains able to strike, Pakistani officials said. Several key leaders of the network have been captured, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks who was seized in 2003.																								But al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, are believed by US officials to be hiding somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan frontier.																								Sultan said the foreign militant who planned an attack on Musharraf was still on the run. He refused to disclose his identity, but intelligence officials have said militant Amjad Hussain Farooqi was the prime suspect in both December attempts.

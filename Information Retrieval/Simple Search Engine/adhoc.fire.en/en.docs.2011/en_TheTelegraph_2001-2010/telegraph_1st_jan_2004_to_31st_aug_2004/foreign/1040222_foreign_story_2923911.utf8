				 	 George W. BushWashington, Feb. 21 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush, a devout Christian, wants to see Mel Gibsons controversial movie about the death of Jesus Christ, The Passion of the Christ.																								The movie opens next week in 2,800 theatres and evidently will end up at the White House theatre as well.																								 Asked if Bush wanted to see the movie, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said: I think he does and I think at some point he probably will.																								Some Jewish leaders have protested the film fearing it will generate anti-Semitism.																								The movie is also ringing up sales for tie-in products ranging from witness cards with prayers on them to nail pendants that signify the spikes driven through the hands and feet of Jesus Christ.

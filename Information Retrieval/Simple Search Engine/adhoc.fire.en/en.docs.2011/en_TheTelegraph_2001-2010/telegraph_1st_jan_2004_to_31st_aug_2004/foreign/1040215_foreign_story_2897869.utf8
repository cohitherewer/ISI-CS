 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Bad news for chocoholics: cocoa bean faces threat
 Washington, Feb. 14 (Reuters):  Chocolate lovers beware: the seed of love, the cocoa bean,  is threatened by disease.																								Its only a matter of time before diseases like witches broom and black pot rot endanger the global cocoa supply, said Raymond Schnell, a geneticist who presented his research on cocoa in two conferences in the US in the week before Valentines Day.																								The witches broom, a deadly white fungus that deforms the trees, was responsible for almost destroying Brazils cocoa crop in the early 1990s. 																								The travelling of diseases is a very real possibility and the consequences of that would be close to catastrophic ... from the local farmers up to every chain in the chocolate industry, said Edward Allen Herre of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, a Panama-based scientist who presented his research at one of the conferences.																								Most cacao trees grow on small plots of land where farmers can interlace them with other crops making them economically viable. 																								The cacao trees are an environmentally friendly crop grown only in tropical regions of the world  about 70 per cent in West Africa, 18 per cent in Asia followed by 14 per cent in Latin America, according to Susan Smith, spokesperson for Chocolate Manufacturers Association.																								Overall production for 2004 is expected to fall 0.3 per cent lead in part by a decline of 2.4 per cent in West Africa, said Bill Guyton, president of Virginia-based World Cocoa Foundation. 																								The decline is due to climatic change, political turmoil and disease. 																								The cacao plant is fragile and also susceptible to pathogens like Phytophthora, a fungus that causes the most widely spread and economically harmful disease among cocoa crops, the black pot rot.																								What we have been finding is that cocoa and trees that produce the chocolate that we all love are naturally shot through with fungi, Herre said.

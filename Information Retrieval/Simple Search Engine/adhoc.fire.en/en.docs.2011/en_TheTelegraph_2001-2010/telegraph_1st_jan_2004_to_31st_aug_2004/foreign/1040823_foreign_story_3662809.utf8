Majority of the members are insisting that they be allowed to import vehicles from Japan as the vehicles imported from India had less market value, the Sunday Times said.																																	Out of the 225-members in the Sri Lankan parliament, 68 were first-time entrants to the legislature and had asked for vehicles.																																	The new MPs were not in favour of accepting the Indian vehicles given to members of the previous parliament, the report said. The then government of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered that MPs should take a cheaper Tata or Mahindra jeep imported utilising the $100-million Indian credit line.

Peter Bryant, general  manager of the Royal Pigeon Racing Association said the  group is looking at spraying its pigeons with nasty-tasting  chemicals, or feeding them special diets that will make  them unpleasant to eat. However, there may be some problems  with the plan. Some sprays could affect the aerodynamics  of pigeon feathers. And some pigeons will end up as lunch  before falcons learn to avoid them.

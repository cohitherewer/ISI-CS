 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 AIDS cases rise sharply in Asia, says UN agency
																								London, July 6 (Reuters): AIDS is gaining ground, and Asia, with 60 per cent of the worlds population, has some of the sharpest rises in HIV infections, according to a report released today.																								We are not doing well, at all, said Dr Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. More people than ever are newly infected with HIV, more people than ever are dying and there is a globalisation of the epidemic outside Africa, he said. 																								About 38 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, including five million who were infected last year, according to the report. Sub-Saharan Africa, with an estimated 25 million cases, remains the worst affected region with women and young people the most vulnerable. Globally half of all people living with HIV are women, said Piot.																								The epidemic has killed 20 million people in just over two decades, but only about 440,000 of the estimated six million people in developing countries who need treatments are getting them. AIDS, without any doubt, is still the largest epidemic in human history, Piot later told a news conference to launch the report, released ahead of the 15th International AIDS Conference in Bangkok from July 11-16.																								It warns that the expanding epidemic in Asia, where 7.4 million people are HIV positive, could have global implications.																								Asia is now where Africa was 15-years-ago, Piot said.																								The growth of the epidemic is going to depend to a large extent on how the countries react. Will they wait, like in Africa, until there is massive mortality because the epidemic is largely invisible, or will they act now?																								China, Indonesia and Vietnam have seen some of the steepest increases in Asia while India has the largest number of people living with HIV outside South Africa. 																								In Africa, though, HIV rates seem to be stabilising.																								That is not wonderful news because it means that as many people die as are newly infected, said Piot, but at least it is not continuing to go up as it is in eastern Europe and Asia.																								The report predicts that in the worst affected countries of eastern and southern Africa, if infection rates continue, up to 60 per cent of todays 15-year-olds will not reach their 60th birthday.

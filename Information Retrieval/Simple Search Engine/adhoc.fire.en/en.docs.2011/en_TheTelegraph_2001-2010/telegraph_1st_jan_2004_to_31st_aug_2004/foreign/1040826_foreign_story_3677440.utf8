The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Decks cleared for Aziz
 IMTIAZ GUL 				 	 Shaukat Aziz																								Islamabad, Aug. 25: Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein today resigned as Prime Minister, paving the way for his successor, finance minister Shaukat Aziz, to lead the country for the next three years.																								Announcing his resignation in the National Assembly, Hussein said he was returning the trust back to the people.																								I am grateful to God for being the first elected Prime Minister to resign with honour and dignity after discharging the obligations entrusted on me, said Hussein.																								With Husseins resignation, the federal cabinet also ceases to exit, setting into motion the parliamentary process to elect new a chief executive.																								The 342-member National Assembly will elect Aziz as its new leader on Friday. He will be sworn in as Pakistans 23rd Prime Minister the next day and will seek a vote of confidence the same evening. 																								He had been named to succeed Hussein, who took over as interim Prime Minister following the sudden resignation of Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali on June 26. 																								Aziz could not directly step into Jamalis shoes as he was not a member of the National Assembly  a hurdle he cleared last week by winning the by-elections from two constituencies in central Punjab and southern Sindh provinces.																								Analysts say Husseins stepping down as Prime Minister after a short stint of nearly two months and transfer of power to Aziz in accordance with the time frame set in June reflects Pakistans steady movement towards a genuine democracy.																								However, critics believe that it reveals the militarys firm control over democracy and the countrys political chess board.																								The term controlled democracy cannot represent the prevalent system led by General Pervez Musharraf it is actually military dictatorship, which has created a facade of controlled democracy to deceive the West and the people of Pakistan, Siddique-ul-Farooque, secretary, information in Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League said.																								But outgoing Prime Minister Shujaat Hussein thought the other way round when he predicted more successes for Pakistan in the wake of its enhanced stature in the comity of nations.																								The country is destined to stay the course of democracy and economic stability, he told the nation in his farewell speech broadcast by state-run Pakistan television.																								Expressing full confidence in President Musharrafs reforms and good governance agenda, Hussein said the countrys economy is getting robust. The next government will be evaluated on its economic performance and it is because of this reason that the ruling Pakistan Moslem League (PML) selected Aziz to lead the charge, Hussein said.																								A banker of international repute, Aziz enjoys a close rapport with leading international financial institutions including the Work Bank and the IMF and is considered a dynamic person in Europe and the US. 																								He was appointed finance minister by President Pervez Musharraf after he ousted the government of Nawaz Sharif in October 1999.																								Following the October 2002 elections, Aziz was elected a member of the Senate  the Upper House  and was retained as finance minister by both Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali and his successor, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein.

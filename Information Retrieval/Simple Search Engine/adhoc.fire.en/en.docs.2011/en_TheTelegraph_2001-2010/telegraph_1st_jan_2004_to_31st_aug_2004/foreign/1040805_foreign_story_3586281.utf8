(AFP) 																								Paris, Aug. 4 (Reuters): Frenchman Henri Cartier-Bresson, one of the great photographers of the 20th century and a founding father of modern photojournalism, has died aged 95, family friends said today.																								A founder of the Magnum picture agency in 1947 who admirers dubbed the eye of the century, Cartier-Bresson died in the south of France on Monday, LCI television channel said.																								The website of newspaper Liberation said the photographer, an intensely private man, was buried today in a quiet family ceremony at Monjustin, in the Provence region. France has lost a photographer of genius, a true master, one of the most gifted artists of his generation and one of the most respected in the world, said President Jacques Chirac.																								He was the greatest. What he saw was extraordinary, said Sipa Press founder Goksin Sipahioglu. He was a great and humble man.																								Cartier-Bresson made his name partly by being in the right place at the right time, plus a talent for capturing in black and white what he called the decisive moment. During his career Cartier-Bresson documented some of the most emblematic moments and figures of the last century. 																								From the Spanish Civil war to the liberation of Paris during World War Two, the death of Mahatma Gandhi to the fall of Beijing to Mao Zedongs forces in 1949 or the Berlin Wall.																								In 1954, the Frenchman also became the first western photographer allowed into the Soviet Union after the death of Josef Stalin.																								Cartier-Bressons most striking photographs, such as the French boy proudly carrying two huge bottles with a little girl giggling behind him or the rotund man caught in mid-leap across a Paris puddle, illustrate the superb design, insight and gentle good humour characteristic of his work.																								One of his most famous photographs, the 1938 Picnic on the Banks of the Marne, shows a working-class family enjoying a picnic, innocently unaware of the cameras presence. In photography, youve got to be quick, quick, quick, quick, like an animal and a prey, Cartier-Bresson said in an interview accompanying a 1979 exhibit of his works.

 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Chandrika to extend term by year
																								Colombo, Jan. 13 (Reuters): A feud between Sri Lankas President and Prime Minister, which has frozen efforts to resurrect a stalled peace process, deepened today with the President saying she may extend her term in office by one year.																								President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are deeply divided over their approach to peace talks with the Tamil Tigers, and have been openly feuding since Kumaratunga seized three ministries in November. The President accuses Wickremesinghe of conceding too much to the Tigers in his bid to end the 20-year war over a separate Tamil state in which 64,000 people have been killed.																								Kumaratunga said on state-owned television today that constitutionally her six-year term did not begin in late 1999, but a year later. Its up to me to decide if I continue as President until 2006 or not, Kumaratunga said.																								She was injured in a suicide bomb attack just before the election and she said a 1999 swearing-in ceremony was performed to show she was fit to hold office after the blast in which she lost an eye.

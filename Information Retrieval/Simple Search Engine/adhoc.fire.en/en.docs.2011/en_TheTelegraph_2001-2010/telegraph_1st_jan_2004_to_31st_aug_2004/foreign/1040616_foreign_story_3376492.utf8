 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Schoolgirl loses UK dress battle 
London, June 15 (Reuters): A 15-year-old Bangladeshi Muslim schoolgirl living in Britain lost a legal battle today for the right to wear full Islamic dress in class.																								In a case which echoes the passionate French debate over religious clothing earlier this year, Shabina Begum claimed her school had wrongly refused to allow her to wear a jilbab, which covers the entire body except for the hands and face.																								Begum argued at the High Court that her education was suffering and her human rights were breached as a result.																								In a ruling which sparked anger among Muslim groups, the judge dismissed her case, saying she had always had the option of attending school in clothes under school rules.																								It seems to me very unrealistic and artificial to say that the claimants right to education has been denied.., said Justice Hugh Bennett.																								The school, 80 per cent of whose pupils are Muslim, welcomed the ruling and insisted its uniform already took account of cultural and religious sensitivities.																								But the Muslim Council of Britain condemned the judgment as extremely worrying and urged Begum to appeal.																								The Muslim community is a diverse community in terms of the interpretation of its faith and its practice. Within that broad spectrum, those who choose to wear the jilbab and consider it to be part of the faiths requirement for modest attire should be respected, spokesman Inayat Bunglawala said.																								Begums lawyer Yvonne Spencer told the court it had been impossible for her to attend the school because she is not allowed to attend wearing her religious dress.																								But the judge said the girl had gone to school happily for two years before she abruptly... changed her beliefs and refused to attend unless she could wear a jilbab.																								The claimant refused because she felt compelled by her religious beliefs. It was at all times open to her to change her mind ... and return to school, he said.

																								London, March 1 (Reuters): Baghdad, which suffered war and occupation in 2003, ranked the worst place to live in the world in a survey just published.																								Concerns over security and precarious infrastructure were among the reasons putting Baghdad at the bottom of a survey on the quality of life in 215 world cities by Mercer Human Resources Consulting.																								Zurich and Geneva in Switzerland were one and two in the poll, which takes into account factors such as the political and social environment, the level of education, the efficiency of transport systems and standards of recreational facilities.																								Vancouver, on Canadas Pacific Coast, was pushed down into third.																								A separate poll on top cities for health and sanitation had Canadas Calgary first with Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver also in the top 10, along with Swiss capital Bern, Zurich and Geneva.

 Sunday, February 22, 2004 				 Iran hawks on course for victory
				 	 An Iranian interior ministry official speaks on the phone at the election headquarters in Tehran. (Reuters)																								Tehran, Feb. 21 (Reuters): Islamic conservatives hostile to President Mohammad Khatamis liberal reforms swept towards a predictable victory over shackled reformists today after a disputed parliamentary election with a sharply reduced turnout.																								Interior ministry figures showed conservatives won 133 of the first 194 provincial seats declared, deputy parliament speaker Behzad Nabavi said. A total of 289 seats were at stake.																								Reformists won 37, independents 17 and five were reserved for Irans religious minorities  Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians. In 31 districts where no candidate polled more than 25 per cent, there will be a run-off later.																								There was not one woman among the first 194 lawmakers elected. There were 13 in the outgoing parliament.																								Reformists branded the election rigged and many boycotted it after the unelected hardline Guardian Council banned 2,500 mainly reformist candidates, including 80 sitting lawmakers.																								Unfortunately, this was not a free election, said Mostafa Tajzadeh, a leader of the main reformist party, the Islamic Iran Participation Front, which boycotted the poll. Our belief from the outset that the conservatives would win was proved right.																								A conservative majority could spell an end to Khatamis seven-year experiment in allowing greater freedom of speech and loosening Islamic cultural and social restrictions, a drive that hardliners have tried to obstruct at every turn.																								State radio and television, keen to assert the reformist boycott had had no impact, announced a 60 per cent turnout.																								But Vice-President Mohammad Ali Abtahi said the national turnout was about 50 per cent and in Tehran just 29 per cent, sharply down on the 67 per cent who voted nationwide in 2000, when Khatamis reformist allies won two thirds of the seats.																								Reformist lawmaker Ali Shakurirad, banned from standing again, told a news conference the fact that half the nation had not voted and more than 70 per cent had stayed home in Tehran was a big defeat for the hardline clerics. But apathy and disillusionment at the slow pace of Khatamis reforms may have had as much impact as boycott calls.																								The lowest turnout for a parliamentary election since the 1979 Islamic Revolution was 53 per cent in 1980.																								With a quarter of the votes in the 30-seat Tehran electoral district counted, conservatives of the Alliance for the Advancement of Islamic Iran held the top 20 places, the Iran Students News Agency said.																								Conservative commentator Amir Mohebian, a policy adviser to Irans senior clerical leaders, suggested the victors would use a velvet glove rather than an iron fist, and the new assembly would usher in a second phase of more effective reforms.

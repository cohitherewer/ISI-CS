				 	 Family members of detained Pakistani nuclear engineers protest in front of the parliament in Islamabad. (AP)																								Islamabad, Jan. 22 (AFP): Pakistani investigators travelled to Iran and Libya late last year to investigate allegations that Pakistani scientists sold nuclear secrets to the so-called rogue states, a minister said today.																								The trip preceded the current probe into 12 top nuclear scientists, engineers and administrators, including the revered father of Pakistans nuclear bomb Abdul Qadeer Khan.																								The inquiry trip was prompted by a letter in November from the UNs nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), information minister Sheikh Rashid said.																								After the IAEA inquiries they wanted to get some information about some people, Rashid said of the Pakistani team. He said he did not know who was in the team or how large it was. 																								They wanted to check how much involved (the scientists and engineers) were and whether they were involved or not. Asked what they were alleged to be involved in, he said: Something like information leakage.  Sheer lies: Beg																								Dismissing as sheer lies allegations that he tried to persuade the Nawaz Sharif government to sell nuclear technology to Iran, Pakistans former army chief General Aslam Beg has criticised President Pervez Musharraf for ordering the interrogation of the countrys nuclear scientists.																								I am not an idiot to carry such a message, he was quoted as saying by the Dawn today.

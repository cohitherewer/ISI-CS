				 Mars rover ends silence, sends limited data

																								Los Angeles, Jan. 23 (Reuters): The Mars rover Spirit resumed sending data to Earth today after the robot suffered from garbled communications and periods of intermittent silence, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said today.
																								JPL, which manages the Mars project for Nasa, said in a statement on its website that the flight team received data from Spirit starting at 1326 GMT and continuing for 20 minutes.
																								The spacecraft sent limited data in a proper response to a ground command, and were planning for commanding further communication sessions later today, Mars Exploration Rover Project manager Pete Theisinger said.
																								The six-wheeled craft landed on the red planet on January 3 for a planned three-month mission. Officials had described the loss of communications as a very serious anomaly. The scientists reported yesterday Spirit had radioed a signal indicating it was receiving Earth transmissions even though it had not resumed sending data back to Earth. Spirit had been unable to return any science or telemetry data since early Wednesday.
																								Spirit landed on Mars on January 3 on a planned three-month mission to explore the geologic history of the planet. 
																								The scientists reported at 1700 GMT yesterday Spirit had radioed a signal indicating it was receiving Earth transmissions even though it had not resumed sending data back to Earth.
																								The signal, a five-minute beep, followed a day-long blackout in direct communications from Spirit, and just one try by the rover in four communications opportunities to send data back to Earth, mission managers said at a morning briefing yesterday.
																								The grim news weighed on the mood at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where mission controllers had delighted until now at the virtually flawless landing on Mars and three weeks of spectacular photographs of the barren martian surface. 
																								The problems with Spirit will not affect the planned landing on Saturday night (Sunday morning IST) of a second rover, the Opportunity, on the opposite side of the planet, scientists said. Spirit has been unable to return any science or telemetry data since early Wednesday.
																								By yesterday morning, the team was able to contact Spirit only on a radio frequency used when the rover experiences an abnormal event and switches to its fault or safe mode.
																								Late yesterday, they were testing a range of scenarios ranging from software and memory corruption to solar rays to learn what caused the communications malfunction.
																								In all exploration you are always going to have anxious moments, JPL director Charles Elachi said. 
																								The key thing that is important is that we stay calm and thoughtful ... you can do harm by reacting too fast.
																								When its troubles began on Wednesday, the six-wheeled robotic geologist was poised in front of a rock shaped like an American football, its tool-laden arm extended and prepared to grind the rocks surface.
																								The rover acknowledged on Wednesday morning that it had received a command sequence for its 18th day of activities but engineers later were unable to ascertain whether it had carried them out, Theisinger said.

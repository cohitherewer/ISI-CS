 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 KLM terms on guards
																								Amsterdam, Jan. 12 (Reuters): Dutch carrier KLM, Europes fourth-largest airline, said today it was willing to put air marshals on some of its flights under certain conditions.																								KLM, which is awaiting regulatory clearance for its agreed takeover by Air France, said these included defining the responsibilities of the various parties if a marshal was deployed.																								If for instance an armed air marshal uses his gun and injures someone on board, who would have the responsibility for that?, KLM spokesman Frank Houben said.																								He said KLM would discuss this in the next few weeks with the Dutch transport and justice ministries, trade unions and smaller Dutch airline Martinair, which is 50 per cent owned by KLM and which also has US-bound flights.																								We expect that in a few weeks we can have drawn up a protocol which outlines who will have what responsibility, he said. The discussions are due to start shortly and follow last months decision by US authorities to order foreign airlines to place armed marshals on board aircraft on some flights to the US. Some airlines, such as South African Airways, have said they would not be able to comply with the demand for the time being while others said they would rather cancel any flights that would require armed police on board. KLM pilots, along with many others have been reluctant to accept armed marshals but last week said they might go along with the plan if certain conditions were met.																								British Airways, Europes top airline, has said it would accept armed police on flights if it was satisfied that safety would be enhanced. Air France, which expects to complete the 3.4-billion-euro ($4.2 billion) merger with KLM in early April, has posted guards on some of its flights since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington.																								The Air France/KLM combine, which was announced in September, will create the worlds largest airline in revenue terms.

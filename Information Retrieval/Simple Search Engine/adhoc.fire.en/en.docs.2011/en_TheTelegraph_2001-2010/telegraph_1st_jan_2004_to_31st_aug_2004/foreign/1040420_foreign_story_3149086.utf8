 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Zardari rejects Pak Swiss offer
																								Islamabad, April 19 (Reuters): The jailed husband of former Premier Benazir Bhutto turned down an offer by the Pakistani government today to go to Switzerland for an appeal against a corruption conviction, according to a government minister.																								Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali offered Zardari the option of going to Switzerland to defend himself at the hearing which had been fixed for April 22. But Zardari, who is currently under guard at an Islamabad hospital, declined, citing poor health.																								Zardaris lawyer has submitted a medical report in Switzerland saying that he is not fit to travel, Ahmed said.																								We had made all the preparations, but that is his choice.																								A Swiss court found Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari guilty of money laundering last year and gave them six-month suspended jail terms and fined them $12 million. The case relates to accusations dating back to the 1990s that Bhutto accepted commissions for awarding contracts to two Swiss companies to do business in Pakistan.																								Musharraf and Jamali took the decision to let Zardari go to Switzerland early today, Ahmed told a private television channel.

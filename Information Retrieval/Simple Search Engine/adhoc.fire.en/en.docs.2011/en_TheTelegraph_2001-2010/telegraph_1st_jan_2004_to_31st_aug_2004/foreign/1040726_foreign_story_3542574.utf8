 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Palestinian cement for Israel barrier
 INIGO GILMORE 				 	 Yasser Arafat: Wall of woe																								Jerusalem, July 25: Palestinian businessmen have made millions of pounds supplying cement for Israels security barrier in the full knowledge of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader and one of the walls most vocal critics.																								A damning report by Palestinian legislators, which has been seen by The Daily Telegraph, concludes that Arafat did nothing to stop the deals although he publicly condemned the structure as a crime against humanity.																								The report claims that the cement was sold with the knowledge of senior officials at the Palestinian ministry of national economy, and close advisers to Arafat. It concludes that officials were bribed to issue import licences for the cement to importers and businessmen working for Israelis.																								One of the reports three authors, Hassan Khreishe  an independent legislator and long-term critic of Arafat  last night called for the Palestinian cabinet to resign.																								Wealthy Palestinians with connections at the highest levels have been making millions helping Israel build this wall while Arafat and the Palestinian Authority have been urging people to fight against it, said Khreishe, a council member from the West Bank city of Tulkarm.																								Why Arafat did nothing about it, we just dont know. These people are traitors who have brought shame on us, and they should be punished.																								An official in Arafats office said: We will not comment because this file has been closed and it is now in the hands of the attorney general.																								Growing resistance to corruption in the Palestinian Authority is posing the most serious internal challenge to Arafats leadership. Last week, gunmen staged a number of kidnappings and attacks on security buildings in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.																								Thousands of Palestinians demonstrated about high-level corruption and the appointment of Arafats cousin, Moussa Arafat, as security chief in the Gaza Strip.																								The report reveals that the cement originally came from Egyptian companies which supplied it at a huge discount of $22 (12.50) a tonne to help rebuild dilapidated Palestinian houses or buildings bulldozed by the Israelis.																								Between September 2003 and March this year, 420,000 tonnes of cement were allegedly sent to three big Palestinian companies. According to the report, however, only 33,000 tonnes were sold in the Palestinian market. The vast bulk was transported to Israel on trucks owned by the three firms. According to Khreishe, the cement was then sold with a mark-up of at least $15 a tonne  and possibly as high as $100  making profits of well over $6 million (3.4 million) for company executives.																								The Legislative Council launched an investigation after Egyptian journalists stumbled upon business links between a German Jewish businessman and the Palestinian companies.																								According to the report, on November 9 last year a letter was sent to Arafat by the Palestinian Authority comptroller, revealing that open-ended import licences for the cement had been signed by Maher al-Masri, the economy minister.																								The Palestinian Authority comptroller asserted in the letter that the cement was destined for the wall. The letter was allegedly received and seen by Arafat on the same day that he urged people to demonstrate on the first international Day against the Wall. According to Khreishe, Arafat took no action to stop further imports, which continued for another five months.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 London, Feb. 4 (Reuters):  He may be one of the few people on earth who knows whether  North Korean leader Kim Jong-il can incinerate Tokyo, and  now he is talking.																								Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khans public confession today that he leaked nuclear secrets is a watershed moment for nuclear non-proliferation that will have ramifications worldwide.																								Within Pakistan it has already unleashed a political firestorm over the extent to which government or military officials were involved. Globally, it will send intelligence agencies scrambling to roll up a network of firms and individuals involved in smuggling nuclear technology. 																								But above all, Washington is likely to focus on whatever Khan can say about the two remaining members of President George W. Bushs axis of evil  Iran and North Korea.																								This is the most important thing, actually, and it is more important than whether hes prosecuted: Are we getting from him, and everyone else in Pakistan, full disclosure on all nodes of the network that was in play here? said George Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.																								In the case of Iran, Khans information could provide Washington with the proof it needs to counter Tehrans assertion that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. In the case of North Korea, it could determine whether Pyongyang already has the bomb.																								Washington has long suspected that Pakistanis sold Tehran and Pyongyang technology to enrich uranium. Basic nuclear bomb designs require either enriched uranium or plutonium as the nuclear material to create an explosion.																								The last few months have seen investigators close in on Khan as other countries came in from the cold. First Iran agreed to admit UN inspectors. Then came Decembers announcement that Libya was ditching its nuclear programme and opening it fully to inspections. 																								The New York Times reported this week that US officials now believe a network linked to Khan did more than sell uranium enrichment technology to Libya  it also sold Libya blueprints for actual bombs.																								The strategic significance is that, if A. Q. Khan provided nuclear weapon designs to Korea, as it now appears he did to Libya, then that could mean that North Korea has a reliable nuclear weapon for the No Dong missile, said Gary Samore at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.

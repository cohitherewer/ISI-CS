 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Tom Cruise on mission director
																								Los Angeles, July 19 (Reuters): Mission: Impossible 3 has a new mission: finding a replacement director for the blockbuster Tom Cruise franchise.																								Joe Carnahan has dropped out of the directors seat because of creative differences, the standard Hollywood explanation in such cases. 																								The film remains scheduled to begin shooting as planned next month in Berlin, said Rob Friedman, vice-chairman of the Paramount Pictures Motion Picture Group.																								Carnahan came on board to direct the latest sequel in the popular franchise in February 2003 after David Fincher exited the project in favour of Lords of Dogtown, which Catherine Hardwicke is now directing.																								Carnahan won acclaim in 2002 for his violent cop thriller Narc, on which Cruise served as an executive producer.																								In M-I:3, Cruise is set to reprise his role as secret agent Ethan Hunt, with Scarlett Johansson, Carrie-Anne Moss, Kenneth Branagh and Ving Rhames rounding out the cast. The 1996 original was directed by Brian De Palma, and the 2000 sequel by John Woo.

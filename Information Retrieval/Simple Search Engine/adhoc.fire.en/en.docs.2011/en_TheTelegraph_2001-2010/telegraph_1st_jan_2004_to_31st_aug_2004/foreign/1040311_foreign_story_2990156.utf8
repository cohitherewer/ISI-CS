 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Whoopi joins gay marriage debate
				 	 Whoopi Goldberg																								New York, March 10 (Reuters): Comedian Whoopi Goldberg thinks same-sex marriage is a laughing matter  and hopes her slant on it will further the national discussion on the subject.																								With gay and lesbian couples testing the marriage laws of states from California to Oregon to Massachusetts, spurring President George W. Bush to call for a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, Goldberg said yesterday she thought it was high time to explore the issue on her NBC sitcom, Whoopi.																								Its a wonderful subject for us to get out there and start talking about and get the discussion to continue, Goldberg said in a telephone interview before taping the episode at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens.																								Weve been working on this for a while. The fact that this has become so spoken about, we decided we better hit it.																								In the show, scheduled to air this spring, Goldbergs character, hotel owner Mavis, agrees to host a wedding for her gay cousin, while at the same time Mavis conservative brother Courtney is using the hotel for a Republican get-together. 																								Goldberg, who has been married three times, said various sides of the debate are presented  and mocked.																								Its presented in a way that was non-condescending and yet thought provoking, said Goldberg, 48. We express many different opinions about it, from the very, very extreme to the very liberal.

 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 HIV medics on death row 
				 	 Two of the Bulgarian medics in the court in Libya. (AFP)																								Benghazi (Libya), May 6 (Reuters): A Libyan court sentenced five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor today to death by firing squad after convicting them of deliberately infecting hundreds of Libyan children with the deadly HIV virus.																								Bulgaria condemned the verdicts announced by court officials as unfair and absurd and was joined in outrage by its western partners  the European Union and the US.																								The issue is a major hurdle to Libya joining an EU economic partnership with Mediterranean region countries.																								Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who is seeking closer ties with the West after more than a decade of international isolation, had promised to swiftly resolve the dispute during a ground-breaking visit to the EU headquarters in Brussels last week.																								The condemned, detained in February 1999, were convicted of infecting 426 Libyan children at a Benghazi hospital with blood products contaminated with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.																								They had pleaded not guilty, insisting the epidemic Tripoli says has killed more than 40 children since 1999 started before they began work at the hospital.																								Prosecutors charged them with uncontrollable murder aimed at destabilising the country, deliberately starting an epidemic... and conspiring to intentionally infect children with the AIDS virus.																								In 2001, Gaddafi had said the children were infected as part of an experiment ordered by the US or Israeli secret services.																								EU aspirant Bulgaria has slammed the trial as unfair, saying there is no hard evidence except for confessions from two nurses who were held without council for a year before being indicted. Nine Libyans have been on trial for torturing the confessions out of them.																								Defence lawyers said they would appeal the sentences.																								Zdravko Georgiev, a Bulgarian doctor and the husband of one of the nurses, was sentenced to four years in jail but was released today on time served.																								Im not happy at the moment. I cannot feel free because I left behind six innocent people, Georgiev told Bulgarian TV after his release.																								Scores of dancing and chanting relatives of the HIV-infected children took to the streets near the court in the Mediterranean port city after the verdicts were announced.																								The verdict is fair. What they did is a crime against humanity. They planted a bomb inside our children, said Ramdane Ali Mohamed, whose younger sister Hiba died of AIDS.																								In Sofia, several hundred sombre demonstrators staged a candle-light vigil for the condemned, aghast at the ruling.																								We are totally convinced they did not conspire to cause the epidemic. Its not possible for a normal person, let alone a nurse, to do such a thing, said pensioner Nina Taneva, 57.

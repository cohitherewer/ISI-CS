 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 No Iraq hand in 9/11, says probe
																								Washington, June 16 (Reuters): Investigators have found no evidence Iraq aided al Qaida attempts to strike the US, a commission investigating the September 11, 2001, attacks said today in a report that undermines Bush administration arguments for war.																								The report by commission staff said al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden had met with a senior Iraqi intelligence officer in 1994 and had explored the possibility of cooperation, but the plans apparently never came to fruition.																								US President George W. Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney this week reiterated pre-war arguments that an Iraqi connection to al Qaida, which is blamed for the September 11 attacks, represented an unacceptable threat. However, the US government-established commission said in a staff report: We have no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaida cooperated on attacks against the US.																								There is no convincing evidence that any government financially supported al Qaida before 9/11  other than limited support provided by the Taliban after bin Laden first arrived in Afghanistan, it added.																								Counterterrorism officials from the FBI and CIA testifying at todays hearing said they agreed with the staff reports conclusion. Democratic presidential candidate Senator John Kerry and other congressional Democrats seized on the news to attack the Bush administration as part of their campaign to unseat the president in November.																								The administration misled America, Kerry said. I believe that the 9/11 report, the early evidence, is that ... we didnt have the types of terrorist links that this administration was asserting. I think thats a very, very serious finding.																								The report was issued at the start of the commissions final two days of public hearings into the hijacked-plane attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. The hearings were called to find out how the US failed to prevent the attacks and what it can do now to improve security. The report stood in contrast to comments this week by Cheney, who said that ousted Iraqi leader Saddam had long-established ties to al Qaida.																								Bush, asked yesterday about Cheneys comments, cited the presence in Iraq of Islamist militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as the best evidence of an Iraqi connection to al Qaeda. 																								Although Cheney and other officials had suggested Iraq might have played a direct role in the September 11 attacks, Bush acknowledged after the war that there was no evidence of this.Pak involvement																								Pakistan benefited from the Taliban-al Qaida relationship as bin Ladens camps trained and equipped fighters for Pakistans ongoing struggle in Kashmir, the report said.																								Pakistan, the report adds, did not break with the Taliban until after 9/11, although it was well aware that the Taliban was harbouring bin Laden.

																								Washington, May 4 (PTI): CBS News delayed broadcasting for two weeks the report on US soldiers abuse of Iraqi prisoners after a request from chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Gen. Richard Myers who thought it would be particularly inflammatory when a battle was going on in full swing in Falluja. 																								Myers called CBS anchor Dan Rather eight days before the report was to be aired and asked for extra time, said Jeff Fager, executive producer of 60 Minutes II. Myers confirmed he made the request. You cant keep this out of the news. But I thought it would be particularly inflammatory at the time, he told ABC-TV yesterday.

 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Pak battles buzz on letting in US hunters
																								Islamabad, March 1 (Reuters): Pakistan denied today a report that it had struck a deal to allow US troops to hunt for al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden on its territory.																								The latest issue of the New Yorker weekly said thousands of US troops would be deployed in a tribal area bordering Afghanistan in return for Washingtons support for Pakistans pardon last month of Abdul Qadeer Khan, a scientist who admitted leaking nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea.																								This report has no truth in it and there is no such deal, military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan said.																								The New Yorker quoted a former senior intelligence official as saying it was a quid pro quo deal with Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf. Were going to get our troops inside Pakistan in return for not forcing Musharraf to deal with Khan.																								Sultan rejected this, saying: There are no quid pro quos on issues of national sovereignty. We totally deny it.																								He said he could not comment on reports that the US planned to shift an elite commando unit that took part in the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq to hunt for bin Laden.																								If the US is shifting a special unit from Iraq into Afghanistan, I have no comment on that, but there is none coming in to Pakistan, he said. After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US, Pakistan became a key ally in the US-led war on terror and has arrested hundreds of al Qaida suspects. But it says it will never allow foreign troops to hunt for militants on its soil.																								US forces hunting al Qaida and Taliban suspects in Afghanistan have expressed frustration about the ability of militants to elude them by slipping across the Pakistani side of the rugged border region and urged Pakistan to do more to help.																								Pakistan says it has deployed tens of thousands of troops along its border with Afghanistan to prevent such movements. Last week it said it detained 20 suspects in the South Waziristan tribal region, but none was a key al Qaida figure.																								On Saturday, Pakistani troops killed at least 11 people they thought were militants when they opened fire on a van in the region. An intelligence official said those killed might not have been militants and the incident was a case of mistaken fire. Residents say fiercely independent tribesmen already sympathetic to al Qaida have been angered by the deaths and civilian killings will not make the Pakistani task easier.																								Today the government imposed a fine of 5.4 million rupees ($94,000) on tribes in South Waziristan after several attacks on military posts there.																								A senior government official said two more rockets were fired overnight, which fell near an area used by the military in North Waziristan but caused no damage or casualties.																								On Saturday, the New York Times quoted senior US and military officials as saying President George W. Bush had approved a plan to intensify the effort against bin Laden.It said the plan would apply new forces and tactics to the hunt and take advantage of better intelligence and improving weather along the Afghan-Pakistan border. The report said the main force in the new effort was Task Force 121, a covert commando team of Special Operations forces and CIA officers involved in capturing Saddam in December. It said the force was gradually shifting resources to Afghanistan.

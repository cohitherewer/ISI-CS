 HILARY ALEXANDER				 	 Eric Clapton: LifelineLondon, August 2: A historic gentlemens outfitters that kitted out Sir Henry Morton Stanley for his journey to find Dr Livingstone is rediscovering its heritage  with the help of a rock star.																								The stylishly dressed guitarist Eric Clapton, 59, moonlights as the co-owner and design director of Cordings of Piccadilly, and for the past seven months has been supervising its re-launch as the home of traditional country clothing.																								Clapton liked its classic shirts and tweed shooting jackets so much that he acquired a 50 per cent stake in December so he could carry on buying them. Cordings was struggling, said Noll Uloth, Claptons business partner and managing director. The previous owners had tried to make it fashionable and it had lost its way. Eric threw us a lifeline.																								Clapton, speaking from America, where he has been on tour since June, said: I wanted to help preserve Cordings for myself. And I would like to ensure its future for the people who still like to buy beautiful country clothes.																								The company, founded in 1839, has a lot of history to capitalise on. 																								It was the originator of such classics as the Covert coat and the Tattersall shirt, and made riding boots for the Queen Mother and the Duke of Windsor. 																								Under Claptons and Uloths direction, the traditional atmosphere is being gradually restored at the London shop, with fishing rods, stuffed pike, roach and chub in glass cases  Clapton is a keen fisherman  and hunting prints. 																								My favourite Cordings pieces are their tweed shooting jackets, said Clapton. I like to aspire to elegance, but never achieve it. I can find the right clothes but cant do anything about my face.

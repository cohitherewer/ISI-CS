 Baquba, Jan. 9 (Reuters):  A bicycle bomb killed six people as they ended Friday prayers  at a Shia mosque in central Iraq, in a reminder that few  are safe from the swirling conflicts still threatening much  of the country.																								Guerrillas earlier fired rockets into a Baghdad hotel used by westerners, and hundreds of US troops raided houses in Saddam Husseins hometown overnight in the hope of capturing the organisers of such attacks.																								In Baquba, 65 km north of Baghdad, unknown attackers strapped a gas cylinder packed with explosives to a bicycle and left it outside a small Shia mosque  close to people praying on the pavement because of lack of space inside.																								At the end of prayers, it exploded, Iraqi police Sergeant Haki Ismail Mustafa said. Officials at a nearby hospital said they knew of 39 people injured.																								Baquba is in a largely Sunni area which is a hotbed of resistance to the US-led occupation of Iraq. American forces have mounted major operations in and around the town to try to capture insurgents.																								Shias make up about 60 per cent of Iraqs 26 million people but were largely excluded from power under the rule of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni. There has been tension between the two communities as they jockey for power in the post-Saddam era.																								A car bomb attack after Friday prayers in the Shia holy city of Najaf in August killed more than 80 people, including one of the most senior leaders of Shias.																								The Najaf assailants have not been identified but there have been whispers among Shias that it was the work of Sunni radicals. Later attacks on Sunni mosques were blamed on Shia militants.																								No one was hurt in the rocket attack on the Burj al-Hayat hotel in central Baghdad, used by western businessmen and US military contractors.

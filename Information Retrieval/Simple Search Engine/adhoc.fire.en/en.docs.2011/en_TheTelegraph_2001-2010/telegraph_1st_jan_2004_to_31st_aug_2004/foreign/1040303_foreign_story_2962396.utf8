The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, March 03, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Paul on toon trail																																	 London, March 2 (Reuters): Paul McCartney is back on the cartoon trail, 20 years after his best-selling Rupert And The Frog Song.																																	The former Beatle, an avid fan of animation since childhood, is releasing Tropical Island Hum, the tale of Wirral the Squirrel with a Liverpool accent. In animation, its good to have a bit of a childlike quality about yourself and I certainly have. Its just something that is in me, said McCartney, announcing the imminent DVD release of the short film.																																	Im still fascinated by the things that fascinated me as a kid, said McCartney whose Rupert cartoon was the best-selling video of 1984. It was accompanied by the chart hit We All Stand Together.																													 																Boar bother Berlin (Reuters): A German hunter stabbed a wild boar to death in a stairwell after the beast rammed through the bolted front door of an apartment bloc and stormed up to the sixth floor, a Berlin newspaper reported on Tuesday. The beast from the local forest sped past a group of children playing outside and into the building in a Berlin suburb, probably in search of food. Petrified neighbours peered through their spy holes fearing their doors would not hold  and called 36-year-old hunter Conrad Meyer. I grabbed him around the neck and then stabbed him square in the heart with my hunting knife, Meyer told the BZ daily newspaper, which showed him in traditional green hunters hat and camouflage kit dragging the carcass away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, January 12, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Murder mystery																																	 London, Jan. 11 (Reuters): One in three Britons believe Princess Diana was the victim of a murder plot, according to a survey by The Mail on Sunday newspaper. 																																	Tuesdays Daily Mirror published a letter written by Diana 10 months before she died in a 1997 Paris car wreck, in which she voiced fears her ex-husband and heir to the throne Prince Charles was plotting to kill her by tampering with the brakes. 																																	Few give credence to that claim and The Mail on Sunday said six out of 10 people questioned in the YouGov poll did not believe Charles would deliberately harm Diana. But one in six said he was capable of causing her death, and 15 per cent believe the British secret services planned her assassination. 																																	The newspaper did not give further details of the exact questions asked by YouGov which interviewed 2,093 people online between Wednesday and Saturday. On the day the Mirror published the letter, plans were announced for an inquest and police inquiry into Dianas death.																													 																Open secret  Nicosia (Reuters): Red faced army bosses  in Cyprus came under fire at the weekend after secret ground  plans of military installations were found in a rubbish  dump. Authorities have launched an inquiry into how the  documents came to be discarded at a landfill, only to be  found on Friday by a curious lorry driver who alerted TV  stations. Local media said the papers contain details ranging  from technical specifications for weapons launch sites to  the thickness of walls at sentry posts dotted along the  islands tensely-guarded ceasefire line. Unconventional  disposal methods have left authorities with egg on their  faces before. Last year reporters stumbled across documents  containing state secrets in bin liners discarded outside  the health ministry.

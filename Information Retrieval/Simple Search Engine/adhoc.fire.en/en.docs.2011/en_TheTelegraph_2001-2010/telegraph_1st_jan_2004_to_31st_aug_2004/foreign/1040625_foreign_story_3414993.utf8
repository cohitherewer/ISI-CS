 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Iran frees UK men, ends diplomatic spat
				 	 British servicemen wait for their plane to take off from Mahshahr airport, 1300 km from Tehran, for the Iranian capital. (Reuters)																								Tehran, June 24 (Reuters): Eight British servicemen were freed today after three nights in the hands of Iranian Revolutionary Guards, ending a diplomatic wrangle that had threatened to inflame tensions over Britains presence in Iraq.																								British diplomats took custody of the eight naval personnel and flew with them to Tehran from the Gulf area where they were detained on Monday after straying into Iranian waters.																								The servicemen were shown blindfolded on Iranian television shortly after their capture, but as diplomacy progressed had also been treated by their captors to chopped meat stew.																								Diplomatic relations had already soured over British pressure on Irans atomic programme but British foreign secretary Jack Straw insisted today he still backed a policy of engagement with Iran, despite the arrests. I am in no doubt at all that our policy of engagements with the government of Iran ... is the best approach, Straw said in London, shortly after the eight were released.																								We have worked hard on diplomatic relations with Iran ... Sometimes the relationships are complicated.																								Diplomats had been locked in negotiations deep into last night, deliberating over the return of the mens equipment. Today, Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi told state television the equipment would be returned.																								The eight were held in the sweltering province of Khuzestan in Irans oil-rich southwest after they were seized on the Shatt al-Arab waterway along the Iran-Iraq border.																								Diplomats visited them yesterday and said they had been well looked after. Television showed them lounging on beds with bright quilts and the semi-official Fars news agency quoted Revolutionary Guards saying they had given their guests a traditional diced-meat stew. At least now we can be pleased that theyre happy and released. And Im told that they are in very good spirits and well cared for, Straw said.																								Irans Arabic-language Al-Alam channel had shown the men blindfolded and forced to walk in single file earlier in their detention. Straw, in comments to reporters outside Prime Minister Tony Blairs Downing Street office, was deliberately conciliatory and avoided comment on the TV images of the men that have outraged many in Britain.																								Obviously Im very pleased indeed as I know their families and service colleagues will be, he said of their imminent homecoming. Id like to express my thanks to my colleague, Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi, for his assistance.																								The eight men had been taken to the British embassy in Tehran, from where they would probably return to their base in Iraq, a spokesman for Blair said.																								While deeply opposed to the US-led war in Iraq, Iran has in the past turned a blind eye to foreign aircraft and boats on its western border. But hardline Iranian newspapers were unenthusiastic about the prospect of an early release.

 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Reform row in Riyadh
																								Riyadh, Aug. 9 (Reuters): Three Saudi activists were charged today with criticising the political establishment of the conservative kingdom at the start of a trial that has put Riyadhs vows for wide-ranging reform in the spotlight.																								The three reformists  Abdullah al-Hamed, Matruk al-Faleh and Ali al-Dumaini  have been in jail since they were rounded up in March with several pro-democracy protesters. The trial appeared at odds with the cautious reform programme championed in recent months by de facto ruler Crown Prince Abdullah.

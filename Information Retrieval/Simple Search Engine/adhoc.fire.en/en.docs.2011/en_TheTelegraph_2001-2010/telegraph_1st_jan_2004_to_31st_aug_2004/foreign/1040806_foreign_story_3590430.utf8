 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 US vows not to yield to abductors
																								Washington, Aug. 5 (Reuters): The US-led military coalition in Iraq vowed not to make any more concessions to kidnappers after the Philippines withdrew its troops to release a hostage, the US said yesterday.																								In an effort to present a united front against a wave of kidnappings, the US issued a policy statement that it said was supported by the coalition hoping to send a message to hostage-takers they would not win their demands.																								We understand that conceding to terrorists will only endanger all members of the multinational force, as well as other countries who are contributing to Iraqi reconstruction, the statement said.																								The US has faced an erosion in its coalition this year and insurgents have tested the will of governments to keep troops in Iraq by targeting their citizens with kidnappings and beheadings. Kidnappers won the Philippines withdrawal of its roughly 50 troops last month.

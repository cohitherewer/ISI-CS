 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Israelis find idyllic love through the Internet
				 	 Picture of a dating websiteTel Aviv, May 2 (Reuters): Imagine  an endless black book of potential dates, one where the undesirables, the stalkers or possible psychopaths can be dismissed into the void with the click of a mouse.																								For the lovelorn, the Internet offers a virtual world of romance and fantasy, an anonymous venue for trysts in the privacy of your bedroom or study.																								All it takes is registering for an online chat, picking an icon that shows youre looking for love and youll find it instantly and in myriad ways.																								The accessibility of cyberlove, where anonymity offers a cloak of safety and the possibility to play several roles at once, is likely to whittle away at the concept of monogamy, said Aaron Ben-Zeev, the Israeli author of Love Online.																								You may have an online relationship at the same time as an offline relationship, said Ben-Zeev, a Haifa University philosopher. Then, because it is so easy to form an online relationship, it is very tempting to form more.																								As the generation born into the Internet age grows older, exclusivity in romantic relationships will fall by the wayside, or at least change in definition, he believes. Partners may lay down rules for one anothers virtual encounters, or even enjoy them together. 																								It may take time.																								In May 2002, the BBC reported that a woman slashed her husbands thyroid artery as he slept because he was planning to bring a woman he had met on the Internet to England.																								The rules of the game are different in cyberspace. Popularity marks go not to the handsome or beautiful but the virtuoso typists and masters of the written word. Intimacy comes through sharing deep secrets and buried fantasies.																								Ben-Zeev, an expert on emotions who read blogs (Internet diaries) about other experiences with cyberlove to write his book, noted that human beings have never before had access to such an ambivalent type of romantic relationship.																								The danger of predators in cyberspace, he says, is small. The risk comes only when virtual love moves off the Internet and into the real world  as it did in the death of a 16-year-old Israeli youth at the start of the Palestinian uprising in 2000.																								The teenager met a Palestinian woman posing as a tourist on the Internet. The woman lured him to Jerusalem with promises of a tete-a-tete, but instead of romance, the teenager found death at the hands of Palestinian gunmen.																								Israeli journalist Daphna Lewy first entered the arena of virtual love on assignment, creating more than 30 unique personalities ranging from a teenage boy to elderly grandmother.																								Everyone I know is doing it, said 40-year-old Lewy. At the end I wrote the article and was left with one of these identities I related to most. I really got to know lots of people, it wasnt just romantic experiences. 																								In Israel, where most surfers choose to communicate in Hebrew, long-term cyberlove is rare, primarily because of the proximity of virtual lovers in a small country. What characterises Israelis on the Internet is that they use the chats and dating services usually only to make the first acquaintance, to find the person, not to build a long-term relationship, said Ben Zeev.																								Lewy, who speaks fluent English, met many new friends by surfing the Net and turned a two-year cyberfriendship with a British man into an offline love story.																								She said the Internets advantage to real-life dating is its initial anonymity that allows for the baring of ones soul  while also offering a quick getaway. 																								If I go too far, expose myself too much, feel uncomfortable or the reaction I get is not really to my liking, then I can click and that is it, the relationship is over, she said.																								As more and more people turn to cyberlove, society will face the challenge of juggling virtual romance alongside offline relationships, said Ben-Zeev.																								We will have to change our social and moral norms to accommodate this phenomena.

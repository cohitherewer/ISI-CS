 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Hate attack stuns France
																								Paris, July 12 (Reuters): French politicians, police and religious leaders appealed today for severe punishments and new ideas to combat race hatred that led to an anti-Semitic attack on a young mother and her baby on a train.																								Amid calls for swift justice, police sought witnesses along the northern Paris train line where six youths of Arab and African origin robbed the woman and daubed swastikas on her stomach on Friday because they thought she was Jewish.																								President Jacques Chiracs office announced that this years annual Bastille Day pardon for minor crimes, which falls on Wednesday, would not apply for race hate or sexist crimes. 																								But the wave of indignation, only days after Chirac urged redoubled efforts against racism, did not hide the fact that Paris has no easy answer to rising racial and religious tension.																								I hope those who committed this barbarous act are identified quickly and punished with utmost severity, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.																								The attackers wrongly assumed the victim, 23, was Jewish because her papers bore an address in a rich Paris district. The mother was not badly hurt and the baby was unharmed when the attackers knocked over a stroller she was sitting in. 																								Roger Cukierman, head of a Jewish group, made an unusual appeal to Muslim prayer leaders: Religious organisations, and especially the imams in the housing estates where such aggressors live, must talk sense and show that anti-Semitic acts are unacceptable.

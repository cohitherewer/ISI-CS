The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, April 09, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Double or bust																																	 Los Angeles, April 8 (Reuters): A British man who has sold all his possessions, including his clothes, will stand in a rented tuxedo on Sunday and bet everything on a single spin of the roulette wheel.																																	If he wins, he doubles his money. If he loses, he will be left with only the television crew documenting his every move.																																	Ashley Revell, a 32-year-old Londoner, said he was worth about 75,000 ($138,000) after he sold everything in March. I thought I was worth at least 100,000, he said in a telephone interview from Las Vegas, where he is putting in a week of gambling about $3,000 in a bid to raise his pot.																																	By yesterday, he was down $1,000.																																	Revell said he had planned to have a friend videotape his bet-it-all spin, but Britains Sky One television decided it was worth a short reality series, called Double or Nothing. Sky will not pay him, he says, but a crew has followed his preparation and will cover the spin live on Sunday at the Hard Rock casino in Las Vegas. It also plans to follow him for a month afterward, win or lose.																													 																Kipling taleLondon (AFP): An unfinished childrens tale by British author Rudyard Kipling, dug up after decades in an English school, has been published for the first time, a charity organisation dedicated to the author said. Scylla and Charybdis, part of Kiplings Stalky and Co. saga about boys at a boarding school, sees Stalky and his friends catch a colonel cheating at golf. The manuscript was discovered by an archivist at a school built on the same site as the authors own childhood school in Windsor, west of London. The Kipling Societys secretary Jeffrey Lewis said the novel was probably left unpublished because Kipling did not think it was good enough.																													 																Clean crime																																	 London (AFP): An obsessive car thief who carefully cleaned the vehicles he took before returning them to their owners in perfect condition has been jailed by a British court, a report said on Thursday. Colin Sadd  described by one judge as the man you would most want to steal your car  received a six-year sentence at a court in sheffield, northern england, the Daily Telegraph reported. The 41-year-old contract cleaner, who has 155 previous convictions for mainly car-related crimes, admitted five counts of stealing cars. The court was told that Sadd would dress smartly and pose as a customer at vehicle showrooms before snatching keys and driving away in a car. After driving them for several hours, he would wash and polish the car, as well as thoroughly cleaning the exterior, before returning them undamaged to their owners, the paper said.

Pasadena (California), Aug. 20 (Reuters): Nasa has recruited two Hollywood helicopter stunt pilots for an especially tricky manoeuvre  snagging a capsule full of stardust as it parachutes back to Earth next month .																								The mid-air retrieval 1,219 metres above the Utah desert on September 8 is the planned climax to the space agencys $264 million Genesis mission, which began three years ago with the launch of a space probe to collect tiny charged particles called ions blown toward Earth from the sun.																								Scientists say the resulting cargo of solar ions, about 10 to 20 microgrammes of oxygen, nitrogen and other elements that collectively weigh about as much as a few grains of salt, will yield key insights about the formation of planets at the dawn of the solar system.																								The novel scheme for snaring the re-entry capsule, thus sparing the canister from a rocky landing that could damage the delicate instruments and samples inside, was unveiled for reporters yesterday at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.																								The return of the Genesis probe will mark the first bits of extraterrestrial matter retrieved from space by human means since the 1970s.																								If successful, it also will make aviation history as the first man-made object captured by aircraft as it entered Earths atmosphere from space, said Roy Haggard, an aerospace research executive hired by Nasa to design the Genesis retrieval project.																								He said helicopters were used in thousands of missions to grab parachuted canisters of film shot by spy cameras over Vietnam and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. 																								But in recruiting personnel for Genesis, Haggard said all the experts kept pointing to stunt pilots as the best suited for the job.																								In the end, he hired Cliff Fleming as his chief pilot for the Genesis project and backup Dan Rudert, both leading Hollywood stunt pilots.

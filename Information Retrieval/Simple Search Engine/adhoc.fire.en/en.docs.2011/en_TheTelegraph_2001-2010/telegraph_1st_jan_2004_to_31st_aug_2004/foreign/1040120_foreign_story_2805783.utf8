 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Omar twist to Pervez probe
				 	 Sheikh Omar 																								Hyderabad (Pakistan), Jan. 19 (Reuters): A British-born militant, who was released by India to end the Kandahar hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane in 1999, is being questioned about two attempts to kill Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, police said today.																								Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh or Sheikh Omar was moved to Islamabad from Hyderabad at the weekend for questioning over the bomb attacks on Musharraf last month, police said. Sheikh Omar was taken to Islamabad yesterday after a request from investigators in President Musharrafs cases, Mansoor Ahmed, deputy superintendent of police in Hyderabad said. He was flown to Islamabad by helicopter.																								Musharraf was not hurt in the two attacks within days of each other in Rawalpindi, adjoining the capital Islamabad. 																								A police source in Hyderabad said investigators suspected there might be a link between Omar and the militants who attacked Musharraf. 																								Before and after the attacks on the President, a few suspected militants visited Sheikh Omar in Hyderabad jail, he said.																								On December 25, suicide car bombers attacked Musharrafs motorcade. He narrowly escaped another assassination attempt on December 14, when powerful explosive charges destroyed a bridge just seconds after his motorcade passed over it. 																								The suspicion of Omars involvement in the attempts added a new dimension to the case. One of the two suicide bombers has been identified as an active member of the Jaish and another of the Harkatul al-Alami. Omar is believed to have an association with both.																								Sheikh Omar was sentenced to death in July 2002 for masterminding the murder of Daniel Pearl, the south Asia bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal. He denied the charge and has lodged an appeal, but after he was sentenced, he warned that anyone who wanted to kill him would himself be killed.

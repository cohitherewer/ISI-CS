Salt Lake City, March 12 (AP): A pregnant woman who allegedly ignored medical warnings to have a Caesarean section to save her twins was charged with murder after one of the babies was stillborn.																								Prosecutors said Melissa Ann Rowland, 28, did not want the scars that accompany the surgery. 																								An autopsy found the baby died two days before its January 13 delivery and that it would have survived if Rowland had had a Caesarean-section when her doctors urged her to, between Christmas and January 9. The other baby is alive, but authorities had no further information. The doctors had warned that without a C-section, the twins would probably die, authorities said. 																								A nurse told police Rowland said a Caesarean would ruin her life and she would rather lose one of the babies than be cut like that. The charges carry five years to life in prison. Rowland was jailed on $250,000 bail.

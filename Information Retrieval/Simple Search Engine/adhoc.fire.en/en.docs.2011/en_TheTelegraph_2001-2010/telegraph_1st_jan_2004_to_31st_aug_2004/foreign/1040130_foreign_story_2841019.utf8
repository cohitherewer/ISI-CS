The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Finally, a book written entirely in SMS jargon
 Paris, Jan. 29 (AFP): A  new book claiming to be the first written entirely in the  abbreviated slang used in mobile phone text messages has  come out in France with an anti-smoking story aimed at teenagers.																								The novel: Pa Sage a Taba  which, translated from French jargon, means not wise to smoke with a pun playing on the expression for beating someone up  may annoy the guardians of the French language but it will also serve as an entertaining public service for youngsters, the author, Phil Marso, said.																								Twelve-to fifteen-year-olds are the biggest users of SMS (short message system), sending an average of 57 per month, he said. The book relies on the concise, if sometimes confusing, slang that has sprung up around the Internet and mobile phones as a way of getting words across in a minimum of key presses.																								A passage in the book has a dtektive (detective) asking the villain: 6 j tasprge d 2 kologne histoar 2 partag lj odeurs ke tu me fi subir? which, once expanded and translated, would come across as: What if I spray you with cologne so you can share the smells you make me suffer?																								Other sentences showcase the French equivalents of terms along the same lines as English Internet equivalents that have given rise to lol (for laugh out loud), d8 (for date), and omg (for oh my god).

 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Life term for Arafat heir
																								Tel Aviv, June 6 (Reuters): An Israeli court today jailed Palestinian revolt leader Marwan Barghouthi for life on murder convictions but the man seen as Yasser Arafats possible successor said his peoples statehood quest would not be broken.																								The (Israeli) occupation is going to end one day. It is dying, Barghouthi, 45, said just before the Tel Aviv court handed down five consecutive life sentences for murder over the killings of five people by militants in his Fatah faction.																								Barghouthi, who denied involvement in militant ambushes, received another 20 years for attempted murder and a further 20 for activity in a terror group  165 years in total  in a high-profile case that Palestinians denounced as a show trial.																								This is a courageous decision by the court that had a difficult task finding justice for victims while the Barghouthi side tried to turn it into a political trial, said Daniel Taub, the Israeli foreign ministrys spokesperson on legal affairs.																								A fiery and articulate Palestinian lawmaker, Barghouthi did not recognise the jurisdiction of the court that convicted him of murder last month but acquitted him of 21 other killings, citing insufficient evidence.																								Its a comedic court. The Israeli occupation doesnt have the right to judge our struggle or a hero like Barghouthi, Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie, who has criticised militant violence as counterproductive to Palestinian aspirations, said on Voice of Palestine radio.

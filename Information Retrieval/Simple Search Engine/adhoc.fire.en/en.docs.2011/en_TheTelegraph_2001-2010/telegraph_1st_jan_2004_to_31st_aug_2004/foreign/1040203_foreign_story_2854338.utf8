 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Dozens hurt in Nepal protest
																								Kathmandu, Feb. 2 (Reuters): Nepali police used batons to stop protesters criticising the countrys king during an anti-government rally in Kathmandu today and injured dozens of people, witnesses said.																								The protest was held during a one-day strike by Opposition parties to press demands for a new government. Shops and schools remained closed and most public transport was off the streets. Police were merciless in beating peaceful demonstrators, said Amrit Bohara, a member of the Communist Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) party.																								The government is trying to suppress the protest by the use of force. We will not give in but fight for our demands.

 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Osama, lover of volleyball and hater of ice
				 	 Osama bin Laden																								Ottawa, March 4 (Reuters): A Canadian documentary about a family closely linked to Osama bin Laden portrays the al Qaida chief as a well-meaning family man who banned ice in drinks, loves volleyball and has trouble controlling his children.																								The programme, broadcast on CBC television last night, lifted the veil on the private life of the worlds most wanted man, accused of masterminding the September 11, 2001, suicide attacks in the US. It included lengthy interviews with the widow and children of Ahmed Said Khadr, an Egyptian-born friend of bin Laden and an accused al Qaida financier.																								Khadr was killed in a gun battle with Pakistani police last October, and his son, Omar, 17, is in US custody in Guantanamo Bay accused of involvement in the death of an American soldier in Afghanistan.																								Another son, 21-year-old Abdurahman Khadr, was released from Guantanamo Bay late last year and now lives in Toronto. In the documentary he described bin Laden as quite normal.																								He has issues with his wife, and he has issues with his kids, financial issues, you know, the kids arent listening, the kids arent doing this and that. It comes down to (the fact) hes a father and hes a person, he said.																								Khadrs 23-year-old daughter Zaynab, who lives with her mother in Pakistan, said bin Laden was athletic.																								He loved playing volleyball. And he loved horse riding... Kids played around him... And (when) theyd go shooting hed go with them. If he missed his (shot), theyd laugh at him and stuff like that, she said.																								Zaynab said bin Laden imposed many restrictions on his three wives and their children and banned the use of electricity in their part of the compound.																								He didnt allow them to drink cold water... because he wanted them to be prepared (so that if) one day theres no cold water, theyd be able to survive and it wouldnt be so difficult for them, she said.

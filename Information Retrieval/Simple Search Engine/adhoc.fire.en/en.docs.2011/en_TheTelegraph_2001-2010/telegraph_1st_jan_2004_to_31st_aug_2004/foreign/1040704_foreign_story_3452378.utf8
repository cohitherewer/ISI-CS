 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Madonna cancels concert after church row
				 	 Madonna																								Lisbon, July 3 (AFP): Madonna has cancelled what would have been her first-ever concert in Portugal after a row with an evangelical church, local media has reported.																								The superstar was scheduled to bring her Reinvention concert tour to the 12,000-seat Atlantic pavilion in Lisbon on September 12, according to concert promoters Tournee yesterday who booked the space in April for September 9-13.																								But after the concert had been announced, the Lisbon-based Mana Christian Church said it had already booked the grounds for September 8-11 to hold a convention of faith.																								The church said it had reserved the grounds in February and it has refused to change the booking despite pleas from fans and an offer of a 25,000 euro ($30,000 ) donation from Tournee. 																								Jorge Tadeu, a self-proclaimed apostle and founder of the church, told tabloid Correio da Manha last month he was revolted by those who want to exchange Jesus for Madonna.																								In our understanding God is moving the Christian church to defeat Goliath, he added.																								We feel the pressure from Madonna is not restricted to the Mana church, but is part of a wider battle between the devil and Christ.																								 The Mana church said in a statement issued yesterday to national news agency Lusa that it had been informed by the singers legal representative in Europe, John Giddings, that the concert would no longer take place.

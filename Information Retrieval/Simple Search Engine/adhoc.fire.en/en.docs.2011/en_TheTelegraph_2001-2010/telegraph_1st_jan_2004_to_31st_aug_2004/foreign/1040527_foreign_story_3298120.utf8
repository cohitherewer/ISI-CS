 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 NYT admits Iraq coverage not rigorous enough
																								New York, May 26 (Reuters): The New York Times acknowledged today it had failed to adequately challenge information from Iraqi exiles who were determined to show Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and overthrow him.																								In an unusual note from the editors,The Times and Iraq, the newspaper said it found a number of instances before the March 2003 US and British invasion of Iraq and early in the occupation, of coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been. The note said editors should have been challenging reporters and pressing for more scepticism.																								The Bush administration also has been faulted for relying on inaccurate or incomplete intelligence in asserting Saddam had an ongoing weapons program, a primary reason cited for the US-led war in Iraq. 																								No significant biological, chemical or nuclear weapons have been found.																								The Times said it had relied on Iraqi exile Ahmad Chalabi, once considered Washingtons top Iraq ally. Until last week Chalabi was paid by the US for intelligence information that has proven to be faulty in many cases.																								Chalabi was an occasional source in its articles since at least 1991 and introduced reporters to other exiles, the newspaper said.																								Complicating matters for journalists, the accounts of these exiles were often eagerly confirmed by US officials convinced of the need to intervene in Iraq, the note said. 																								Administration officials now acknowledge that they sometimes fell for misinformation from these exile sources.																								So did many news organisations  in particular, this one, the note said.																								While the newspaper assigned no blame to individual reporters, a good deal of criticism has been directed at Times reporter Judith Miller, who wrote several articles about Iraqs purported weapons of mass destruction.

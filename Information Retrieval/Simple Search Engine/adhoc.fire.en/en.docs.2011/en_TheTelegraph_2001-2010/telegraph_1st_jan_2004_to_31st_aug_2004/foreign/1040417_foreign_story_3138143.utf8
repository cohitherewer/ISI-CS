 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Chlorine leak kills 7 in China
Beijing, April 16 (PTI): Seven people were killed, three injured and about 150,000 evacuated today after a series of explosions rocked the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing following a major chlorine gas leakage from a chemical factory, local officials said.																								Loud explosions were heard from the Tianyuan chemical plant, from where the highly irritating, greenish-yellow gas began leaking late last night, Xinhua news agency reported.																								About 150,000 people living near the chemical factory in Jiangbei district of Chongqing municipality were evacuated from the area today, as toxic fumes filled the air, Xinhua reported from the city.																								All residents living within one kilometre of the leak and some citizens living in an urban area facing the plant on the other side of Jialing river were evacuated, vice-mayor Zhou Mubing said. 																								Firefighters estimated that at least seven liquefied chlorine gas furnaces, with a load of six tonnes of gas each, are letting off toxic fumes.																								Inhalation of 2.5 milligrams of chlorine gas is enough to cause death and symptoms of inhalation include bronchial spasm, dropsy and respiratory difficulty.

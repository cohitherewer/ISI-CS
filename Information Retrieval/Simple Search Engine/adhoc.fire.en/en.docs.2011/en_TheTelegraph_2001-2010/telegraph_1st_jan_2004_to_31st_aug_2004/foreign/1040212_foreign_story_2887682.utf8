 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Flu found in Delaware flock again
																								Washington, Feb. 11 (Reuters): A bird flu virus has been discovered in a second chicken flock in Delaware, sparking concerns the outbreak could seriously threaten the mid-Atlantic regions poultry industry, state officials said yesterday.																								Delaware officials said the bird flu virus found in a commercial flock of chickens in Sussex County was the same H7 strain found last week at another farm 8 km away. 																								The H7 virus, which is not transmissible to humans, is different from the strain that has killed at least 19 people and decimated poultry stocks in 10 Asian nations.																								State officials, who had believed the first case was an isolated incident, immediately banned the sale of live poultry in the state as a precaution.																								This development is completely unexpected given the precautions we took, the investigation we made and the industrys expectations of this diseases behaviour, Delawares agriculture secretary Michael Scuse said.																								This is now a serious situation for the DelMarVa poultry industry, he added, referring to the Delaware, Maryland and Virginia region. 																								Last year, broiler production in the three states totalled 3.21 billion pounds, about 10 per cent of annual US chicken production. Delaware said it will kill 72,000 birds in three chicken houses to stop the spread of the virus. The state slaughtered 12,000 chickens after the first finding.																								State officials declined to identify the company that purchases poultry from the infected commercial flock. 																								The new case will delay efforts by the US agriculture department to convince trading partners to ease bans on US poultry, industry officials said.

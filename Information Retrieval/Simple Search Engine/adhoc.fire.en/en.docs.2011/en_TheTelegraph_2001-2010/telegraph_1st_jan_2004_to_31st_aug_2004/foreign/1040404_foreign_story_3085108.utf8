 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Lost memory movies stick to the mind
 DESSON THOMSON  Jim Carrey (top) and Kate Winslet. (Reuters) Los Angeles, April 3: The compelling Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, in which two lovers (Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) decide to erase their memories of each other, is just one of many recent movies about the misplacing or insidious alteration of memory. 																								In such films as Mulholland Drive, Memento, Iris, The Bourne Identity, Paycheck, Solaris, Finding Nemo, 50 First Dates and Eternal Sunshine, characters find themselves trapped and clueless in their own cognitive shrubbery.																								Those mazes can lead to false memories  ones concocted by sinister governments or ones that reveal the hero himself (or herself) to have artificial intelligence.																								 Often, the way out is a matter of life and death because  look out!  someones looking to kill them before they figure things out. 																								In 1962s The Manchurian Candidate, which Jonathan Demme has remade this year, the hero is programmed to kill someone else. 																								Along with Manchurian, slated for release on July 30, we can also look forward to The Notebook, in which an old man (James Garner) tries to jog an old lovers memory  eroded by Alzheimers disease  about their long-ago affair. 																								Although source material for some of the latest round of memory films (by Philip K. Dick and Richard Condon, to name a few) was written years ago, and weve had such movies before (Random Harvest and Spellbound in the 1940s, for instance), we have to wonder: Is Hollywood making so many of them, and are we watching them, because many of us suspect we are losing our minds? 																								An increasing number of middle-agers are in the sandwich generation, taking care of ageing parents, some of them succumbing to Alzheimers and other forms of dementia. And theyre also taking care of kids, an increasing number of whom are being flagged with learning disabilities. 																								Everyones a part of this sandwich, young and old. Life is becoming more stressful and multitask-oriented. Many of us feel our brains arent holding onto everything they need. Were losing it, or think we are. 																								Is that why were especially engaged by people trying to hack their way out of those overgrown hedges in search of sanity, memory and peace? 																								Many of these movies involve finding love, too. And going home, where a Penelope-like figure often awaits her Odysseus.																								 But what use is going back without your memory? It turns out that home is where the mind is. 					 LOS ANGELES TIMES- WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

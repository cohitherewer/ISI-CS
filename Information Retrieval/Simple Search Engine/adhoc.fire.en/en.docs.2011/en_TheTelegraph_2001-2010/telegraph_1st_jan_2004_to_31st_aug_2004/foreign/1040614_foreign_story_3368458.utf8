 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Million-dollar Qaida suspect in Pakistan net
																								Islamabad, June 13 (Reuters): Pakistan arrested an al Qaida suspect with a $1-million reward on his head, and eight other militants suspected of carrying out an attack on the Karachi military commander last week, the information minister said today.																								Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said that an Arab national, an important member of the al Qaida network, had been arrested. He was identified as Musaad Aruchi. The al Qaida person is the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the minister said.																								Khalid was the alleged mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US and was arrested in a Pakistani army majors house in Rawalpindi near Islamabad last year.																								In a separate development, the minister said, eight militants suspected of involvement in an attack on Karachis army chief had also been arrested. Gunmen ambushed a convoy escorting Lieutenant-General Ahsan Saleem Hayat on a main road in the volatile port city last Thursday. He escaped unharmed, but 10 people were killed, including his driver. 																								Troops continued to battle al Qaida-linked militants today in a remote tribal region bordering Afghanistan, with the military saying more than 70 combatants had been killed in five days of fighting.																								At least 55 militants were killed in South Waziristan, a mountain region 400 km southwest of Islamabad, and security forces lost 17 men, Pakistan military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan said. At least three civilians were also killed. Most militants killed were foreigners, Sultan said. The operation against them in that area is now almost over.																								In a separate incident overnight, security forces killed at least eight suspected militants who tried to enter Pakistan from Afghanistan, an army official said.																								The men were among a group of suspected militants riding in three vehicles who tried to enter the Angoradda area in South Waziristan, he said on the condition of anonymity.																								When they were challenged, they opened fire. Our soldiers responded, destroying their two vehicles and killing at least eight of them, he said.																								Their bodies are on the Afghan side of the border, he said, adding Pakistani troops did not sustain any casualties.																								Pakistan says up to 600 foreign militants, including Arabs, Chechens and Uzbeks linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network, have been hiding out in the semi-autonomous tribal areas, protected by the tribesmen.																								The army has sealed borders with Afghanistan in a bid to stop them fleeing or getting reinforcements, officials said.																								Overnight, artillery fire boomed in the Shakai area of South Waziristan, where Pakistani forces were trying to flush out foreign militants and their local supporters, witnesses said.																								Our houses shook because of the artillery fire all night, said one resident in Wana, the main town of South Waziristan.																								Militants fired rockets at two remote Pakistani posts near the Afghan border last night, but there was no report of casualties, residents said. Pakistani forces sent jets to bomb militant hideouts on Friday for the first time  raising the stakes in the war against al Qaida in the country. No air strikes were carried out today, residents said.

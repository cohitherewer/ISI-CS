Two rockets were fired at them, said Khalas Ahmed, a 15-year-old boy selling cigarettes from a nearby kiosk. The Americans started firing back. The bullets hit my kiosk and I dived to the ground.

All three men inside were killed.																								A US military spokeswoman in Baghdad said she had no immediate information on the incident. 																								Hundreds of people participated in the protest against the arrest of a young woman by troops in the town yesterday.

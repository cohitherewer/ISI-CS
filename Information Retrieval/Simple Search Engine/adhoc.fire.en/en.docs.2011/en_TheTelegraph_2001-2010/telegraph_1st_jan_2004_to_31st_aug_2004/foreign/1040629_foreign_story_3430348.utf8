 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Iraq tries to make sense of Bush-style sovereignty
 															- Presidents seal 				 	 A note received on Monday by George W. Bush during the Nato summit in Istanbul from Condoleezza Rice confirming Iraqi sovereignty and Bushs reply: Let Freedom Reign!. (AFP)																								When the US formal transfer of sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government was televised on Monday, some Iraqis on a bustling downtown street dismissed it as a cosmetic change in a country destabilised by occupation.																								But others said the handover was a step in the right direction, and called on Prime Minister Iyad Allawi to take stern measures to restore stability.																								We are happy. Although Allawi was chosen by the Americans, at least now we have some sovereignty, said Mohammed al-Daraji, a driver for a transport company. Allawi may succeed, if he is very tough.																								At a grimy transport firm, long-haul drivers predicted more trouble on Iraqs roads, where they have seen everything from suicide bombings to carjackings in the last 14 months.																								What could change now? I was held up by armed men and then detained by the Americans for a month for holding a weapon in my vehicle for protection, said Ali Ibrahim.																								How can sovereignty mean anything when American soldiers are going to stay in Iraq? If they leave, it will be stable.																								Although Iraqis were happy to see their interim government take over after the occupation that ended 24 years of Saddam Husseins rule, some questioned the extent of their sovereignty.																								We will have an American embassy here with thousands of employees, the biggest embassy in the world. The Americans will keep interfering, said the transport companys manager, Bashar. Sovereignty means full sovereignty  no American troops.																								Many of his drivers hope sovereignty means Iraqis will no longer be treated as second-class citizens on the Jordanian border, where passport inspections became rigorous after Saddams 1990 invasion of Kuwait.																								We have been treated badly for so long. I drove Iraqi families to Jordan and the customs people would just send them back. This Iraqi passport has no value in the rest of the world, said driver Abbas Mahmoud, waving a friends passport.																								The al-Quds transport company, with its diverse ethnic mix of employees, offers a glimpse into the minds of a people who have seen no way out of suffering for decades.																								First there was Saddams brutal one-party state. Then President George W. Bushs troops invaded with promises of prosperity and democracy. Now Allawis untested government faces a host of challenges, with security as the highest priority.																								Violence has become so pervasive that many want to see stern measures to restore security. Allawi says the government plans to introduce emergency laws, including curfews.																								I want to behead Saddam Hussein for what he did. He killed four members of my family, said Akeel Kathim, another driver. Despite that I hope he comes back because only he can end the security crisis.																								The roads were safe under Saddam because criminals faced severe sentences such as long prison terms, or the severing of hands for illegal money dealing. During the chaos of occupation, armed gangs preyed on motorists. Now al-Quds 25 drivers can only wait to see if Allawi delivers.					 REUTERS

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Saudis veto bargain for American
				 	 Blindfolded American hostage Paul Marshal Johnson in a frame from an al Qaida video. (AP)																								Riyadh, June 16 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia will not give in to al Qaidas demands to free jailed militants to secure the release of an American the group kidnapped last week, Saudi official sources said today.																								The al Qaida has threatened that unless Saudi authorities free the militants by Friday it will kill the hostage, engineer Paul Marshal Johnson. There is no way they are going to agree to their demands, Nawaf Obaid, a senior Saudi security consultant, said.																								There is no way they will release any of those militants who have been key to providing information to disrupt operations of those (militants) outside.																								Saudi government foreign affairs adviser Adel al-Jubeir told CNN that his government was looking into the situation and consulting the US on what actions to take. And then we will make decisions on what the next steps are but our history has been one of not negotiating with terrorists, he said.																								The threat to kill Johnson, which follows a spate of suicide bombings and shootings in the past six weeks, raised the stakes in al Qaidas war to topple the kingdoms pro-US monarchy and drive out westerners from the worlds largest oil exporter.																								On a website, al Qaida showed Johnson, kidnapped in the capital Riyadh on Saturday, blindfolded and sitting in a chair with one sleeve of his orange uniform ripped off showing a tattoo.																								An accompanying statement said: If the tyrants in the Saudi government want to secure the release of the American hostage, they must release our mujahideen held hostage in its jails. They have 72 hours from today (Tuesday) or else we will sacrifice him.																								Saudi Arabias de facto ruler Crown Prince Abdullah showed no signs of compromise, saying the kingdom would strike soon against al Qaida. We have forces and until now they have not appeared but you will see them in the coming days, he said late yesterday. We can only be patient for so long and from now on you will see things that will reassure you, he said.																								Mansour al-Nogaidan, a Saudi writer and former Islamist radical, said he believed Johnson would be killed and that the militants would carry on out more attacks and kidnappings.																								There will be no negotiations or release of anyone. This American will be killed and there will be more kidnappings. This is a dangerous escalation.																								A US state department official said Washington would use every appropriate resource to gain Johnsons safe release but would make no concessions to the kidnappers. Johnson was the first westerner to be kidnapped in a wave of militant attacks in the kingdom that began more than a year ago.

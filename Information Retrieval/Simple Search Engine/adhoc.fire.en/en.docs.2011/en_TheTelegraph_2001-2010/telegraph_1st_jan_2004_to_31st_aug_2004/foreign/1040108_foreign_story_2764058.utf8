 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Arnies salesmanship skills face budget test
 MICHAEL FINNEGAN 				 	 Arnold Schwarzenegger in Sacramento, California, on Tuesday. (Reuters)																								Sacramento, Jan. 7: Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger described himself yesterday as a salesman by nature.																								If I can sell tickets to my movies like Red Sonja or Last Action Hero, you know I can sell just about anything, he joked in his first State of the State address. But even for a Hollywood film star whose marketing skills have proved one of his most valuable assets as a politician, promotion of the billions of dollars in government cuts he will propose later this week will pose a daunting challenge. 																								The full scope of the pain that Schwarzenegger would mete out to resolve Californias fiscal crisis will become clear only on Friday, when he releases his budget.																								But that budget is sure to include cuts that could trigger a voter backlash. And in his State of the State speech, Schwarzenegger set out on the task of dodging political damage. 																								Aides are well aware of the potential peril. Hes going to take a lot of water, no matter what, one Schwarzenegger advisor acknowledged. 																								For the short term, the question is whether Schwarzenegger can draw enough power from his status as a mega-celebrity to overcome lawmakers resistance to his budget and recover from any dip in his popularity. 																								For the long term, Schwarzeneggers political interests dictate a fast resolution to the budget crisis to ease his path to re-election in 2006, should he seek a second term. 																								Its kind of like Civil War surgery: If youre going to take someones leg off, then do it quickly, said Rod Kiewiet, a political science professor at the California Institute of Technology. 																								History suggests that approach can succeed. Governor Ronald Reagan approved a major tax hike in his first year in office, leaving the unpopular move well behind him by the time he was re-elected in 1970. Governor Pete Wilsons job-approval rating sank to 28 per cent after he raised taxes and slashed programmes during a deep recession early in his first term. Yet Wilson, now a Schwarzenegger mentor, went on to win re-election two years later in a romp. 																								Schwarzeneggers first political task is to navigate among foes in the legislature. Last month, it was largely his force of personality that prodded lawmakers into putting his budget measures on the March 2 ballot. 																								The new Republican governor began framing the budget debate on his own terms amid the pageantry of his first State of the State address to a joint session of the legislature. 																								He avoided early disclosure of any programme cuts that could lead to a public uproar; last month, angry protests led Schwarzenegger to rescind $274 million in cuts he had proposed in services for the developmentally disabled.

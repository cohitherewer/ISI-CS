 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 God amp; guidance for glossy bible
 London, April 6 (Reuters):  Is this a sign of the times or what? The British edition  of Cosmopolitan, the glossy bible of sex and shopping  for the single girl, has launched a new monthly column on  spirituality.																								Ive come to the painful realisation that men and shoes are not enough to make me happy, Hannah Borno, the magazines new spirituality editor, wrote in the March edition. The key to true contentment lies elsewhere.																								God and guidance would hardly seem to suit the Cosmo girl. British media have mocked the magazine for asking what happens now after years of breathless stories about dressing sexy, finding men and having multiple orgasms. Borno, 32, says reader feedback has convinced Cosmo that many young women long for something more than the materialist life.																								Lots of women say I have a great job, I have a great relationship, so why am I unhappy? We have been covering everything else. We already cover the mind and the body but we needed the spirit as well, she said.																								Nina Ahmad, acting editor of the British Cosmopolitan, said the magazine had a million readers in Britain and did not want them to feel alone on their spiritual journey. We want women to be the best they can, in every respect of their lives, she said.																								In the US, where higher profile of religion means Cosmopolitans main American edition has not copied the British example, the editor of a leading website on faith and spirituality was not surprised by Bornos new job. 																								There is clearly a huge number of people who are either disassociated with or disgusted with organised religion but are seeking spirituality by other means, said Steven Waldman, editor-in-chief of Beliefnet in New York.																								Institutions are no longer imposing a message on the faithful, wrote Frederic Lenoir, a French sociologist of religion. Individuals are freely taking what suits them from various traditions, he added, referring to what is sometimes derided as supermarket spirituality.																								Borno bore that out in her first spirituality section, advising readers to tap their dreams to hear their inner voice and use ancient Chinese meditation tricks to think clearly.																								An amazing 44 per cent of you think either you or someone you know is psychic, she told her readers. More than 50 per cent of you believe in the accuracy of tarot cards and palmistry and 38 per cent of you believe in mind-reading.																								As in many other European countries, this new search for spirituality has nothing to do with established religions.																								Borno has no religious training herself and does not pretend to be an expert on dispensing theological advice. First and foremost, Im a journalist, she explained, adding she would consult experts to explain complex topics in what she called Cosmo-friendly language.																								There is so much on offer out there and I will try to sift through the whole lot and extract stories we think are interesting, she said. That includes explaining meditation techniques, reviewing books or asking if traditions such as Kabbalah, an esoteric Jewish mysticism embraced by stars like Madonna and Britney Spears, would help readers lead happier lives.																								Cosmo is all about presenting readers with practical options and tricks and techniques they can use, Borno said.

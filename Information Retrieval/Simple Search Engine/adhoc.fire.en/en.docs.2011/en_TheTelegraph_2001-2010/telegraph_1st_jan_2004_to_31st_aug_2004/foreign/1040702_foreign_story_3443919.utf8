 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Kasuri optimistic
																								Jakarta, July 1 (Reuters): The new Pakistani Prime Minister wants peace with India and in the past had even written to Sonia Gandhi, foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said today.																								Kasuri said he would hold a bilateral meeting with his Indian counterpart, Natwar Singh, tomorrow on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Asean (Association of South East Asian Nations) Regional Forum that now groups 24 members with the entry of Pakistan this year. I have no doubt that Chaudhry Shujaat, the new Prime Minister, is also for peace, Kasuri said in an interview.																								Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain was sworn in yesterday as Pakistans Prime Minister, a job he is expected to relinquish in less than two months in favour of a technocrat handpicked by President Pervez Musharraf.																								I have no doubt there will be no interruption, Kasuri said of the tentative peace process with India. Musharraf was very positive about the talks, Kasuri said, adding that he looked forward to a meeting between Musharraf and the new Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, but gave no timetable.																								I would want a highest level relationship... but I would not want the leaders to meet without due preparation, he said.																								Pakistans military ruler is seen to be in direct control of foreign policy. India and Pakistan vowed to press ahead with discussions on Kashmir on Monda.																								Kasuri cited an Indian requirement for passport formalities as an obstacle since that raised the issue of sovereignty. We would welcome (the travel) if it is not on passports and visas that would imply a level of predetermination of the issue, he said.																								Kasuri said he was looking forward to another meeting with Natwar Singh. I feel very strongly there are major suspicions when you dont talk to each other, you dont know each other, he said. The two ministers are expected to hold a formal meeting in August to review progress in the peace process.

 DAMIEN MCELROY																								Casablanca, March 21: A scion of a wealthy Casablanca family who has close ties to senior al Qaida terrorist Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi has been identified as the architect of the Madrid bombings by Moroccan investigators.																								DNA samples from other family members have been transferred to Spain from Morocco to help track down a terrorist who will now be the subject of a Europe-wide manhunt.																								The man, who is 36 and married to an American, is believed to have activated terrorist cells in Spain last year after he fled across the Strait of Gibraltar following the Casablanca bombings. He has maintained his links to Moroccos Salafist Jihadia, the terrorist group blamed for the Casablanca bombings, but has established his own network of cells called Hassam, an Arabic word meaning  final solution.																								The Sunday Telegraph has learned that Hamid Langiri, the head of the Moroccan Security Directorate, believes that the suspect  who cannot be named for legal reasons  is on the run in Europe.																								He is from the upper tier of the merchant class, said Mohamed Dafir, an adviser to the directorate. Langiri has intelligence that he was in Madrid before the bombing. We also have testimony from people caught after the Casablanca bombings.																								Seven Moroccans, including Jamal Zougam, the suspected cell leader, have been arrested in Spain in the 10 days since the simultaneous bomb attacks on Madrids suburban rail network, which killed 202 people and injured almost 1,500.																								At least one of the men in detention, Mohamed Chedadi, is related to a suspected Moroccan terrorist: his brother, Said Chedadi, is an alleged al Qaida operative who was arrested in 2001, according to Nabil Benabdellah, Moroccos communications minister.																								Moroccan security chiefs believe that their quarrys first involvement in terrorism was a bomb attack by al Qaida in 1996 in al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia, in which 19 American servicemen died. The Hassam leader then helped to set up an al Qaida network in Morocco.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

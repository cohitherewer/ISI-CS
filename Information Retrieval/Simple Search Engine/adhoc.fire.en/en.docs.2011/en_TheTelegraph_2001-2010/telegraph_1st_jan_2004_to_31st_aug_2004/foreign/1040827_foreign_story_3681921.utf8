 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Opposition closes ranks on Pervez
																								Islamabad, Aug. 26 (Reuters): Pakistani Opposition parties today nominated a politician serving a life term in jail for defaming the military as a candidate in an election for a new Prime Minister.																								Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, de facto leader of a Pakistan Muslim League faction opposed to President Pervez Musharraf, has no chance of winning tomorrows vote, but his nomination showed the Opposition was closing ranks against the powerful President.																								Shaukat Aziz, the outgoing finance minister and a Musharraf ally, is set to win the vote because of the majority the ruling party enjoys in the National Assembly.																								Hashmi was jailed for 23 years in April on charges of forgery, defamation and inciting hatred against the army. 																								His nomination was endorsed by the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy (ARD). 																								The ARD opposes Musharrafs sweeping powers, including the power to dismiss the government and parliament.

 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Unveiled women root of all evil, says Saudi cleric
				 	 Saudi Arabias most prominent businesswoman Lubna al-Olayan. (AFP) London, Jan. 22: Saudi  Arabias most senior Islamic cleric has condemned women  who mingled unveiled among men at a business conference  this week, saying their actions could cause evil and catastrophe.																								Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah al-Sheikh, the grand mufti of the desert kingdom, made his comments after the countrys top businesswoman called for reform and pictures of her supporters  without headscarves  appeared on newspaper front pages.																								Allowing women to mix with men is the root of every evil and catastrophe, he said. 																								It is highly punishable. Mixing of men and women is a reason for greater decadence and adultery. This is prohibited for all. I severely condemn this matter and warn of grave consequences. 																								I am pained by such shameful behaviour in the country of the two holy mosques (Mecca and Medina). Analysts said the muftis declaration, which also condemned women who did not wear the Islamic hijab ordered by God, was a clear attempt by religious authorities to limit political reforms.																								Jeddahs annual three-day economic forum had opened with a call for change by the countrys most prominent businesswoman, Lubna al-Olayan, the chief executive of Olayan Financing Company.																								Without real change there can be no real progress. If we in Saudi Arabia want to progress we have no choice but to embrace change, she said to sustained applause at what is billed as West Asias leading think tank. Three hundred mostly unveiled businesswomen, separated by screens from 1,000 businessmen, watched her performance in awe. Inspired by her call for change, dozens stepped up to the microphone to praise her.																								Such was the impact of her unprecedented speech that her photograph and those of other women at the conference were splashed across the strictly Muslim kingdoms front pages, crediting her with striking a major blow for the liberation of Saudi women. Prince arrest																								An outspoken Saudi prince said today he was under house arrest in Riyadh after Saudi agents drugged and abducted him from Switzerland because of his criticism of corruption and calls for democracy in the kingdom.

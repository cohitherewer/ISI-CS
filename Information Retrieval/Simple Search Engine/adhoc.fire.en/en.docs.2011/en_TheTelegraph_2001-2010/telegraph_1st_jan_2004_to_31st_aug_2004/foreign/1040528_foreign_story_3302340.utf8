 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Political ploy in Qaida threat scare
																								Washington, May 27 (Reuters): A vague new US warning that al Qaida may be planning a massive attack smacks of political back-covering and campaigning, not just a call for heightened vigilance, analysts and former government officials say.																								Stung by accusations that the Bush administration ignored key intelligence in the run-up to the September 11, 2001, attacks, officials may now be issuing warnings to prove to Americans they are on the ball this time, say terrorism analysts on both sides of the political fence.																								Apparently there were warnings over 9/11 and nothing came out to the public before that, and theyve paid a dear price for that, said Jonathan Schanzer, a terrorism analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.																								They need to alert the public that there could be something coming down the pike, in which case, dont say we didnt tell you, he said. One former national security official in the Bush administration said: This is more butt-covering than anything else.																								Critics say the new threat warnings may also just be a ploy to shore up the Presidents job approval ratings or divert attention from the increasingly unpopular Iraq campaign.																								But some analysts say the announcement yesterday that the US had credible but unspecified information on possible terror attacks in the next few months would lead to tighter security and could act as a deterrent to militants.																								US attorney general John Ashcroft said several upcoming events  which include two major American holidays, a Group of Eight summit, political party conventions, and US elections in November  could be attractive targets for al Qaida.																								It is certainly an appropriate cry for all of us to remain vigilant, said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism analyst at the RAND think tank.																								Asked whether he worried about sceptics who say youre just protecting your behind, Ashcroft told a news conference: I just dont think my job is to worry about what sceptics say. My job is to do everything I can to protect the American people and to help the American people protect themselves.																								But beyond urging citizens to be on their guard, officials failed to suggest what Americans should do to help mitigate the threat. They said the government had no plans to raise the terror threat level or announce new precautions, and gave no details on when, where or how it might occur.																								 New York and Los Angeles, two of the biggest US cities, said they had not been briefed on any new threats.																								Most people feel that just a generalised be concerned about things is not that useful, said Randall Yim, head of the homeland security division at the governments General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.																								Some critical voices say the government may also be hoping the warnings could score political points on national security that could boost President George W. Bushs flagging popularity ahead of the November elections.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Sharif kin flies in and flown out
				 	 Shahbaz Sharif																								Lahore, May 11 (Reuters): Pakistan deported the brother of deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today little more than an hour after he landed in the country from more than three years exile, putting him on a plane to Saudi Arabia.																								Shahbaz Sharif flew into Lahore aboard a scheduled flight from Abu Dhabi this evening in a dramatic challenge to President Pervez Musharraf, the general who overthrew Nawaz in a bloodless coup in 1999.																								Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said Shahbaz left Lahore aboard an unscheduled Pakistan International Airways flight to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where members of the Sharif family have been living in exile.																								Senior Lahore police official Tariq Saleem Dogar said police served Shahbaz with an arrest warrant before moving him to the other plane. He was in Pakistan for less than 90 minutes.																								A journalist accompanying Shahbaz said he kissed the ground as soon as he stepped off the first aircraft.																								The chairman of the pro-Sharif Pakistan Muslim League faction Raja Zafar-ul-Haq said the governments decision was a highly condemnable act and very unfortunate.																								The information minister said the government was sticking to a pact with the Sharif family that took it into 10 years exile in 2000. Nawaz was flown from jail into exile in Saudi Arabia under a deal whose conditions have never been revealed. Shahbaz, also in custody, says he was forced to leave the country.																								Ahmed told the private ARY One channel that Shahbaz had signed the agreement. I will quit politics if there are no signatures of Shahbaz Sharif on the agreement, he said. Analysts said Shahbazs return would have constituted the biggest Opposition challenge to Musharraf since he overthrew Nawaz Sharif, but deporting him would nip the problem in the bud.																								However, political commentator Shafqat Mahmood said Shahbaz had shown courage to attempt the return, despite the threat of arrest, and would benefit from that.																								The stature of Shahbaz Sharif and his party has increased, but there is no immediate threat to Musharrafs government.																								Shahbaz flew to Pakistan despite the risk of arrest on charges of involvement in the extra-judicial killing of five Islamic militants while chief minister of Punjab.

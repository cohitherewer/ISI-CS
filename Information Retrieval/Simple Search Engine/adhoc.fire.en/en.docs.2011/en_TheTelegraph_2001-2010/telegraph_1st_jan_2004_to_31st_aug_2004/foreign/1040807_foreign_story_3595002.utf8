 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 US makes UK act in haste
																								London, Aug. 6 (Reuters): A Pakistani computer expert linked to US security alerts and the arrest of 12 terrorism suspects in Britain was part of an undercover sting operation before Washington revealed his name, a British newspaper said today.																								The report raised suggestions that US officials, determined to present a public justification for security alerts that caused widespread disruption in New York and other cities, may have jeopardised the British police swoop.																								British police sources acknowledged that they were forced to mount the raids in which they arrested the 12 more hastily than planned, but denied a report that five suspects had escaped.																								US officials revealed the name of Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan in anonymous briefings with journalists to justify the orange alert that led to some of the most disruptive anti-terrorism tactics since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Khans name appeared in the New York Times on Monday. The next day Britain launched its raids, arresting 12 suspects across the country.																								The sweep bore clear signs of haste. Britain normally conducts anti-terror raids in the early morning when suspects are at home. On Tuesday police swooped in broad daylight, dragging some suspects out of shops and catching others in a high-speed car chase. A British anti-terrorism police source would not comment on what had prompted the hurry, but said: It would be a fair assessment to say there was an urgency. The Times newspaper in London said Khan was forced to cooperate with Pakistani authorities in an undercover sting operation in the weeks after his arrest last month. 																								His arrest was kept secret and he was made to remain in touch with his contacts. During his detention he regularly communicated through e-mail with the al Qaida operatives in Britain and other countries. That helped us to identify them, a senior Pakistani government official said. 																								The report did not make clear whether Khan was still working under cover at the time that the Americans revealed his name. But the haste of the subsequent British crackdown raised suspicions that Britain was forced to act because Khans name had been made public.

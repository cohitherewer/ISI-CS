 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Philippines blast kills 10
																								Manila, Jan. 4 (Reuters): A homemade bomb killed at least 10 people and wounded 46 at a gymnasium on the restive southern Philippines island of Mindanao today, police said, with blame quickly falling on a local political squabble.																								The target of the attack during a basketball game may have been Vivencio Bataga, the Christian mayor of the largely Muslim town of Parang, who had survived several attempts on his life, military spokesperson Julieto Ando said.																								Filipinos are due to vote in national, regional and local elections on May 10. Campaigns in one of Asias most turbulent democracies are often marred by violence, intimidation, vote-buying and cheating. 																								It felt like an earthquake, one resident told local radio.																								The bomb, hidden on a motorcycle outside the gymnasium, went off at about 0800 GMT just after 3,000 basketball fans had listened to a speech by the mayor, police and witnesses said. 																								People were crying. People were shouting and others were running, said one player who was wounded in the leg. Thats all I remember because I lost consciousness.																								A radio station in nearby Cotabato City put the death toll at more than 10. The mayor was among the wounded, police said.

 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Donors deliver democracy and rights sting
 PRANAY SHARMA 				 	 Gyanendra: In a fix																								Kathmandu, May 6: In the first official and public criticism of the king, Nepals donors have expressed concern over the lack of democracy in the country. They called on the government to take urgent steps to have the democratic process restored and peacefully end the armed conflict with the Maoist rebels. 																								At the end of a two-day meeting of the Nepal Development Forum (NDF), donors said restoration of the democratic process at both national and local levels, political stability and peace, respect for, protection and promotion of human rights, and partnership among stakeholders was essential to effectively use the resources for development in the country. 																								Representatives from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and 20 countries, mostly European, are part of the NDF, which channels $560 million annually into Nepal. 																								India, one of Nepals biggest donors, is not part of the NDF but its ambassador, Shyam Saran, and other embassy officials attended the meet as observers. 																								The criticism is a major departure from the past practices of the NDF, which had till now limited its discussions to technical issues. 																								Political observers believe it is a strong signal to the king, and not so much to the Surya Bahadur Thapa government, known to have been propped up by the palace. 																								To drive home the point about restoration of democracy, the donors held separate meetings with leaders of the parliamentary parties, who have formed a five-party alliance demanding reinstatement of the parliament. 																								The observers believe the criticism will definitely be a cause for worry for the king, but it is not clear whether it will prompt him to take urgent remedial steps. 																								The kings response to all crises in the past has been ad hoc. In all probability, he may again take some cosmetic steps to defuse the crisis but they may be far from bringing any fundamental change in the situation in Nepal, a senior diplomat from a neighbouring country said. 																								There are indications that the monarch will meet Nepali Congress chief G.P. Koirala this week. But the question is whether he is willing to give up much of the power he has taken away from the elected representatives.																								King Gyanendra is battling to gain legitimacy both within and outside the country and also to establish his authority in the running of Nepal, which has seen one political crisis after another in the recent past. 																								To do so, the king needs the donors support. The Indians and the Americans have been asking Gyanendra to resolve his differences with the democratic parties and put up a united fight against the Maoists. But so far, he has failed to patch up with the parties. The Royal Nepal Army, too, has not made any major dent against the Maoists. 																								Because of the political crisis, development work, particularly in the rural areas, has been ignored. The Opposition has also charged that development funds are being diverted by the king to buy military hardware and expand his army. 																								Giving development another chance is not a black cheque for more of the same chaotic governance, Praful Patel, vice-president of the World Banks South Asia Region said at the meeting, expressing perhaps a view shared by most donors.

 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Sharon beckons, France fumes
 Ariel Sharon: Fresh ruckus Paris, July 19 (Reuters): French politicians and Jewish leaders denounced today a call by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for French Jews to emigrate immediately to Israel to escape what he called the wildest anti-Semitism.																								Sharon made his remarks in a speech to visiting Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, despite acknowledging efforts to fight anti-Semitism led by President Jacques Chirac. His comments have soured the atmosphere as France tries to build ties with Israel. The foreign ministry branded the comments unacceptable and said today it was still awaiting an explanation, while an Israeli government spokesman sought to play down the row.																								The French government has adopted a very tough line over these (anti-Semitic) incidents, but they continue to happen, Avi Pazner told LCI television in French. Thats all (Sharon) said and theres nothing particular about what he said, except that it has been reported in a totally unacceptable way, he added.																								However, parliamentary speaker Jean-Louis Debre, a member of Chiracs governing UMP party, told Europe 1 radio Sharons comments were unacceptable and irresponsible. These are matters which distort reality ... and I think they are an expression of hostility towards our country, he said. Sharon often calls on all the worlds Jews to migrate to Israel. He acknowledged the French government was making efforts to stem anti-Semitism but added that the threat was so grave that French Jews should head for Israel without delay. France is home to western Europes biggest Jewish and Muslim communities and has been troubled by attacks on Jewish people and property in recent years.

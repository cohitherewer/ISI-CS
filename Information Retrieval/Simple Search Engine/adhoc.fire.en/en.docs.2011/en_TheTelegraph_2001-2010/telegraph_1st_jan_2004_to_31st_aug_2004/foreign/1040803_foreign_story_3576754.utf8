 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Paraguay seeks answers to fire
				 	 A policeman tries to revive a 4-month-old baby who was found on the supermarket floor in Asuncion, Paraguay. (AFP)																								Asuncion (Paraguay), August 2 (Reuters): Paraguay today mourned the deaths of nearly 300 people in a fire in a busy supermarket and struggled to find answers to the impoverished nations worst tragedy in decades.																								Investigators will be probing reports that yesterday shoppers were trapped inside after the supermarket locked its doors to stop people from looting. There are several witnesses who saw how they shut the doors to the supermarket and we also confirmed that the emergency exit was soldered, Paraguays police chief Humberto Nunez said.																								Three owners of the Ycua Bolanos supermarket and three security guards are in police custody, but denied that the doors had been locked.																								The fire swept through the busy supermarket on the outskirts of the capital Asuncion at mid-day yesterday when it was packed with shoppers. Officials said the blaze was caused by a gas explosion near the food court. Flames engulfed a parking lot underneath and several charred corpses were found in their burnt cars.																								Up to now we have a total of 276 dead, 131 have been identified and handed over to their families and 145 are pending identification, Nunez said. Workers were still searching for bodies inside and many of the injured were in critical condition.

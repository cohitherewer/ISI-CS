 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Israel unveils proposal to expand Golan settlements
																								Jerusalem, Dec. 31 (Reuters): Israel disclosed plans today to expand Jewish settlement in the Golan Heights captured from Syria in a 1967 war, infuriating Damascus just weeks after Syria proposed reopening peace talks.																								Agriculture minister Yisrael Katz, running the right-wing Israeli cabinets settlement committee, said the plan aimed to underline that the Golan is an integral part of Israel before any negotiations for its handover demanded by Syria.																								A senior official close to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon denied that the plan was a political message to rebuff Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or prejudge dialogue on the Golan, insisting agricultural and tourist development was the goal.																								But Damascus saw a manoeuvre to make Israels control over the strategic plateau irreversible.																								Israel is deluded that it can achieve something by relying on power and occupation, deputy foreign minister Isa Daweesh said. Conflicts... should be resolved under international law.																								Israels main daily Yedioth Ahronoth said the $62 million plan would double the Golans 18,000-settler population within three years. But an agriculture Ministry spokesman said only 900 families would be settled  a roughly one-third increase.																								Whatever the numbers, Israels opposition left bemoaned the plan as another ill-timed blow to flagging regional peace efforts, saying it would encourage Syria to keep supporting Palestinian militants fighting Israel.																								An explosion in downtown Tel Aviv today was initially reported to be a bombing. But police, on high alert for possible attacks to mark the New Year, announced a false alarm moments later, with Israel radio citing a tyre blow-out.

 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Bush, Kerry brace for the last 100 days
				 	 George Bush (top) and John Kerry: Tasty times																								London, July 17: The note pinned to the door of the communications director of George W. Bushs re-election campaign reads: Its the hypocrisy, stupid.																								The slogan is meant as a jolt to the couple of hundred Republican eager-beavers in the partys war room as they toil away in an office block in suburban Virginia.																								Not that they need much prompting. As they hunch over computer screens and follow a bank of televisions broadcasting speeches and campaign events from around the country, they are ruthlessly focused on finding and highlighting inconsistencies from Bushs Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry  or the flipflopper as he is known in Republican advertisements.																								But the note is also aimed at a wider audience. For any American with the slightest interest in politics it has a deliberate and aggressive echo of intent.																								In 1992 Bill Clintons campaign guru, James Carville, coined the most successful electoral admonition of the past two decades: Its the economy, stupid.																								 He also inaugurated an aggressive style of campaigning that has become the prototype for both parties in this years campaign.																								With little more than 100 days to go before the vote, and the White House clearly up for grabs, the two war rooms are stepping up the ferocity of their offensives.																								Attack and counter-attack. The now notorious Clinton war room is the model, said Prof Anthony Corrado, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, and one of Americas leading political commentators. 																								No criticism can be left unanswered. No talk-show, no newspaper account can be left unchallenged.																								The idea is you should never cede a news moment. Campaigns have gone from planning the attack of the day to planning the attack of the morning and what you will attack tonight. And it can only get worse.																								Traditionally, the Republicans have been far more successful  even brutal  in their campaigns. But this time both sides are blazing away, fuelled by the record sums of money they have raised. 																								Kerry supporters say the big tent is the ideal forum for the right decisions. Bush fans lick their lips and ask how Kerry will make up his mind. And there are still three-and-a-half months to go.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

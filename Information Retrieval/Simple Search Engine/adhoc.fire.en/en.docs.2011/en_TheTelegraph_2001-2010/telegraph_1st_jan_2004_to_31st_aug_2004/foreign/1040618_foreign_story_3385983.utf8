The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Paul winds to milestone
				 	 Sir Paul McCartney																								Los Angeles, June 17 (Reuters): Notching a key milestone in the long and winding road of his career, former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney is expected to play his 3,000th live show when he performs later this month back in the former USSR.																								The upcoming June 20 concert before some 100,000 fans in the Palace Square of St. Petersburg, McCartneys first ever in that city, comes in the midst of his summer tour through Europe, organisers said in a statement yesterday.																								The exact number of live shows McCartney played in the early years of the Beatles and their precursor band the Quarry Men, was not perfectly kept, but a new tally by his management indicates he is now in the vicinity of 3,000 performances.																								The Beatles gigs alone  ranging from Shea Stadium and live radio and TV performances to the multiple sets the Fab Four played nightly in Hamburg, Germany, during the early 1960s  numbers approximately 2,523, his management said.																								With the addition of 140 live appearances with Wings, plus 325 other post-Beatles gigs as either a solo artist or at such events as Live Aid or the Super Bowl, his official count prior to the start of his Live Experience tour in Europe on May 25 stood at about 2,988.																								As closely as can be ascertained, his 3,000th show will fall on the night of his St Petersburg performance.																								I never keep count on the statistics, so I was amazed when people told me Ill do my 3,000th gig on this tour, McCartney said in a statement. Thats an awful lot of late nights.																								The current European tour will also take McCartney, who has played in 25 countries around the world, to Lisbon for his first concert ever in Portugal, he said.																								Another new venue for McCartney will be Britains outdoor Glastonbury Festival, a three-day extravaganza that begins June 25 and is billed as one of the largest outdoor music festivals in the world.

My wife would talk on the phone for hours with her sisters and girlfriends to discuss recipes, clothes and the latest fashion and I used to pay the monthly bill without complaint, the man identified as Abu Sami told Petra news agency today.																																	But things got out of hand when Abu Samis wife began using the family landline phone to dial international numbers to participate in games run by Arab satellite channels, the man complained. The phone bills represented three-fold my salary, he said, adding that this prompted the first divorce.																																	Under pressure from family and friends, Abu Sami and his wife got back together but only briefly. His wife returned to her favourite hobby, prompting him to repudiate her a second time but again they were pressed to re-marry. Abu sami filed recently for his third, and final divorce.

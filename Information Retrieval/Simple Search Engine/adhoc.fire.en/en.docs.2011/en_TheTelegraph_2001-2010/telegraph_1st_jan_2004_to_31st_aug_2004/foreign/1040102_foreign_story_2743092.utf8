The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Pope calls for new world order
				 	 Pope John Paul 																								Vatican City, Jan. 1 (Reuters): The world needs a new international order to solve its conflicts and ensure peace, Pope John Paul said in his New Years Day address today.																								The ghosts of 2003  when the US invaded Iraq without UN approval  dominated the Popes first speech of 2004. 																								More than ever we need a new international order which draws on the experience and results of the UN, the 83-year-old pontiff said at a mass in St Peters Basilica.																								The land in which Jesus was born sadly continues to live in a dramatic condition. And in other parts of the world sparks of violence and conflict have not been extinguished either. But we need to persevere and not bow to the temptation of losing hope.

(AFP)																								Karachi, May 12 (Reuters): Seven people were killed and dozens wounded in large-scale violence today during byelections in Karachi, police said.																								Soldiers and paramilitary troops were deployed in an attempt to halt the violence and arson in working-class districts in the central and western parts of the city.																								But clashes mainly between armed militants belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)  a key partner in the ruling coalition  and the Opposition Islamic Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) continued unabated. The MQM has lost three members and the MMA two, Karachi police chief Tariq Jameel said. Identity of two others remains unknown, he said.																								At least 29 people belonging to the rival political parties, including Benazir Bhuttos Opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), sustained bullet wounds, police said. At least five vehicles were set ablaze, police said.																								But thank God, violence has stopped now and the situation is now under control, Jameel said.																								The violence occurred during by-elections for three National Assembly seats and one provincial assembly seat.																								The elections will not affect the complexion of the government, but they are seen as a test of popularity of the rival parties. The three National Assembly seats fell vacant as the MQM asked its lawmakers to resign on corruption charges.

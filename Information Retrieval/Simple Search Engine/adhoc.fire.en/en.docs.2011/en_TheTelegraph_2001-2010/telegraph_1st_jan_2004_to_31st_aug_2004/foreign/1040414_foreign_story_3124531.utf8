 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Militants kill four policemen near Riyadh
																								Riyadh, April 13 (Reuters): Suspected Muslim militants killed four Saudi policemen today at checkpoints along a road north of Riyadh shortly after security forces defused two car bombs in the capital, a security source said.																								Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, is battling a wave of Islamist violence linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network after suicide bombings killed 50 people last year. The incidents came as the US embassy urged Americans in the kingdom to be alert as Washington continued to receive indications of possible terror attacks in the Gulf state.																								The Saudi source said the militants had killed the policemen while driving north towards Qassim, the heartland of Saudi Arabias austere Wahhabi Muslim creed, and they were being chased by more security forces.																								Earlier, police agents acting on a tip-off managed to defuse two car bombs also in northern Riyadh, he said. The terrorists had packed a huge quantity of explosives in the cars and they would have caused major damage but, by the grace of God, they were defused, he said.																								These militants were heavily armed and while fleeing, they killed two policemen at a checkpoint along the Qassim road. They killed another two at a second checkpoint, he added.

 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 EU to lift booze bars
				 	 A man tastes wine in Bordeaux, France, during a wine-tasting session. (AFP)																								Brussels, April 2 (Reuters): As much booze as you want at the lowest possible price.																								Thats the promise dangled before EU citizens today, as the blocs executive proposed scrapping all limits on how much alcohol they can transport across borders, while allowing them to pay the lowest tax rate they can find.																								EU citizens can already buy as much wine or beer as they like in another member state and bring it home with them  provided it is for personal use.																								But the executive commission has set indicative limits  10 litres of spirits, 90 litres of wine and 110 litres of beer  to decide what counts as personal use, and some countries are observing these guidelines too zealously. 																								So in order to get rid of this problem we are proposing to delete these indicative levels, commission spokesman Jonathan Todd told a briefing.																								It gets even better for thirsty consumers facing high taxes at home. The commission also wants to allow EU citizens to pay excise duty at the rate in the country where they buy their alcohol, rather than in the country they take it to.																								So for example youre on holiday, you visit a Chateau in France, you take a liking to the wine and you order a consignment to be delivered to your home member state, Todd went on. Currently that wine is subject to excise duty in the country where you live.																								Not any more  under the proposal, consumers will be able to buy wine in, for example, Spain, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy, Greece and Portugal, all of which have no excise duty on wine at all, and take it home with nothing more to pay. 																								The only proviso is that buyers must arrange transport themselves.

 SEAN RAYMENT				 	 Colonel Tim Collins 																								London, Jan. 11: Colonel Tim Collins, who won worldwide renown for his rousing speech on the eve of the Iraq war, has quit the British army.																								Col Collins, who commanded the 1st Battalion the Royal Irish Regiment during the conflict, is reported to have resigned and will leave in August because he has become disillusioned with the army.																								Although he has made no official statement, his wife, Caroline, was quoted yesterday as saying: Tim is worried that the army is being crippled by political correctness, petty bureaucracy and the refusal of politicians who send soldiers to war to give them enough money to do their job. Tim is no longer convinced that the army reflects the country with the fourth largest economy in the world. He fears it has become a cottage industry.																								She said an important factor in her husbands decision was the armys failure to support him when he was wrongly accused of mistreating Iraqi prisoners. Collins returned home from Iraq to face a military investigation after an American officer accused him of mistreating Iraqi civilians and prisoners of war. 																								Collins strenuously denied the claims that he had abused captured Iraqis, and he was later cleared by the ministry of defence after a full inquiry.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

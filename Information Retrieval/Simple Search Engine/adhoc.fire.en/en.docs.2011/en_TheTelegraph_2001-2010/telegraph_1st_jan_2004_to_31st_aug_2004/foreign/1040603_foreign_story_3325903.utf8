 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Mystery shrouds fate of suspect with MIT past
				 	 Aafia Siddiqui																								Boston, June 2 (Reuters): A woman who the US government suspects is an al Qaida operative was not involved with the group and may be dead, detained in Pakistan or kidnapped by her former husband, a lawyer for her family said yesterday.																								The FBI is looking for Aafia Siddiqui, 32, a Pakistani behavioural scientist who studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brandeis University outside Boston, the law enforcement agency said last week. Her family does not believe she is involved in any nefarious or sinister act connected to al Qaida or any other sadistic terrorist group, attorney Elaine Whitfield Sharp said.																								Sharp said Siddiquis family denied misperceptions in the media that she might have worked on a neurobiological or neurological weapons development programme.																								At Brandeis, Siddiqui studied how the brain used visual cues and memory to learn new tasks. The goal of the research was to help children with learning disabilities, said Sharp.																								FBI chief Robert Mueller described Siddiqui as an al Qaida operative and facilitator and said she was one of seven sought in connection with possible terrorist threats in the US.																								The family did not know where Siddiqui was or if she was indeed still alive, and said it was possible that her ex-husband Muhammad Amjad Khan, a former Boston doctor now back in Pakistan, had kidnapped her and the couples three children, said the lawyer. 																								Siddiquis former co-workers and family members told Sharp that Khan abused her when the couple lived in Boston. 																								He divorced her in the summer of 2002, and the two fought over whether their three young children would be reared in the US or Pakistan.																								Siddiqui vanished with them in March of last year and has since not been heard of or seen by the family.																								Her mother, Ismet Siddiqui, was the last to see her as she and her children got in a cab in Karachi. 																								She had planned to take the children to Islamabad to visit an uncle and get away from her ex-husband, Sharp said.																								She was concerned because Khans family is very powerful, Sharp said. They have a compound with a wall around it. Is she there alive, is she dead and buried behind those walls? We dont know. Is she in Pakistani or US custody? We dont know.																								There were no family members at the press conference. Siddiqui has a brother in Houston but her mother lives in Karachi. The father is dead.

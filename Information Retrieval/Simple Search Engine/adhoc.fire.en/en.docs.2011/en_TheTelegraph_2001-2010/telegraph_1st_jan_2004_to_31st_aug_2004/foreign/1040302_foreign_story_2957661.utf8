 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Nato force to expand operations
 IMTIAZ GULKabul, March 1: The chief of the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, Lieutenant General Rick Hillier, said they would possibly expand its operations in the country and work with warlords and influential Afghans to bring stability in the region.																								We have to bring the warlords and other influential Afghans together to promote a sustainable political process and I dont think we can put in place a more secure environment by indulging in a direct confrontation with them, he said in an interview. 																								On the tenure of the force in Afghanistan, Hillier said: We are here for a long term but for how many years that I dont know. 																								Currently, there are 6000 Nato-led ISAF troops in Afghanistan  about 5,500 in Kabul and the remaining in Afghanistans northern Kunduz region.																								As the political process gains momentum with the successful holding of the Loya Jirga and the general elections planned for June this year, I am hopeful that stability will return to this country, he said. 																								He said the security situation has improved despite the activities of some people who are keen to destroy it.																								Hillier, however, did not specify those trying to disrupt the process. He said: We are working with the Afghan government to neutralise and prevent them from disrupting the stability and security of the country.																								Hillier also spoke of challenges in the process of reconstruction and said it was the ISAFs job to create a secure environment. This would enable the international community to invest in the reconstruction, he said.																								We believe Afghans have the will and determination to build this country as quickly as possible, he said, adding that political stability, beginning from Kabul, could help accomplish this objective quickly.																								About Natos expansion plans, he said: First of all, Nato is walking through the expansion issue in Kunduz... and we will support the Afghan government in any area that we expand to.

 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Radical to resist Pervez bid to amend Islamic laws
																								Islamabad, May 17 (Reuters): The leader of a hardline Islamic alliance in Pakistan vowed today to resist any attempt by President Pervez Musharraf to amend Islamic laws that rights groups say discriminate against women and non-Muslims.																								One of the most controversial provisions of the so-called Hudood Ordinance states that a woman must have four pious male Muslim witnesses to prove a rape, or face adultery charges. Those convicted of adultery face stoning to death or 100 lashes.																								Musharraf told a human rights convention on Saturday that the laws passed under the military dictatorship of late General Zia-ul-Haq in 1979 should be studied afresh.																								Fazal-ur-Rehman, secretary-general of the Opposition Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal Islamic alliance, charged that Musharrafs statement on the Hudood Ordinances and laws relating to blasphemy were the result of American and western pressure.																								We will not allow the American agenda to be imposed on 140 million Muslims, he told a news conference. Islamic Laws will be protected with full force and in this connection everything will be done to resist the ideology of secularism.																								Secular political parties, civil rights and womens groups say rape and other violent crimes against women have soared since the passage of Hudood laws. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan says the incidence of rape could be higher than the one every two hours reported in the local media. 																								But successive governments have failed to change the laws because of stiff opposition from Islamist groups. Musharraf said the countrys blasphemy law should also be reviewed. It prescribes the death penalty for insulting Prophet Mohammad, but rights groups say it is often used to settle personal scores.																								While most convictions are thrown out on appeal to higher courts, several Christians and Muslims accused of blasphemy have been killed by Muslim fanatics inside prisons.Congo disease																								Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever has killed four people and infected at least six more in Pakistan, health officials said today.																								Tariq Khoso, medical superintendent at Fatima Jinnah Chest Hospital in Quetta, said six patients suffering from the fever had been admitted and placed in an isolation ward.

 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Hands-on Tonys handshake
																								London, March 25 (Reuters): Whats in a handshake?																								When British Prime Minister Tony Blair shook Muammar Gaddafis hand today he welcomed the Libyan leader back into the international fold with a symbolic gesture more telling than words.																								The handshake at Gaddafis tent in Tripoli illustrated  literally  Blairs hands-on approach to global diplomacy and was also a defiant gesture to British critics who condemned the visit altogether. Blair himself used the metaphor. In reaching out the hand of partnership today, we do not forget the past, he said after his talks with Gaddafi. But we do try in the light of the genuine changes happening to move beyond it.																								Christopher Hill, professor of International relations at the London School of Economics, said the gesture was crucial.																								A handshake is usually a demonstration of mutual regard and this suggests you are willing to admit them into the community of nations, which Blair has expressed willingness to do with Libya, he said. I think Blair wants to deal with all problems on a very personal and individual level and has great confidence in his personal powers to be able to heal divisions, he added.																								The handshake was the culmination of a lengthy process of detente with Libya and a reward to Gaddafi.

 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Hong Kong in Beijing political bear hug
																								Beijing, March 26 (Reuters): Angered by growing demands in Hong Kong for more democracy, Beijing acted today to assert its authority over a city in theory allowed to govern itself by saying it would review how its leader and legislature are chosen.																								Beijings move is an open step to stamp its control over the politics of the freewheeling former British colony and is likely to marginalise the mainly elected government, breaking a promise of a high degree of autonomy when Hong Kong was handed back in 1997.																								Top officials of the National Peoples Congress (NPC), Chinas parliament, would next week deliberate on two articles of the Basic Law, Hong Kongs mini-constitution, Chinas official Xinhua news agency said.																								In interpreting relevant clauses of the annexes of the Basic Law, the NPC Standing Committee aims to put an end to confusions and differences, Xinhua said in a commentary.																								Chinas overt entry into Hong Kong politics came shortly before it warned Taiwan that it would not sit idly by if protests against last weeks disputed re-election of President Chen Shui-bian spin out of control.																								The relevant clauses to be interpreted refer to amending the method for selecting Hong Kongs chief executive after 2007, and to the method for forming its legislative council and how that body votes on bills.																								Beijings announcement triggered howls of protest from right groups and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.																								They rape the law in the name of upholding it. This is no rule of law, not even rule by law... it is a mockery of the promise of a high degree of autonomy, said Law Yuk-kai of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.																								Chinas move  after weeks of angry rhetoric directed at the territory  to re-interpret the mini-constitution comes amid growing calls for universal suffrage in Hong Kong in the wake of protests by half a million people last year.																								Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa, appointed by Beijing, swiftly called a news conference to emphasise that Chinas parliament was empowered to alter the Basic Law.																								It will offer an authoritative decision on the issue and this will allay any doubts about the issue and will provide a solid foundation by which to take the constitutional development forward, Tung told the hastily arranged news conference.																								Democracy activists have demanded a firm timetable for the democratic election of the territorys top leadership, including the chief executive post now held by the unpopular Tung.																								Opinion polls show most people in the capitalist territory of nearly seven million people want universal suffrage but doubt Beijing will allow it.																								Hong Kong was supposed to conduct widespread discussions here first, but it seems Beijing cant even tolerate that, said political commentator Andy Ho.																								This will certainly damage the one country, two systems principle, said Ho, referring to the agreement that promised Hong Kong wide autonomy after it returned to Chinese rule.

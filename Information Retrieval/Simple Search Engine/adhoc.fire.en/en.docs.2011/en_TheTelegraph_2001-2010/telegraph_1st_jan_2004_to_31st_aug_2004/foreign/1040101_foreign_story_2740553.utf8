(AFP)																								Bam, Dec. 31 (Reuters): The Stars and Stripes received a rare welcome in Iran today as US medics joined efforts to help survivors of an earthquake that killed at least 30,000 people.																								Medics and the Iranian army said at least five more people, including an 80-year-old woman, had been pulled alive from the rubble in the last two days in the worst-hit ancient Silk Road city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran. 																								But officials have said the death toll from one of the worst disasters of recent decades may climb to 50,000 and most rescue teams have abandoned the search for more survivors.																								UN officials said about 40,000 people were now left in Bam  most spending the bitterly cold nights in tents  out of an original population of 103,000. The remainder were either dead, missing, in hospital or had left town.																								The 80-strong US team of medics and relief experts arrived in Iran on Sunday and reached Bam last evening.																								For Americans to come here and help us in such a situation, I really appreciate it and all Iranians appreciate it, said Shia cleric Sheikh Ahmad Faiz, as US relief workers erected a tent bearing a large US flag.																								The US government broke ties with Tehran shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution and the American flag is routinely burned during official anti-US demonstrations.																								Marty Bahamonde, spokesperson for US disaster relief body the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the lack of diplomatic ties had slowed things up but his team had been warmly received.																								At every stop, they have opened their hearts, he said.																								Aid trucks made regular tours through the ravaged city distributing water, blankets and food. Red Crescent workers manned makeshift pharmacy stalls on street corners.																								An unnamed senior US official yesterday said President George W. Bush had been considering opening dialogue with Iran, a country he has branded part of an axis of evil.																								At least some of the US group in Iran harboured hopes that the trip could help ease years of bilateral tension. It feels fantastic to come here and help them and try to break the ice, so to speak, said Kent Watts, a 49-year-old rescue officer with the office of foreign disaster assistance.																								Irans President Mohammad Khatami has welcomed the aid, but insists it will not alter relations between the two foes.

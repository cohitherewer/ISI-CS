 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Bush was lax on terror, finds poll
																								Washington, April 1 (Reuters): Most Americans agree with a former White House counterterrorism chief that US President George W. Bush was lax on terrorism before the September 11, 2001, attacks, a poll published today found.																								However, the poll also found that a majority of Americans still support Bushs record on security, a key issue in his re-election effort.																								The poll by the Los Angeles Times found that 52 per cent of Americans agreed with charges by the former official, Richard Clarke, that Bush failed to take the threat of terrorism seriously enough before the attacks, while 40 per cent disagreed.																								An even larger share, 57 per cent, agreed with Clarke that Bush placed a higher priority on invading Iraq than on combating terrorism.																								Clarkes charges have received immense publicity in recent weeks  in testimony before a commission investigating the September 11 attacks, in media coverage of a new book by Clarke, and in the White Houses ferocious counterattack against his credibility.																								The Los Angeles Times survey of 1,616 Americans, taken between March 27-30, also found that 56 per cent approved of Bushs handling of the war on terrorism, and 59 per cent believed he had made the country more secure  a figure little changed since November.																								Those findings are significant for an election year in which Bush, who has called himself a war President, has made his leadership of the fight against global terrorism a major campaign theme.

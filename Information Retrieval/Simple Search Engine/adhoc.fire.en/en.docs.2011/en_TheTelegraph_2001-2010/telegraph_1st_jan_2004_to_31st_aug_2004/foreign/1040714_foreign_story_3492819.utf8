The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Tigers put off talks
																								Colombo, July 13 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers will not resume peace talks with the government to end the islands 21-year civil war until a destabilising split within their ranks is resolved, officials and a pro-rebel lawmaker said today.																								Local polls at the weekend raised hopes the government could move from electioneering to restarting talks  seen as ever more important following a suicide bomb blast in the capital last week that raised fears for the ceasefire holding since February 2002.																								But the anger of the LTTE over what they call government complicity with the rival faction, led by a commander known as Karuna, has made an early return to the table unlikely.																								There is a terror campaign being unleashed on our people under the guise of Karuna. So how can you expect any self-respecting Tamil to sit and negotiate with a duplicitous government under the circumstances? Tamil lawmaker Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam said in an interview on the Tamilnet website.																								The government and Tigers have been divided over the agenda for resuming talks that stalled in April last year, with the rebels wanting them based on their proposal for interim self-rule and the government seeking parallel talks on a final settlement.

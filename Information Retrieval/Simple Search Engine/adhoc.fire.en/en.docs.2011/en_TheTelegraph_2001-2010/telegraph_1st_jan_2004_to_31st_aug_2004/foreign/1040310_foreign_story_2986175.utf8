 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Iran threat to UN agency
																								Tehran, March 9 (Reuters): Angered by tough remarks by the head of the UNs atomic watchdog, conservative Iranian politicians warned that Tehran may cease cooperation with nuclear inspectors, newspapers reported today.																								The attitude of conservative legislators, who regained control of parliament from reformists in elections last month, could jeopardise ratification of an agreement signed by Iran last year to allow intrusive snap checks of its nuclear facilities.																								International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Mohamed ElBaradei criticised Iran yesterday for failing to declare advanced nuclear research and equipment which could be used to make atomic bombs. One senior conservative legislator said Iran could follow North Koreas example by pulling out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Irans threat about opting out of the NPT is serious, Hassan Qashqavi, member of parliaments National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, was quoted as saying by the hardline Siyasat-e Rouz newspaper. He said the IAEA board of governors meeting which began in Vienna yesterday had been hijacked by US interests.																								The pressure from America is mainly political and is aimed at depriving Iran of nuclear knowledge, he said. This will lead Iran to reconsider its nuclear cooperation. Iran insists its nuclear programme is aimed at generating electricity, not making bombs as Washington alleges. Hardliners objections to cooperation with nuclear inspectors had been more muted in recent months following Irans decision last October, under intense international pressure, to agree to snap inspections, halt uranium enrichment and cooperate more closely with the IAEA.																								Iranian officials last week called for the IAEA to remove Irans nuclear programme from its agenda, arguing that Tehran had done enough to prove it had no nuclear arms ambitions.

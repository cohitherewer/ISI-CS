 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 UK rapist wins 7-m jackpot
 AMIT ROY				 	 Hoare																								London, Aug. 11: The old English saying, Lifes a bitch and then you die, must strike home this morning to the many victims of a 52-year-old rapist who has just scooped 7 million on the lottery.																								Iorrworth Hoare, who is serving a life sentence for multiple rapes  the UK long ago got rid of the death penalty  will be allowed to keep his money. He is, anyway, currently a day release prisoner, so he can improve his lifestyle immediately.																								He was on temporary release staying at a Middlesbrough South Bank bail hostel when his numbers came up in last Saturdays Lotto Extra draw. He collects a cheque for 7,039,469.																								In Britain, life does not always mean life. With good behaviour, a prisoner can be given parole if he admits the crime, shows repentance and is not considered a threat to society by the Parole Board.																								So it is quite possible that in the next 10-12 years, Hoare will be given complete freedom to enjoy his new-found wealth.																								The son of a coalminer, Hoare began a series of sex attacks while he was still in his twenties and was sentenced to a total of 18 years between 1973 and 1987. His catalogue of crimes included one rape, two attempted rapes and three indecent assaults.																								Hoare, formerly of Leeds, was jailed for life at Leeds Crown Court in 1989 for attempting to rape a 60-year-old woman in a park in the city. Known to his family as Ivor, Hoare has a brother, Rhys Owen, 56, a hospital night porter, who today expressed fury at the fickleness of fate and regret for the rape victims. The two brothers have not met for 20 years. 																								My first reaction was unprintable, said Owen. I work hard for my living. I work unsociable hours trying to make ends meet and then I hear my brother wins 7 million on the Lotto. Its absolutely unbelievable. The win would revive painful memories for the rape victims, said Owen. It must be hard for them. One of the victims was 60 and she must be in her 80s now if shes still alive.																								He added: It must be hard for her having to read all this again. What my brother did was inexcusable. But he won the lottery and good luck to him. We all do it. I do it. My wife does it. Fair play. His luck came up. On whether his brother should compensate the victims, Owen replied: Thats for him to decide.																								Nor will he ask his younger brother for a handout. Im not going begging for any money. Hopefully he will sort himself out with his money. Hopefully it will keep him on the straight and narrow.																								His brother turned up at his house in Leeds during a weekend prison leave two months ago. But Owen, who did not want to meet Hoare, slipped out through the back door. I didnt want anything to do with him and I called the authorities, said Owen. When Hoare was first convicted, Owen would take their mother to Wakefield Prison for family visits but he himself waited outside. Their mother died 16 years ago.																								Curiously, Hoare was caught after he sent his photograph to a television station in an effort to be chosen as a candidate for a quiz show called Winner Takes All.																								In Britain, an effort is made to rehabilitate prisoners  rather than punish them for life. Under home office guidelines, prisoners in open conditions  on a day release or community project  are allowed to take part in the lottery and claim prizes. 																								Before the win, Hoare was a category D prisoner at Leyhill open prison. He has now been moved to a closed prison for security and his own safety. According to fellow prisoners, Hoare looked really smug when he told them of his win and said: Im made for life now.

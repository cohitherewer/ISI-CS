 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Aziz elected new PM, defence top priority
																								Islamabad, Aug. 27 (Reuters): Pakistans National Assembly elected former finance minister Shaukat Aziz Prime Minister today, after he was hand-picked for the post by military leader President Pervez Musharraf.																								The election of Aziz, a former Citibank executive who has led the turnaround of Pakistans economy from the verge of bankruptcy over the past five years, was a formality given the pro-military parliamentary majority. Aziz will be sworn in and is expected to name a new cabinet tomorrow.																								He is expected to keep the finance portfolio and to retain key ministers, including foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, who has represented Pakistan in recent peace talks with India, a senior government official said.																								Officials and analysts said there would be no changes in Pakistans support for the US-led war on terror as Musharraf, who wields ultimate power as President, would continue to lead the fight against Islamic militancy.																								Overall, the ongoing policies of the government will continue, said political analyst Hasan Askari. In his acceptance speech, Aziz vowed to continue to deal strictly with terrorism and corruption and also to take forward the peace process with India with an open mind.																								At the same time, he said defence would be the top priority of the new government, so it would continue to develop the countrys nuclear weapons programme, which was central to that.																								Aziz secured 191 votes in the 342-seat house. Opposition groups boycotted the vote after the speaker refused to allow their candidate, Javed Hashmi, who is serving a life term in jail for defaming the military, to attend the vote.																								Opposition members shouted slogans against Musharraf and Aziz before walking out of the chamber ahead of the vote. Aziz was picked by Musharraf in June to become head of government after the resignation as Prime Minister of Zafarullah Khan Jamali. Before taking up the post, Aziz needed to win a National Assembly seat and Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, another close Musharraf ally, served as interim prime minister in the meantime.

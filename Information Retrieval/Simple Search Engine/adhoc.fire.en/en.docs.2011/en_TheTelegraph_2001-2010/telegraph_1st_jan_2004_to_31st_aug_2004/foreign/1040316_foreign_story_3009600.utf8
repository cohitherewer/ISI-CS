 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Victor Socialists to bring troops home
				 	 Prime Minister-elect Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero thanks supporters during a rally in Madrid. (AFP)																								Madrid, March 15 (Reuters): Spains incoming leader Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero indicated today he would pull Madrids troops out of the disastrous occupation of Iraq in a major swing from his predecessors pro-American foreign policy.																								The EU, concerned by growing signs that Thursdays Madrid train bombings may have been carried out by Islamist militants, called emergency counter-terrorism talks.																								Zapateros Socialists swept to office at the weekend in what some analysts said could constitute an alarming first case of Islamist militants influencing, by violence, the outcome of a major western election. 																								Zapatero himself called his triumph a first consequence of the Iraq wars unpopularity with Spaniards.																								The second will be that the Spanish troops will come back, he told a Spanish radio station. 																								Mr Blair and Mr Bush must do some reflection and self-criticism... you cant organise a war with lies, he said in remarkably frank comments for the next Prime Minister of western Europes youngest democracy and fifth largest economy. 																								US President George W. Bush called to congratulate 43-year-old Zapatero. The two leaders said they both looked forward to working together particularly on our shared commitment to fighting terrorism, a White House spokesman said.																								Zapatero, due to take office within the next month, repeated several times today his campaign pledge to pull out troops unless the UN takes charge in Iraq by mid-year  but added in his radio interview that scenario was unlikely. 																								Spain has 1,300 troops in parts of south-central Iraq. Critics of the government have argued that the Madrid bombings were the price Spain paid for backing the Iraq occupation.																								Most commentators saw Zapateros shock election victory as driven by anger over Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznars handling of the suspected al Qaida attack on Madrid commuter trains last Thursday that also wounded 1,500 people.																								After Thursdays attacks Aznars government initially blamed the armed Basque separatist group ETA, which denied involvement. Sunday would go down in history as the day when Islamic fundamentalism was seen as dictating the outcome of a European election, said Wilfried Martens, head of the European Peoples Party, an umbrella group for European conservative parties. With almost all votes counted, the Socialists had won 42.6 per cent of the vote to the PPs 37.6 per cent.																								With 164 seats in the lower house of parliament, 12 short of an absolute majority, Zapatero has said he intends to govern through dialogue with other groups. He ruled out the possibility of a coalition with regional parties.																								But the PP will remain by far the largest single force in the upper house or Senate, potentially making it difficult for a Socialist government to pass legislation.

 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Tapes show Di, Camilla had a showdown
				 	 Princess Diana																								Washington, March 11 (Reuters): Britains late Princess Diana staged a confrontation with her husbands long-time lover, Camilla Parker Bowles, saying she knew about the affair with Prince Charles, according to audio tapes aired on Thursday.																								I was terrified of her, the princess was heard to say on the tapes, which were played on NBCs Today programme. And I said: I know whats going on between you and Charles and I just want you to know that.																								The confrontation, which took place in 1989 at a party, occurred when Diana interrupted a conversation between Parker Bowles, the prince and another male guest. And I said to the two men: OK, boys, Im just going to have a quick word with Camilla and Ill be up in a minute. And they shot upstairs like chickens with no heads and I could feel upstairs all hell breaking loose: What is she going to do?																								The princess said Parker Bowles had a very interesting response. She said to me: Youve got everything you ever wanted. Youve got all the men in the world fall in love with you and youve got two beautiful children, what more do you want?																								So I said: I want my husband ... and I said to Camilla: Im sorry Im in the way ... and it must be hell for both of you. But I do know whats going on. Dont treat me like an idiot.																								The tapes obtained by NBC were secretly recorded in 1991 for a 1992 book that exposed the turmoil in the royal marriage.																								Princess Diana died in a Paris car crash in 1997.

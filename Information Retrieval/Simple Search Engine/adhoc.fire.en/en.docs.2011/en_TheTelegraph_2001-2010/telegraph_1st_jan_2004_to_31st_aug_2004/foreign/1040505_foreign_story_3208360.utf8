				 	 Janis Karpinski 																								Baghdad, May 4 (Reuters): Last August, US Brig.-Gen. Janis Karpinski gathered journalists at Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, notorious for torture under Saddam Hussein, and announced proudly that the bad old days were over.																								Nine months later, she is at the centre of a deepening abuse scandal in which six of her soldiers face criminal charges for cruelty and mistreatment at Abu Ghraib and six more have been reprimanded for misconduct.																								It is a marked turnaround for the military police commander, with the events that took place on her watch now threatening to further undermine the US-led occupation at a point when it is already deeply unpopular with frustrated Iraqis.																								Karpinski, a reservist, has left Iraq as part of a troop rotation, but she was in charge when the abuses are alleged to have taken place last November and December.																								This week, she appeared on US television to defend her actions and even pointed the finger at more senior US commanders, including Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, saying they bore responsibility for the abuse.																								Pictures of the cruelty are in contrast to the pledges Karpinski made nine months ago when the prison was first opened to the press. That day, she touted it as a model facility that would be a welcome change for Iraqis after decades of torture. 																								She said military police in her unit had spent months repainting and remodelling the jail  including providing new beds, blankets and pillows for prisoners  and were proud of their role in making the new Iraq a better place.

 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Sharon alliance faces collapse
																								Jerusalem, June 7 (Reuters): Ariel Sharons coalition faced possible collapse today when a key far-Right partner said it was considering walking out in protest against a cabinet vote approving the Israeli Prime Ministers Gaza withdrawal plan.																								But the government defeated two parliamentary no-confidence motions brought by small Opposition parties, the latest in a series in recent months. The plan was passed by 14 votes to seven yesterday but only after Sharon placated mutinous ministers in his Right-wing Likud party by agreeing not to evacuate Jewish settlements for at least nine months and then in four phases each requiring a vote.																								By bowing to future votes of his unruly government for each phase of withdrawal, Sharon effectively left in the air the fate of the 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip and four of 120 in the West Bank he said he intended to remove by the end of 2005.																								Palestinians welcome any pullout from occupied Gaza, but object to plans endorsed by US President George W. Bush for Israel to keep parts of the West Bank in return. The militant Hamas group called the cabinet decision a big trick.																								Sharon was clinging to a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament after firing two ultra-Rightist ministers to secure the cabinet vote, capping weeks of manoeuvring and brinkmanship.																								Leaders of the pro-settler National Religious Party (NRP) were split on whether to quit the coalition. Rabbis who help draft NRP policy were to announce their opinion later before a final decision by the partys parliamentary group. If the NRP left, the coalition would drop to an untenable 55 seats. This would force Sharon to court the centre-left Labour Party, which favours his plan, or into early elections, which weary Israelis do not want after three in the past five years.

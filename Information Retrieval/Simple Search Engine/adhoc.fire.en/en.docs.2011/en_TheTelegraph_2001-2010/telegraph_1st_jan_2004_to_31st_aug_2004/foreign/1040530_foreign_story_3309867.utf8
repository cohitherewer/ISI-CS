The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 Blair not to bow out, says he is up for it
				 	 Tony Blair																								London, May 29 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair sought today to dispel speculation that he could bow out before the next election, saying: I am up for it, even as a new poll suggested Britons considered him a liability.																								Blair told the Daily Mirror newspaper he would lead his ruling Labour Party into the next election, expected in 2005. Am I up for doing it? Yes I am, he was also quoted as saying.																								His statement of intent follows a week of frenzied speculation after his deputy John Prescott said Labour would win the next ballot if Blair was at the helm. Political commentators seized on his use of the word if  a word hitherto taboo among party faithful. Many point to his powerful finance minister Chancellor Gordon Brown as the obvious successor.																								Confronting those who say he must pledge to serve a full term if he stands at the next election, Blair said: The reason I try to answer that carefully is you always end up with headlines saying I am going on, and on, and on. Thats Thatcher business, he added, referring to the tenacious former Prime Minister.																								Blair said a five-year strategy would be unveiled in late June or July. A poll in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which is traditionally allied to Blairs Conservative opponents, said 41 per cent wanted Blair to resign immediately and a further 18 per cent believed he should go before the next election.																								Asked which of eight leading Labour figures would make the best Prime Minister, only 25 per cent of the over 2,000 respondents pointed to Blair, compared to 29 per cent who favoured Brown.																								Fifty one per cent thought Blair had become a liability to his party, compared to 21 per cent who thought the same of Brown.																								Speculation about an end to the Blair era after seven years has mounted as the Prime Ministers public trust and popularity ratings have plummeted in the wake of the Iraq war, which was unpopular from the outset.																								Blair said in the Daily Mirror interview he thought calm would return to Iraq sooner than people might think.

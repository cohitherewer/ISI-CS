 London, Feb. 2 (Reuters):  The MyDoom Internet worm claimed its first scalp yesterday,  paralysing the website of American software firm SCO Group  with a massive data blitz.																								In a statement issued yesterday morning, the Utah-based company confirmed MyDoom knocked its site, http://www.sco.com, out of commission.																								Internet traffic began building momentum on Saturday evening and by midnight Eastern America Time the SCO website was flooded with requests beyond its capacity, the statement read.																								While we expect this attack to continue throughout the next few weeks, we have a series of contingency plans to deal with this problem and we will begin communicating those plans today, Jeff Carlon, worldwide director of Information Technology infrastructure, the SCO Group, said in the statement.																								The speed and severity of the attack surprised security officials. It was spectacularly successful, said Mikko Hypponen, research manager at Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure.																								As intended, Sco.com was the only discernible victim yesterday. There were no other reports of outages or slowdowns elsewhere online due to the worm.																								MyDoom.A, also known as Novarg or Shimgapi, emerged last week in the form of a spam e-mail message that contained a well-disguised virus attachment.

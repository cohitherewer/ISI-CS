 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Kremlin faces cover-up charge
 JULIUS STRAUSS  Moscow, Aug. 27: The Kremlin  faced growing accusations of a cover-up yesterday as Russian  officials announced that the black boxes of two crashed  passenger jets had failed to yield evidence of a terrorist  attack.																								The two aircraft blew up and crashed within minutes of each other after take-off on Tuesday night, killing all 89 crew and passengers.																								Russias free media speculated that the security services were deliberately playing down suspicions of terrorism in an attempt to spare the Kremlin the embarrassment of admitting to serious lapses in security.																								Despite earlier statements that suggested the black boxes were in good condition, officials said yesterday that they were damaged and would require lengthy analysis that may not yield results.																								The FSB, the Russian security service, said on Wednesday  when the investigation was only a few hours old  that there was no evidence of terrorism. 																								Critics say the announcement was hasty and politically motivated.																								An explosives expert working at one of the crash sites was quoted in the liberal daily Kommersant as saying: Our guys had not even got down to work when they heard on the radio that no evidence of a terrorist act had been found.

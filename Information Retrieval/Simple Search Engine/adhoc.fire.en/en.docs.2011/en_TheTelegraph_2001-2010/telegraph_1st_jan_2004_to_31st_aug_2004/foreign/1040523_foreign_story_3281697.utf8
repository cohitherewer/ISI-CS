 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Commonwealth lifts Pak suspension
				 	 Commonwealth secretary-general Don McKinnon (right) and Nigerian foreign minister Olu Adeniji at a press conference in London. (Reuters)																								London, May 22 (Reuters): The Commonwealth readmitted Pakistan today, citing the countrys progress on democratic reforms since its suspension after a military coup five years ago.																								The decision ends the exclusion imposed after President Pervez Musharraf seized power in 1999 and seals Pakistans reintegration into the international fold.																								Pakistan, which has one of the worlds biggest Muslim populations, has already been embraced by the US as a major ally, widely seen as a reward for its support in the America-led war against terror.																								The (Commonwealth) welcomed the progress made in restoring democracy and rebuilding democratic institutions in Pakistan, secretary-general Don McKinnon said.																								(It) decided, therefore, that Pakistan should no longer remain suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth.																								But the group of 53 mostly former British colonies said after a meeting of foreign ministers and diplomats it would monitor further reforms and expected Musharraf to meet a pledge to stand down as chief of the army by the end of this year.																								If the nuclear power fails to continue along the road to democracy or if Musharraf does not stand down as army chief the Commonwealth will consider fresh action, officials said.																								Many analysts had predicted the Commonwealth would lift the suspension.																								The fact that Pakistan has been accepted by other countries and institutions would have put the Commonwealth out on a limb if it had not made this decision, said Gareth Price, South East Asia expert at the Royal Institute of International Affairs.																								Pakistan, which has a population of 149 million, had long argued it had met Commonwealth demands.																								This is our moral victory. We deserve it, said Pakistani information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.																								Pakistans high commissioner to London, Maleeha Lodhi, said Musharraf would stick to his undertaking to resign as army head.																								Lets remember he has stood by every commitment he has made, thats his track record, she said.																								Musharraf was made army chief in 1998 and ousted the elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup a year later.																								Diplomats said earlier an apparent softening of his pledge to give up his army uniform and the deportation earlier this month of Nawaz Sharifs younger brother Shahbaz Sharif had raised concerns.																								Critics accuse Musharraf of building up a personal power base by strengthening pro-military groups before quitting as army chief and point out that top Opposition leaders including former Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif have been in exile for several years.																								Farhatullah Babar, spokesman for Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party, said: The decision is not surprising as western countries, taking General Musharrafs promise to fight against terror on its face value, wanted to reward his government.																								Emeka Anyaoku, a former Commonwealth secretary-general, said it was a tragic blow to the hard earned credibility of the (Commonwealth) as a force for promoting its fundamental principle of democracy.																								Representatives from Nigeria, India, Canada, Tanzania, Lesotho, the Bahamas, Malta, Samoa and Sri Lanka made the decision in the name of the Commonwealth.																								McKinnon said the decision had no direct impact on Zimbabwe which withdrew from the Commonwealth last December after its suspension was extended.Pipeline attack																								Suspected tribesmen fired 16 rockets at a state-run natural gas facility today in southwestern Pakistan and damaged a main pipeline, disrupting gas supplies to several areas, officials said.																								The attackers also fired automatic weapons at paramilitary troops guarding the facility at Sui, 400 km east of Quetta.

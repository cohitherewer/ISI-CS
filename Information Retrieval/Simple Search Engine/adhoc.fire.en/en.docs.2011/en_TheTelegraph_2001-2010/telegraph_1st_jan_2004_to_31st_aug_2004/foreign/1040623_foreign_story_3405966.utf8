(AFP/Reuters) 																								Tehran, June 22 (Reuters): Eight British sailors seized in Iranian waters could be released soon if investigations show their incursion was not ill-intended, an Iranian official said today, potentially defusing a serious diplomatic rift.																								The sailors appeared on Iranian television in blindfolds, and footage was then released of two of the group apologising for straying onto the Iranian side of the Shatt al-Arab waterway which marks the southern stretch of Irans border with Iraq.																								Britain, whose relations with Iran have soured over its criticism of Tehrans cooperation with nuclear inspections, summoned Irans ambassador to press for the release of the men.																								Some Iranian media reports said the Britons were carrying sophisticated maps and arms and would be prosecuted, but Ali Reza Afshar, deputy head of the armed forces chief of staff, said the Royal Navy sailors could be freed shortly.																								If the result of the interrogations of those British military men shows that they didnt have any bad intention, they will be released soon, he told the ISNA students news agency. Another ISNA report said the men would be handed over to British authorities in the coming hours or tomorrow morning.																								Britain said the group was training Iraqi police and was on a routine mission delivering a boat to an Iraqi river patrol.																								The team wrongly entered Iranian waters and we apologise for this mistake because it was a big mistake, one of the sailors, identified as Sergeant Thomas Hawkins, said in comments dubbed into Arabic and shown on al Alam television. Hawkins, dressed in military fatigues, said his team of eight sailors had been one mile inside Iranian territorial waters when they were arrested by Irans Revolutionary Guards.																								Prime Minister Tony Blairs spokesman said: We want to resolve this situation as quickly as possible... We have asked for full details and access to them. A picture taken from Iranian television shows weapons seized by the Revolutionary Guards from the British naval personnel. (AFP)A Tehran-based political analyst, who declined to be named, said the contradictory reports emerging from Iran on the Britons case were probably the result of some kind of battle going on inside the Iranian regime between reformist and hardline elements.																								We probably wont see a solution until that battle is resolved.																								Ali Ansari, West Asia expert at University of Exeter, pointed out that Britain, unlike the US, has tried to engage with Irans leaders in recent years.																								I think therell be a couple of high-level contacts ... Therell be a bit of diplomatic toing-and-froing, then theyll be released ... in a matter of days, he said.																								Irans foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi has told British counterpart Jack Straw he would personally look into the matter. Britains defence ministry said the Britons had been delivering a small craft to the Iraqi Riverine Patrol Service. The boats carried only the sailors personal weapons.																								A British military source acknowledged the British boats may have strayed into Iranian waters. It was quite a confused situation. The weather was appalling and this happened in a confined stretch of water, he said.

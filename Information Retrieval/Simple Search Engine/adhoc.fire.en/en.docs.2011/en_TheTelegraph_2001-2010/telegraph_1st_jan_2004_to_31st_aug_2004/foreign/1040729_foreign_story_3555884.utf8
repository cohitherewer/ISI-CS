 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Minibus blast kills 68 in Iraq
																								Baquba (Iraq), July 28 (Reuters): A minibus packed with explosives blew up near a police station and a market north of Baghdad today, killing 68 people and wounding 30 in the worst attack since the handover of power exactly one month ago.																								The powerful suicide bomb left a sea of destruction, obliterating market stalls and destroying several buildings. It raises fears of a fresh insurgent campaign just days before Iraq holds a major political conference to plot its future.																								It was the worst death toll from a single bomb attack in Iraq since a blast outside a mosque in the holy city of Najaf last August killed more than 80 people.																								Reuters Television pictures showed at least a dozen bodies scattered across a street, some of them still on fire. 																								A severely wounded man, his clothes burnt and torn and his body covered in blood, sat amongst smouldering ruins with several dead, some of whom looked like children, lying near him.																								A health ministry official said 68 people were killed and 30 wounded in the blast shortly after 0600 GMT in Baquba, an often violent town 65 km north of Baghdad. He said the death toll could rise, with many of those injured receiving shrapnel wounds to the chest.																								Twenty-one people travelling in a minibus alongside the one that detonated were killed, an interior ministry source said. It was the deadliest day in Iraq since June 24, when more than 100 people were killed in a string of bomb blasts, suicide attacks and armed assaults across the country. The blast also came a month to the day after the interim government took back sovereignty, and three days before a major political conference to chart Iraqs future.																								There were several other incidents across the country today.																								A mortar or rocket struck a busy street in Baghdad, killing one person and wounding five, witnesses said. South of Baghdad, seven members of Iraqs security forces, backed by US and Ukrainian troops, died in a gunbattle in which 35 insurgents were killed, Polands defence ministry said. 																								No US or Ukrainian forces were wounded or killed.

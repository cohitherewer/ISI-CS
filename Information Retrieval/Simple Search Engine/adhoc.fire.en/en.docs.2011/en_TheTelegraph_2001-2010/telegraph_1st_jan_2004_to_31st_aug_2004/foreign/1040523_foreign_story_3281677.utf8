(AFP)																								Baghdad, May 22 (Reuters): A car bomb in Baghdad killed at least five people today and wounded a senior interior ministry official, five days after the head of Iraqs governing council was assassinated in a similar bombing.																								Deputy interior minister General Abdel Jabar al-Shaikli was in a stable condition in hospital, but four guards and a woman neighbour died in what may have been a suicide attack outside his home. US generals have predicted more violence as Iraqis prepare to take over running their own affairs next month.																								A group headed by al Qaida figure Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the car bomb attack in Baghdad. ...Your brothers in the Jamaat al-Tawhid and Jihad attacked the treacherous apostate the deputy interior minister General Abdel Jabar in front of his home as he was preparing to go to his office, said the statement carried on an Islamist website.																								US efforts to ensure a pro-American government after the handover on June 30 and elections next year took a fresh knock when the Pentagon admitted it was investigating more killings of Iraqis in US custody, among them a general who American officials said last year had died of natural causes.																								US soldiers at todays bomb scene said neighbours reported shooting shortly before the blast, suggesting the guards may have tried to avert a suicide attack. I felt my house shaking and I thought it was going to collapse, said Rasoul Zayzan, a policeman who lives in the same street.																								The militia of Moqtada al-Sadr will end their armed presence in Najaf and Karbala as soon as it is clear that US troops have withdrawn from the holy Iraqi cities, a top aide to Sadr said on Saturday.

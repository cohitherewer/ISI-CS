The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Lanka stares at hung House
				 	 A worker prepares election documents in Colombo. (Reuters)																								Colombo, March 31 (Reuters): Sri Lankans vote on Friday in a general election that most expect will lead to a deadlocked parliament, further dragging out efforts to end 20 years of civil war with Tamil Tiger rebels.																								There has been no major fighting for more than two years, but the widely predicted hung parliament could further put off the resumption of stalled peace talks and delay $4.5 billion in aid to rebuild the country, analysts said.																								The two major rivals in the election  President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who is not up for re-election, and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe  differ in their approach to the peace process.																								Kumaratunga dissolved parliament, forcing the snap election, after accusing the Prime Minister of giving too many concessions to the Tigers.																								An opinion poll today showed Kumaratungas United Peoples Freedom Alliance winning 101 seats in the 225-seat parliament, marginally ahead of Wickremesinghes United National Party (UNP) and its coalition partners with 99. The poll by Org-Smart Opinion Polls, which has a five per cent margin of error, implies that neither side will get a clear mandate to carry forward the peace process.																								Any possible kingmaker roles could go to a Sinhalese Buddhist party running an all-monk slate of candidates or to the Tamil National Alliance, which is backed by the Tigers.																								The Buddhists are strongly opposed to any concessions for the Tigers in peace talks, while the TNA candidates are mostly proxies for the rebels.																								The LTTE claim to represent the islands minority Tamils, and say their community has been discriminated against in jobs and education by the Sinhalese majority.																								Voting laws require all campaigning to end two days before election day, and Kumaratunga criticised Wickremesinghes economic policies at a final rally late yesterday.																								The country has been destroyed in every sector. Either they have started the destruction or completed it already, she said. There has been no fighting for two years, but the absence of war does not mean there is peace. There has to be a long-term solution, she added.																								Wickremesinghe has campaigned solely on his record of presiding over the longest period of peace since the war started in 1983 and says he needs a new mandate to translate that into a permanent peace.

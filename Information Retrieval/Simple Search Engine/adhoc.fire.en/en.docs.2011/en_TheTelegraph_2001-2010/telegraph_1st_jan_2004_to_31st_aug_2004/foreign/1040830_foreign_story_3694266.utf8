 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 French Muslims plead for release
		 Georges Malbrunot (Reuters)  in Iraq. (AFP) Paris, Aug. 29 (Reuters): Frances government and leaders of its Muslim minority urged Iraqi militants today to free two French journalists they were holding hostage in a bid to force Paris to revoke its ban on Muslim headscarves in schools.																								The appeal came as Paris held a series of emergency meetings to consult cabinet ministers and parliamentarians about the demand by the Islamic Army in Iraq holding journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot.																								The militant group, which the Arabic television station al Jazeera last Thursday reported had killed Italian journalist Enzo Baldoni, has given Paris 48 hours to rescind the ban due to apply from the start of state schools on Thursday.																								We want everyone to know that secularism in our country does not divide the French but unites them, interior minister Dominique de Villepin said, flanked by Muslim leaders. French people of all origins and all religions are united in support of our compatriots Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, he said. Together, we ask for their release.																								French Muslim leaders reacted nervously to the news and denied there was any link between the two issues.																								The French Muslim community is absolutely innocent, said Dalil Boubakeur, head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith. I beg that there not be any confusion between the French Muslim community and this odious blackmail. 																								Lhaj Thami Breze, head of the Union of French Islamic Organisations (UOIF) which has urged schoolgirls to defy the ban, said the headscarf issue was strictly a French affair. We cannot accept any outside interference, he said.																								France passed the law banning conspicuous signs of faith in state schools last March in reaction to the growing influence of Islamist activists among its five million Muslims and mounting tensions between Muslim and Jewish youths in schools. 																								Criticised abroad as a violation of religious freedom, it won a boost in June when the European Court of Human Rights ruled in a case from Turkey that banning headscarves did not abuse human rights and was valid to fight fundamentalism. 																								Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin met interior minister Villepin, foreign minister Michel Barnier and culture minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres early today for a first review of the situation.																								He was due to meet President Jacques Chirac later today for a working meeting on the situation of the two French journalists, presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said. Raffarin was also due to meet education minister Francois Fillon and defence minister Michele Alliot-Marie as well as the speakers of the National Assembly and the Senate.																								Chesnot worked for Radio France International (RFI) and Malbrunot for the dailies Le Figaro and Ouest France. They disappeared en route from Baghdad to Najaf on August 20, the day after Baldoni was taken hostage.																								RFI vice president Alain Menargues sought a ray of hope in the fact the militants communique did not threaten to kill the two journalists.																								When you read the text in Arabic, its very clear  we give France 48 hours to respond to this communique, he told France 2 television. We dont consider this an ultimatum. Were hanging on to this hope.																								The Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders appealed to Iraqs Shia leader Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Sunni religious leaders to help free the journalists.

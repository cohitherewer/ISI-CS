 CAROLINE DAVIES				 	 The portrait of Prince Philip by Pearson Wright. (AP)																								London, April 30: It is entitled Homo sapiens, Lepidum sativum and Calliphora vomitoria, which roughly translates as a portrait of the Duke of Edinburgh as the artist sees him.																								And it is certainly an arresting work, albeit one Prince Philip has made clear he would never hang on his wall. Before it was completed, in fact, the prince had made his feelings plain to the award-winning portrait painter Stuart Pearson Wright. Gadzooks! he exclaimed on seeing the work in progress. Why have you given me a great schonk?																								So there can be little doubt about his reaction to the finished portrait, unveiled at a London gallery yesterday, showing him bare-chested, with a bluebottle on one shoulder and seedlings growing out of his index finger.																								In fact this portrait was rejected last year by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA), the very body that had commissioned the work to mark the 50th anniversary of Prince Philip as its president.																								As Pearson Wright had only four one-hour sittings with the prince, the portrait was completed with the help of photographs and an elderly gentleman in his mid-eighties, from Bethnal Green who provided the hirsute chest. The bluebottle (Calliphora vomitoria), explained Pearson Wright, is a memento mori, a reminder of mortality, a tradition in portrait painting. In other words, no matter how privileged or powerful the subject, we all die. Its not about Prince Philips mortality, but humanitys mortality, he said.																								And the plants (Lepidum sativum)? They are four mustard cress seeds with plants growing from them. They represent the four heirs to the throne Prince Philip provided. It references his role as the seed bearer for the royal family, which is essentially his function.																								Pearson Wright has a fair idea of the princes feelings. When I asked him if he thought the face resembled his, he replied: I bloody well hope not.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

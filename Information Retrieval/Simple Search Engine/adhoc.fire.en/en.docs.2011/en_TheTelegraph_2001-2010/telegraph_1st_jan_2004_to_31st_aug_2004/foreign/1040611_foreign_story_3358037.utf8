 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 11 Chinese workers killed near Kunduz
																								Kabul, June 10 (Reuters): Gunmen in Afghanistan killed 11 Chinese road workers after bursting into their compound early today, in one of the worst attacks on foreigners in Afghanistan since the Talibans overthrow in 2001.																								The raid occurred 35 km south of the northern city of Kunduz, until now deemed a secure area as Islamic insurgents concentrate their attacks in Afghanistans south and east.																								The provincial governor blamed the raid on militants bent on destabilising the government of President Hamid Karzai by attacking foreign and Afghan troops as well as aid and reconstruction workers ahead of landmark elections in September.																								The Taliban, the main guerrilla group opposed to Karzais government, denied responsibility. We were not behind this, we have not done this, said rebel spokesman Hamid Agha.																								The raid was another blow for Karzai, who is visiting the US and faces growing instability that is undermining vital assistance missions and reconstruction in the war-shattered country of 28 million people.																								For sure this was a politically motivated act, said Kunduz governor Mohammad Omar.																								It was carried out by the enemies of Afghanistan, he added, using the euphemism for remnants of the ousted Taliban or their allies in al Qaida and forces loyal to renegade warlord and former Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. China condemned the killings as a brutal terrorist act but said it had no plan to pull its workers out of the country.																								The Chinese side will not yield to any form of terrorism, foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said.																								China backed the US-led war on terror after the September 11 attacks but has expressed misgivings over the war in Iraq. Militant attacks on Chinese overseas have been rare.																								But a car bomb exploded at one of Pakistans biggest construction projects in May, killing three Chinese technicians and wounding 11 people in what Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf called a barbaric act of terrorism.																								Liu said Chinese vice-foreign minister Dai Bingguo had spoken to his Afghan counterparts by telephone and asked them to guarantee the safety of Chinese personnel still in the country.																								The ministry had also summoned the Afghan ambassador and called for an investigation into the attack and for the assailants to be brought to justice, he said. Hundreds of Chinese construction workers are working in Afghanistan, including more than 120 in Kunduz employed on a road paving project for a Chinese company that is being funded by the World Bank.																								The Chinese ambassador to Afghanistan, Sun Yuxi, said before boarding a plane for Kunduz that there were 20 unidentified attackers.

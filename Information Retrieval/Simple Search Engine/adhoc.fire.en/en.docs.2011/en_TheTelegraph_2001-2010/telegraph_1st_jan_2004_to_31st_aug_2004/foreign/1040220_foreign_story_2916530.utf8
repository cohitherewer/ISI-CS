 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 US coach threat to raped player
																								Denver, Feb. 19 (Reuters): The head football coach at the University of Colorado has been placed on paid leave about two hours after a police report said he warned a woman that he would back one of his players 100 percent if she reported being raped to the police, officials announced.																								Head coach Gary Barnett was placed on on administrative leave late yesterday pending an investigation by an independent panel into the coachs comments as well as a growing controversy about the school using alcohol and sex parties to recruit star athletes. We were utterly distressed over the information contained in that (police) report, university president Elizabeth Hoffman said at a hastily called news conference in downtown Denver. 																								Barnett was also in trouble for calling the only woman who ever suited up for the schools football team a terrible player on Tuesday, the same day a published report said the woman had been raped by a teammate. We believe that in the context of a rape allegation it is inappropriate to make statements about the ability of the player, Hoffman said. The university has been embroiled in controversy over charges that star athletes were recruited with the lure of alcohol and sex parties. The school has been sued by three women who said they were raped at or shortly after an off-campus recruiting party in 2001.																								On Tuesday, former player Katie Hnida, the only woman to ever play on the schools football team, told Sports Illustrated magazine that she had been subjected to lewd comments by other players, groped in team huddles and raped by a teammate. University officials said they were upset about the magazine report.																								Barnett tried to explain why Hnida had been harassed, said she was an awful player who was not respected by team members. You know what guys do; they respect your ability. Katie was a girl, and not only was she a girl, she was terrible. She couldnt kick the ball through the uprights, he said																								Soon after Hoffman and university chancellor Richard Byyny finished speaking with reporters, Barnett came out of the athletic department at the universitys Boulder campus to make his own statement. I sincerely regret that yesterday a portion of my remarks were misinterpreted or aired out of context and I apologise for answering in that manner, he said.																								He also said he believed there were some inaccuracies in the police report where he said he would back his player if the woman pressed charges.

Exhausted but jubilant relatives of the three cried out in joy in Tokyo as they saw their loved ones on television. Its true, its true, they yelled, hugging and crying tears of joy. Its wonderful, said another, shown on NHK. When I saw them alive on TV, I felt really happy, said Ayako Inoue, Nahokos sister. I feel truely grateful from the bottom of my heart for many people who took action to save their lives. Takashi Imai, Noriakis father, broke down in tears and hugged his other son, Yosuke.																								Japan has been on tenterhooks since last Thursday when an armed group took the three civilians hostage.

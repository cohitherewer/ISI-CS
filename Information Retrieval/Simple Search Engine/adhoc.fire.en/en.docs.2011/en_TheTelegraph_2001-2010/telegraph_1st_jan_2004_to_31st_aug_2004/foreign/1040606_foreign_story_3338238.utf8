 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Ex-husband challenges Berry deal
																								Los Angeles, June 5 (Reuters): The estranged husband of actress Halle Berry, R amp;B singer Eric Benet, is challenging their pre-nuptial agreement in court as he seeks spousal support from his Oscar-winning wife.																								Benet filed papers this week in Los Angeles Superior Court asking a judge to determine the validity and/or enforceability of the parties pre-nuptial agreement and subsequent amendments thereto, according to documents posted on the website thesmokinggun.com.																								The documents show Benet is asking Berry to pay his legal bills and spousal support but does not know the nature and extent of their joint assets and debts.																								Berry, 37, who won the Academy Award as best actress for her sexually charged performance in Monsters Ball, filed for divorce from Benet, 33, her second husband, in April of this year, six months after the couple separated.																								The divorce petition cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split. In a recent appearance on Oprah Winfreys TV show, Berry said Benet had been unfaithful to her and was being treated for sexual addiction. The two married in January 2001 and have no children. 																								Berrys previous marriage to Cleveland Indians outfielder David Justice ended in divorce in 1996.																								Berry, last in theaters starring in the psychological thrillerGothika, will next be seen in the title role of Catwoman, due for release in July.

 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 New planet blip on Nasa radar
London, March 15: Nasa scientists believe they have discovered a new planet in the solar system, after sightings by the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes.																								The body  named Sedna after the Inuit goddess of the ocean  has been found orbiting the sun in a region of space known as the Kuiper Belt, which is 6.2 billion miles from Earth. The object is believed to be about 1,250 miles across, but astronomers have said it may even be larger than the furthest known planet, Pluto, which is 1,406 miles across and was discovered in 1930.																								The discovery of the most distant object ever detected orbiting the sun was made by Michael Brown, associate professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena, Nasa said. 																								Whether the new find can actually be called a planet is likely to be debated for months or even years to come.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

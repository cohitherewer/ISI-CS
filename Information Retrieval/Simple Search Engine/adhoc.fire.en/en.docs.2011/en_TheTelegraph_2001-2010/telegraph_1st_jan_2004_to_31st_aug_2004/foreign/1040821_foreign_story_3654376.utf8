The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Bird flu outbreak feared
				 	 Chickens in a cage waiting to be sold at a market in Kuala Lumpur. (AFP)																								Beijing/Kuala Lumpur, Aug. 20 (Reuters): The discovery of a deadly bird flu strain in Malaysia after cases elsewhere in southeast Asia signalled a major winter outbreak was likely, international health experts said today.																								Since a strain deadly to humans emerged in Asia early this year, scientists have voiced fears the flu could mutate, become able to jump to humans, and spread.																								Adding to concern was an announcement by a Chinese scientist today that pigs in China had been found infected with bird flu, but the WHO said that did not come as a complete surprise.																								A strain of bird flu blamed for 27 deaths in Asia this year has been found in Malaysia this week and hundreds of birds have been gassed this week and their carcasses burned to contain the outbreak. The latest deaths from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza were of three people in Vietnam earlier this month.																								This is a great concern. It says to me that the virus is endemic in the region, virologist Dr Robert Webster of St Jude Childrens Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, told a Beijing symposium.																								China had found pigs infected for the first time with bird flu in 2002 and 2003, Chen Hualan, a member of the China Academy of Agriculture, told an conference on avian flu and Sars. This is a somewhat dangerous signal for public health, she said.																								WHO representative Henk Bekedam said: We know that pigs can carry human virus as well as bird flu virus.																								We need a lot more information before we can make comments on that... We also know that the virus so far has been very ineffective in being easily transmitted to humans, let alone between humans.																								The fear is that human and bird flu virus could mix in pigs and form a strain more easily transmittable to humans. 																								A teenager from the village at the centre of the Malaysian outbreak had been taken to hospital with cold symptoms but officials said there was no indication from initial tests that she had contracted the bird flu virus.																								Malaysias poultry industry faces huge losses as export markets close and livestock prices fall. 																								And restaurants specialising in chicken dishes in Kuala Lumpur had noticeably fewer customers today. Usually we are jam-packed on Friday and Saturday because the food is good, said a waiter at Mediterranean grilled chicken outlet Nandos.

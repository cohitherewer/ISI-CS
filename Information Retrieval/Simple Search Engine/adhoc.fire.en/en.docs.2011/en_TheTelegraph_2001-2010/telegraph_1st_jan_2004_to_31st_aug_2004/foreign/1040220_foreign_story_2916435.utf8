 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 UK mulls fat tax on junk food
London, Feb. 19: A Downing Street-based policy unit has proposed a plan to place a fat tax on junk food in an attempt to tackle the rising incidence of heart disease.																								According to The Times of London, the Prime Ministers Strategy Unit raised the prospect of extra duty or VAT (value added tax) being imposed on some of the nations favourite foods after heart disease overtook cancer as Britains biggest killer, and more young people started developing diabetes.																								No 10 stressed that no proposals for taxing unhealthy foods have been put to Tony Blair. The Strategy Unit document  Personal Responsibility and Changing Behaviour  suggested a range of public policy initiatives for combating obesity, including a national drive to encourage participation in sport, and placing warnings on food packaging.																								But it went on to say: There might even be potential to consider fiscal measures  a fatty food tax  applied to food not people  or different VAT treatment for foods with poor nutritional standards.																								This would be a signal to producers as well as consumers and serve more broadly as a signal to society that nutritional content in food is important.																								A No 10 spokesman said: It is no secret that the government is looking at the problem of obesity. 																								But no proposals of this kind have been put to the Prime Minister.																								Earlier this month, a British doctors groups urged the government to take swift action over the terrifying health consequences of the nations obesity problem.Favourite chocolate																								Sales of Kit Kat, Britains most popular chocolate bar, have plummeted so far that the manufacturer is contemplating lemon cheesecake, liquorice and even curry flavoured versions.

Sales of Kit Kat Chunky have plummeted 18 per cent to 50.5 million.																								Chris White, Nestl Rowntrees new managing director, said he was looking to launch a new range of flavours to haul sales out of their nosedive, adding that the company was a business in crisis.

 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Clash of alien identities
																								Washington, March 9 (Reuters): A Harvard professor has sparked a heated debate with a book arguing that the massive influx of Mexican immigrants to the US threatens traditional American identity and national unity.																								Samuel Huntingtons book, Who We Are: Challenges to American National Identity, is not due to be published until May. But an excerpt in Foreign Policy magazine has already prompted exchanges that have reverberated far beyond academic circles.																								The crux of Huntingtons argument is that large scale immigration to the US from Latin American countries, and especially Mexico, coupled with the high fertility rate of these newcomers compared to native Black and White Americans, constitute the single most immediate and serious challenge to Americas traditional Anglo Protestant culture.																								Other sociologists have launched a withering attack on his thesis, questioning both his data and his motives.																								Huntington won wide attention for his 1993 book, The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, which predicted that globalisation would lead to conflict between western values and the Islamic world.																								In his new book Huntington writes: The extent and nature of this immigration differs fundamentally from those of previous immigration, and the assimilation successes of the past are unlikely to be duplicated with the contemporary flood of immigrants.																								This reality poses a fundamental question: Will the US remain a country with a single national language and a core Anglo Protestant culture? 																								By ignoring this question, Americans acquiesce to their eventual transformation into two people with two cultures (Anglo and Hispanic) and two languages (English and Spanish).																								More than 11 million immigrants arrived in the US in the 1990s and the Census Bureau estimates the inflow since then at around 1.4 million a year.

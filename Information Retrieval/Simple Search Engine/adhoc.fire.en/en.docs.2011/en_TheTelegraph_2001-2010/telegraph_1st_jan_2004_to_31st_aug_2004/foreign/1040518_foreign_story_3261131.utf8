 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 US jobs moving faster overseas, reveals study
																								New York, May 17 (Reuters): The movement overseas of US white-collar jobs over the next few years is accelerating faster than previously expected, Forrester Research said today, fuelling a highly charged election-year issue.																								Technology market researcher Forrester said in a report titled Near-Term Growth of Offshoring Accelerating that it expects the number of US business service and software jobs moving offshore to reach 588,000 in 2004 from 315,000 in 2003.																								The loss of US software programming, customer call-centre and even legal paperwork positions should rise to 830,000 jobs by 2005, up 40 per cent over this year, the report said.																								In the short term, (the trend) is definitely growing, Forrester business services analyst Stephanie Moore said in a conference call.																								The revised prediction reflects heightened awareness among corporate customers of potential lower costs associated with sending work offshore. It comes 18 months after Forrester helped spark an outcry in the US over outsourcing when it predicted that some 3.3 million jobs could be shifted to countries such as India by 2015.																								The rush of jobs overseas, coming amid debate over a jobless US economic recovery, has provoked a political backlash that has made it a prominent issue in the US presidential campaign.																								The political backlash has increased the awareness of offshoring... and increased the awareness of the savings from offshoring among our (corporate) clients, Moore said.																								Despite the outcry, government economists say the impact on overall US employment remains minimal.																								Forrester is careful to say that its statistics focus on specific types of jobs that lend themselves to being transferred overseas and does not suggest some wholesale export of jobs.																								The 830,000 jobs expected to move outside the US in 2005 amounts to fewer than 1.6 per cent of jobs in specific categories viewed by Forrester as most likely to be affected. The emotional 1 million mark will be crossed in 2006, report author John McCarthy said in the conference call. But critics say the threat to US jobs is exaggerated.																								Cathy Minehan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, has downplayed the effect, saying offshore services accounted for one-tenth of 1 per cent of US gross domestic product in 2002.																								Clearly, this is not immaterial, but it simply isnt large enough to have had a major impact on US employment levels in the aggregate, despite the rhetoric that suggests otherwise, she said during a speech in March.																								Forrester said it saw little change in its long-term outlook, forecasting that 3.4 million jobs will move overseas not just to India but to China, Russia, the Philippines and Mexico by 2015, up from the 3.3 million it had predicted.																								Forrester says the jobs at risk of moving offshore are concentrated in customer service call-center operations and low-level computer programming and Web design work. But it also includes some biotech, architectural and legal research jobs.

London, April 26 (Reuters): British scientists have developed living bandages, made from a patients own cells, which speed healing for burns and diabetes sufferers.																								The biological bandages, which will be launched at the British Burns Association meeting tomorrow, have been used successfully on patients with severe burns and diabetics with chronic wounds. 																								It is a convenient way of using the patients own cells to heal wounds, Prof. Sheila MacNeil, of the University of Sheffield, said. This is a simple dressing to take laboratory-expanded cells and deliver them back to patients wounds.																								MacNeil, who developed the bandages called Myskin with her Sheffield colleague Professor Robert Short, said the bandages can be placed on wounds five to seven days after a sample of cells has been taken from the patient and grown on specialised discs in the laboratory.																								After the bandage has been applied to the wound, the discs release the cells and prompt new layers of skin to grow in the damaged areas. The bandage is removed after the cells have migrated to the wound.																								Doctors have been using patients own cells to heal wounds for years. Myskin, which was developed after 10 years of research, takes the technique further because the cells are grown on the bandage surface and it is put directly on to the patients wound. It makes it simpler all round, said MacNeil. You can get a much faster healing than you would have done without them.																								Myskin has been successfully used on a young boy suffering burns to his legs and chest from a bonfire accident, a 28-year-old with similar injuries and an 80-year-old man who had been badly burned on his face and body. There are around 1,000 severe burn injuries in Britain each year.																								The biological bandages have also helped to heal chronic wounds from persistent ulcers in diabetes patients. In Britain alone, three million people suffer from chronic wounds and 5,000 foot or toe amputations are performed on diabetics because of ulcerous wounds.

 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Kerry sends Bush to bed
 							 - President slams rival record				 	 George W. Bush tosses an American football pigskin in Berea, Ohio. (AFP)																								Springfield (Montana), July 31 (Reuters): President George W. Bush sought to grab the political spotlight back from John Kerry today by casting his Democratic rival as a senator of few achievements and offering a bare-bones preview of his own second-term agenda.																								Brushing aside Kerrys acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention as nothing new, the White House said Bush went to sleep rather than stay up to watch it on television on Thursday night.																								Bush, who spent the Democratic convention at his secluded Crawford, Texas ranch, derided his rivals record and warned voters against wavering in Iraq and on the war on terrorism.																								Were not turning back, Bush told cheering supporters on a rain-soaked ballpark in Springfield, Missouri, as he returned to the campaign trail.																								Bush said Kerry had little to show for nearly 20 years in the US Senate, including eight years on the Intelligence Committee. During that time, Bush said, Kerry cut the intelligence budget and had no record of reforming the intelligence services.																								Kerry has made intelligence reform a cornerstone of his campaign and has called for quick adoption of the recommendations of the September 11 commission. 																								Aides said Bush was expected to act on some of the recommendations by executive order next week.																								In his acceptance speech on Thursday, Kerry also criticised Bush over the invasion of Iraq, saying it was based on faulty intelligence, and promised that he would ask the hard questions and demand hard evidence.																								Bush defended his actions and said: If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift towards tragedy. This will not happen on my watch.																								He told a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that members of the US Congress from both political parties, including my opponent, looked at the intelligence and they saw a threat.																								And he insisted: America and the world are safer.

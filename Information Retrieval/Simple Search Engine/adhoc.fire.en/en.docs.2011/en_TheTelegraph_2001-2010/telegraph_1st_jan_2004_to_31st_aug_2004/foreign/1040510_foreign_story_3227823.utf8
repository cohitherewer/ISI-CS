The site is peppered with rarely-seen pictures of Khamenei as a young boy and wearing a number round his neck for a mug-shot taken by security forces of the US-backed Shah, deposed in 1979.																																	One anecdote relates how he has banned his pilot from speaking to Iranian air-traffic control-towers in English.

																								Baghdad, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Budding British travel operator Don Lucey has a novel idea for a holiday  visit Iraq.																								Undeterred by kidnappings of foreigners, a raging insurgency and general lawlessness that probably makes Iraq the most dangerous place in the world, Lucey is planning a genteel tour for around 10 people at the end of September. He is even bringing his 16-year-old daughter along.																								Im adamant this trip will go ahead. It seems a forbidden place to visit, people are interested in that, said Lucey, a former soldier and policeman who worked in Iraq in 2003 and set up Bann Tours in Swindon, western England, the same year.																								It has a lot to offer, a lot of history. Its not just all war and people killing each other. Obviously terrorists scare a lot of people, but people like myself want to prove that they are not in control, he said in a telephone interview.																								Iraq was never popular for tourists under Saddam Hussein, but it did draw people to sites of ancient civilisations such as Babylon and Ur, the Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, and its beautiful lakes, mountains and deserts.																								Since US-led forces ousted Saddam in April 2003, about the only tourists have been pilgrims from neighbouring Iran.																								Television images of the insurgency are grim, from foreigners held hostage pleading for their lives to charred bodies strewn about in the wake of suicide car bomb attacks.																								Lucey said tourism in Iraq had to start somewhere, and that he and his clients were determined to be the catalyst. The 10-day trip, which will take in some ancient sites, costs 1,200 ($2,192) per person, not including insurance.																								Another man who has high hopes for the industry is Ahmed al-Jobori, head of the state-run Iraqi Tourism Board. Jobori has a 10-year plan to develop tourism and make it a pillar in an economy that has few natural resources besides oil. He hopes Iraq can draw two to three million tourists a year by then. But for now, even he warns tourists to stay away.																								We dont want good people from all over the world to come and be captured by criminals. I think they must wait, he said. One element of his tourism plan includes a multi-million dollar project on Al Aras island on the Tigris in the south of Baghdad. The project envisages five-star hotels and a Disney-type theme park.

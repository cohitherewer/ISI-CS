 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 Pervez: Terror war to continue
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, March 27: President Pervez Musharraf today said Pakistan would continue to act strongly against terrorists in South Waziristan and they would not be allowed to damage the country.																								Speaking at a ceremony at the countrys premier cadet college in Hassan Abdal, 40 km from Islamabad, Musharraf said: We will not allow them (the terrorists) to cause harm to Pakistans interests by using its soil for operations against any other country.																								The Wana operation has nothing to do with Islam nor is it something concerning Muslims or non-Muslims. It is simply a war against terrorism, which will continue, he said. Musharraf added that the al Qaida network has been involved in terrorism all over Pakistan and it has masterminded two attempts on his life in December last year in Rawalpindi.																								Musharrafs remarks came after reports of an agreement between a delegation of tribal elders and pro-al Qaida Yargulkhel tribe on the release of 12 soldiers and two local officials captured during the military operation. Yargulkhels have agreed to release 15 officials and 12 paramilitary troops will be released by tomorrow afternoon while the two officials will be relseaed by Monday, Mir Nawab, a local tribesman said. The elders had travelled to a remote mountainous region for talks this morning after an unsuccessful round of talks yesterday. Earlier, the Yargulkehl tribe refused any assistance in securing the freedom of at least 12 troops until Pakistans military ends its siege of suspected terrorist hideouts.

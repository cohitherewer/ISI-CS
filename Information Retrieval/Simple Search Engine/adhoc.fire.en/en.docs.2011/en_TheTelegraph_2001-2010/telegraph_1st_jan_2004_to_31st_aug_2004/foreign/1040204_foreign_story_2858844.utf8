 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Hindsight sows doubts in Powell 
																								Washington, Feb. 3 (Reuters): US secretary of state Colin Powell told The Washington Post that he does not know whether he would have recommended an invasion of Iraq had he known that Saddam Hussein had no stockpiles of banned weapons.																								In an interview published today, Powell told the paper: The absence of a stockpile changes the political calculus; it changes the answer you get.																								But Powell conceded that the administrations conviction that Saddam already had banned weapons had made the case for war more urgent, the newspaper reported.																								Asked if he would have recommended an invasion knowing Iraq had no prohibited weapons, Powell replied: I dont know, because it was the stockpile that presented the final little piece that made it more of a real and present danger and threat to the region and to the world.																								Powell defended the Bush administrations decision to go to war, saying that history will ultimately judge that it was the right thing to do, the newspaper said. The Post said that during the lengthy interview, Powell suggested that former chief weapons inspector David Kays testimony last week before a Senate panel was more supportive of the administration than has been portrayed in news accounts.																								Kay told the panel that we were almost all wrong in believing Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But he also came to other conclusions that deal, I think, with intent and capability which resulted in a threat the president felt he had to respond to, Powell told The Post.

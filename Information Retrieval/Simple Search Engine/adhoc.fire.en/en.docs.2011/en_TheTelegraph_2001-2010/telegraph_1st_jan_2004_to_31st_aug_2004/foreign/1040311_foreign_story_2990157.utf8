 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Revealed: Israel plan to raid Pak
																								Jerusalem, March 10 (PTI): Israel considered attacking nuclear installations in Pakistan in 1979 after the US aired concerns over Islamabads efforts to acquire nuclear weapons to attain parity with India, according to a media report here.																								The possibility of an Israeli attack on Pakistani nuclear installations came up during Jimmy Carters term as US President, the Haaretz daily reported, quoting newly declassified US state department documents.																								The documents also make it clear that the US government did not hold special discussions to address Israels preventive strike plans, it said. The documents were recently released by the National Security Archive, an independent non-governmental research institute based in Washington that specialises in disclosing unclassified documents under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act.																								The Israeli plan is said to have come up in a meeting held on September 14, 1979, by a disarmament consultation committee, a panel created in the 1960s by the executive branch, but no longer exists. The participants in the meeting related to urgent nuclear matters, the report said.																								The Carter administration is said to have been particularly worried about reports indicating that Pakistan was making efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and attain parity with India.																								During the meeting, committee deputy director Charles Van Doren voiced concerns that China was helping Pakistan attain nuclear capability, the report said. Chinas policy, Doren argued, reeked of double standards as it claimed not to be helping its neighbour on the one hand, while urging the US to help Pakistan cope with the Soviet threat, given Indias close ties with the USSR.																								William Burr, senior analyst at the National Security Archive, told the Haretz daily a large portion of the documents, including ones that alludes to the possibility of an Israeli attack on Pakistan, underwent heavy censorship before they were declassified.																								This makes it impossible to attain additional details about the episode and to measure the seriousness of Israels plan to attack the Pakistani arms facilities, leaving the targets of the proposed attack as well as the way the operation was planned unclear, he said. Anti-Taliban mission																								Pakistan is failing to cooperate with the US in its battle to crush the Taliban despite Washingtons restraint over Islamabads nuclear proliferation scandal, US deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz said.

 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Russia bleeds in Chechen charge
				 	 Investigators look at bodies on a street in Nazran, Russia, after the clashes. (AFP)																								Nazran (Russia), June 22 (Reuters): Suspected Chechen rebels rampaged through a southern Russian region in attacks early today that killed 48 people and raised new doubts about Moscows ability to stamp out Chechnyas separatist violence.																								In a brazen operation, the rebels seized the interior ministry building in Ingushetia region and held it for several hours, raided police arms depots and reduced police headquarters and a building housing border guards to gutted wrecks.																								The large-scale offensive was the biggest armed operation by rebels in Ingushetia since war between separatists and Moscow erupted in neighbouring Chechnya a decade ago.																								The coordinated strikes, concentrated in the regional capital Nazran, led to fierce overnight battles involving grenade-launchers and automatic weapons as security forces fought to dislodge the rebels from the ministry building.																								Coming just six weeks after the assassination of Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov, the daring operation dealt a further blow to President Vladimir Putins assertion that the tide had turned in Moscows favour in its nine-year battle with the separatists.																								There was no immediate word from the Kremlin. Itar-Tass news agency said Ingushi President Murat Zyazikov kept Putin informed on the situation by telephone.																								Tass quoted police as saying a small army of up to 200 guerrilla fighters staged the operation that began with rebels tricking their way into checkpoints on one of the main highways.																								Using false documents that identified them as members of anti-crime and special service squads, they commandeered the checkpoints and then gunned down police who turned out to answer the alarm, police said, quoted by Tass.																								Forty-eight people  18 policemen, five regional justice officials and 25 civilians  were killed, Yakhya Khadziyev, a spokesman for the regional interior ministry, was quoted as saying by Tass. He said the dead included the acting regional interior minister Abukar Kostoyev, who had been in the building when it was captured. 																								Another 60 people were injured. Two rebel fighters had been killed.																								Footage shown by ORT Channel One television showed bodies of combatants and civilians lying in the streets today, many of them charred and mutilated from the intense fighting.																								Witnesses said they had seen the bodies of many police officers in the ministry building which the rebels held for several hours before pulling out in the early hours. 																								A police officer who gave his name only as Timur said: In our section alone, 30 people were killed and wounded.

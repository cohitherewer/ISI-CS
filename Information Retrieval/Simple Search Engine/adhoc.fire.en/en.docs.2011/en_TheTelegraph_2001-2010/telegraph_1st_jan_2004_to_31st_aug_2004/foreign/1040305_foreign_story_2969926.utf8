 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Tigers admit crisis in ranks
																								Colombo, March 4 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers admitted today there was a crisis in their organisation, which could threaten efforts to put the islands peace process back on track, but said they would resolve the problem.																								It was the first time the LTTE had admitted to an internal dispute, and comes as the rebels have harshly criticised political splits in the government for delaying efforts to restart stalled peace talks.																								The crisis is only a temporary one and a resolution will be reached very soon, political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan said on an official LTTE website.																								He did not say what the crisis was, which comes during a campaign for parliamentary elections on April 2. But Sri Lankan media is reporting that the rebels eastern commander, Karuna, would lead his own faction after a rift with the groups reclusive chief, Velupillai Prabhakaran.																								The reports said Karuna would abide by a two-year ceasefire with government forces, but any split in the group would inevitably complicate peace efforts even more. The Tigers are known for tight internal discipline and allies of top leaders have in the past been assassinated for straying from the party line.																								The LTTE peace secretariat website said rebel leaders from the east, but not Karuna, are in the process of discussions with Prabhakaran to resolve the crisis. Thamilselvan also met Trond Furuhovde, the head of the international force overseeing the truce, today.																								Furuhovde said the meeting was positive and constructive.																								Government spokesman G.L. Peiris earlier declined to comment on the rift, but said: We have no reason to believe the continuity of the ceasefire is in doubt. Efforts to restart talks to end the 20-year war were cast into doubt in November when President Chandrika Kumaratunga sacked three government ministers after accusing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of offering the rebels too many concessions.

 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Pak reply to India deal: all-city missile
 IMTIAZ GUL AND REUTERSIslamabad, March 9: Pakistan today test-fired a new nuclear-capable ballistic missile with a range of up to 2,500 km that covers all cities in India.																								The two-stage Shaheen-II Missile System, which has been developed indigenously by Pakistani scientists and engineers, can carry all types of warheads up to 2,000 km, the Pakistan military said in a statement.																								Nuclear and missile scientist Samar Mubarak Mand, chief of the National Development Complex, said the full range of the missile (in Reuters picture above) was 2,500 km, though it was tested only to 2,000 km, the edge of Pakistans sea limits.																								Its total range is 2,500 km. We have fired it to the end of our sea limits, which is about 2,000 km, Mand said on private Geo television. He is one of the architects of Pakistans atomic bomb.																								Japan expressed concern that Pakistan had conducted the test despite efforts by the international community to curb proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles. The Japanese government hopes that the test will not bring about a negative effect on positive developments between Pakistan and India towards improving their relations, said a statement from the Japanese embassy in Islamabad.																								Mand said Shaheen II was 17.5 metres long with a 1.4 metre diameter; the solid-fuel rocket has a 1,000 kg payload. The military said Pakistan had informed neighbouring countries and shipping companies operating in the Indian Ocean of the test as a confidence-building measure. The test came after Israel last week concluded a deal to sell India a strategic airborne radar system despite warming ties between Islamabad and Delhi.																								Pakistan says the new missile exceeds the 1,500-km reach of the Ghauri, previously its longest-range missile, which some experts say was developed with North Korean help. The countrys medium-range missile programme began in April 1998, when it successfully test-fired the Ghauri-1.																								Western and Japanese defence analysts believe the Ghauri is a replica of the North Korean Nodong and the Shaheen series is thought to have been based on Chinese M-11 rockets.																								But Pakistan insists that both systems have been indigenously developed. Todays test was Pakistans second test-fire in the last five months; it test-fired Shaheen-1 in October 2003 for the maximum flight range of 750 km.

 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 China, America in rights clash
				 	 Chinese assistant foreign minister Shen Guofang. (AFP)																								Beijing, March 23 (Reuters): China suspended its dialogue on human rights with the US on today, saying it was not afraid to take on Washington over its proposal to the UN to condemn Beijings record.																								The US urged a UN watchdog yesterday to condemn Chinas backsliding on human rights, despite Beijings warning the move could affect warming Sino-US ties.																								The Chinese side cannot but immediately halt bilateral human rights dialogue and exchanges, assistant foreign minister Shen Guofang told US ambassador Clark Randt.																								The US should bear all consequences that might arise from this, a Chinese foreign ministry statement said. It was not the first time China has suspended dialogue with the US on the issue and analysts said it was unlikely to inflict much damage on overall relations. 																								Foreign ministry spokesperson Kong Quan said China was shocked by the US move but would not shy away from confrontation.																								If the US is bent on stirring up confrontation in such an arena, the Chinese side is not afraid, Kong told a news conference, referring to the annual session of the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Commission.																								We will keep the US company to the end, Kong said. Justice will eventually defeat confrontation. Dialogue will eventually defeat confrontation.																								Washington has said China made some improvements in 2002 but that last year its rights record deteriorated with such abuses as extrajudicial killings, torture and the repression of religious and political groups opposed to the government.																								The US decision came just weeks after China released democracy activist Wang Youcai and a Tibetan nun from prison and cut the jail term of ethnic Uighur businesswoman Rebiya Kadeer  all cases the US has brought up in the rights dialogue.																								Rights groups see such moves as a step in the right direction, though largely symbolic, and continue to protest against Chinas record.																								Washington decided against such a censure last year and China told the US to think three times about introducing a critical resolution this year.																								Shen said Washington went back on its word to suddenly announce the resolution amid consultations between the two.																								The US insistence on provoking confrontation has seriously damaged the foundation of our two countries human rights dialogue and exchange, Shen was quoted as saying.																								Shen accused the US of double standards and said China cared more about human rights than any other country.																								 He also pointed out a host of legal steps China has taken recently in an attempt to better protect human rights, including a constitutional amendment this month.																								A condemnation from the 53-member UN Human Rights Commission, which began its six-week session last week, brings no penalties but spotlights a countrys behaviour.

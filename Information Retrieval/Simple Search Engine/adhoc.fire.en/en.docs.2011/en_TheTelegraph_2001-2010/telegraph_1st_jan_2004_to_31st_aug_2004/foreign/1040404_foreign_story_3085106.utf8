 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Uzbeks seek information on nationals held by Pak
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, April 3: The Uzbekistan government has formally requested Pakistan for information about its nationals arrested in a recent military operation in South Waziristan.																								Our mission in Tashkent and the foreign ministry in Islamabad have received a communique from the Uzbek government seeking detailed information about people of Uzbek origin who were taken into custody during the military operation, foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan told a press briefing in Islamabad.																								At least 60 alleged terrorists were killed and 167 arrested  including 73 foreigners, mostly Uzbeks, Chechens and Arabs, and 94 locals  in the military operation in the South Waziristan district. Forty six army and paramilitary troops were killed during the operation.																								In a recent briefing, General Safdar Hussein, Corps Commander, Peshawar, had said that most radio messages intercepted by the army in Wana were either in Uzbek or Chechen languages.																								The army also claimed that Uzbek militant Tahir Yuldeshev was injured during the clashes. 																								Yuldeshev is a leading figure of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and had recently been sighted with accomplices in the South Waziristan region.																								The Uzbek governments communication is presently under consideration and we have not given any response yet, Khan said.																								The spokesman denied that Moscow had made a request for information on Chechen or Russian nationals caught or killed in the Wana operation.																								However, Russian diplomatic sources in Islamabad said today that the issue has been discussed at the bilateral level between the two countries.																								We have asked the Pakistani authorities several times to provide us details about those Russian or Chechen nationals allegedly involved in militancy or staying illegally in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, a diplomat said requesting anonymity.																								The Pakistan-Russian group on anti-terrorism had met in Islamabad in February and discussed the presence of Chechen militants in Pakistan.																								Two persons were reportedly killed in a series of blasts that rocked illegal arms shops in the Azam Warsak, South Waziristan, when a shopkeeper was shifting weapons, security chief of the tribal region Mehmood Shah said. 																								According to my information it was an accident, Shah said and and added that reports did not suggest the blasts were the result of terrorism.

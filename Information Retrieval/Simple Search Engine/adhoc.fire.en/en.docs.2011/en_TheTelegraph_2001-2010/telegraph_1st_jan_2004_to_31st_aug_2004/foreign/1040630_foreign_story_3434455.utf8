 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Playboy pestered by hacker
																								London, June 29: A bored supermarket shelf-stacker hacked into Playboy magazines computer files and blackmailed its bosses into believing he had access to the private accounts of Internet customers, a court was told.																								Simon Jones, 25, made just 60 out of his scam. But his activities resulted in a dawn visit from the American Secret Service at the home he shared with his parents and, ultimately, a two-year jail sentence.																								Jones, who has a science degree, was bitter over his failure to get a job in the computer industry and used his Internet skills to convince the Playboy company that he had obtained confidential information that he was prepared to sell unless he was paid not to do so.																								The company paid him 60 to protect two customer accounts and called in the police. The company was forced to conduct an internal review of its Internet security, costing 3,550, and believed it might have to rebuild its entire database at a cost of 547,000.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

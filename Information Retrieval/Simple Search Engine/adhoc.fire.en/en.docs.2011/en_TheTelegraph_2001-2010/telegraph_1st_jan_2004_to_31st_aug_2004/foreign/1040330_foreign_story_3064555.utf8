 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Mermaid surgery
																								Warsaw, March 29 (Reuters): The mermaid patron of a Polish coastal town faces plastic surgery after councillors decided her breasts were too small and hips too wide, a city official said today. 																								The mermaids looks became a hot topic during talks in the city hall on a promotion campaign for Ustka, a small port on the Baltic coast, in which the towns mermaid shield was supposed to play a key role.																								There was a discussion about the coat of arms and one female councillor said jokingly that the mermaids breasts were too small and that she was a bit fat, city hall spokesman said. 																								The joke became a serious idea when local and national media got wind of the debate, giving sleepy Ustka plenty of coverage.																								We are now considering altering the mermaid slightly by making her breasts bigger and making her leaner, the spokesman said. She will become more attractive and Ustka will gain publicity.																								The soon-to-be revamped mermaid can be seen on the towns web page: http://www.ustka.pl/ustka.html?section=40.

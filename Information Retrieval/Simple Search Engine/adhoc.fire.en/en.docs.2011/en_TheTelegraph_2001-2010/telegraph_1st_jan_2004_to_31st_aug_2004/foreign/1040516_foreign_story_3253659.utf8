 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Bar on some grilling methods
																								Washington, May 15 (Reuters): The US military, facing a scandal over the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib jail, has banned several interrogation methods in Iraq, including sleep and sensory deprivation and body stress positions, defence officials said yesterday.																								The officials said these techniques previously required high-level approval from the US military leadership in Iraq, but now will be prohibited completely. The officials said the decision was made by the top US commander in Iraq, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez. 																								An official said the US military never actually approved a request from personnel at any prison to use any of the techniques that now are being prohibited.

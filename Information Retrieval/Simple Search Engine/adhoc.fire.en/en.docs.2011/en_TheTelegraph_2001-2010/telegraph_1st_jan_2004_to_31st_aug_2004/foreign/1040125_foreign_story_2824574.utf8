 															- Older  women watching more films 				 	 Diane Lane																								With a scene-stealing performance in The Clearing at this weeks Sundance Film Festival, Helen Mirren is leading a new charge through Hollywood by mature actors.																								A sudden surge in cinema-going by women of 40 and over is evident, with female audiences anxious to see stars they grew up with. A distinct sign of the times is that Mirren, 58, is among four actresses near 40 or over nominated for the title of best female in a comedy at the Golden Globe awards.																								Her rivals are Diane Keaton, 58, in Somethings Gotta Give, Jamie Lee Curtis, 45, for Freaky Friday, and Diane Lane, 38, in Under The Tuscan Sun.																								Mirren, nominated for Calendar Girls, spoke yesterday of the shortage of good roles for women of a certain age. Accepting a South Bank Show outstanding achievement award in London, the Prime Suspect star said that the past year had been incredible especially for one of my particular sex when getting a job becomes harder and harder to achieve.																								She lamented that Calendar Girls had been ignored this week by the Bafta voters. The actress said: Im very sad it wasnt nominated for a Bafta. One never knows why the choices are made. I think its very unfortunate because its a film that deserves recognition.																								Of her Golden Globe nomination, she said: I cant be there to enjoy it. I wish I could, if only to lose  its always a good idea to go and lose gracefully.																								The Eccles Theatre in Park City, Utah, was packed for the world premiere of The Clearing, with hundreds waiting for spare tickets outside in the cold.																								The crowds wanted to see Robert Redford, who plays a successful Philadelphia businessman kidnapped by Willem Dafoe. Mirren, as Redfords wife, must come up with the ransom. She had to skip the premiere because she was acting at the National Theatre. Ty Burr, the Boston Globe critic, described her performance as incandescent.																								Lane is noted for her steamy scenes in Unfaithful  and, intriguingly, she appeared in Searching for Debra Winger, a documentary that riled several studio executives when it was shown on cable television.																								Rosanna Arquette, 44, made the picture, in which actresses from Vanessa Redgrave and Jane Fonda to Charlotte Rampling and Sharon Stone, told personal horror stories about insensitive producers and casting directors, who thought that beyond 40, women were over the screen hill.																								Lane said beauty had to be a certain way in Hollywood. A woman who aged became damaged beauty or sad beauty.																								Arquette said that her film had upset movie bosses. There are a lot of misogynistic men who are very angry about it. Theyve told me: Its just a bunch of chicks sitting around bitching about us.																								The New York Times has come out in favour of the over-forties, saying that the older woman is this years Hollywood It Girl. 																								The paper pointed out that studio executives were now insisting that audiences of older women were becoming vital for any mainstream Hollywood successes, turning out to see movies such as Chicago and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.																								Hollywoods most powerful woman, Amy Pascal, 45, the chairman of Columbia Pictures, said: If you dont get the female demographic, you cant have a mainstream movie.																								Lynda Obst, 53, a Paramount Pictures producer who made the hit How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days, as well as Flashdance, said: Older women are saying: Were not dead yet. 																								Statistics from the National Association of Theatre show that 26 years ago 20 per cent of cinema audiences were women of 40 and over. This grew to 27 per cent in 1995. It is now 32 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Radical fury against Pervez
				 	 Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal leader Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman speaks at a rally in Islamabad. (Reuters)																								Karachi, June 4 (Reuters): Fearful traders kept businesses shut in the troubled Pakistani city of Karachi today after a strike call by Islamists to protest the recent killing of a pro-Taliban cleric during a wave of militant violence.																								Islamist leaders led anti-US rallies in several cities.																								In Karachi, at least six Sunni protesters were wounded by police gunfire and four policemen were hurt by stone-throwing.																								Police fired teargas to disperse small but violent crowds of Sunnis in the western part of the city, and scuffled with a group of mostly young protesters near the mosque of Sunni leader Mufti Nizamuddin Shamzai.																								Shamzai was killed during a wave of tit-for-tat sectarian violence in May that included two bombings of Shia mosques and killed more than 50.																								While the latest violence has smacked of decades-old sectarianism, analysts say Sunni militants have been using attacks on Shias in a broader campaign to undermine President Pervez Musharraf and his support for the US-led war on terror.																								But Islamist leaders told rallies that Shamzais killing and the bombing of the mosques could not have taken place without the connivance of Musharrafs government.																								The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a six-party Islamic alliance, had called a nationwide strike to protest Shamzais killing, but while it was observed in some towns such as Quetta, in the MMA heartland of Baluchistan province, it largely fizzled out elsewhere.																								Earlier, the alliance poured cold water on a proposal by the main party in Musharrafs government for a united provincial administration in Sindh province, including Opposition parties, to contain the violence.

(AFP, Reuters)Washington, August 2: The unannounced capture of a figure from al Qaida in Pakistan several weeks ago led the CIA to the rich lode of information that prompted the terror alert yesterday, according to senior American officials.The figure, Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan, was described by a Pakistani intelligence official as a 25-year-old computer engineer, arrested on July 13, who had used and helped to operate a secret Qaida communications system where information was transferred via coded messages.A senior US official would not confirm or deny that Khan had been the Qaida figure whose capture led to the information. But the official said documentary evidence found after the capture had demonstrated in extraordinary detail that Qaida members had for years conducted sophisticated and extensive reconnaissance of the financial institutions cited in the warnings yesterday.One senior American intelligence official said the information was more detailed and precise than any he had seen during his 24-year career in intelligence work. A second senior American official said it had provided a new window into the methods, content and distribution of Qaida communications.The documentary evidence, whose contents were reported urgently to Washington on Friday afternoon, immediately elevated the significance of other intelligence information gathered in recent weeks that had already been regarded as highly troubling, senior American intelligence officials said. Much of that information had come from Qaida detainees in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia as well as Pakistan, and some had also pointed to a possible attack on financial institutions, senior American intelligence officials said. The officials said the new evidence had been obtained only after the capture of the Qaida figure. Among other things, they said, it demonstrated that Qaida plotters had begun targeting the buildings in New York, Newark and Washington even before the attacks of September 11, 2001.Among the questions the plotters sought to answer, senior American intelligence officials said, were how best to gain access to the targeted buildings; how many people might be at the sites at different hours and on different days of the week; whether a hijacked oil tanker truck could serve as an effective weapon; and how large an explosive device might be required to bring the buildings down.The American officials would say only that the Qaida figure whose capture had led to the discovery of the documentary evidence had been captured with the help of the CIA. Though Pakistan announced the arrest last week of a Qaida member, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian wanted in connection with the bombings of American embassies in East Africa in 1998, the American officials suggested that he had not been the source of the new threat information.An account provided by a Pakistani intelligence official made clear that the crucial capture in recent weeks had been that of Khan, who is also known as Abu Talha. The intelligence official provided information describing Khan as having assisted in evaluating potential American and western targets for terrorist attacks, and as being representative of a new al Qaida.The Pakistani official described Khan as a fluent English speaker who had told investigators that he had visited the US, Britain, Germany and other countries. Khan was one of thousands of Pakistani militants who trained in Afghanistan under the Taliban in the 1990s, the Pakistani official said.

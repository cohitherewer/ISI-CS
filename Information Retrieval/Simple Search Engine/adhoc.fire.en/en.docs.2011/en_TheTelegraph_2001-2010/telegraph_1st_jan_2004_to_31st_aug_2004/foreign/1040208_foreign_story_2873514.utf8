The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, February 08, 2004 				 American held for vulgar sign in Brazil
 Sao Paulo, Feb. 7 (Reuters):  The second American in a month was arrested while entering  Brazil for making an obscene gesture while being photographed  by an immigration official, police said today.																								Federal police in Foz do Iguacu on Brazils border with Argentina and Paraguay said retired US banker Douglas Allan Skolnick, 56, was jailed overnight for flipping his middle finger in a photo now required to be taken of all US tourists entering Brazil.																								Brazil began fingerprinting and photographing Americans entering the country in January after the US government imposed a similar process on foreigners, except for those from 27 mostly European countries. Mr Skolnick went before the judge this morning and opted to take the public prosecutors offer that he pay a 15,000 real fine ($5,000) to avoid prosecution, said officer Marcos Koren of the Foz do Iguacu federal police.																								Skolnick, who came into Brazil on a charter flight with 91 other tourists  mostly American  from Chile yesterday, is being held in his hotel room under police guard until he pays the fine, said Koren.

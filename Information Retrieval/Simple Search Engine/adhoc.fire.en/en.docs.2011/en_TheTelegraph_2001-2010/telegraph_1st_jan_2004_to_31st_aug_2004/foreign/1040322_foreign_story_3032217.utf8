 RENE MICKELBURGHLondon, March 21: She can remind you to eat breakfast, guide you to the bathroom and bat her eyes approvingly while you swallow your medicine.																								Pearl, believed to be the worlds first robotic carer, could be the perfect solution for a population that is facing a critical shortage of nurses at the same time as the number of its elderly residents is rising rapidly.																								The 125-pound intelligent nursebot uses sonars and an internal map to detect and follow her patient. She knows exactly where they are and what they should be doing at certain times of the day.																								Developed by a team of researchers from the universities of Michigan and Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pearl could revolutionise the way the elderly are cared for. She has been programmed with a computer-generated female voice and can use a touch-screen to communicate reminders and advice.																								Martha Pollack, a professor of electrical engineering at the university of Michigan, said that preliminary testing on Pearl with residents in a retirement home had been a great success. She tries to figure out if the person has done what shes supposed to do and, if not, remind her to do it, Pollack said. Another thing she can do is provide navigational guidance. When people are a little bit disorientated and they know they need to go to the cafeteria, but they cant remember how to get to there, she can guide them.																								The prototype of Pearl cost almost $100,000 to develop but it will be some time before Pearl is mass-produced and put on sale. The development scientists want to advance her capabilities before letting her loose on retirement homes and hospitals around the world.																								At the moment, the nursebot functions on a battery system that needs to be recharged every couple of hours, and as she moves about on wheels, stairs are an impossibility.																								I think theres a whole range of things she could do, said Pollack. One very important application is monitoring various aspects of a persons health. She could monitor things like heart rate, ankle diameter and blood pressure.																								Pollack said that despite Pearls popularity they did not want her to replace human nurses and carers. Thats not what we are trying to do. Theres human contact there which is just invaluable but the reality is that there are huge nursing shortages. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

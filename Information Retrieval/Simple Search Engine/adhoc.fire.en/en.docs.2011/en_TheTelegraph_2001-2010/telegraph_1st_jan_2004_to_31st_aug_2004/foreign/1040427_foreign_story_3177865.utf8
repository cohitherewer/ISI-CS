 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Jackson replaces lead attorneys
				 	 Michael Jackson (right) with one of his attorneys Mark Geragos. (AFP)																								Los Angeles, April 26 (Reuters): Michael Jackson said today that he personally terminated his two lead defence attorneys in his child molestation case, suggesting that they had failed to give him their full attention.																								I have terminated the services of attorneys Mark Geragos, esquire, and Benjamin Brafman, esquire, effective immediately, Jackson, who was indicted last week by a Santa Barbara County grand jury, said in a statement posted on his website.																								The self-declared King of Pop said he had replaced his high-profile lead attorneys with veteran Los Angeles lawyer Thomas Mesereau and was keeping two other members of his defence team, Steve Cochran and Robert Sanger.																								Apparently bristling at press speculation that he had fired his legal team at the urging of his Nation of Islam advisers, Jackson added: Let me make it clear, I have not replaced my defence team. I have replaced the lead attorneys. And contrary to reports, this is a decision I have personally made.																								Though Jackson did not say in his brief statement why he sacked Geragos and Brafman, the 45-year-old singer hinted that he was unhappy with the attention they had given his case.																								Brafman is based across the country from Santa Barbara in New York and Geragos has been busy in Northern California defending Scott Peterson on charges that he murdered his wife, Laci, and their unborn son. That case could lead to the death penalty for Peterson.																								It is imperative that I have the full attention of those who are representing me. My life is at stake, Jackson said. Therefore I must feel confident that my interests are of the highest priority. Brafman said yesterday that he and Geragos had resigned from the case over complicated legal and practical issues that he could not discuss.

 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Libya to allow snap nuclear inspections 
				 	 Libyan minister of scientific research Maatoug Mohammed Maatoug (left) and International Atomic Energy Agency director general Mohamed ElBaradei during the signing in Vienna. (Reuters) Vienna, March 10 (Reuters):  Libya took a fresh stride towards international rehabilitation  today by signing an agreement allowing the UN atomic watchdog  to conduct snap inspections of nuclear facilities.																								This is a step by Libya to be clean of all nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, scientific research minister Maatoug Mohammed Maatoug said after signing the accord with Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency.																								ElBaradei said: Libyas decision could be, and should be, a first step towards an Africa and West Asia free from weapons of mass destruction and at peace.																								Earlier, the IAEAs governing board passed a resolution praising Libya for dismantling its secret nuclear weapons programme and commending Tripoli to the Security Council.																								Diplomats said the resolution noted Libyas past nuclear activities had put it in breach of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) but applauded its current disarmament moves.																								The moves marked significant fresh steps by Libya  long branded as a rogue state for sponsoring attacks like the 1988 Lockerbie airline bombing  to reintegrate itself into the international community.																								Tripoli made the surprise announcement last December it was abandoning all WMD programmes and would cooperate with the IAEA, the US and Britain to dismantle them.																								On Saturday, Libya dispatched a shipload to the US containing all the equipment believed to remain from its nuclear weapons programme, along with longer-range missiles and launchers.																								On Monday, the IAEA supervised an airlift from Tripoli to Russia of 80 per cent enriched uranium from a reactor near the capital. The agency said the metal was almost pure enough to be used in a nuclear weapon.																								Asked if there would be further shipments of nuclear-related equipment, Maatoug said: Theres nothing still to be removed. Under the additional protocol, IAEA inspectors can obtain short-notice access to any declared or undeclared sites where nuclear material may be present, in order to check for evidence of banned weapons activity. In recognition of Libyas efforts, the Bush administration announced last month it would allow US oil firms to begin negotiating to resume operations. It also eased restrictions on American travel to Libya and decided to let it establish a diplomatic presence in Washington.

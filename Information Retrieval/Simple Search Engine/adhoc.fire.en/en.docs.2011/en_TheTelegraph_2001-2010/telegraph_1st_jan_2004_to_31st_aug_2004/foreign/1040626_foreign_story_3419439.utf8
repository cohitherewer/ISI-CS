The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 80 killed in Iran fuel truck mishap
																								Tehran, June 25 (Reuters): A fuel truck exploded after smashing into a bus in southeast Iran late yesterday, killing 80 people and injuring another 100, officials said today.																								The disaster is so grave we cannot identify faces and cannot differentiate between corpses, Haidar Ali Nourai, governor of the southeastern city of Zahedan, told state television.																								He said the accident happened when the truck was unable to stop and ploughed into a bus waiting at Nosratabad police checkpoint. The fireball then enveloped five other buses.																								Television showed bodies charred beyond recognition. A gold watch was seen stuck to an arm scorched to the bone.																								According to the latest figures from the police the death toll has reached 80, health official Mohammad Taghi Hosseini Tabatabai told the official Irna news agency. 																								Saeed Khazai from the provincial crisis committee in the poor border region of Sistan-Baluchistan said many of the injured were in a critical situation. The death toll may rise, he said. 																								Nosratabad lies on the road from Zahedan to Bam, which was hit by an earthquake last year that killed more than 20,000 people.																								The road is dotted with checkpoints because it is the main route for drugs smugglers taking opiates from Afghanistan and Pakistan to the West.

 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Dictionary catches Dubyavirus
New York, July 15 (AP): If youve never dropped the word Dubyavirus into casual conversation, urged that an official be Ashcrofted or commented upon the Cheney effect, then you havent seen the future, at least the future according to McSweeneys. 																								The ever-expanding genre of books criticising President George W. Bush has now entered the reference field. Coming in August from McSweeneys, the publishing house founded by author-activist Dave Eggers, is the future dictionary of America, a Utopian tome set sometime beyond the present.																								Contributors include Eggers, Stephen King, Kurt Vonnegut, Jonathan Franzen, Wendy Wasserstein and more than 100 others. 																								The McSweeneys dictionary includes both new words such as Dubyavirus and old words such as environment with new definitions. Most of the entries are political. Some are philosophical, some simply playful. Under the entry Dubyavirus, fiction writer Thisbe Nissen imagines that Bush has been indicted as a war criminal, thus ending an aggressively invasive and tragically widespread disease. 																								Another writer, Paul Auster, defines Bush as a poisonous family of shrubs, now extinct. In homage to vice-president Dick Cheney, Pulitzer-prize winning novelist Jeffrey Eugenides invokes the Cheney effect, reserved for the manifestation of personality changes brought on by reception of a transplanted organ, usually the heart.

				 	 Tom Hanks in a scene from PhiladelphiaPhiladelphia, June 2 (Reuters): Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, has launched the first US television advertising campaign to promote a city as a gay destination, officials said today.																								In the television commercial, a young man in colonial attire writes a letter inviting his beloved to meet him at Independence Hall, one of the citys main tourist attractions.																								The man is approached by a woman who glances at him but passes by before another man greets the letter writer and accepts flowers. The spot emphasises the citys historic attractions and its friendliness to gay travellers and is part of a three-year, $1 million campaign using the slogan Philadelphia  Get Your History Straight and Your Nightlife Gay.																								The gay market is an extension of our leisure marketing efforts for the destination and complements our programs for other types of travellers, said Meryl Levitz, president of the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corp.																								The group estimates that the US gay travel market is worth $54 billion annually.																								Philadelphia means brotherly love in Greek.

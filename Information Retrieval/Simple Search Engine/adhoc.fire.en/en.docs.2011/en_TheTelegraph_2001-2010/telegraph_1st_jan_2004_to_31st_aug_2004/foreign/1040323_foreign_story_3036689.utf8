The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 More arrests in Spain
																								Madrid, March 22 (Reuters): Spanish investigators began grilling five suspects in the Madrid train bombings today and officials said four more had been arrested for the suspected al Qaida-linked attack that killed 202 people.																								The simultaneous bombing of four commuter trains is believed to be the first Islamist strike in the West since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US.																								Fourteen men have now been detained. Several are Moroccans thought to have links with the al Qaida network. 																								High Court judge Juan del Olmo and a state prosecutor began questioning five suspects late this afternoon, calling them in one by one.																								At least three were Moroccans but del Olmo started with a Spanish man suspected of helping the conspirators steal the explosives used in the attack, which also injured more than 1,800 people.

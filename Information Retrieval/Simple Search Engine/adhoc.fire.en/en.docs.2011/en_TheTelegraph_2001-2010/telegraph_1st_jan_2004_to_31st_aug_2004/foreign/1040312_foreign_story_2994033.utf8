 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Oil fuels Africa fire
																								Johannesburg, March 11 (Reuters): Oil should have brought wealth and development to bitterly poor West Africa, but instead it has fuelled wars, coup plots and even mercenary intrigue.																								Equatorial Guinea, an oil producer on the Atlantic coast, this week arrested what it called an advance party of 15 mercenaries, saying enemy powers and multinational companies had been plotting against the tiny state.																								Two thousand miles away, Zimbabwe threatened to execute some 60 suspected mercenaries who authorities said had been on their way to Equatorial Guinea to join the plot. Harare has accused US, British and Spanish spy agencies of involvement in the alleged plot that could have been straight out of a Frederick Forsyth bestseller.																								In Forsyths novel The Dogs of War it was the discovery of platinum riches in a remote African country that attracted an army of ruthless mercenaries. In West Africa, it is oil.																								The region is increasingly important to the US as it seeks to reduce dependence on West Asian supplies, and Washington keeps a close watch as governments rise and fall.																								The facts are often as murky as the state finances of some oil-rich African states, but analysts say one thing is certain: black gold can often attract trouble.																								Oil has historically been a cause of coups and conflicts in the region. It does bring out the worst in people, said Teju Akande, analyst with UK-based oil consultancy Wood Mackenzie. 																								The plot story swirling around Equatorial Guinea  sub-Saharan Africas third largest oil producer  follows a coup attempt last year on West Africas Sao Tome islands, which are expecting a gush of cash from crude. The regions giant and sub-Saharan Africas biggest oil producer, Nigeria, has seen its fair share of coups and military takeovers since independence in 1960  with oil wealth the prize for the big men who seized the reins of power. 																								West Africa has also become a region of strategic importance to the US, the worlds biggest oil consumer. In recent weeks US generals have been criss-crossing the region on a mission they say is to seek ways of securing the unstable area against international terrorism.																								Analysts say they cannot rule out US military action in the future to secure the flow of West African oil to US markets to ease reliance on a volatile West Asia.

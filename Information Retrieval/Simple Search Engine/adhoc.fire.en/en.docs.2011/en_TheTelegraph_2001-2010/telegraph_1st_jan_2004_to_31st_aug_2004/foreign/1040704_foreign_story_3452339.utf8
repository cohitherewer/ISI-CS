 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Marine beheaded
Dubai, July 3 (Reuters): The militant group, the Army of Ansar al-Sunna, said in an Internet statement that it had beheaded a US Marine kidnapped in Iraq and was holding another infidel hostage. 																								We tell your leadership that we beheaded the Marine of Lebanese origin Hassoun and you will see the film with your own eyes soon, said the Arabic-language statement, which was carried on at least two Islamic websites today. 																								Al Jazeera last Sunday screened a videotape of militants holding a blindfolded Wassef Ali Hassoun with a sword poised over his head. They demanded the release of prisoners in Iraq. 																								It was not immediately possible to verify the authenticity of the statement, which was addressed to President Bush and advised him to withdraw his troops from Iraq. Your soldier had romantic relations with an Arab girl and he was lured away from his base, the statement said. 																								And we will soon issue a new tape showing a new infidel hostage, it said without giving the nationality of the hostage. 																								The US military has said that Hassoun had been absent from his unit since June 21, but could not confirm he had been abducted. 																								Amjad Hafeez, a Pakistani kidnapped by Islamic militants in Iraq, contacted his family and said he had been freed, his uncle in Pakistan said yesterday.																								Earlier, two Turkish hostages were freed in Iraq.

				 	 Francis Crick																								Washington, July 29 (Reuters): Francis Crick, who helped discover the double helix shape of DNA, has died at the age of 88, his family said today.																								Crick died at a hospital in San Diego after a long battle with colon cancer, the Salk Institute in nearby La Jolla said in a statement. British-born Crick won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for his work on DNAs structure, which he discovered in 1953 along with James Watson at Cambridge University. Watson and a third colleague, Maurice Wilkins, shared the prize.																								The names of Crick and Watson, youthful friends and colleagues at the time, have been linked ever since.																								I will always remember Francis for his extraordinarily focused intelligence and for the many ways he showed me kindness and developed my self-confidence, Watson in a statement from his office in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.																								Being with him for two years in a small room in Cambridge was truly a privilege.																								Francis Harry Compton Crick was born on June 8, 1916, in Northampton in Britain but had been living in La Jolla, California where he was a distinguished research professor and former president of the Salk Institute.																								Crick, the son of a shoe-factory owner, studied physics and biology but had his efforts interrupted by World War Two. Crick went to work as a scientist for the British Admiralty, helping to design magnetic and acoustic mines. I still didnt know much about anything so I could go into whatever I wanted, Crick said in 1997 in a lecture at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 																								I used what I call the Gossip Test to decide what I wanted to do, he added.																								The gossip test is simply that whatever you find yourself gossiping about is what youre really interested in. I had found that my two main interests which I discussed the most were what today would be called molecular biology  what I referred to as the borderline between living and the non-living  and the workings of the brain.																								His career took a crucial turn in 1951 when he struck up a friendship with James Watson, a talkative young American 12 years Cricks junior who was on a post-doctoral fellowship in genetics. They agreed that DNA was the compound that carried genetic information, not proteins, as many believed at the time. They set to work studying the compound.																								In 1953 they proposed the twisted ladder-like shape called the double helix for DNA, with its paired nucleotides now known by their initials A, C, T and G.																								We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA). This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest, reads the introduction to their first paper, published in the science journal Nature.

 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Philip Morris settles EU spat with $1.25 billion
																								Brussels, July 9 (Reuters): The worlds top tobacco company, Philip Morris, agreed today to pay $1.25 billion to the EU over 12 years to fight contraband cigarettes and end legal disputes with the EU over smuggling charges.																								The deal between Philip Morris, part of food and tobacco group Altria, involved no admission of liability, but ended all legal battles between the two sides. The amount was slightly higher than a $1.0 billion settlement aired in April.																								EU budget and anti-fraud commissioner Michaele Schreyer said half the money would be paid out over the first three years of the deal. Philip Morris will also make payments if its genuine cigarettes were seized in anti-smuggling operations.																								We believe that it will enhance the ability of the European Commission and the member states to combat the illegal trade in cigarettes which results in the loss of substantial tax and customs revenues each year, Schreyer said.																								The payments could, subject to several variable factors, total approximately $1.25 billion over 12 years, and would be payable over those years in varying amounts, the company added.																								Altria said in a filing to the US Stock Exchange that it had recorded a pre-tax charge in the second quarter of $250 million for the initial payment.																								It will make additional payments of $150 million on the first anniversary of the deal, $100 million on the second anniversary and $75 million each year for the next 10 years. 																								The funds from Philip Morris would be used by the commission and EU states.

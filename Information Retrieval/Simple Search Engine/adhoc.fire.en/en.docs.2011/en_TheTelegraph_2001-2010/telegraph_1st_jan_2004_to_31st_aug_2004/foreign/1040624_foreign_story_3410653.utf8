The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 UN panel pushes US on backfoot
																								United Nations, June 23 (Reuters): The US abandoned its effort today to seek a UN exemption for US soldiers from prosecution overseas and withdrew a Security Council resolution because it lacked support.																								The US has decided not to proceed further with consideration and action on the draft at this time in order to avoid a prolonged and divisive debate, said James Cunningham, the US deputy ambassador. We are dropping action on this resolution.																								Washington in the past has threatened to veto UN peacekeeping missions if the resolution giving it immunity from the new International Criminal Court were not adopted. Cunningham would not comment about whether it would carry out the threat this time. The US has rarely faced such opposition in the council, with the notable exception of its attempt to get UN endorsement for the invasion of Iraq last year.

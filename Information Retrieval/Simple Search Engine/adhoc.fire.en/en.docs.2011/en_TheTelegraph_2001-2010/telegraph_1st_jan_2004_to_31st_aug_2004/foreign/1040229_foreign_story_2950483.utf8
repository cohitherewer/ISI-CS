The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, February 29, 2004 				 Gigli sweeps Razzies as worst of the worst
				 	 Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck in a scene from Gigli. (Reuters) Los Angeles, Feb. 28 (Reuters):  And the Razzie goes to: Gigli, Gigli and, oh yes,  Gigli. Plus another three for good measure.																								In a virtual sweep of the awards that honour the worst of the very worst in Hollywood  a sort-of anti-Oscar, the Jennifer Lopez-Ben Affleck mega-flop was accorded the Golden Raspberry today as worst film of the year.																								And in an almost unprecedented wash, Gigli, the first on-screen collaboration for the couple, whose overhyped engagement went down in flames, mowed down the competition in all the top categories.																								No one was left out: worst actor Affleck, worst actress Lopez, worst director and screenwriter Martin Brest in a double whammy, and and worst screen couple (yes, them again).																								There was some small consolation for the Gigli perpetrators in the worst supporting actor and actress nods going to Razzie king Sylvester Stallone and another veteran, Demi Moore.																								Stallone was cited for an unprecedented 10th Razzie for Spy Kids 3D: Game Over, while Moores work in Charlies Angels: Full Throttle had Razzie voters jaws hitting the floor.																								The latter film was also cited as worst sequel. And in a new category, the Mike Myers vehicle The Cat in the Hat was named worst excuse for an actual movie. (All concept, no content). 																								It came into the competition with an impressive eight nominations.																								There was some consolation for the artistic vandals responsible for Gigli. 																								The record for most Razzies, now in their 24th year, still belongs to Showgirls and Battlefield Earth which amassed seven each.																								And on an encouraging note, they could look to this years Oscar darling Sofia Coppola, multi-nominated for Lost in Translation and a favourite to win for best original screenplay. 																								The former actress won twin Razzies back in the 90s for her turn as Al Pacinos daughter in Godfather III.																								At the time viewers laughed or even applauded when she took a bullet in the chest in the films climax, then intoned Dad? before dropping dead.																								The Razzies are chosen by the 617 Golden Raspberry Award Foundation members throughout 39 U.S. states and 15 foreign countries, who mail in ballots for the final tally.																								The awards themselves, a handcrafted gold spray-painted golf-ball-sized raspberry atop a mangled reel of Super 8 film, are handed out on the eve of the Academy Awards in a less-than-glittering ceremony in a conference room at a Sheraton hotel in Santa Monica, California.																								Organizers peg their estimated street value at $4.89  although this being Hollywood, you really cant put a price on fame.

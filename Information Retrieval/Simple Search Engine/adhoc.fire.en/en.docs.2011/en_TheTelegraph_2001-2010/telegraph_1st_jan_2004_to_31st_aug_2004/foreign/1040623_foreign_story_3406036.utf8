The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, June 23, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Iran pipes bubble over																																	 Tehran, June 22 (Reuters): Iranian authorities are trying to snuff out one of the countrys favourite pastimes, the smoking of hubble-bubble water pipes, whose apple and citrus tobaccos waft through most Persian restaurants.																																	Police said there was no particular focus on the pipes, saying the after-dinner relaxants had just fallen victim to a directive banning smoking in all public places. Health ministry official Hassan Azaripour confirmed the ban, however. According to health ministry directives, the ban on water pipes will be implemented, he told the Sharq daily today.																																	Young men and women often spend their evenings chatting round a qalyoun in restaurants or on carpet-decked platforms in parks. The more rebellious sprinkle hashish among the tobacco on the smouldering white charcoals. In one old-style restaurant in central Tehran, diners smoked away oblivious to the new rules after a hearty platter of kababs and chicken in walnut and pomegranate sauce. When asked why authorities had banned qalyoun, waiter Peiman tapped his forefinger against his temple: They are mad, he said.																													 																Nervous needle theft nixed Munich (Reuters): A man who tried to hold up a pharmacy with a needle he said was contaminated with AIDS gave up after the nervous clerk struggled to open the cash register, and he fled with just a chocolate bar, police said. A spokesman for the Munich police department said on Tuesday that the thief, aged about 18, waved the syringe at the clerk and demanded she turn over the money in her cash drawer. Police said the woman was so frightened that she fumbled with the cash drawer. It was all too slow for the thief so he just grabbed a chocolate bar and fled, the spokesman added.

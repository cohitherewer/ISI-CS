 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Rabin killer in wedding row
				 	 Yigal Amir 																								Jerusalem, Jan. 19 (Reuters): Israels prison director said today he would forbid the killer of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to marry in prison, after reports of his wedding plans stirred a national uproar.																								Rabins daughter, Dalia Rabin-Pelosoff, was hospitalised with an irregular heartbeat after hearing Israel media reports that Yigal Amir was planning to marry an ultra-Orthodox divorcee in the spring, a family friend said on Army Radio.																								Amir is serving a life sentence for shooting Rabin as he left a peace rally in November 1995. Amir, an ultra-nationalist, believed Rabin, who led a centre-left government, had betrayed Israel by concluding interim peace deals with the Palestinians.																								Word of Amirs wedding plans provided a rare occasion for outraged agreement between the ruling Right and Opposition Left. Shimon Peres, head of centre-left Labour and foreign minister under Rabin, said on Army Radio parliament should pass a special law to prohibit the marriage. In other countries they execute people. We dont. But to allow him to enjoy a normal life, that is a bit too much, said Peres, adding he feared the wedding would be a first step towards Amirs eventual release.																								Yuval Shteinitz, a senior lawmaker from the right-wing ruling Likud party, agreed that the law enabling abominable murderers such as Yigal Amir to get married in jail should be changed. Israeli law does not guarantee prison inmates the right to marry or have conjugal visits, but inmates can petition courts for improvements in their conditions, legal sources said. 																								Amirs mother Geula told the daily Maariv she was delighted her son had decided to marry and hoped authorities would allow the wedding to take place.																								Yaakov Ganot, head of Israels Prison Authority, said Amir had not yet made a formal request to marry the divorced mother of four in jail, but added he would reject it.

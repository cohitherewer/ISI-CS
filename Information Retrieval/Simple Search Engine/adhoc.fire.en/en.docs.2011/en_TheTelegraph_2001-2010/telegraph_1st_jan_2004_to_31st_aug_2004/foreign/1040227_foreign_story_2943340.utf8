(Reuters)																								Colombo, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Sri Lankas feuding President and Prime Minister kicked off parliamentary election campaigns at the islands most holy sites today with promises to end a two-decade separatist war with the Tamil Tigers.																								Elephants, saffron-robbed monks and ancient regal settings formed the backdrop for rallies by both President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the official start of campaigning for the April 2 vote.																								The two are from rival parties and are elected separately, but have had to share an uneasy partnership in which the President has wide constitutional powers but Wickremesinghe controls parliament.																								They have fought over how to restart talks with the rebels to end a war that has killed 64,000 people, with Kumaratunga calling a snap election three years early after accusing Wickremesinghe of making too many concessions to the Tigers.																								I need a mandate from the people to continue the peace process rightly and correctly, Kumaratunga told thousands of supporters in Anuradhapura, the ancient capital where generations of kings ruled over a Buddhist empire in the first millennium. My alliance will put forward a massive development programme that will create thousands of jobs within the first three months, she said.																								Kumaratunga is not up for re-election, but will be the chief campaigner for the United Peoples Freedom Alliance, a coalition grouping her party and the Marxist Peoples Liberation Front. Before the rally, Kumaratungas supporters made an offering at a sacred Bo tree, said to be more than 2,000 years old, and grown from a sapling brought by an Indian princess.

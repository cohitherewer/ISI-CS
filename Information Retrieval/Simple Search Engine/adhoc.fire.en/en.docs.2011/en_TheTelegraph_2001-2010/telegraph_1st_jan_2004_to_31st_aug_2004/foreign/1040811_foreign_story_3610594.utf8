				 	 Fay Wray																								New York, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Fay Wray, the shrieking blonde beauty who earned fame as the frightened girl stalked by King Kong up the Empire State Building, died at age 96, a spokesman said yesterday.																								Spokesman Greg Mitchell of the Writers Guild of America West in Los Angeles said Canadian-born Wray died on Sunday in New York. Born Vina Fay Wray in Cardston, Alberta, on September 15, 1907, she was one of six children. Her family moved to the US when she was 3.																								Having appeared in about 100 films, she was best known for her role in the movie King Kong in 1933 and she also starred as a Mexican aristocrat in Viva Villa!																								Wray was barely in her teens when she began her silver-screen career as a extra. She went on to be regularly cast as a heroine in silent movies and made her break-through in 1928s The Wedding March.																								In the early 1930s, she made a number of horror movies, including Doctor X (1932) and The Vampire Bat (1933) and became known as Hollywoods first scream queen. After those movies, Wray was told her next job would be working with a tall, dark leading man.																								(King Kong director Merian C. Cooper) called me into his office and showed me sketches of jungle scenes, and told me: Youre going to have the tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood. Naturally, I thought Clark Gable, Wray recalled.

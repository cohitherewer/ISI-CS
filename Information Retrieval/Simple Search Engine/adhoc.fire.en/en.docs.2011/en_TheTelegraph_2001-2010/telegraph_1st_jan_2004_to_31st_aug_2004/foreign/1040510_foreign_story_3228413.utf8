 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 US soldier to be tried in public
				 	 Under a cloud: US army specialist Charles A. Graner, Jr. with Private Lynndie R. England at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Both face charges in the prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq . (Reuters)																								Baghdad, May 9 (Reuters): The first of seven US soldiers charged with abusing detainees at Iraqs Abu Ghraib prison will be court martialled later this month in a public trial, the US military said today.																								Specialist Jeremy Sivits, 24, a member of the 800th Military Police Brigade, is charged with conspiracy to maltreat detainees; dereliction of duty for failing to protect detainees from abuse, cruelty and maltreatment; and maltreatment of detainees, the department of defence said in a statement.																								The court martial will begin on May 19 in Baghdad and will be held in public, possibly at a convention centre built by Saddam Hussein that sits inside the Green Zone, the heavily protected headquarters of the US-led coalition.																								Court martials are open to the public, military spokesman Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt said in Baghdad.																								Its our desire to make the upcoming courts martial as accessible as possible, he said.																								The charges carry a maximum sentence of one years imprisonment, a reduction in grade to private, the docking of two-thirds pay and allowances for a year and a fine. The court can also hand down a bad conduct discharge from the military.																								A US military lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sivits, from Hyndman, Pennsylvania, would be able to chose whether he is tried in front of a single military judge or a three-person panel of senior military officers.																								He will have access to a military trial defence attorney and may also retain a civilian attorney. To be convicted, the defendant must be found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as in civilian criminal cases in US federal courts.																								It is not the first court martial since US-led forces invaded Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein.																								A military source said Sivits was alleged to have taken many of the pictures of abuse at Abu Ghraib, pictures that show soldiers piling naked and hooded detainees on top of one another or posing them to simulate sex acts. New pictures emerged today of dogs apparently menacing a naked detainee.																								The images were revealed to the public by US television 10 days ago and have caused a furore around the world, provoking alarm at the highest levels of the US administration.																								Sivits father, Daniel Sivits, defended his son earlier this week saying he was not deployed to Iraq as a military policeman and had no training for the role he was told to perform. My son is not a trained MP, he was quoted as saying in US media. He is trained as a mechanic..Hes used to changing tyres on a humvee.																								The abuse scandal has come at an awkward time for the US administration as it prepares to hand sovereignty over to an Iraqi government on June 30 even as the military is trying to put down a militia uprising across much of southern Iraq.

 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Lawyers in fair trial concern
																								Amman, July 1 (Reuters): A team of western lawyers defending Saddam Hussein said today the former dictator was being denied a fair trial by being brought before an Iraqi court without a lawyer and without independent judges.																								I dont think there is a prospect of a fair trial in Baghdad and I think any court in Baghdad will inevitably be one which is not fair, Tim Hughes, a British criminal lawyer from the British-based Bevan Ashford law firm, said.																								Hughes is among a handful of western lawyers in a 20-strong team who gathered in Amman to prepare Saddams defence under a power of attorney by his wife Sajida Khairallah, which also has the support of their daughters Raghad, Rana and Hala.																								We will be arguing for a trial away from Baghdad. He is entitled to legal representation and legal defence just as anybody is in any fair legal system, Hughes said as Saddam appeared on television in a courthouse and heard seven charges under a preliminary arrest warrant.																								Hughes cast doubt over the legality of Saddams trial by an Iraqi government that does not enjoy full sovereignty. We say that the regime which is currently in force is a regime which has no backing in law ... and coalition forces are still there, he added.

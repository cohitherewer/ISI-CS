 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Independent rights panel to be set up, says Pervez
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, May 15: President Pervez Musharraf today announced that an independent national commission would be set up to protect human rights in Pakistan.																								The National Commission on Human Rights would have an independent status and report, review and advise on all forms of human rights violations.																								The government is committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and the new commission will go a long way in implementing human rights standards and laws in the country, he said. Musharraf was speaking at a convention in Islamabad on human rights standards in Pakistan.																								The President recounted a range of pro-active steps for the socio-economic empowerment of the people of Pakistan. He also introduced initiatives for women to join politics from the Senate to the local government.																								Musharraf described killing girls in the name of family honour as un-Islamic and said the government plans to enact stringent laws to counteract it.																								According to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), around 450 girls were victims of honour killings in urban and rural Pakistan last . Musharraf also called for a parliamentary debate on the controversial Islamic Hudood law.																								This is a highly discriminatory law against women which must be debated in the parliament, he said, adding that he was at a loss to understand why religious parties are averse to debating the issue. Radical Islamists have supported the Hudood laws describing the commissions recommendations for its repeal as un-Islamic. The National Commission on the Status of Women, in a recent report, called for a repeal of the law. Multan gangrape																								Human rights activists staged a demonstration today in Multan in protest against an alleged gangrape of two women by policemen, witnesses said.																								The two victims, aged 18 and 30, told a court they were abducted by four policemen while returning from a wedding.

 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Deodorant link to cancer 
																								London, Jan. 12 (Reuters): Chemicals found in underarm deodorants have been detected in the tumours of breast cancer sufferers, British scientists said today.																								Researchers at the University of Reading found traces of the chemicals called parabens in tissue samples, proving that the preservatives can accumulate inside the body, although a direct link with breast cancer has not been proven. Their detection in human breast tumours is of concern since parabens have been shown to mimic the action of the female hormone oestrogen, and oestrogen can drive the growth of human breast tumours, Philippa Darbre, lead author of the study, said in a statement.																								But Philip Harvey, European editor of the Journal of Applied Toxicology, which published the research, stressed the need for more investigation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Sars-infected restaurant in Guangzhou searched
																								Beijing, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Doctors of the World Health Organisation today searched a restaurant in southern China that employed a waitress suspected of having Sars, to find out if she could have caught the virus from civet cats dished up there.																								The WHO said it was taking the case of the 20-year-old woman seriously but had yet to see any sign that an epidemic of Sars was about to sweep out of southern China as it did last year. This place did have civet cat, WHO spokesman Roy Wadia said by telephone from the restaurant in the southern city of Guangzhou.																								China confirmed today its first Sars case since the world outbreak was declared over in July. The patient, a 32-year-old television producer from the south, recovered and left hospital on Thursday.																								Chinese authorities said a gene sample from the man resembled that of a coronavirus found in civets, a local delicacy.																								Sars first appeared in southern China and infected about 8,000 people around the world last year, killing about 800. 																								About two-thirds of the cases and about 350 deaths were in China.																								Many experts believe the flu-like disease jumped from animals to humans in southern China, and the weasel-like civet, a small mammal related to the cat family, has emerged as prime suspect. 																								Top Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said yesterday he believed the waitress illness was related to the animal, now banned and being rounded up in a mass cull.																								The WHO team took samples from the seafood and exotic game restaurant in an old quarter of Guangzhou where the waitress worked, looking for clues. Theres big pictures on the wall downstairs of all the food they served, and I heard someone say that three of those pictures showed civet cat, Wadia said.																								The team later toured the notorious Xinyuan bird and livestock market, a target of the government crusade to wipe out the civet cat, the raccoon dog and a species of badger. 																								The WHO has recommended that authorities send samples from the woman, who has been in stable condition without fever for more than a week, to laboratories in Beijing and WHO facilities abroad for more tests.																								 Working from the incomplete data we have, this seems to us that there is sufficient evidence to indicate that further laboratory tests should be performed and that this case should be taken seriously, the WHO said in a statement.

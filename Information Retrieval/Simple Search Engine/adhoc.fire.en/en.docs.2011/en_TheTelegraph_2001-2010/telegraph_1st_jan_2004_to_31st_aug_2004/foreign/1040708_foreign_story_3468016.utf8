The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, July 08, 2004 Valentino shows why he is king of Oscar night
				 	 Liz Hurley: Fashion freak																								Paris, July 7 (Reuters): Valentino is the king of Oscar-night dressing, and yesterday he showed guests, including talk show host Oprah Winfrey and actor Liz Hurley, a parade of surefire winners for their next trip down the red carpet.																								The Italian designer, who next year celebrates 45 years in business, is one of the last remaining veterans on the Paris haute couture scene now that his French counterpart Emanuel Ungaro has decided to shut down his couture division. Valentino showered his models with crystals for his autumn-winter collection, which reflected his years of experience in dressing Hollywood stars from Sophia Loren to Gwyneth Paltrow.																								This is a collection for important women whose personal allure is a counterpoint to the richness of their clothes, he said in a statement.																								Indeed, only a confident woman could carry off these ultra-luxurious ensembles that screamed wealth.																								Valentino dresses the women who can afford his exclusive made-to-measure creations for all hours of the day and night, though a slimline silhouette prevails.																								British model Jacquetta Wheeler was exquisite in a fitted ivory silk skirt suit with a cutaway collar, trimmed in white mink and belted with a white satin ribbon  perfect for a smart lunch at Le Cirque or the Four Seasons in New York.																								A brown crocodile leather jacket was paired with a burnt orange skirt with colourful embroidered flowers for a daring cocktail-time alternative to the ubiquitous little black dress.																								Best of all, however, were the sumptuous evening gowns that are Valentinos speciality.																								Applause greeted a see-through black tulle dress embroidered with rows of jet beads, accessorised with long black leather gloves and a black fox shawl that slipped off to reveal thin straps criss-crossing a bare back to sensual effect.

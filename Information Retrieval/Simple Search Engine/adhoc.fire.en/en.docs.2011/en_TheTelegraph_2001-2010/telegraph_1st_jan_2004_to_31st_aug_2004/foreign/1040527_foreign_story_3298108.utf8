 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Obesity to get worse before it gets better
																								Prague, May 26 (Reuters): Obesity is a global problem that affects 300 million people but local policies are needed to control an epidemic which is likely to get worse before it gets better, a leading expert said today.																								Prof. Peter Kopelman, president of the European Association for the Study of Obesity, believes it could be five or 10 years until the epidemic peaks. We need to have strategies at a national and local level to tackle the immediate problems that every population is facing, he said ahead of the 13th European Congress on Obesity in Prague.																								There are priorities on a national level because people who are suffering most are largely those that are socially deprived. It is particular ethnic groups and particular cultures that seem to be suffering from the medical complications of obesity. 																								Up to 20 per cent of men and 25 per cent of women in European countries are considered obese. Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania and the Czech Republic have among the highest rates, while the Netherlands, Norway, Hungary and Switzerland have the lowest.																								High fat, energy dense diets and sedentary lifestyles over the past 20 to 30 years, along with economic growth, urbanisation and the globalisation of food markets have contributed to expanding waistlines around the globe and have resulted in more than one billion overweight adults.

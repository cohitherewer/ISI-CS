				 	 Paul McCartney																								San Francisco, March 30 (Reuters): Legendary musician Paul McCartney became a dinner show entertainer when he took the stage at a local restaurant in a California resort town and sang a few songs, the co-owner said yesterday.																								Of course they were shocked, J.J. Morgan, co-owner of Moodys Bistro and Lounge, said of the 70 diners present when McCartney played on Monday night.																								In the Lake Tahoe area town of Truckee on holiday with his wife Heather Mills, the former Beatle returned to the restaurant where he had dined and performed last year, Morgan said. A jazz trio was already on stage.																								He got up on stage and sang with the band again, Morgan said. He played Dont Get Around Much Anymore and then to the tune of Going to Kansas City he put in some words about going to Tahoe City and about skiing.

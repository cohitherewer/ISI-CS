 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Bush zeroes in on Iraq suspect
				 	 Al-Zarqawi: Marked																								Crawford (Texas), March 7 (Reuters): President George W. Bush yesterday vowed to crush militants behind this weeks wave of deadly attacks in Baghdad and Kerbala, and signaled a major push against chief suspect Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whom Bush singled out by name.																								Bush offered his first personal response to Tuesdays bomb attacks on Shia worshipers, saying: Laura and I and the American people were filled with grief and anger.																								In citing progress toward handing sovereignty back to the Iraqis on June 30, Bush made no mention of the postponement of Fridays signing of an interim Iraqi constitution.																								We will defeat the terrorists who seek to plunge Iraq into chaos and violence, and we will stand with the people of Iraq for as long as necessary to build a stable, peaceful and successful democracy, Bush said in his weekly radio address from his Crawford, Texas, ranch.																								Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry said in response that Bush had misplaced priorities in Iraq, spending billions of dollars on contracts to Halliburton Co. but not providing troops enough body armour and other protective gear.																								To ease the strain on the Reserves from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, Kerry said active-duty forces should temporarily be expanded by 40,000 troops.																								Tuesdays attacks killed at least 181 people in Iraqs bloodiest day since Saddam Husseins fall.																								Despite the latest delay of the constitution, Bush said members of the Iraqi Governing Council were making progress and having a free and open and spirited debate as they complete a new framework for governing their nation.																								The President touted plans that call for the election of a transitional national assembly by January 31, 2005.																								Later that year, Bush said, that assembly would draft a new constitution to be ratified by the Iraqi people. By the end of next year, the Iraqi people will elect a parliament and establish a government that is fully representative and truly free, Bush said.																								One of the terrorist leaders, a killer named Zarqawi, recently wrote to a senior al Qaida terrorist of his plan to tear Iraq apart with ethnic violence, to undermine Iraqi security forces, to demoralise our coalition, and to prevent the rise of a sovereign, democratic government. The killers strategy will fail, he added.Seal on Monday																								Iraqs interim constitution would be signed tomorrow without changes to the text and despite the reservations of the countrys foremost Shia cleric, Shia politicians said today. We will sign the interim constitution on Monday as it stands, Mohammed Hussein Bahr al-Uloum, the son and chief adviser to Mohammed Bahr al-Uloum, the current president of the Iraqi Governing Council, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, January 05, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Date with death																																	London, Jan. 4 (Reuters): Heavy metal rocker Ozzy Osbourne said he died twice after an accident on a quad bike that left him in a coma for eight days.																																	Osbournes life was saved by bodyguard Sam Ruston who went to his aid after the December 8 crash at the stars country estate in Buckinghamshire, southern England. If it wasnt for Sam I probably wouldnt be here, Osbourne told Britains Sunday Mirror newspaper. 																						He had to bring me back to life twice.																																	The former frontman of heavy metal band Black Sabbath said he had learnt a lesson from his brush with death. Ill never go near one of those damn bikes again...I am lucky to be here today and not paralysed, he said. 																													 																Detroit woes Detroit (Reuters): Detroit mayor Kwame  Kilpatrick committed something of a cardinal sin in the  motor city on Friday by blaming cars and trucks for Detroiters  bulging waistlines. Its probably something to do with  the culture, Kilpatrick told local journalists, when asked  about a report that Detroit had passed Houston to take the  title as Americas fattest city. Were not a walking city,  Kilpatrick said, adding this was because Detroit is the  automotive capital of the world. Detroits international  auto show, the industrys biggest yearly event and a celebration  of all things automotive, opens on Sunday. An annual list  of the 25 fattest US cities will appear in the February  issue of Mens Fitness magazine. 																													 																Baby blow																																	 New York (Reuters): A British couple who could face up to a year in jail after leaving their baby alone in a car parked outside a shopping mall said the incident was due to a cultural misunderstanding. Yisroel Singer, 26, said he was shocked to find police waiting to arrest him and his wife, Golda, in a New York parking lot on December 23 after they left six-month-old Rosie in the car to take daughters Rochel, 3, and Chaya, 2, to a bathroom. Under US law, the couple were charged with child endangerment, a class A misdemeanor. Parents in England who leave their child in a car probably would not end up in court, Singer said.

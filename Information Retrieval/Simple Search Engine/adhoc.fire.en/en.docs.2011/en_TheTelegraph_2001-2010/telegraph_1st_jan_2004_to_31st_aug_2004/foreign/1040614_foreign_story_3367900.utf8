 ELIZABETH DAYLondon, June 13: Scientists have developed what they claim is the mathematical formula for the perfect joke. 																								The equation they have formulated, x=(fl+no)/p, takes into account the length of the jokes build-up, the comedic value of the punchline and the groan-inducing qualities of puns.																								The best and worst jokes are awarded values on a sliding scale from zero to 200, with 200 being the funniest.																								A comedic value is determined by multiplying the funniness of the punchline (f) by the length of the build-up (). This is added to the amount someone falls over () to the power of  the Ouch factor of physical pain or social embarrassment. The total is then divided by the number of puns, which reduce laughter.																								The perfect joke would therefore score 10 for punchline and length and contain a high number of pratfalls or social embarrassments but no puns. So, many traditional gags, such as the doctor, doctor or knock, knock jokes that have short build-ups, no falling over and end in puns, score lowly.																								For instance: Doctor, doctor, I swallowed a bone. Are you choking? No, I really did, would be represented as x=(2 x 2 + 0)/2 with a measly score of two points. Shaggy dog stories, however, with lengthy build-ups, tend to score in the higher end of the spectrum.																								The formula has been developed by a neuroscientist and a comedian as part of a forthcoming science museum event that aims to prove the hypothesis that science can be funny.																								Helen Pilcher, the neuroscientist and science writer for Nature magazine who co-wrote the equation, said that good jokes could be written by following the formulas rules but that stand-up comics also needed a helping of natural talent.																								I think you can apply the formula when sitting down and writing gags, Pilcher said. Audiences respond well to well thought out jokes. However, for a stand-up comic to be truly funny, they need to incorporate a large degree of spontaneity into their act. Of course the formula cant teach someone to be relaxed and funny on stage but it does help when you need a prepared gag to fall back on.																								Timandra Harkness, the stand-up comedian who helped devise the equation, explained: It is common knowledge that the longer the build-up, the less funny the punchline needs to be. And vice versa, the funnier the punchline, the shorter the build-up needed to make a joke work. Logically, this means the funniest jokes of all will be those with lengthy build-ups and hilarious punchlines  and that is what the formula shows.																								The attempt to apply mathematical rules to humour, however, met with a mixed reception among comedians.																								Jimmy Carr, the television presenter, Perrier nominee and winner of the Royal Television Societys Best Stand-Up Comedian award 2003, called the formula total and utter nonsense. 																								Theyre having a laugh. Theres no way on earth you can come up with this kind of computerised formula for jokes. Its obviously been written by some geeky Blackadder fan who has got a little bit obsessed and needs to go away and calm down. You can only ever analyse jokes retrospectively, which is why scientists arent funny and why I am.																								Nicholas Parsons, the host of the Radio 4 panel show Just A Minute, who has written and acted in three one-man shows, agreed. The formula has obviously been thought up by somebody with no sense of humour. I do not see how you can computerise humour like this because there are so many different types of joke. For instance, how can you compare the wit of Oscar Wilde or Noel Coward with the humour of Johnny Vegas or Peter Kay?																								Bernard Manning, stand-up comedian, agreed: To make a joke funny you have to learn your delivery over the years. Im still crafting at 71 and I think its rubbish to suggest that you can come up with a formula like this. As far as Im concerned, theres no such thing as a perfect joke, except for Tony Blair.

 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Legal leash on UK rights
																								London, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Ten foreigners held without charge under Britains emergency post-September 11 anti-terrorism laws lost an appeal today against their detention in a ruling their lawyer said legitimises torture.																								With language that struck at the heart of the debate over how far governments can roll back human rights in the war on terror, Britains appeals court ruled against the men, some of whom have been held for nearly three years with no charge.																								Lord Justice John Laws, one of two judges on a three-member panel who voted to dismiss the appeals, said the sickening massacre of many hundreds of innocent persons in New York City on September 11, 2001 justified examining evidence that would be banned in criminal court.																								If (the state) limits the means by which the citizens are protected against the threat of terrorist outrage to the ordinary measures of the criminal law, it leaves a yawning gap, he said. 																								It exposes its people to the possibility of indiscriminate murder committed by extremists who, for want of evidence, could not be brought to book in the criminal courts.																								The suspects argued some of the secret evidence against them may have been obtained by the US through torture at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba or in Afghanistan. 																								Lawyer Gareth Peirce, who represented several detainees, said the judgment violated treaties against torture by allowing the government to use evidence obtained by mistreatment. 																								Its something that we would never have countenanced could even be discussed in a court and argued about: whether we can make use of evidence obtained through torture in the courts of this country, Peirce said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Supplies trickle into Kathmandu
				 	 A family of monkeys at a temple in Kathmandu. (AFP)																								Kathmandu, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Food and supplies were rolling into Kathmandu again after Maoist rebels lifted a week-long blockade that demonstrated their growing power in the impoverished Himalayan Kingdom .																								The capital city of 1.5 million people had only a few weeks of fuel and food supplies left after the blockade choked off supplies from the southern plains and neighbouring India.																								Thank God it is over. I was stranded because I cannot afford air travel to reach my home town, said Janak Karki, as he boarded a bus at the main terminal for his home in west Nepal.																								The Maoists, who unexpectedly lifted the blockade yesterday, gave the government a month to honour their demands to release jailed guerrillas and investigate the killing of comrades in what they say were fake gunbattles.																								This was in a sense a test case, which turned to be successful, said Padma Ratna Tuladhar, who brokered two previous rounds of talks.

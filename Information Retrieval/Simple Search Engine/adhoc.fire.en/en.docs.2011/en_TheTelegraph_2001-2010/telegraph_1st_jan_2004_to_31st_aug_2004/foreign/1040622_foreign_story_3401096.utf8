 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Iran seizes 3 British naval warships
				 	 Iran foreign ministry spokesman Hamis Reza Asefi																								Tehran, June 21 (Reuters): Iran seized three British naval vessels today that entered its territorial waters near the Iraqi border and arrested eight crew, Iranian officials said.																								While Tehran is deeply opposed to the US-led war and occupation of neighbouring Iraq, there has been little direct conflict up to now between Shi Iran and foreign forces along its western border.																								The incident is likely to place further strain on Tehrans ties with London which last week joined other European nations in condemning Iran for being less than fully cooperative with inspectors from the UNs nuclear watchdog.																								This morning three British vessels with eight crew entered the Islamic Republic of Irans waters and Irans naval forces, acting on their legal duty, confiscated the vessels and arrested the crew, foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said in a statement.																								The crew are under investigation in order to clarify the issue, he added.																								State media said the incident took place in the narrow Shatt al Arab waterway which separates southwestern Iran from Iraq.																								Britain confirmed today that eight of its military personnel were being held by Iran after they were captured in three small boats in the Shatt al-Arab waterway.																								We can confirm that eight Royal Navy personnel from the Royal Navy training team based in southern Iraq have been detained by the Iranian authorities while delivering a boat from Umm Qasr to Basra, Britains ministry of defence said in a statement.																								The ministry described as rubbish a report that the vessels were warships and said it didnt have any large vessels in the area.																								We are not talking about ships, we are not talking about warships, we are talking about small river patrol vessels, the spokesman said.																								A British diplomat in Tehran said the UK government was in close contact with Iranian authorities in Tehran and London.																								Irans state television said maps and weapons carried on the British vessels were confiscated.																								Revolutionary Guards spokesman Massoud Jazaeri said Iran was determined to defend its territorial integrity.																								Anyone from any nationality entering our waters will face the same response, Jazaeri said.																								Irans Revolutionary Guards, a branch of the armed forces charged with defending Irans Islamic revolution, earlier this month seized some eight fishing vessels from the United Arab Emirates in a tit-for-tat measure after the Emirates took an Iranian boat which had strayed into its waters.

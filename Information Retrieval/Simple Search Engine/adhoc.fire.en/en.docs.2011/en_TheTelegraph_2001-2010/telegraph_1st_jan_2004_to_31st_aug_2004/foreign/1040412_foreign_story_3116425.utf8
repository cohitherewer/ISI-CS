The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Echo of terror in Vatican
				 	 Pope John Paul at the mass. (AFP)																								Vatican City, April 11 (Reuters): Amid some of the tightest security ever seen at the Vatican, Pope John Paul issued an Easter condemnation of terrorism today and urged world leaders to bring peace to Iraq and other flashpoints.																								Speaking to tens of thousands of people in St Peters Square and millions of television viewers and radio listeners, he railed against a logic of death pervasive in the world.																								May (humanity) find the strength to face the inhuman, and unfortunately growing, phenomenon of terrorism, he said in his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message.																								The long shadow of the conflict in Iraq reached as far as St Peters Square this year with an Easter season that has been marked by unprecedented security for fear of an attack at the heart of Christianity or elsewhere in Italy. 																								Many more police  in uniform and plainclothes  were on hand than in the past to check people as they entered the Vatican area																								The Polish Pope, who afterwards wished the world a Happy Easter in 62 languages  including Arabic and Hebrew  painted one of the bleakest pictures of the world that he ever has in his 26 Easters as Roman Catholic leader.																								He said that the international community had its work cut out for it in trying to deal with conflicts and asked God to sustain world leaders in their efforts to resolve satisfactorily the continuing conflicts in Iraq, the Holy Land and Africa.

 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Terror charges
																								London, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Britain charged eight men today with conspiracy to murder and other terrorism charges, some of them relating to plans of US buildings that could have been used to organise attacks.																								The charges were brought two weeks after the suspects were captured in dramatic raids that followed alerts in the US and arrests in Pakistan.																								 Three were charged with possessing documents that could be useful to terrorists, including plans of buildings in New York, New Jersey and Washington DC that were the subject of the alerts earlier this month in the US.																								A ninth suspect was charged with possessing a weapon. Four others had earlier been released or charged with offences not related to terrorism. US officials have said the men include at least one senior figure in Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network.																								Police named the eight as Dhiren Barot, 32, Omar Abdur Rehman, 20, Mohammed Ui Haq, 25, Abdul Aziz Jalil, 31, Nadeem Tarmohammed, 26, Mohammed Naveed Bhatti, 24, Quaisir Shaffi, 25 and Junade Feroze, 28. Barot, Tarmohammed and Shaffi were charged with possessing documents useful to someone planning an act of terrorism.																								In the case of Barot, this included reconnaissance plans of the Prudential building in New Jersey, the stock exchange and Citigroup headquarters in New York, and IMF headquarters in Washington. The buildings were the subjects of an alert declared by the United States two days before the men were arrested.

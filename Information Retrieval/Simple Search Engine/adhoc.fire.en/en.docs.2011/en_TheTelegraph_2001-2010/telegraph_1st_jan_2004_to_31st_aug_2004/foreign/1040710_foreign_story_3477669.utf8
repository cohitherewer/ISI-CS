 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 World Court rules against Israel wall
																								The Hague, July 9 (Reuters): The World Court said Israels barrier in the West Bank should be torn down and called on the UN today to stop a project it said had illegally imposed hardship on thousands of Palestinians.																								In a non-binding opinion hailed by Palestinians and rejected by Israel, the court said the barrier violated international humanitarian law and could presage the annexation of territory occupied by the Jewish state in the 1967 West Asia war.																								The ruling could heighten Israels concern about sanctions although its key ally the US has vetoed Security Council resolutions against the Jewish state in the past. Washington dismissed the UN courts intervention and the American on the panel wrote a dissenting opinion. 																								The wall ... cannot be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order, said Judge Shi Jiuyong of China as he read out the ruling. The construction of such a wall accordingly constitutes breaches by Israel of its obligations under the applicable international humanitarian law.																								A senior adviser to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said as of today Israel should be viewed as an outlaw state. Israel dismissed the decision: It fails to address the essence of the problem and the very reason for building the fence  Palestinian terror, said foreign ministry spokesman Yoni Peled.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Madrid bombs rip through trains, kill 190
				 	 A gaping hole in the middle of a train after the Madrid explosions. (Reuters)																								Madrid, March 11 (Reuters): Simultaneous bomb blasts ripped through packed commuter trains at three stations in Madrid today, killing 190 people and injuring about 1,247 in Europes bloodiest attack for more than 15 years.																								There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the 10 rush-hour blasts three days before Spain votes in a general election, but Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznars government blamed the Basque separatist group ETA.																								Officials brushed aside suggestions Muslim militants angry at Spains support for the US-led war in Iraq could have been behind the bombs, which tore people including a baby to shreds, and left pools of blood on wrecked trains, tracks and buildings.																								It is absolutely clear that the terrorist organisation ETA was seeking an attack with wide repercussions, Spanish interior minister Angel Acebes told a hastily called news conference.																								US intelligence agencies said it was too early to decide who was behind the attack, but saw the hallmarks of both ETA and Osama bin Ladens al Qaida.																								There are characteristics of each. You have multiple attacks, multiple explosions in different locations in a short period of time which is very al Qaida-ish, said one US official. George W. Bush condemned the bombings and said the US stood with its war ally in the fight against terrorist organisations like the ETA.																								The train was cut open like a can of tuna... We didnt know who to treat first. There was a lot of blood, a lot of blood, said ambulance driver Enrique Sanchez, at Atocha station in central Madrid. Passenger Ana Maria Mayors voice cracked as she told reporters: I saw a baby torn to bits.																								The other blasts occurred at El Pozo station in southern Madrid and at Santa Eugenia in the southeast of the capital.																								Aznar called on Spaniards to take to the streets tomorrow in protest at the attack, and vowed the government would arrest the criminals behind it.																								ETA has killed around 850 people since 1968 in its fight for a separate Basque homeland in northwest Spain and southwest France, and has been branded a terrorist group by the US and the EU. Late last month, police arrested two suspected ETA members heading for Madrid with a van containing 500 kg of explosives.																								If the Basque group was responsible for todays bombings, it would be its deadliest attack, far exceeding the 21 people it killed in a supermarket blast in Barcelona in 1987. 																								It was the biggest death toll in an attack in Europe since December 1988, when a Pan American World Airways Boeing 747 crashed on the town of Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 aboard after a bomb on the plane exploded. 																								The Spanish government convened an emergency cabinet meeting and the ruling Popular Party suspended its election campaign, which had focused on a tougher stance against ETA.																								Some experts on ETA said the bombings did not fit the groups usual profile for attacks. ETA has frequently warned in advance of its attacks.

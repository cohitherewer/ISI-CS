 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Bush defers Palestine date
																								Cairo, May 8 (Reuters): President George W. Bush said establishing a Palestinian state by 2005 was no longer a realistic goal because of violence and changes in Palestinian leadership.																								Palestinian President Yasser Arafat rejected Bushs views and said creation of a state by 2005 was more than realistic.																								In an interview with Egypts semi-official al-Ahram daily published today, Bush said Washington remained committed to the road map for peace that calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state. However, he added: I think the timetable of 2005 is not as realistic as it was two years ago. Nevertheless, I do think we ought to push hard as fast as possible to get a state in place.																								I announced today (Thursday) that I will send a letter to Palestinian Prime Minister (Ahmed Qurie) saying that I am committed to the road map, Bush was quoted as saying in an Arabic translation of the interview.																								But he said changes in Palestinian leadership and violence in the region has affected the timetable for the plans full implementation.																								Well, 2005 may be hard... I readily concede the date has slipped some, primarily because violence sprung up... and (previous Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas) Abu Mazen was replaced, which changed the dynamic, al-Ahram quoted Bush as saying.																								Bushs comments came amid new anger in the Arab world over the US roles in Iraq, as details emerged about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Americans, and the West Asia peace process.																								Arafat, responding to Bushs comments to al-Ahram, said the 2005 goal was more than realistic because according to the signed agreements...our state should have been declared by 1998 or 1999. He did not elaborate.																								Last month Bush sparked criticism by saying Israel might be able to retain part of the occupied West Bank and Palestinian refugees should give up hope of regaining their homes in what is not Israel.																								Many Arabs accused the US of adopting Israeli policy and abandoning the road map for peace which it helped draft along with Russia, the European Union and the UN.

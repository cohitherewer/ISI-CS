(Reuters)																								Al Hoceima (Morocco), Feb. 25 (Reuters): Angry homeless survivors from an earthquake that killed nearly 600 people in northern Morocco blocked a main road today in protest at the lack of government aid to rebuild their shattered lives.																								Dozens of demonstrators staged a sit-in on the road linking the Mediterranean port city of Al Hoceima to the interior, interrupting all traffic.																								We spent the night under the rain, in the cold. We want this to stop, said Ahmed Mnabhi, 26 and unemployed. We want building material, bricks, cement, iron to rebuild our homes. Hopes dimmed of finding any more people alive in the rubble of mud-brick homes in villages around Al Hoceima.																								The death toll from Moroccos worst natural disaster in more than 40 years rose to at least 564, the health minister said.																								As dozens of aftershocks rippled across the poor mountainous region and rattled nerves, authorities feared the death toll could climb still higher when search-and-rescue teams reached hamlets far up the Rif mountains. 																								Mohamed Benhaddou, a man in his fifties taking part in the sit-in outside Al Hoceima, said aid was sorely missing. On TV, they say food, blankets are being delivered. Weve seen nothing of this relief aid. Grocery shops are closed (for fear of looting) so we cant even buy food, he said.																								In the nearby village of Im-Zouren, where many houses were flattened, survivors were also bitter. They brought us two tents that could accommodate maybe 20 people when there were more than 200 of us out there, said Abdelmajid Nachat, 47. We got no bread, no milk, no potatoes.																								Many people spent the night in the open or under sheeting and other makeshift shelters because their homes were destroyed. Most were home asleep when the quake, measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, struck early yesterday in an area of between 300,000 and 400,000 people. 																								Fatima Moussaoui, an elderly veiled woman, said she spent a bleak night in pouring rain with no drinking water. My daughter has broken legs, she got no treatment, she said.																								Disabled Khadija Ouhand, a one-legged middle-aged Berber woman, lost her husband and son in the quake. I rely on people here to take me to the toilets. What I want is food and medicine, she said.																								Mourad Boutssount, 12, stood outside the debris of what was his home. The three-storey building collapsed this morning and buried his father inside. He did not want to leave the house, he was afraid of looters, Mourad said, sobbing.																								The world community offered help. Former colonial power France was among the first countries to pledge aid, including rescue workers with sniffer dogs and clearance equipment. Algeria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and the US also offered humanitarian help.																								With local help stretched to cope with the scale of the disaster, international aid was welcome. Villagers, some digging with their bare hands or shovels to search for survivors, said heavy equipment, sniffer dogs and field hospitals were needed.																								The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched an appeal for 2.8 million Swiss francs ($2.25 million) to provide supplies including 1,500 tents, 30,000 blankets, 15,000 mattresses, as well as heaters and food.																								A Tunis-based IFRC official, Anne Leclerc, said France, Spain, Belgium and Germany had sent planes with heavy digging machinery.

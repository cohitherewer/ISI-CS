 															- Book on resurrection set to be bestseller 				 	 hunger for god: A scene from the film The Passion of the Christ																								Los Angeles, April 5 (Reuters): Seen the movie about Jesus death? Now read the book about his return.																								A novel about the return of Jesus is set to become one of the biggest selling books of the year in the US as Mel Gibsons controversial film about his crucifixion breaks domestic box office records. Glorious Appearing: The End of Days, written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, went to a second printing before it even hit the shelves on Tuesday, after booksellers snapped up the first 1.9 million copies.																								The book, the 12th in a series of novels, is a fictionalised drama about Jesus return to Earth. The series is based on LaHayes interpretation of the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, which is shared by many evangelical Christians.																								The first book in the so-called Left Behind series has been published in 34 languages and sold eight million copies. Sales of subsequent books in the series have ranged from two million to 4.6 million copies.																								Jenkins said the books success, combined with strong sales for works by religious leaders such as Pope John Paul and the Dalai Lama, indicated a strong interest in spiritual issues. Whether people admit it or not, there is a general God hunger. People are looking for something beyond themselves, Jenkins said.																								Jenkins, a well-known Christian author who co-wrote autobiographies of baseball greats Nolan Ryan and Orel Hershiser, writes the Left Behind books based on story outlines provided by LaHaye.																								LaHaye was the pastor of a church in San Diego for 25 years and has written more than 50 non fiction books on subjects ranging from biblical prophecy to a sex manual The Act of Marriage After 40: Making Love for Life. He was on the board of the Moral Majority, a conservative US Christian political action group, when it was launched by Jerry Falwell in 1979.																								Like Mel Gibsons movie The Passion of the Christ, which recently broke the US box office record for the highest grossing R-rated movie of all time, the books have sparked plenty of controversy.																								As the Left Behind series opens, Christians suddenly disappear in an event described in the book as The Rapture. The people who remain on Earth, or are left behind, experience a seven-year period of suffering before Christ returns to Earth.																								Glorious Appearing, the final book in the series, deals with the conclusion of the battle between believers in Jesus and the forces of the Antichrist in the Valley of Meggido (aka Armageddon) and culminates in the return of Jesus.

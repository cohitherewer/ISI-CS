SMS split Kuala Lumpur (Reuters): An intimate Valentines  Day text message nearly caused a Malaysian couple to split  when it landed on a wrong mobile phone number, a newspaper  reported on Sunday. A 27-year-old man and his wife of two  months were taking a romantic drive around a park in Seremban,  south off Kuala Lumpur, when his phone beeped just after  midnight, The Sunday Star said. He asked her to retrieve  the message, which read: Darling, I really miss you, always  thinking of you even when you are not here tonight beside  me in the bed, I am waiting, lots and kisses and hugs -  Jane. The wife demanded her husband stop the car, accused  him of infidelity and left for her parents home in a taxi.  She refused to take his calls and his father-in-law later  told him she would be filing for divorce. It took 12 frantic  hours before the sender of the message was traced. She called  the wife with an explanation, and the couple made up with  a hug in front of their families. Test case																													 																 Los Angeles (Reuters): Lawyers for salsa star Marc Anthony say a paternity test has cleared their client of claims that he fathered a two-month-old son by a Miami waitress but the womans attorney says Anthony may have cheated on the test. The paternity claims raised by Elizabeth Leyva prompted Anthonys wife, former Miss Universe Dayonara Torres, to file for divorce last month and demand alimony and child support for the couples two sons.																													 																Gay gaiety Mexico City (Reuters): Thousands of  gay couples and transsexuals in fancy dress packed into  a downtown Mexico City plaza on Saturday to call for legalisation  of same sex unions.

Organisers  behind what has become an annual Valentines Day rally for  gay rights in this heavily Catholic country said turnout  was higher than last year, when 2,400 couples tied the symbolic  knot. Ive been coming every year, said Andres Manuel,  dressed in a skin-tight cat suit painted as a business suit,  and black stilettos. Our biggest problem is the Church.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Marbeck pours fat into Loos fire 
				 	 David and Victoria Beckham in London on Monday. (AP) 																								Sydney, April 13 (Agencies): Sarah Marbeck, one of two women who have claimed to have had affairs with English soccers golden boy David Beckham, said today she had waited for him for two years after he told her he loved her.																								A media frenzy has descended on the England captain and Real Madrid midfielder since the News of the World printed lurid allegations by Marbeck and Beckhams former personal secretary Rebecca Loos. 																								In a statement issued through her Australian lawyer Marbeck said she had gone public with her story because for two years my life was on hold.																								Sleeping with David Beckham was a momentous day for me, not just a one-night stand, she was quoted as saying. I certainly didnt take our affair lightly, nor did he. This is probably the most famous father, family man and husband in the world. 																								He said he loved me and I slept with the phone by my bed waiting for it to ring, Marbeck said in the statement. I am not a celebrity seeker and I am not interested in extra fame, but I have found myself at the centre of a media storm and I am shocked by the intense level of public interest in my life, she said.																								Malaysian-born Marbeck, the 29-year-old daughter of a barrister, told the newspaper that she had an affair with Beckham from July 2001, two years after Beckhams marriage to former Spice Girl Victoria Adams.																								Marbeck claims she met Beckham in Singapore during a Manchester United tour. Finally, I accepted that my relationship with Beckham was over and I decided to move forward with my life. But in that time my life changed forever, and there is no way back for me, Marbeck said.																								Australian media descended on her parents home in the west Australian city of Perth after the allegations were printed. 																								But Sydneys Daily Telegraph published a story today quoting unnamed friends of Marbeck as saying she was obsessed with Beckham, describing her recent behaviour as erratic, and treating cautiously claims that she had slept with him. One told the paper that Marbeck, affectionately known as Kiki, had a snapshot taken with Beckham during a chance encounter with him at Singapore airport in 2001. She had claimed to have had sex with him hours later.																								She is doing it for the money, the paper quoted one pal as saying. She must be desperate for the attention. A Perth-based modelling agency, Viviens Modelling Management, meantime said Sarah Marbeck had been signed with it for a couple of years, but had not done any work for it for some time.																								Marbeck said she intends to remain in Australia and thanked her family for their support.																								I apologise if I have hurt or embarrassed my family, I know I am not perfect and have made some mistakes, she said. I am not proud of what I have done but there is more of my personal story to come in the News of the World next week, she said.																								The statement included a brief response from her mother, Elizabeth Marbeck. I was aware of Sarahs relationship with David Beckham and supported her decision to tell the public about it, she said.																								The allegations have reignited speculation about Beckhams five-year marriage with Posh Spice. The couple continue to dismiss these stories and they will not be commenting upon them further at this time, the Beckhams said in a statement on Sunday.

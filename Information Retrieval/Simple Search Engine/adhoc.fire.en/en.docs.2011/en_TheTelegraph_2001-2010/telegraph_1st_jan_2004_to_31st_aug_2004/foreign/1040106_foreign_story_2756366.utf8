 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Georgia leader faces uphill task
																								Tbilisi, Jan. 5 (Reuters): Mikhail Saakashvili, whose crushing win in Georgias presidential vote was beyond doubt today, faces an uphill struggle to reshape his small Caucasus nation plagued for years by separatism and poverty.																								As the central election commission slowly counted the votes to confirm Saakashvilis win, the US-educated lawyer was at a government residence, likely contemplating the first steps he would take after ousting veteran leader Eduard Shevardnadze.																								Widespread corruption and separatist conflicts since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 have battered Georgias economy and infrastructure and deterred investment. 																								Half of Georgias 4.5 million population live on less than $4 a day and state finances are bled white by a shadow economy accounting for 60 to 70 per cent of activity. Saakashvili says his focus will be on dragging the economy out of its perilous state by fighting corruption, encouraging foreign investment and forging closer ties with Western Europe and the US.																								The new leadership, ushered in after a rose revolution in November, won praise for the election from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the rights group. It said it was a welcome contrast to a November parliamentary poll which sparked mass protests against Shevardnadze.

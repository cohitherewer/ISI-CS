 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 300 trapped as ferry capsizes
Dhaka, May 23 (Reuters): A ferry carrying up to 300 people capsized during a storm early this morning with most of the passengers feared trapped inside, police said.																								The double-decker M.V. Lighting Sun was sailing to Dhaka on the Meghna river from the southern Madaripur area when it was swamped by a sudden storm near Chandpur, 170 km east of the capital.																								Police said eight bodies had been found so far. Villagers and fishermen in motor boats picked up at least 35 survivors and another seven were plucked from atop the hull of the upturned ferry, which was floating partly submerged in the river.																								Many of the passengers were believed to be asleep when the ferry overturned around 3.30 am local time.																								Gusty winds and occasional blasts of rain drove off the ill-equipped rescuers, who managed to cut a part of the ferrys hull to let the survivors out.																								Only seven people have crawled up and been taken to safety. But no one else showed up, said a Reuters TV cameraman on the scene. It seems impossible for the local rescuers to turn the ferry or pull it towards the shore, he said by telephone.																								It seems more people, dead or alive, are trapped inside.

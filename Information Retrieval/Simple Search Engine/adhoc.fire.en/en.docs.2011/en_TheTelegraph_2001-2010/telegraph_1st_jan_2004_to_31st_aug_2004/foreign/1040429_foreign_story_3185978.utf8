 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Jackson absent from Jones We Are the World sequel concert
Michael Jackson (From clockwise top left) Norah Jones, Alicia Keys, Natalie Cole and Angelina Jolie Los Angeles, April 28 (Reuters): Nearly 20 years after recording the ground-breaking charity album We Are the World, producer Quincy Jones is at it again  assembling an all-star ensemble concert to raise money for childrens centres in war-ravaged cities.																								We Are the Future will be held in Rome on May 16 at the Circus Maximus, site of the citys ancient chariot races.																								At a luncheon this month at his Bel Air, California, home, Jones said the four-and-a-half-hour concert to support his Global Forum will be unprecedented in its worldwide diversity, with L.L. Cool J, Alicia Keys, Norah Jones, Natalie Cole, Angelina Jolie, Andrea Bocelli, Oprah Winfrey, the cast of Stomp and artists from South Africa, Turkey, Pakistan and even Iraq.																								Apparently not invited is pop star Michael Jackson, although Jones declined to directly answer why. Jackson, a key figure in recording We Are the World, is currently charged with child molestation, with authorities holding his passport. Organisers expect that through sponsors, music and DVD sales, and charitable contributions, the concert will generate enough money to build six childrens centres in war-torn and impoverished cities and fund their annual costs.																								While organisers did not say how much they hoped to raise, they said each centre would cost about $1 million a year to operate. 																								The concert is sort of like Fourth of July fireworks to get attention for the project, said Stephen Commins, a top official with The World Bank who is helping organise the effort.																								Jones, who 50 years ago played trumpet with jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie, said he and Gillespie were international musical emissaries decades before the likes of Bono and Sting. both of whom may appear at the event. 																								Recalling how he and Gillespie managed to work their way through different countries with different languages, Jones said: It was because we knew all the same songs. It was an amazing feeling.																								Last year, Jones met West Asian peace advocates Hani Masri of Nablus and Uri Savir of Tel Aviv and agreed to work with them to find ways to not only care for children, but to teach them to grow up to create a more peaceful world.																								I dont think theres ever been more conflict in the world simultaneously, said Jones.																								Kigalis mayor, Theoneste Mutsindashyaka, the guest of honour at Jones luncheon, said thousands of kids, many of them street children, flocked to the new centres opening day to play football and basketball.																								Mutsindashyaka said workers at the centres will teach birth control, AIDS prevention, nutrition and perhaps most importantly, tolerance. For me, it will be a hope for our country and you can say never again. Genocide, never again, Mutsindashyaka said.																								Other such centres are planned in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and the Palestinian territories.																								Twenty years ago, Jones, now 71, got Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie to write We Are the World. The song was recorded by Jackson, Richie and 40 other performers including Bruce Springsteen, Tina Turner, Billy Joel and Ray Charles.																								The song won Grammys in 1985 for Song of the Year and Record of the Year, and raised more than $70 million to feed starving Africans, the World Banks Commins said.																								As caterers draped a lunch buffet across Jones pool table, actress Sharon Stone dropped in to express her interest. 																								Its always my desire to make sure that children all over the world have a safe place to eat, sleep and be, Stone said. And until thats done, I have to be a part of creating that.																								Noticeably absent from the project is Jackson. Jacksons best-selling albums were produced by Jones. Half of the memorabilia in Jones pool room are photos of Jackson or awards for the albums.																								Even Jacksons ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley is on a list of 34 acts that were invited but not yet confirmed.																								Jacksons donations to Africa have helped build hospitals and schools and develop child immunisation programmes. Last month, Jackson spoke in Washington about wanting to visit Africa later this year.																								Jacksons passport is being held by officials in Santa Barbara, California, where he faces trial on charges of molesting a young fan. But he could appear by satellite simulcast, as Sting and some other performers are expected to do.																								The first time Reuters asked Jones about Jackson, the producer ignored the question and moved on to other guests. The second time, Jones said: Im sure he would be interested in it. Then he changed the subject to the projects website, www.wearethefuture.com.

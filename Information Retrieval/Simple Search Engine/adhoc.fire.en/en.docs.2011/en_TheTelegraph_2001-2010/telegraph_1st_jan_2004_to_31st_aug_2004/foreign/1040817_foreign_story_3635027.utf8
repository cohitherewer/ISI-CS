 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 UK backlash booklet
																								London, Aug. 16 (Reuters): Britains nearly 2 million Muslims should prepare for a backlash of revenge attacks if terrorists strike on UK soil, Islamic leaders are warning in a booklet to be distributed nationwide.																								The pamphlet will also urge Muslims to be vigilant for any terror-related activity. 																								The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said today its booklet would advise mosques to install CCTV cameras, worshippers to be alert for suspect packages, and all Muslims to resist retaliating to any attacks on their faith. If, God forbid, a terrorist attack happened here, we know there are elements who would want to incite trouble against Muslims, said Inayat Bunglawala of the MCB, an umbrella body for over 400 Muslim groups, schools and mosques in Britain.																								Muslims should not be provoked by the likes of the far right and those who have an interest in creating strife. A draft copy of the booklet warns mosque officials and worshippers to regularly check their bins and look for any suspicious packages. It also calls on them to report any suspicions of terror-related activity to police. For Muslims, averting a terrorist attack that could harm any innocents is an imperative, the draft says. If you are aware of any suspected terror-related activity, then bring the information to the immediate attention of the police.																								British Muslims have reported increasing hostility and discrimination after the September 11 attacks on the US.																								Anti-terror raids on Muslim homes in Britain regularly make the headlines, while authorities and police have repeatedly warned that an attack is inevitable. Many fear Muslim disenchantment over the invasion of Iraq has helped militants recruit for their holy war against the West.

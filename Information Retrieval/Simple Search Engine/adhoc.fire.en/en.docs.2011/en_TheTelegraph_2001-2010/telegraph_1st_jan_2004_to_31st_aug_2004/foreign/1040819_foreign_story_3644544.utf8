 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Pak offers rewards for most-wanted terrorists
 IMTIAZ GUL 				 	 Pakistanis read newspapers carrying advertisements of the six most-wanted terrorists in Islamabad. (AFP)																								Islamabad, Aug 18: Pakistan today published pictures of six most-wanted terrorists and offered cash rewards for information leading to their arrests.																								In a three-column advertisement printed on the front page of two leading newspapers, the government said the identity of the informants would be kept secret and published two toll free numbers and e-mail addresses. 																								Five of the suspects are Pakistani  Mati-ur-Rahman, Mansoor, Qari Ehsan, Omar Aqdas and Amjad Hussain  and the sixth is a Libyan Abu Faraj al-Libbi. 																								A reward of two crore rupees each was offered for information leading to the arrest of Amjad Hussain and Abu Faraj, both suspected of involvement in two assassination attempts on President Pervez Musharraf in December, last year. 																								Amjad Husaain alias Amjad Farooqi, from the radical Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami group, has also been linked to the 2002 murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl.																								The sum of one crore rupees was offered for information leading to the arrest of Mati-ur-Rehman, alias Samad.																								Intelligence officials say he is an activist in the outlawed Lashkar-e-Jhangvi group behind sectarian violence and attacks on westerners and Christians and with known links to al Qaida.																								The equivalent of around 50 lakh rupees was offered for information on Mansoor, alias Chota Ibrahim, Qari Ehsan, alias Shahid and Omar Aqdas, alias Sohail.																								The head money has been raised ten fold after it almost became evident that these Pakistanis are linked to al Qaida, intelligence officials said. 																								The six terrorists have been at large ever since the security agencies began the hunt for them over two years ago in the wake of a series of sectarian-related acts of terror in the country. 																								Security forces, in recent operations, have captured about 30 al Qaida suspects including Tanzanian-born Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani and a Pakistani computer engineer Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan. 																								Security forces raided a religious seminary and its hostel in Islamabad today. However, they failed to arrest any suspected militant. A central mosque known as Lal Masjid was raided twice to arrest the cleric of the mosque for alleged links with the al Qaida network. A meeting of clerics here today condemned the raids on mosques and seminaries and blamed Musharraf for toeing Washingtons anti-Islam policy.

 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 Iran reformists pass poll law
																								Tehran, Jan. 25 (Reuters): Iranian MPs voted to change the countrys electoral law today, in a clear act of defiance of a conservative watchdog that has banned thousands of candidates from running in Februarys parliamentary election.																								The hardline Guardian Council has barred nearly half of the 8,200 aspiring candidates from the February 20 poll, mainly allies of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, including 80 of the standing 290 MPs.																								The proposed reform to the electoral law says candidates given the green light in previous elections cannot be blocked unless a full legal justification is submitted. This would save the candidacies of many disqualified MPs. But before it can become law, the electoral reform passed by the reformist-dominated parliament must be approved by the Guardian Council  the very body that issued the disqualifications.

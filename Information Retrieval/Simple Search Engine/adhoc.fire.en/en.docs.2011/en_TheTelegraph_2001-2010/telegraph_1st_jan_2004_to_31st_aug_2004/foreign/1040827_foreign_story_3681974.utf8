The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Bush Olympic ad draws flak
																								Athens, Aug. 26 (Reuters): The US Olympic Committee has asked the campaign to re-elect President George W. Bush to pull an ad that refers to the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee said today.																								The ad has angered Olympic officials because they feel it hijacks the Olympic brand  a registered trademark  even though it does not display the Games logo.																								The television advertisement, ahead of the presidential elections in November, does not feature the five Olympic rings  one of the worlds most recognisable images  but an announcer tells viewers that at this Olympics there will be two more free nations, referring to the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq under Bushs presidency.																								The IOC said no official request had been made for use of the reference to the Games.

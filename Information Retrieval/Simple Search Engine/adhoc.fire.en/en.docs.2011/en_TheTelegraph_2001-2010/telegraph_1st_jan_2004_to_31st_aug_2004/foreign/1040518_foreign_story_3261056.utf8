 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Police foil gold heist at Heathrow
																								London, May 17 (Reuters): Armed police arrested seven men today after foiling an attempted gold heist at Heathrow airport that would have been one of Britains biggest-ever robberies.																								The men smashed a van through steel shutters into a warehouse and threatened staff with guns and knives in a bid to steal 40 million in gold bullion and cash. But more than 100 police officers were lying in wait after a tip-off.																								In preventing this attack, we have foiled what would have been one of the biggest robberies ever committed in the UK, said detective superintendent Barry Phillips, from Scotland Yards Flying Squad that headed the operation. Police fired special rounds, used to deflate tyres, to disable the gangs van. 																								It is clear that a lot of planning and preparation went into the attack but the flying squad was one step ahead of the team for some time, Phillips added.																								Six men were arrested at the warehouse but two escaped by forcing a worker to drive them away in a hijacked van. 																								One of the men has since been arrested.

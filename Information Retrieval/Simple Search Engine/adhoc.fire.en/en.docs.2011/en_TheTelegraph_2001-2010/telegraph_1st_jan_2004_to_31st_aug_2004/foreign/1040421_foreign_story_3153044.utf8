 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 Abdullah rebuffs Bush over Israel
STEVEN R. WEISMAN King Abdullah Washington, April 20: King Abdullah of Jordan dealt a rebuff to President Bush yesterday, abruptly putting off his visit to Washington scheduled for later this week. Jordanian officials said the visit had become impossible in light of Bushs recent support for Israels territorial claims in the West Bank.A statement from Jordan said the king, who was in California yesterday and went home rather than to Washington, would not meet Bush this week as planned.It said the meeting would wait until discussions and deliberations are concluded with officials in the American administration to clarify the American position on the peace process and the final situation in the Palestinian territories, especially in light of the latest statements by officials in the American administration.A Jordanian official said the statement, in deliberately cool tones, was meant to send a message of displeasure.For their part, administration officials said that the visit had to be put off because of developments in the region and that it would be rescheduled for May.Jordanian officials made clear that King Abdullah, who was in California meeting with technology and entertainment industry figures, had been irked by Bushs declarations in his meeting last week with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and would therefore bypass Washington.After his meeting with Sharon a week ago, Bush broke with American policy and supported Israels ultimate retention of some settlements in the West Bank and also rejected the longtime Palestinian demand for a right of return to family homes abandoned in 1948 in what is now Israel.The Jordanian statement followed by a week a protest by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. The problems with Egypt and Jordan came as the administration faced another round of difficulties in its plans for Iraq, especially after the abrupt announcement by Spain that it would quickly withdraw its forces there in the face of a deteriorating security situation.Honduras announced last night that it would withdraw its 370 troops, which have been operating in Iraq as part of the Spanish contingent. Administration officials also said that Poland faced a decision on whether to renew its commitment to keep troops in Iraq, and that it was far from clear whether it would renew its pledge. The Polish commitment is to expire in September. Poland has 2,460 troops in Iraq.Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian issue, an Egyptian official said that Mubarak and his aides had been talking with American officials for several weeks about the possibility of an American endorsement of Israeli aspirations, and that each time the Egyptians had made their opposition clear. Mubarak described himself as shocked by Bushs statements in his meeting with Sharon, although Egyptian officials said he had been apprised of the statements when he met Bush in Texas before the Sharon visit.Administration officials said that despite their difficulties with Egypt and Jordan, they still expected both nations to try to help with security in the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank, from which Israeli forces and settlers are to be withdrawn under Sharons plan.A Jordanian statement said King Abdullah is looking towards a common plan with the international community to support the Palestinians, but offered no further details.But an Egyptian official said whatever Egypt hoped to do in the Gaza Strip would now be much more difficult in light of Bushs statements last week.The Jordanian foreign minister, Marwan Muasher, was due to confer with administration officials to try to clarify the situation.

 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Kerry struggles to lose elitist tag with voters
 ALEC RUSSELLDemocratic presidential candidate John Kerry plays baseball at the Hanscom Air Base in Boston, Massachusetts. (AFP)																								Washington, July 24: The Democrats presidential challenger returned to his birthplace yesterday seeking to give an answer to a key question hanging over his campaign: who exactly is Senator John Kerry?																								With polls showing him neck -and-neck with President George W. Bush, he is in a better position at this stage of the race than any challenger since Ronald Reagan in 1980. He has also raised more money than any challenger in history and with his resume as a Vietnam War hero cannot easily be tarred with that old Democratic label of soft on defence.																								John Kerry has a reputation as an awkward patrician. A series of polls yesterday suggested that more than half of Americans are not happy with the way the country is going. Senior Republicans concede Kerry is a serious threat, an unthinkable admission a few months ago and a reflection of how Bush has been weakened by months of bad news from Iraq.																								Yet a lingering concern dogs his staff. Despite a multi-million-dollar advertising campaign, polls suggest more than a third of Americans do not know who he is beyond that he is a senator from Massachusetts  a state with dangerously liberal connotations for heartland folk.																								As even his closest fans admit, he is not a natural campaigner. Despite months of coaching, he still often fits his caricature as an awkward patrician. And in a close race  Florida, one of the three key states, is a dead heat in the latest poll  everything counts.																								What this hall needs is a little energy, he bellowed the other day as he opened an address to the teachers union, before joking about his lack of sex appeal in comparison with his telegenic running mate, Senator John Edwards.																								Delighted delegates said this was his most convincing performance to date. He has become more forceful. He is definitely getting better at playing the crowds, said Rita Victor, a teacher from New Jersey, for whom Kerry was the third choice for the Democratic nomination. He was aloof. But hes warmer now. Hes learned.																								But his style still smacked more of the Yale debating chamber where he honed his oratorical skills than the Middle American living rooms where the race will be won.																								And not all in the audience were convinced. I just dont think I know him, said an intern on his campaign, looking on as he pumped his fists in the air. I am just not sure.																								Democrats say it is unfair to label him elitist. They point to his record as something of an outsider in his smart New England private schools where, as the son of a diplomat, he was a relative pauper compared with his super-rich classmates.																								But given his maternal bloodline stretching back to the first settlers and his second wifes fortune  Teresa Heinz Kerry is one of Americas wealthiest women  that will be a hard argument to push home.

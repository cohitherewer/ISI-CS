 - Cities rival reach for the skies
 SIMON SCOTT PLUMMER  Taipeis 101 Building  (left) and the Jin Mao Tower in Shanghai 																								Taipei, April 4: Soaring towers are a potent symbol of a citys claim to modernity. So it is little surprise that three of the five tallest buildings in the world are in China or, to be precise, in three distinct Chinese political entities: Taiwan, the Peoples Republic, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.																								The architectural race for the skies demonstrates the rivalry between the great cities of Taipei, Shanghai and Hong Kong. 																								It is partly financial  a desire to prove which system has the most vibrant economy  but it is also political, with the Peoples Republic desperate to show the world that its brand of one-party state will conquer all.																								Topping the list of tall structures is the 101 Building in eastern Taipei, named because of the number of its storeys. At 1,670ft, it is an emblem of Taiwans success in creating a world-class economy, then transforming its political system from a Leninist one-party state into a democracy. As such, it should stand as a beacon to the Chinese world. 																								Sadly, things are not as simple as that. Rejecting Taiwans de facto statehood, Beijing regards it as a renegade province to be reunified, by force if necessary.																								The Taiwanese may be ever more involved economically in the mainland but, having freed themselves from the Leninism of the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang  which ruled Taiwan with an iron grip for three decades  they have no desire to embrace the Chinese Communist Partys version of it.																								But what evidence is there of Leninism in China? a visitor to Shanghai might ask. The forests of towering buildings on each bank of the Huangpu river seem to betoken raw capitalism released at last from the bonds of the command economy. 																								Two things testify to its cheeky challenge to the rest of the world.																								The first is the second of the towers, the Jin Mao, standing defiantly at 1,380ft across the Huangpu from the Bund, the main thoroughfare in the days when the city was divided into foreign concessions. 																								On the 53rd floor is the lobby of a luxury hotel from where one looks up nearly 500ft through an atrium with golden walls.																								The second is the worlds first commercial magnetic levitation railway. It is an astonishing ride, taking passengers to the airport in seven minutes. 																								The citys great rival is Hong Kong, the former British colony where the IFC Tower rises 1,361ft from the waterfront of the island. Officials in each city refer politely to the complementarity of the two and they are right in that each serves a distinct hinterland. 																								In the words of one diplomat, as a financial hub; Hong Kong can play London, an international centre, to Shanghais New York, where domestic stocks are largely traded.																								Each of the soaring towers symbolises success but the relationship between the entities where they stand is at best uncertain. If their rivalry came to China invading Taiwan, it could destabilise East Asia.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

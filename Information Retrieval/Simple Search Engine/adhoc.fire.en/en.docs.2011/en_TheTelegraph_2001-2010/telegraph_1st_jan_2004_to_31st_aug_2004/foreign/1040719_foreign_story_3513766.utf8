 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 American air strike in Iraq kills 12
																								Falluja, July 18 (Reuters): US forces launched an air strike on suspected guerrillas allied to al Qaida in Falluja today, and local doctors said at least 12 people were killed.																								The US army said in a statement that Iraqs interim government had authorised a strike against a known terrorist fighting position in southern Falluja. The point is we didnt just strike off on our own, visiting US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage told a news conference with Iraqi foreign minister Hoshiyar Zebari.																								The US military said about 25 fighters loyal to Jordanian militant Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi were in the area just before the attack. The suspected al Qaida allys organisation claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings yesterday, including one that just missed killing Iraqs justice minister.																								The air strike, at around 2200 GMT yesterday, destroyed defensive fighting positions and trench lines near the remains of a house and a foreign fighter checkpoint, the US military said.																								Doctor Ahmed Ghanem said at least 12 people were killed, including women and children.																								Armitage said he had discussed Iraqs security woes with interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. He is the most senior US official to visit since the handover of sovereignty on June 28.																								A key issue in the handover was the role the new government would play in overseeing the 160,000 mostly US troops in Iraq and notably in authorising strikes such as that in Falluja.Sadr paper																								Iraqs interim government has ordered the mouthpiece newspaper of radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to be allowed to reopen, lifting a US-imposed ban that helped trigger an uprising.																								Because of his belief in freedom of the press, Prime Minister Iyad Allawi has ordered the reopening of the al-Hawza newspaper, a statement from his office said today. It gave no further details.

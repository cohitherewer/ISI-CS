 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Nepal rebels kill 29 in telecom tower strike
Kathmandu, March 3 (Reuters): Hundreds of Maoist rebels stormed a telecommunications tower in eastern Nepal, killing 29 soldiers in their biggest offensive since peace talks with the government collapsed in August, the military said.																								Army spokesman Colonel Deepak Gurung said troops killed 10 guerrillas after yesterdays attack in Bhojpur district, a stronghold of the rebels who are fighting to replace Nepals monarchy with a communist state.																								They bombed the telephone tower and destroyed it, Gurung said today, adding that communications in the area had been snapped after the attack in Himalayan foothills 500 km east of Kathmandu.																								Another army official said more than 1,000 rebels, armed with automatic weapons and bombs, wanted to capture the district capital but were repelled by soldiers. At least 10 troops were missing after the clash that also left 23 people wounded. Violence has surged in Nepal since the guerrillas walked out of peace talks after the government refused to compromise on the future of the monarchy.																								Officials say about 1,700 people, most of them rebels, have been killed since August, taking to more than 8,900 the total deaths since the revolt began in 1996. Gurung said the rebels also bombed the office of the district administrator and the local branch of a state-owned bank causing minor damage to the buildings.																								But they could not take away valuables or cash from the bank, Gurung said.																								There was no comment from the rebels, whose revolt has crippled Nepals tourism-dependent economy, scared away investors and threatened the stability of the kingdom, wedged between Asian giants, China and India. The rebels ran away after an army helicopter with night vision facilities began aerial patrol, one official said.																								The rebels have been blamed for a string of small bomb attacks in Kathmandu in recent days. Nepal has been in turmoil since King Gyanendra, who ascended to the throne in 2001, fired an elected Prime Minister the following year.

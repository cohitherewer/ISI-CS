 DAVID RENNIE				 	 A Humvee after it was attacked in Falluja. (Reuters)																								Washington, April 28: Armoured cars being sent to Iraq are not up to the job, according to a senior US army general, prompting calls for Pentagon chiefs to swallow their pride and reactivate thousands of mothballed Vietnam-era armoured personnel carriers.																								With improvised bombs, rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades taking an ever deadlier toll on coalition forces, the Pentagon is spending 225 million to replace thin-skinned versions of the Humvee, the US militarys ubiquitous jeep-like transport, with an up-armoured model, as fast as they can be churned off the production line.																								Commanders have shuddered as troops attached home-made armour plating and even sandbags to ordinary Humvees, whose thin skin, canvas doors and shoulder height windows have made them highly vulnerable to attack. The new, armour-plated Humvees have been touted by Pentagon chiefs as the best solution to complaints from the field about the standard version of the vehicle.																								But General Larry Ellis, the commanding general of US army forces, told his superiors that even the armoured Humvee is proving ineffective.																								In a memo leaked to CNN television, he wrote: Commanders in the field are reporting to me that the up-armoured Humvee is not providing the solution the army hoped to achieve.																								Reports from the field say that even with armour plating, the Humvees rubber tyres can be burnt out by a Molotov cocktail, while at two tons, it is light enough to be turned over by a mob.																								General Ellis said it was imperative that the Pentagon instead accelerate production of the newest armoured personnel carrier, the Stryker, which weighs 19 tons and moves at high speed on eight rubber tyres.																								But the Stryker has many influential critics who say it is too big to be flown easily on the militarys C-130 transport aircraft, and too cumbersome to manoeuvre in narrow streets. Instead, they want the Pentagon to turn back the clock and re-deploy thousands of Vietnam-era M-113 Gavin armoured personnel carriers, which are still used by support and engineering units, and are held in huge numbers by reserve units.																								Gary Motsek, the deputy director of support operations for US army materiel command, said: I have roughly 700 113-series vehicles sitting pre-positioned in Kuwait, though some are in need of repairs. I have them available right now, if they want them.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

Khan has not suffered heart attack, Pakistan foreign office spokesman Masood Khan said when asked to comment on the report in The Dawn newspaper. 																								Asked if the scientist, who has admitted selling nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea, was under house arrest, the spokesman said: Strict security restriction have been imposed on him. 																								To a question whether the scientist was facing some medical problem, Khan said: He is fine and besides this I dont know his medical history. 																								The Dawn, quoting officials at the hospital, said Khan is under treatment at his residence and his condition is stated to be critical. It said in view of his poor cardiac condition, a heart specialist along with a cardiac machine was secretly sent to the nuclear scientists residence. However, Abdul Qadeer Khans doctor today said that the disgraced scientist is suffering from acute hypertension, high blood pressure, depression and sleeplessness.																								Speaking amid reports that Khan had suffered a heart attack, Dr Shafiqur Rehman said he last visited the scientist at his residence in the last week of January when he found him in poor health.																								 He has a history of hypertension and I had been visiting him regularly until I was stopped by the authorities on February 4 after the last visit, the doctor said.																								Rehman said he was unaware whether Khan had suffered a heart attack. The doctor said he had learnt that a nurse was attending to Khan at his home.																								Last week I asked the authorities to allow me to check up Khan in the presence of a magistrate but my request was refused, Rehman added.

 																											- Al Qaida behind raid on BBC team, says Saudi diplomat				 	 Gardner																								Riyadh, June 7 (Reuters): A statement purportedly from al Qaida militants in Saudi Arabia warned today of new attacks on US and western airlines, as a Saudi diplomat said the militant group was behind an attack that killed a BBC cameraman.																								All compounds, bases and means of transport, especially western and American airlines, will be a direct target for our coming operations in the near future, said the statement, posted on a pro-al Qaida site on the Internet. It asked Muslims to keep away from Americans and other westerners to avoid falling victim to an attack by the Islamic militant network led by Saudi-born Osama bin Laden.																								Saudi forces hunted today for gunmen who shot dead Irish cameraman Simon Cumbers, 36, and critically wounded BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, 42 in a Riyadh area known as a militant stronghold.																								Yesterdays attack, the fourth in five weeks on westerners in a kingdom battling al Qaida militants, heightened security fears among the tens of thousands of expatriates in the worlds largest oil exporter.																								We also warn security forces and guards of Crusader (western) compounds and American bases and all those who stand with America, its agents... and the tyrants of the Saudi government, and urge them to repent, said the statement, signed by al Qaidas Organisation in the Arabian Peninsula. The BBC said Gardner, who suffered wounds mainly to the abdomen, was in a stable condition after extensive surgery overnight.																								It is the same fanatical group. They are linked to al Qaeda, Jamal Khashoggi, the media adviser to Prince Turki al-Faisal, Saudi ambassador in London, said, referring to a recent string of attacks.																								It was an easy job for these militants because they had spent some time in the area. I believe it was an opportunistic strike, Khashoggi said. These militants want to send a message that the kingdom is not safe for westerners. 																								The attack came a week after al Qaida militants killed 22 people, 19 of them foreigners, in a shooting and hostage-taking spree in the oil city of Khobar. 																								British Ambassador Sherard Cowper-Coles also said the BBC team, who were with a Saudi information ministry guide, appeared to be victims of an opportunist rather than organised attack. 																								Prince Turki al-Faisal, Saudi Arabias ambassador to the UK, said militants were going after individuals and soft targets because a security clampdown had made it hard for them to organise major attacks. But despite the assurances, the attacks rattled westerners. Its frightening. We are seeing them (militants) carrying out more attacks. I dont see it ending, one westerner said.

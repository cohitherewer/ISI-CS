San Francisco, May 6 (Reuters): The former head of a US military police unit at Baghdads Abu Ghraib prison is under investigation following charges he secretly photographed naked female US soldiers as they showered, officials have said.																								Captain Leo Merck, 32, a member of the California National Guard who commanded the 124-strong 870th Military Police Company, is under US Army investigation and has been relieved of duty, they said.																								Three of our soldiers were in the shower. If you just walked by the shower you could see their ankles, said Lieutenant Michael Drayton, who took over command of the unit after Merck was removed in November. My understanding is that he was taking pictures. One of the soldiers noticed the flash.																								Merck, a veteran of the first Gulf War who worked as a financial analyst before going to Iraq, is suspected of snapping the photographs in November. The incident is the latest embarrassment for the US occupying force in Iraq.																								Merck, who is married and resides in Fremont, California, a suburb of San Francisco, is at an undisclosed location under US Army control. Drayton said Merck was taken to Kuwait. The US Army justice system is working its wheels, California National Guard spokesman Andrew Hughan said.																								The Contra Costa Times, which broke the story yesterday, quoted Spc. Myrna Hernandez, 26, as saying she saw Merck photograph her as she was showering with two other women. I saw a guy get on all fours with a digital camera in his hands. His head was going under the wall, and we made eye contact, she told the newspaper. I was in shock, like what do I do now?																								Merck enlisted in the National Guard in 1989 and has received decorations and service medals. He was a very quiet guy, Drayton said. Hes an accountant and he fits the stereotype  very timid, non-talkative.

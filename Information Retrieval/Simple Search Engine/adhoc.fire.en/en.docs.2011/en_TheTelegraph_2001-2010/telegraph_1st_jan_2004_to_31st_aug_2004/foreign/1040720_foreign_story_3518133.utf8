 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 50 students abducted for Maoist campaign
				 	 Government spokesman Mohammad Mohsin announces the abduction of the students in Kathmandu. (Reuters)																								Chaimale (Nepal), July 19 (Reuters): Maoist guerrillas have abducted at least 50 students and a dozen teachers from a school near the Nepali capital to try to force them to back a campaign against the constitutional monarchy, officials said today.																								The rebels dragged the children, aged between 13 and 16, and their teachers at gunpoint from the school in Chaimale village yesterday afternoon, police officer Deepak Ranjit said.																								In the past the Maoists have kidnapped school and university students from the countryside, but have sent them back after one or two days of indoctrination, analysts said.																								Villagers in hilly Chaimale, south of Kathmandu, said about nine heavily-armed guerrillas entered the two-storey school building and took away students and teachers. Most of the kidnapped students were girls.																								They dragged my child in front of my eyes and I couldnt do anything to stop them. He was crying to be rescued, said Arjun Acharya, father of one of the kidnapped children.																								Yesterdays kidnapping of school children was the first in the Kathmandu valley. Soldiers have been deployed to secure the release of the hostages, Ranjit said. The guerrillas have heavily mined the mountainous road leading to Chaimale and its surrounding areas, making it difficult for the troops to advance and intensify their search operations. In the past the rebels, seeking to set up a communist republic in Nepal, have ordered village families to send one child each to join their armed struggle.

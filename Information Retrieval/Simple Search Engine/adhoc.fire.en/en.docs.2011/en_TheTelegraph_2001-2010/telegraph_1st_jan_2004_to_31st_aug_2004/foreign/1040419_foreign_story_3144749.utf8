				 	 Einstein 																								Cape Canaveral, April 18 (Reuters): Almost a century after Albert Einstein began writing about relativity, Nasa is poised to launch a mission 45 years in the making to put a little known tenet of his general relativity theory to its first test.																								The Gravity Probe B satellite is the bland name given to one of the most precise scientific instruments ever built. 																								But the projects $700 million price-tag adds glamour, as does its long history, surviving the Congressional budget axe seven times.																								Lift-off of the Boeing Co. Delta 2 rocket carrying the probe is scheduled for tomorrow at 1700 GMT from the rocket range at Californias Vandenberg Air Force Base.																								With four near-perfect spheres  the roundest objects ever made, according to Nasa  the probe will try to show whether the Earth, which is known to warp both time and space with its mass, also twists them like tornado winds as it rotates.																								That was Einsteins prediction in his theory of general relativity. He had already, in 1905, answered many of the most important questions about mass, energy and the speed of light with his theory of special relativity.																								By 1915, he was applying those insights to time and space. His theories showed how massive objects  planets, stars, black holes  warp time and space, slowing down clocks and sucking nearby objects toward them. 																								That is why an apple falls from a tree and speeding planets do not escape the sun.																								Einstein also argued that the space-time continuum was twisted and dragged by the spinning of massive objects, an effect known as frame dragging.																								Weve seen two of the three aspects of warped space-time. Weve seen the warping of space and the warping of time. We have never seen, in any clean way, the dragging of space into motion, said Kip Thorne, who holds the Richard Feynman chair in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.																								Scientists at Stanford University began discussing the idea of using a satellite to test this theory in 1959, just one year after the US launched its first satellite. Nasa signed on and funded the project in 1964.																								This test of relativity is very simple in concept, but when you get down to the technology of how to do it, its a testimony to perseverance to say the least, said Stanford professor Brad Parkinson, who heads the engineering team.																								To an astronaut orbiting the Earth, the effect is undetectable, but Einsteins theory says that a small bit of space is actually lost as space is spun around on itself.

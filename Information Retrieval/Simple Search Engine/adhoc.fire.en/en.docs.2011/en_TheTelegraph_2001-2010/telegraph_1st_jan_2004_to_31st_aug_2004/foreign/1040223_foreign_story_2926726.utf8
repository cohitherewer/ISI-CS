Tehran, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Eight people died in clashes with police in two towns in southern Iran over disputed results for a parliamentary election in which Islamic conservatives secured a big victory over reformists, local officials said today.																								Final figures for the vote, which was boycotted by leading reformists after hundreds of candidates were barred from standing, showed a record low turnout of 50.6 per cent of Irans 46 million eligible voters, the interior ministry said.																								A faction with the minimum backing of the people is going to take control of parliament, said Mostafa Tajzadeh, a senior member of the pro-reform Islamic Iran Participation Front.																								Irans clerical establishment hailed the election as a great success and boasted that the turnout shocked doomsayers and enemies abroad who had predicted a much smaller vote.																								Analysts said many people stayed away from the polls as much out of frustration with President Mohammad Khatamis failure to deliver promised social, political and economic reforms as due to a boycott by his reformist allies.																								Four people, including a policeman, died in clashes yesterday in Firouzabad in the southern Fars province after the governors office declared an unexpectedly high turnout in a tight race between a reformist and an Islamic conservative candidate, a local official said.																								Another four were killed yesterday in the southwestern Khuzestan province when police clashed with a group of people protesting election results in the town of Izeh, the ISNA students news agency reported, citing an unnamed official.																								Post election disputes are not uncommon in Iran but they rarely lead to deaths. Voting in most of the country passed off peacefully and there were no major allegations of vote-rigging.																								The 50.6 per cent turnout was well below the 67 per cent who voted in 2000 parliamentary elections. It also was the lowest in a parliamentary vote since the 1979 Islamic revolution.																								Turnout in the capital Tehran was around 29 per cent, an interior ministry spokesperson said. 																								In Tehran province, which includes outlying towns and cities, it was 33 per cent.																								Iran dismissed today US criticism of its elections as a bid by Washington to undermine its democracy. The American government, from the beginning, was not very happy to see elections, or to see democracy institutionalised here, said foreign ministry spokesperson Hamid Reza Asefi.																								Interior ministry figures showed conservatives, hostile to President Mohammad Khatamis liberal reforms, made up 124 of the 194 members elected so far. A total of 289 seats were at stake.																								A conservative majority could end Khatamis seven-year experiment in allowing greater freedom of speech and loosening social restrictions in the oil-rich state of 66 million.

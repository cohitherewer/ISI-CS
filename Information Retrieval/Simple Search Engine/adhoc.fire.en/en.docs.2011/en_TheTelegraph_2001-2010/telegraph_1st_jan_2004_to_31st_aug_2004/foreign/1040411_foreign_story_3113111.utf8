The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Violence hits Taipei rally
																								Taipei, April 10 (Reuters): Thousands of Taiwanese demonstrators protesting last months election results clashed with riot police today outside the barbed wire barrier protecting newly-elected President Chen Shui-bians office.																								The clash happened after more than 100,000 protesters marched in Taipei to demand an independent inquiry into an election-eve assassination attempt on the new President, which Opposition supporters suspect was staged to win sympathy votes.																								In the worst violence since last months fiercely contested poll, about 2,000 protesters used a large scaffold as a battering ram and tried to charge through the iron barriers and barbed wire that protects Chens office.																								Water cannon and about 8,000 helmeted policemen wielding full-length shields and batons forced the protesters back, although no one appeared seriously injured so far.																								Chen Shui-bian step down! We want the truth! Go democracy! the protesters shouted as they threw tables, chairs and bottles in the third major protest since Chen narrowly defeated Nationalist leader Lien Chan in the March 20 elections.																								Earlier in the day, Lien led a peaceful rally demanding an independent inquiry into the shooting in which Chen was lightly wounded. The President has rejected demands for an inquiry, so Nationalists are calling for a referendum on the issue.																								In the last three weeks, Mr Chen Shui-bian has shied away from, avoided and ignored the peoples demands, Lien told a sea of supporters waving flags and tooting horns in the afternoon.																								This is not a long-term strategy. You cannot forever hide behind the iron barriers and barbed wire, he said to Chen.																								Police estimated about 120,000 people at the rally, double the number at last weekends event but less than the 500,000 who took to the streets on March 27 in Taiwans largest protest.																								The crowd began to break up after Lien left, when the violence started.

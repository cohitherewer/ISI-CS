 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Musharraf urges US to respect Iraq holy sites
																								Islamabad, Aug. 20 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terror, has urged America to respect the sanctity of Muslim holy sites in Iraq and to avoid civilian casualties.																								Musharraf telephoned the commander-in-chief of the US central command General John Abizaid tonight to express concern about the sites, particularly the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf, Pakistans official APP news agency reported.																								The President expressed the hope that all possible steps would be taken by the troops present in Iraq to ensure care and sanctity of the holy sites and necessary measures would be taken to avoid casualties to innocent civilians, it said.																								APP said Musharraf also underlined the importance of the restoration of peace and stability in Iraq for its people as well as the entire region.																								The report was issued after US warplanes pounded positions overnight around the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf, where forces of radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr have holed up during a two-week rebellion that has killed hundreds.																								While Musharraf has been a staunch ally of the United States in its battle against al Qaida and its allies since 2001, he has so far ruled out sending Pakistani troops to Iraq.

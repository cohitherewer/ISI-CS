 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Pak tribal chief remains defiant
																								Islamabad, April 9 (Reuters): A notorious tribesman wanted by Pakistan for harbouring foreign militants from al Qaida and the ousted Afghan Taliban regime has said he had no plans to give himself up, a local newspaper reported today.																								The government has given leaders in the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) bordering Afghanistan until April 20 to hand over foreign fighters and local tribesmen sheltering them, or to come up with an alternative plan.																								Senior elders gathered in the western town of Wana today to decide how to respond to the ultimatum, which Islamabad hopes will pave the way for a political solution after dozens of soldiers were killed in fierce clashes in the region last month.																								But comments from Nek Mohammad, a tribal commander involved in those clashes and believed to be sheltering al Qaida guerrillas, suggested more fighting loomed.																								We are still in this area. Where else can we go? Mohammad told the News daily, after contacting the newspaper from an undisclosed location.																								Mahmood Shah, FATAs security chief, said Mohammad was the most wanted among Pakistani tribesmen who have close military and family ties to foreign fighters from Arab countries, Central Asia, China and Russias breakaway region of Chechnya. The links go back more than 20 years, when Pakistan was used as a launching post for attacks on Soviet forces in neighbouring Afghanistan.																								Pakistan was also the main backer of the Afghan Taliban regime, toppled from power in late 2001, before Islamabad abandoned the militia after the September 11 attacks on the United States. 																								The Taliban had sheltered al Qaida in Afghanistan.																								Pakistan has come under increasing pressure to hunt down foreign fighters, including senior al Qaida members, in its tribal areas, where around 50,000 troops are now deployed.																								A major battle between 5,000 soldiers and hundreds of militants and tribesmen raged near Wana last month, during which more than 100 people were killed in 12 days of heavy fighting in South Waziristan. No top al Qaida figures were found.																								Initially officials believed Ayman al-Zawahri, al Qaida chief Osama bin Ladens deputy, may be in the area. Then suspicion turned to Tahir Yuldashev, a renowned Uzbek al Qaida fighter also wanted in Uzbekistan for attacks there. Mohammad told the News he did not know of Yuldashevs whereabouts.																								Shah said that senior tribal maliks, or elders, had gathered in the South Waziristan town of Wana, some 380 km southwest of Islamabad, today ahead of formal deliberations over the weekend aimed at ending the crisis.

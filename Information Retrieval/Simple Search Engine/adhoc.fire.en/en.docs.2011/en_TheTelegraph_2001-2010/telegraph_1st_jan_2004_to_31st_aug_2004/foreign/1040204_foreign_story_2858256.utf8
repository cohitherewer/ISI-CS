				 	 A Chinese shopper looks at chickens at a market in Guangzhou, China. (Reuters)																								Singapore, Feb. 3 (Reuters): A deadly strain of bird flu killed a seven-year-old boy in Thailand today and spread to Indonesia as officials across the region scrambled to limit damage to Asias huge tourism sector.																								China, which has the worlds largest population of poultry, said the potentially lethal H5N1 strain had been detected in poultry in teeming Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong. 																								Three other regions on the mainland have also reported the strain, the only form of the avian influenza virus known to have killed humans.																								The death of seven-year-old Virat Phraphong from the major chicken farming province of Suphanburi in Thailand takes the death toll from the disease to 13. He had pneumonia for a month before he was transferred to and put on a respirator at the Childrens Hospital in Bangkok last month, his doctor said.																								Despite cases of bird flu in 10 countries across Asia, only some have reported the H5N1 strain and the virus has leaped to humans only in Thailand and Vietnam. Four people have died in Thailand and nine in Vietnam. Indonesia, the worlds fourth most populous nation, said today it had detected the H5N1 strain in poultry.																								The identification process indicates the virus H5N1 in poultry...but so far there is no case among humans, Tri Satya Putri Naipospos, director of animal health at the agriculture ministry, said.																								Indonesias poultry industry, estimated to be worth about 60 trillion rupiah ($7.2 billion) annually, has seen costs from the outbreak run to about 7.7 trillion rupiah.																								To stave off the threat to Asian tourism, officials meeting in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, weighed strategies such as joint marketing campaigns, fewer curbs on travel and discounts on air travel and hotel stays. The bird flu outbreak comes a year after Sars devastated Asian economies. 																								Im expecting that maybe bird flu will cause the number of tourists coming to Asia to decline a bit, said Shin Hyun Taek, South Korean vice minister for tourism. Sars clipped 10 per cent off Korean tourist arrivals last year, from 5.35 million.

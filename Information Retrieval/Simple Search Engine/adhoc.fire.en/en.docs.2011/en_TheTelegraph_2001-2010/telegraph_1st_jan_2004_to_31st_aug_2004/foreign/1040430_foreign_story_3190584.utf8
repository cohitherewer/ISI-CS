 NIGEL BUNYAN																								London, April 29: A ward sister tried to murder four of her elderly patients in a ruthless drive to free hospital beds, a court was told yesterday.																								Barbara Salisbury, 47, crossed the line between humane nursing and callous dispatch, it was claimed.																								She gave a 76-year-old man an excess of diamorphine, telling him as she did so: Give in. Its time to go. On another occasion she instructed a nurse treating a 92-year-old: Lay him flat. With any luck his lungs will fill with water and hell die.																								She justified her administering of diamorphine to an 88-year-old woman at Leighton Hospital, Crewe, Cheshire, with the observation: Why delay the inevitable?																								Robin Spencer, QC, prosecuting at Chester Crown Court, said: Barbara Salisbury arrogated to herself the right to decide when patients should die, and attempted by her actions to shorten what remained of their lives. If she thought a patient had no hope of recovery she didnt want to have to wait too long. If a patient could be made well enough she would aim for that. If not, she would hasten death.																								With Salisbury sitting in the dock a few yards from her husband, Derek, and one of the couples two daughters, Spencer said it was difficult to fathom her motive. 																								One explanation is a downright cruel streak, he said. Another is a desire for control. She seems to have been motivated by a drive for ruthless efficiency to free up a hospital bed.																								He added: No one would wish to see an elderly relative suffer unnecessarily as death approaches. But equally, no nurse has the right actively to hasten death. Easing the passage from life to death is one thing; deliberately accelerating death or attempting to do so is quite another.																								Spencer alleged that Salisbury, who had worked at hospitals in Peterborough, Cambs, and Kings Lynn, Norfolk, before moving to Leighton in 1993, made little or no secret of what she was doing. Eventually some of the junior staff on her ward felt compelled to speak out.																								All of Salisburys alleged victims were elderly patients whose days or even hours were numbered. For all, the prospect of recovery was poor or non-existent. For some, death was imminent.																								Spencer said the trial was not about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia. Barbara Salisbury does not suggest that she was putting these old people out of their misery. Her defence is far more fundamental: the allegations are quite simply untrue. 																								The trial continues.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

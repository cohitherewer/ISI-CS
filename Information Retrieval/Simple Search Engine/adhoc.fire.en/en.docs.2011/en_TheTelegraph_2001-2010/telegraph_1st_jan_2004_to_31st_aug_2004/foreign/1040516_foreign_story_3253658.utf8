																								Kathmandu, May 15 (Reuters): Maoist guerrillas stormed a luxury tourist hotel in west Nepal and then exploded a bomb, damaging the building but hurting no one, police said today.																								About 150 people, including Indians and other foreigners, were in the Fishtail Lodge, owned by the royal family, in Nepals second city of Pokhara, 200 km west of Kathmandu, at the time. All guests and the staff rushed out before the explosion, a police spokesman said.																								Always crowded with tourists, Pokhara is the gateway to some of the most popular trekking and mountaineering destinations in Nepal, including Mount Annapurna. The attack came hours after soldiers killed a regional Maoist leader.

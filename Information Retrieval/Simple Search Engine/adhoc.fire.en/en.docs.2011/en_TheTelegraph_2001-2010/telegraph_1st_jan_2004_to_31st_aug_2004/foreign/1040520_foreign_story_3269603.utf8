 DAVID DERBYSHIRE				 	 Brad Pitt (left) and Jennifer AnistonLondon, May 19: Manufactured celebrity smiles are making young people needlessly paranoid about the state of their teeth, according to research.																								The gleaming grins of Hollywood stars such as Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt and Sandra Bullock are partly to blame for unrealistic expectations in people with healthy gums and teeth, a leading dentist said yesterday.																								Prof. Jimmy Steele, from Newcastle Universitys school of dental sciences, said dentists were increasingly being asked to provide cosmetic treatments such as bleaching, tooth veneers and straightening. They are often under pressure to perform small miracles as the line between healthcare and cosmetic treatment becomes blurred, he said.																								There are very few celebrities who dont have a perfect smile these days, he said. You just have to open some of the glossy magazines to see pictures of famous people with perfect, unblemished teeth, and features about cosmetic procedures such as bleaching.																								His comments followed a study published in the journal Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology which analysed results from quality of life surveys of about 7,000 people in Britain and Australia. Adults were asked for their perception of the health of their teeth and gums, and how it affected their daily lives.																								Prof. Steele and colleagues from the University of Adelaide found that losing teeth in old age inevitably made a big impact on quality of life. But once this was taken into account, people over the age of 70 actually had the least worries about the health of their teeth. The most anxious age range were the 30- to 49-year-olds, followed by those aged 30 and under.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

Eight people were killed in the violent protests that followed the clerics assassination. (Reuters)																								Karachi, May 30: Pakistans commercial centre plunged into chaos today following the assassination of a pro-Taliban Pakistani cleric who had started changing his hardline stand.																								At least eight assailants opened fire on Mufti Nizamuddin Shamzai the moment he emerged from his residence in Karachi, along with his son and a couple of armed guards, witnesses said.																								One of Shamzais sons confirmed that the cleric succumbed to his injuries shortly after arriving at the hospital.																								Shamzais son, nephew and driver were also injured in the attack, but the assailants managed to flee. 																								One of the attackers was wounded in the exchange of fire and we are now searching for him, police officials said. 																								Violence broke out after the killing with angry Shamzai followers pelting stones at cars, and damaging traffic signals. 																								Protesters also attacked a fast-food restaurant, a fuel station, a bank and set the local police station on fire.																								Shamzai, who headed the Jamiat-ul Uloom-e-Islamiya group, had been a staunch supporter of the Taliban and other pan-Islamist anti-American forces opposed to Israeli rule in Palestinian territories.																								The firebrand cleric had issued a decree in the late 1990s saying Muslims are in a state of war with America and killing pro-Israel Americans is justified.																								He also called for a jihad or holy war against America shortly before the US-led coalition attacked Afghanistan in October 2001, which toppled the Taliban regime within two months.																								Two of Shamzais sons fought alongside the radical militia in 2001 and managed to escape back to Pakistan after thousands of Taliban fighters were trapped in Afghanistans Kunduz province.																								As the head of a delegation of Pakistani clerics to Kandahar, southwestern Afghanistan, Shamzai had also made a futile attempt to persuade Taliban supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar, to hand over Osama bin Laden, in September 2001, to prevent the American-led invasion of Afghanistan.																								But lately, Shamzai, an ethnic Pashtun born in the Swat town of Pakistans NorthWestern Frontier Province (NWFP), signaled a shift in his hard-line approach when he started appearing in talk shows on state-run Pakistan Television.																								In these programmes, he defended the religious institutions, arguing that they did not just impart religious education, but students are taught subjects like science, mathematics and social studies as well. Mufti Nizamuddin ShamzaiShamzais seminary was one of the many religious institutions in Pakistan, which served as a nursery to groom the radical Taliban and its followers.																								Observers fear that the assasination may also trigger Shia-Sunni violence in Karachi, a hotbed of sectarian and ethnic violence, with scores of religious and political groups declaiming each other. Shamzai was known for his anti-Shia sentiments.																								Qazi Hussein, the head of the Jamaat-e-Islami group, termed Shamzais murder as martyrdom at the hands of anti-Islamic powers. 																								Speaking on telephone from Turkey, he said the killing was an attempt to create a rift between Shias and Sunnis.																								The provincial government has ordered an immediate inquiry into the incident and offered a reward of two million Pakistani rupees ($35,000) for information about the killers. 																								Interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat condemned the incident and said extra forces have been deployed ahead of the burial after sunset, which is expected to draw thousands of Shamzai followers from all over the country.

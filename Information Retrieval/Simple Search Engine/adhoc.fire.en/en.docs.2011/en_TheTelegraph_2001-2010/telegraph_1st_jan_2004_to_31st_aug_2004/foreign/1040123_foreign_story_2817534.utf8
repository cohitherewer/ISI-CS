 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Bush starts campaign with economy pledge
																								Mesa (Arizona), Jan. 22 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush, facing election-year Democratic attacks on his handling of the economy, said yesterday that US growth is strong but industrial states like Ohio still face troubled times.																								Starting a two-day tour to highlight themes in his State of the Union address, Bush unveiled a plan for $500 million in new spending on education and job training.																								Amid an intensifying race among Democrats to challenge him for his re-election, the President visited Ohio and Arizona to tout a jobs-related message and was due to travel to New Mexico to discuss national security.																								Polls show the economy may be a weak spot for Bush. Nationwide, this economy is strong, Bush told an audience of faculty and students at Owens Community College near Toledo.																								But he added: I fully recognise, in Ohio there are still troubled times. The manufacturing here is sluggish at best, and, therefore, people are looking for work.																								 Faced with fierce competition from abroad, factories nationwide have shed 2.6 million jobs since Bush took office in early 2001. The manufacturing sector has not seen a net gain in jobs since mid-2000.																								People who could rely upon a steady job in the manufacturing sector are hoping to be able to realise their hopes by finding work elsewhere, Bush said.																								Later at Mesa Community College in Arizona, the President said a rapidly changing economy meant some workers had been left behind, creating a need for training programmes.																								Bush played the role of a talk-show host, asking questions of people at the school.																								One student, Stacey Leedom, who is a single mother of a 7-year-old daughter, told of pursuing a Mesa Community College degree to switch from her former job in graphic design to a prosperous new career in high technology. Being a single mom is the toughest job in America. Being a single mom who needs more education and has the desire to do so is doubly tough, Bush said. Yours is a wonderful story.																								Bush said his proposals would allow more of such re-training. They include $250 million to create partnerships between community colleges and employers for training in certain high demand job sectors.

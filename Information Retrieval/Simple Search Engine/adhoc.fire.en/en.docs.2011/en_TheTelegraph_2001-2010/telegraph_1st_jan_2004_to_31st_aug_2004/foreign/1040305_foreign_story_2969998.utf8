 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Straw praise for Pervez
																								Islamabad, March 4 (Reuters): British foreign secretary Jack Straw heaped praise on Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf today for his determination in the war on terror and for reopening peace talks with India.																								Speaking after talks with Musharraf in Rawalpindi, Straw also said Britain was satisfied with steps Pakistan had taken so far to prevent a repeat of a scandal over sales of nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea. Straw said he had full and thorough discussions with Musharraf on non-proliferation after Pakistans top nuclear scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted last month to leaking secrets abroad. Straw declined to give details, but said: Whats important is that we learn the lessons from what has happened and take action to ensure that there isnt such similar proliferation in the future.																								Referring to the decision to pardon Khan after his admission, Straw said this was a matter for the Pakistani authorities. But I am satisfied with the progress the Pakistani authorities are making.

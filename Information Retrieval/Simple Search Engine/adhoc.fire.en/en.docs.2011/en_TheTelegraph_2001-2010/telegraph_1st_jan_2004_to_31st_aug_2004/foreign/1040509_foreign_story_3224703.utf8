 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Nepal parties wary of king
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Nepalese demonstrators in Kathmandu on Saturday. (AFP) 																								Kathmandu, May 8: Surya Bahadur Thapas resignation as Prime Minister may have come as a shot in the arm for the parties fighting to restore democracy in Nepal, but questions are being raised on whether the king will give back the powers he had taken away unconstitutionally from the executive.																								Sources close to the palace said King Gyanendra wanted to replace Thapa with someone who had a clean image. The five-party alliance, however, feels the king wants to bypass them and run the country with another puppet government.																								The alliance, with its two main parties  the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist)  has held talks to plan its next step if the king extends an invitation for consultations. 																								We want restoration of democracy, Nepali Congress leader Chakra Bastola said. The other key player, Sher Bahadur Deuba, a former Prime Minister and Nepali Congress (democratic) leader, also had consultations with his party. The parties are also trying to arrive at a consensus on the prime ministerial candidate. But even if they set aside their differences, the question remains whether their nominee will be appointed by the king and will be able to work with some independence.																								Political observers believe that as long as article 127 of the constitution, which allow the king to intervene and take away most of the executives powers, remain, a permanent solution cannot be reached.																								There are only two ways this article can be withdrawn  either by parliament or by a fresh decree of the king stating that he is returning the powers to the democratic forces. 																								There is no possibility of the parliament being revived now and there is little to suggest the king will issue a royal decree giving back the powers. The only likely way out is by giving a timeframe by which elections can be held. Once a new parliament is formed, it can withdraw article 127. 																								The king can show he is sincere in his efforts to end the crisis by inviting leaders of the alliance  as they had the maximum number of elected representatives in the last Parliament  and ask them to name their candidate for the Prime Ministers post.																								For this, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party (UML) will have to come to an understanding. Earlier, the Congress had agreed to propose Madhav Nepals name, but now party chief G.P. Koirala is keen to become Prime Minister himself. A consensus may elude the alliance.																								Deuba, who is also an aspirant, may back Nepals candidature to spite Koirala as he knows it will be difficult for him to get the support of the parties and the king.

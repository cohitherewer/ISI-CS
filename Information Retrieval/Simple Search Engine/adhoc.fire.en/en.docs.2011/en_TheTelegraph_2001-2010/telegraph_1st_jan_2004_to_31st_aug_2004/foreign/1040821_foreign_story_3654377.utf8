(AFP)																								Islamabad, Aug. 20 (Reuters): Pakistans leading human rights group has expressed concern about the death in custody of an Islamic cleric suspected of links to al Qaida and reports that he was tortured.																								Qari Mohammad Noor was arrested with three associates last week in a raid on an madarsa, in Faisalabad.																								Faisalabad police said he was brought to a hospital on Wednesday where he died of heart failure. But intelligence officials and hardline Islamic groups said Noor died after he was tortured and television pictures showed bruising on his body.																								The death of Qari Noor Mohammad and reports that there were marks of torture on his body are a cause of grave concern, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said in a statement received today.																								It is not the first incident of torture in custody, it said.																								The rights group said the failure of authorities to abide by the law when dealing with militant suspects was uncivilised and could only produce negative results.

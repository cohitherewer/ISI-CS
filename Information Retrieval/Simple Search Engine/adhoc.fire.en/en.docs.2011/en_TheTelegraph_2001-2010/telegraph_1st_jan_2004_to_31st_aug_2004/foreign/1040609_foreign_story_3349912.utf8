 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Torture memo
																								Washington, June 8: In August 2002, the justice department advised the White House that torturing al Qaida terrorists in captivity abroad may be justified, and that international laws against torture may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations conducted in President Bushs war on terrorism, according to a newly obtained memo.																								If a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity, he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the US by the al Qaida terrorist network, said the memo, from the justice departments office of legal counsel, written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance. It added that arguments centreing on necessity and self-defence could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability later.																								The memo seems to counter the pre-September 11, 2001, assumption that US government personnel would never be permitted to torture captives. It was offered after the CIA began detaining and interrogating suspected al Qaida leaders in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the wake of the attacks, according to government officials. The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo, which covered treatment of al Qaida detainees in CIA custody, was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the defence departments detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At that time, defence secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the legal issues associated with interrogation techniques. 					 LOS ANGELES TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

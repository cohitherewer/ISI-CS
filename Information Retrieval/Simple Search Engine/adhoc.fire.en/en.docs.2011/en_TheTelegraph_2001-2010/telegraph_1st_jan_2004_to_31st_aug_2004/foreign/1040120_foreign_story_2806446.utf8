 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Tigers warn of threat to truce
																								Colombo, Jan. 19 (Reuters): The Tamil Tigers warned today that a political fight between Sri Lankas President and Prime Minister threatened a ceasefire that has held for two years, the longest period of peace on the island in two decades.																								It was the strongest statement yet from the rebels since a power struggle between President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe burst into public in November, stalling efforts to restart direct peace talks.																								The government apparatus that should take forward the peace process with commitment and sufficient strength is in shambles, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) political wing leader S. P. Thamilselvan told a meeting of aid donors.

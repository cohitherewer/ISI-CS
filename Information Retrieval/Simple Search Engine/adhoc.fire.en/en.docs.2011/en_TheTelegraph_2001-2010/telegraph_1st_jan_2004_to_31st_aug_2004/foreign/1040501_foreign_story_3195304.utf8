 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Jackson pleads not guilty
				 	 Michael Jackson arrives at the courthouse in Santa Maria, California on Friday. (Reuters)																								Santa Maria (California), April 30 (Reuters): The stakes were dramatically raised in the Michael Jackson child molestation case today as the singer was charged with new counts of conspiracy to commit child abduction, extortion and false imprisonment in addition to lewd acts.																								Jackson, 45, sombrely dressed and appearing low-key and serious in contrast to his January court appearance, pleaded innocent to 10 counts handed down by a grand jury earlier this month that heard witness testimony behind closed doors.																								Details of the testimony have been kept secret and Santa Barbara county superior court judge Rodney Melville said he would not release details of the new charges or grand jury transcripts to protect the identity of the alleged victim and ensure a fair trial for Jackson.																								No trial date was set for Jackson, who was greeted by hundreds of fans as he arrived early at the courthouse in Santa Maria, near his Neverland ranch. Michael, God and we know you are 100 per cent innocent, read a sign. Innocent until proved innocent, read another banner.																								Jacksons lawyer, Thomas Mesereau, hired less than a week ago because Jackson felt his two former high-profile attorneys were not paying him sufficient attention, was unable to comment on details of the case because of a gag order on both prosecution and defence.																								The charges are restricted, as were earlier ones filed in January, to one child under the age of 14. But the prosecution raised the stakes against the entertainer by adding a charge of conspiracy involving child abduction, false imprisonment and extortion to those filed in January of lewd acts against a child under the age of 14 and plying him with liquor. Jackson has previously called the charges a big lie.

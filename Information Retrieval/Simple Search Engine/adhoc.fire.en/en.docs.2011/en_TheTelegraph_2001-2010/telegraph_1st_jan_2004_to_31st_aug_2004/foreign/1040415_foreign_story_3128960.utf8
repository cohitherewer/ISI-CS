Bush bets job on Iraq outcome

(AFP) 																								Washington, April 14 (Reuters): President George W. Bush said he would stake his re-election on a successful outcome in Iraq at a rare prime-time news conference last night where he said more US troops might be needed to stop the violence and transfer power to Iraqis.																								Bush appeared before millions of Americans from the White House East Room to answer rising public concerns over his Iraq policy with April emerging as the deadliest month for the US in Iraq, with more than 80 US troops killed, since Saddam Hussein was toppled a year ago.																								Bush acknowledged there have been tough weeks in Iraq and said voters may decide to change in November and thats democracy, but that he did not think they would. Many of Bushs fellow Republicans fear spiraling violence in Iraq could cost him the election as he competes in a tight race with Democrat John Kerry for the White House in November.																								I dont plan on losing my job. I plan on telling the American people that Ive got a plan to win the war on terror and I believe theyll stay with me. They understand the stakes, he said.																								As for the investigation into the September 11, 2001, attacks, Bush said there were some things that might have helped prevent them. The commission investigating the attacks levelled stinging criticism at the US justice department and FBI for failing to meet the growing threat of the al Qaida militant network blamed for the attacks.																								There are some things I wish wed have done, he said. He mentioned the post-9/11 Patriot Act that some Democrats say has infringed on US civil rights.																								Given a chance to apologise on behalf of the US government to the 9/11 victims like former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke did, Bush would not. Im sick when I think about the death that took place that day, he said. The person responsible for the attacks was Osama bin Laden.																								Bush, speaking for more than an hour, gave a stay-the-course message, condemned a power-grab by these extreme and ruthless elements and said US forces were allowed to use decisive force to maintain order. Some moderate Iraqis have expressed concern at the deadly tactics used to fight Sunnis and Shias on separate fronts.																								He ruled out any delay in a June 30 deadline for a transfer of sovereignty to a still-undefined interim Iraqi government. Some politicians fear June 30 is too soon given the volatile security situation and want a delay.

 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Differences bog down Korea talks
				 	 US assistant secretary of state James Kelly in Beijing. (AFP)																								Beijing, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Six-way talks on the North Korean nuclear crisis were bogged down by differences, difficulties and contradictions, but host China held out hopes today for a joint statement to help end the 16-month-old stalemate.																								Late on third day of discussions in Beijing, senior negotiators from China, the US, the two Koreas, Japan and Russia struggled to hammer out the wording of the statement and agree on when another round of talks should be held.																								North Korea again accused the US of hindering progress by pressing the same demands it had at a first round of talks in August, and a North Korean embassy official said it has tried to show flexibility and sincerity.																								The US and Japan rejected a draft prepared by China because it did not contain a line on a complete, verifiable and irreversible end to North Koreas nuclear programmes.																								Precisely because there are some differences, difficulties and contradictions, it is necessary to continue with the talks process, a Chinese foreign ministry statement quoted delegation head Wang Yi as saying.																								Japanese and South Korean diplomats said the talks would close tomorrow at 0300 GMT, with the Japanese diplomat adding that the six parties would try to produce a joint statement.																								South Koreas Yonhap news agency, quoting media sources, said a draft statement would be presented tomorrow morning.																								It includes a tentative agreement among the parties to establish a working group of officials to negotiate an end to the nuclear crisis and supply energy aid to North Korea, it said.																								A senior official involved in the talks, while declining to comment on the content of the draft statement, said that it would be reported to the capitals overnight and may be adopted in tomorrows morning session.																								Host China also said there was hope for a final document.																								Right now, the parties are in the process of carrying out intensive consultations on a document, so the hope still exists, foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said. If there is not a document, we should not say the talks were a failure.There was no sign the North admitted having a uranium enrichment programme that is the crux of the crisis. North Korea has a plutonium programme centred on a small reactor at Yongbyon.

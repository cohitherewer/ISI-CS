 Wednesday, May 19, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																More eggs for tycoon																																	Moscow, May 18 (Reuters): A $100 million spending spree would satisfy most people.																																	But Russian business tycoon Viktor Vekselberg, who splashed out at least this amount for a glittering collection of rare Faberge Imperial Easter Eggs so that he could return them to Russia, wants to shop some more.																																	Exuding opulence with their gold, platinum, diamond and rubies, the distinctive eggs  between seven and 30 cm tall  made their first appearance in Russia for many decades on Tuesday when they went on display at Moscows Kremlin. Their owner, the 47-year-old oil and metals magnate, is planning to buy more of the many valuable works of art and national treasures that left Russia when the Tsars were overthrown and communism took over in 1917. We want to find, acquire and return to our homeland objects of Russian culture and art, Vladimir Voronchenko, chairman of Vekselbergs non-profit foundation that was set up when he bought the eggs, told journalists. We are planning today to complete two other interesting acquisitions. In terms of their socio-cultural and historical meaning, I think they will be even more interesting than the first step taken in acquiring the Faberge collection.

 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 James Bond is still the best 
 CHRIS HASTINGS				 	 Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in Die Another Day 																								London, Feb. 22: James Bond has been named the worlds most popular film hero ahead of modern rivals such as Batman, Indiana Jones and Harry Potter.																								A study of box office figures compiled by Variety, the entertainment magazine, places Britains favourite agent in pole position ahead of franchises including Star Wars, Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings. Bonds on-screen adventures, renowned for their stunning special effects and bevies of beautiful women, have now taken more than 2.46 billion at the box office  500 million more than his nearest rival.																								Ian Flemings most famous creation, who has been played by five different actors in 20 films, made it to the silver screen 15 years before Star Wars, the second-longest-running fantasy franchise. But not even his worst on-screen enemies could put down his success to longevity. Indeed, his box office lead over Star Wars, his nearest rival, grows considerably when figures are adjusted to take inflation into account. Thunderball, released in 1965, grossed more than 76.7 million at the box office. At todays rate of inflation, that would be worth more than 429 million. 																								The Bond series has suffered several lulls but have recently gone from strength to strength, with each new film taking at least 26.8 million more at the box office than its predecessor. By contrast, rival franchises have struggled to maintain their position. 																								Jane Seymour, who played Solitaire in Live and Let Die in 1973, puts Bonds success down to the fact that he is debonair. She added: He has a very dark side but his Britishness lets him get away with murder.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

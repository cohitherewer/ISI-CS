 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Shakespeare silences guns in warring Rio slum
																								Rio de Janeiro, June 9 (Reuters): Shakespeare silenced the guns in a no mans land separating two warring Rio de Janeiro gangs last night as residents of nearby slums watched Brazilian TV stars perform a play about love in time of war.																								Actors and an audience of about 1,000 were greeted with a deafening welcome of firecrackers set off by the local Third Command drug gang shortly into the premiere of Antony and Cleopatra in a concrete, open-sided school sports hall.																								Ever since a deadly shootout at a soccer match two decades ago, mobsters from the Third Command in the Parada de Lucas slum have feuded with the Red Command gang from neighboring Vigario Geral, separated by a street known locally as the Gaza Strip.																								It was chaotic tonight but its been a wake-up call to help bring these communities into the cultural mainstream, said Paul Heritage, the British director of the Portuguese-translated drama. Its much more than a play. It brought people together ... this area is normally deserted, silent and violent, added Heritage, a drama professor at Queen Mary, University of London, who has worked on mainly prison-based theatre projects in Brazil for the past 12 years.																								Rio de Janeiros slums, or favelas, are notoriously violent. Many are controlled by drug gangs, with police only wiling to enter in military-style invasions.																								Im rather nervous. Its the first time Ive played in a favela. There are many children and its difficult for them to understand, said Maria Padilha, a star of an immensely popular Brazilian TV soap opera, before stepping on stage to play Cleopatra. In 20 years Ive never acted in such a difficult environment, film actor Chico Diaz said. The language was very different from what they speak but they identified with violence and love ... there was a chemistry ... discovery.																								Its difficult living here, dangerous ... this was different, said local resident Fabiana da Silva Pinto, 28, with 5-year-old daughter Fabricia clinging to her. Weve never seen anything like it before. We adored it.																								Heritage said he would stage Antony and Cleopatra and Measure for Measure in the City of God and other Rio favelas during the next eight weeks. Performances are also scheduled in Rios chic southern zone near Ipanema beach.

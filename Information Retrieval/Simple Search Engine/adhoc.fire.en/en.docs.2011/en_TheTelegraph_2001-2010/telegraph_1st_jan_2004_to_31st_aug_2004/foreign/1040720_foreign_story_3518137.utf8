 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Pak sends helicopter gunships for Qaida hunt
																								Wana, July 19 (Reuters): Pakistan sent gunship and transport helicopters over mountains near the Afghan border today in its hunt for al Qaida-linked foreign militants, officials and residents said.																								The military reported three militants killed and six wounded in clashes starting yesterday morning around the Santoi and Mantoi valleys near Wana, the main town in the South Waziristan tribal area where foreign fighters have been most active.																								Most of the heights around these valleys have been secured by the security forces with full cooperation of the locals, the Pakistani military said.																								A security official in the northwestern city of Peshawar said the military was hunting militants in the forbidding area of Boshghar, on the border between South and North Waziristan. It is considered critical in the hunt for foreign militants and their local tribal supporters, who have refused previous government offers of amnesty.																								But a tribal jirga, or council, handed over to the authorities 40 tribesmen wanted by the government on suspicion of helping foreign militants. No senior wanted figures were among them, said residents in Wana, where the handover took place.																								The US has put pressure on Pakistan to hunt down foreign militants in its tribal belt, believing that targets like al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri may be hiding somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan border.																								A government source said at least one soldier was killed and six wounded yesterday when an army convoy was ambushed in South Waziristan, where hundreds of foreign fighters including Arabs, Uzbeks and Chechens are said to be hiding.																								He said two civilians were also killed in the crossfire between soldiers and unidentified militants, but there was no official confirmation of casualties.																								Residents in Wana said they saw gunship and transport helicopters flying back and forth to the west of the town. 																								The army also pounded suspected militant hideouts in the mountains with artillery, residents added.																								Pakistans army, which deployed into semi-autonomous tribal regions in the west of the country for the first time last year, has come under frequent attack by militants and their local allies.

 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Musharraf praises man of peace Atal
				 	 Pervez Musharraf speaks during a press conference in Davos. (AFP)																								Davos, Jan. 24 (Agencies): Pervez Musharraf today said he believed Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a man of peace but said both India and Pakistan would have to show flexibility and boldness to resolve the Kashmir dispute.																								We have taken a big step forward in setting the stage for negotiations, the Pakistan President said, asserting that both sides would have to reach a compromise between their earlier extreme positions.																								But Musharraf was full of praise for the Indian Prime Minister. I find him to be a man of peace. I find him to be a very balanced leader. I give him credit for his boldness, he said at a breakfast meeting with reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.																								The Pakistan President, who met Vajpayee during the recent South Asian summit in Islamabad, said resumption of dialogue between the neighbours and acceptance of Kashmir as a dispute have already taken place. 																								Now is the question of moving forward, he said, adding that another step he had proposed was to eliminate issues unacceptable to the parties concerned  India, Pakistan and the people of Kashmir.																								A good beginning has been made and the two sides now need to start a composite dialogue, he asserted.																								Musharraf also said his countrys nuclear technology was well guarded. We have not left any stone unturned to ensure the security of all our assets, he added. 																								Following his acknowledgement that it appeared Pakistani scientists had sold nuclear secrets abroad for personal financial gain, the International Atomic Energy Agency today said it was working with Islamabad to trace a sophisticated underworld thought to be helping countries with clandestine nuclear weapons programmes.																								We are working with Pakistan... to come to the bottom of this ring of proliferators, Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the agency, said in Davos in the Swiss Alps.																								In Islamabad, senior Pakistani officials said investigators have concluded that at least two of the countrys top nuclear scientists  including Abdul Qadeer Khan, considered the father of Pakistans nuclear bomb  provided unauthorised technical assistance to Irans nuclear weapons programme in the late 1980s.

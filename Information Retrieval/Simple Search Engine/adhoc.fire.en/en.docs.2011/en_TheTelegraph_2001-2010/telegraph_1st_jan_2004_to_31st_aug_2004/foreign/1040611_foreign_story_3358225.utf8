 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Bush, Chirac meet on Nato rift
																								Sea Island (Georgia), June 10 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac sought to iron out differences on a Nato role in Iraq today at a Group of Eight summit that is focusing on Baghdads transition, West Asia and Africa.																								Leaders from six African countries  Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda  were to meet the G8 leaders at the Georgia resort of Sea Island to find ways of dealing with the wars raging on their continent, development issues and fighting AIDS.																								Bush held a bilateral meeting with Chirac  a leading opponent of the invasion of Iraq last year  and told reporters afterwards they had discussed whether or not there is a continued role in Iraq for Nato.																								I assured the President that we will continue to consult closely. The point is we understand that the Iraqi people need help, said Bush, who was buoyed by a unanimous UN Security Council resolution passed on Tuesday that approved plans for an interim government in Iraq.																								The US has about 130,000 troops in Iraq and, along with Britain, is seeking greater involvement by the western military alliance in dealing with the precarious security situation.																								I heard caution on the part of the French, but not a hard no. I think the French are cautious about a visible Nato role, said a senior Bush administration official who attended the Bush-Chirac meeting.																								But a French spokesman said after the Bush-Chirac talks that Chirac believed it would be clumsy for Nato to have an expanded role in Iraq.																								Bush yesterday obtained the agreement of the seven other group members on an initiative to push democratic and economic reform in West Asia after revising the plan to include a commitment to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 																								The group  the US, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia  issued a statement today urging rapid action to get the Arab-Israeli peace plan back on track.																								It said the G8 would join with others in the international community, led by the so-called Quartet of the US, the EU, Russia and the UN, to restore momentum on the road map for peace.																								A senior Bush administration official said G8 officials worked into the night to try to reach a deal on how generous an aid commitment to make toward the worlds poorest countries.

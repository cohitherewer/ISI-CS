(Reuters)																								Caen (France), June 6 (Reuters): Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder paid a historic visit to Normandy today, joining Germanys erstwhile enemies for the first time in a tribute to victims on both sides of the pivotal World War II battle.																								Schroeder, an infant when the Allies stormed French beaches in the D-Day landings 60 years ago that hastened the wars end, said Germany would never forget its debt and vowed to keep working closely with France in their campaigns for peace.																								Frances memories of June 6, 1944 are different from Germanys yet they still flow into the same joint conviction: We want peace, he said. We Germans know we unleashed a heinous war. Were aware of our responsibility and take it seriously.																								Thousands of Allied soldiers died in a single, gruesome day and paid the ultimate price for freedom, he said in a speech at D-Day ceremonies in the northwestern town of Caen.																								German soldiers died because they were sent on a murderous campaign to crush Europe. But in death all soldiers were united regardless of the uniform they wore  in the grieving of their parents and wives, brothers and sisters. Their pain unites us all.																								Schroeder, whose 32-year-old father was killed in combat four months after D-Day, said the Allies not only liberated France but also Germany. He labelled the defeat a victory for Germany, remarks that would have once angered Germans at home.																								No one will forget the terrible record of Hitlers 12-year tyranny, Schroeder said. My generation grew up in its shadow. My fathers grave was found only four years ago. He was a soldier killed in Romania. I never got a chance to know him.																								Schroeders trip has had an electrifying effect in Germany, stirring debate about when, or if, the country will ever be able to draw a line under its past. It has also given fresh momentum to the idea that Germans were liberated by their own defeat.																								Schroeder said his visit proved the post-war era was over.

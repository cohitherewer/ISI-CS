 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Sharon bid to assuage party
																								Jerusalem, May 3 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said today he would amend his Gaza withdrawal plan to win over his Right-wing party after it overwhelmingly rejected the US-backed initiative in a referendum.																								Buoyed by yesterdays vote, Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip poured concrete for a new neighbourhood today while ultra-nationalist Jews moved into an Arab district of Jerusalem.																								Leftist and Arab legislators mounted a no-confidence vote against Sharon over what they called his governments socio-economic and diplomatic failures, but lost by a 62-46 margin. Sharon has beaten back several such votes this year.																								Sharons allies said that while the referendum was a humiliating reverse, he would not retreat since his landmark plan for disengagement from conflict with Palestinians enjoyed the support of most Israelis as shown by various opinion polls.																								He was also keen not to alienate Washington, which reversed decades of policy and incurred Arab anger by assuring Israel it would not have to cede the whole West Bank under any peace deal if it unilaterally vacated Gaza as a start toward negotiations.																								The alternative is more murder, terrorism and attacks without us having any wise answer for what 7,500 Jewish (settlers) are doing among 1.2 million Palestinians (in Gaza), Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said.																								Sharon told Likud lawmakers later he would modify the plan to prevent Israel being embroiled in the most difficult circumstances, a euphemism for an internationally-imposed peace accord he feels would require dangerous territorial handovers.																								Sharon did not say what changes he had in mind. But sources said one way of rallying the party behind him might be to vacate only some Gaza enclaves most exposed to violence.

 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Woman says not guilty in baby death
Salt Lake City, March 16 (AFP): In a landmark case, a US woman today pleaded not guilty to murdering her unborn baby by refusing medical advice to have a Caesarean section to deliver twins.																								Melissa Ann Rowland, 28, appeared in court in Salt Lake City, in the western state of Utah, via a television link from her jail to deny the charge that she murdered one of the twins she was carrying by depraved neglect.																								In a case that has sparked intense public debate over an expectant mothers right to choose medical treatment, Rowland is accused of allowing one of her babies to die because she was too vain to have surgery to save the twins.																								She was arrested on a charge of criminal homicide on Thursday after allegedly refusing to deliver her twins surgically because being cut from breast bone to pubic bone would ruin her life, according to prosecutors.																								She chose interest in her vanity over the interest in seeing that her child was born healthy, Salt Lake City county assistant chief district attorney Kent Morgan said.

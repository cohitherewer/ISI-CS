 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 China frees rebel for US treatment
																								Beijing, March 4 (Reuters): A leading Chinese dissident has been released and allowed to seek medical attention in the US after months of quiet diplomacy by American officials, a rights group said today.																								The early medical parole of physicist Wang Youcai, 37, handed an 11-year sentence for subversion in 1998 after helping found the China Democracy Party (CDP), follows moves in the last week to reduce the sentence of an Uighur businesswoman in Xinjiang and the release of a Tibetan nun.																								Wangs release, more than five years ahead of schedule, comes one day before the start of Chinas National Peoples Congress, which is preparing to enshrine human rights in the constitution through an amendment. Rights groups and dissidents see that move as largely symbolic but a step in the right direction.																								Wangs release was also the latest sign Beijing wants to deflect criticism after an annual US report skewered China for backsliding on rights. A US official said Washington is inclined to seek a UN resolution on Chinas practices.																								He was released from prison in the city of Hangzhou in eastern China.

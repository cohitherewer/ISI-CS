 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Iran says it has said enough on nuke issue
																								Tehran, Feb. 25 (Reuters): Iran said today it had told the UN enough about its nuclear programme and had no obligation to say more, rebuffing calls for it to be more open and dispel suspicions it is building a nuclear bomb.																								Iran has given enough answers to the agencys questions, Hassan Rohani, head of Supreme National Security Council and Irans chief nuclear negotiator, was quoted as saying by the official news agency Irna.																								Yesterday the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UNs nuclear watchdog body, said Iran had continued to hide from it technology and research that could be linked to a weapons programme  despite its declaration in October that it had no more secrets to divulge.																								We have other research projects which he havent announced to the agency and we dont think it is necessary to announce to the agency, Rohani said.																								 The Irna report gave no details on the kinds of projects he was referring to.																								Irans foreign ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, said in a statement sent to Reuters that outstanding IAEA concerns about Tehrans nuclear programme were purely procedural and did not undermine Irans denials that is is pursuing atomic arms.																								IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei said yesterday Tehrans failure to disclose sensitive research in its October declaration was a setback and said he wanted to see much more prompt information coming from the Islamic republic.																								I hope this will be the last time any aspect of the programme has not been declared to us, ElBaradei said during a flight from the Libyan capital Tripoli to Rome. 																								However, he praised Irans overall cooperation and its decision to suspend all activities related to the enrichment of uranium.

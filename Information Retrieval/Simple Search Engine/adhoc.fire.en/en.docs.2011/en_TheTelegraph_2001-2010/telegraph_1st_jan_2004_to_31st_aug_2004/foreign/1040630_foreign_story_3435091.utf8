The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Portrait of Beckham the looser defaced
				 	 Beckham: Losing face																								London, June 29 (Reuters): A photographic portrait of David Beckham was defaced today amid lingering frustration among England fans after their team was knocked out of the Euro 2004 tournament.																								Vandals used a red marker pen to scrawl the words,You loosers on the 1.5 metre high picture of Beckham that featured in an exhibition of the worlds greatest footballers at Londons Royal Academy of Arts. The culprits misspelled losers, using a double  in a possible reference to Rebecca Loos, the Spanish woman who claimed to have had an affair with the England captain.																								The vandals also hit out at their new bete noire  the Swiss referee Urs Meier  by scribbling Beckham and Meier, you loosers on a wall opposite a portrait of Pele.																								Meier achieved notoriety among England fans when he disallowed a last-minute goal by defender Sol Campbell during Englands Euro 2004 quarter-final defeat by Portugal. Beckham was also criticised for missing the target during a penalty shoot-out in the same match.																								The portrait of Beckham, which had already been sold for 7,500, has been removed from the exhibition. The exhibitions curator, David Grob, said police are examining CCTV footage to try to identify those responsible.																								Im absolutely furious, he said. We spent around 18 months putting the exhibition together. You expect this sort of hooliganism to happen at a football ground, not at an art gallery.

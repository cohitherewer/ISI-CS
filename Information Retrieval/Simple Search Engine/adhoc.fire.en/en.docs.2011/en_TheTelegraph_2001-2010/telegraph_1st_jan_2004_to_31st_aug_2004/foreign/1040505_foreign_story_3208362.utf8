 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Koirala crack in Nepal alliance
 PRANAY SHARMA																								Kathmandu, May 4: A possible meeting between the Nepali Congress chief Girija Prasad Koirala and King Gyanendra tomorrow has brought to the fore fissures in the five-party Opposition alliance. The alliance has been agitating in favour of its 18-point agenda since last year with primary focus on the restoration of democracy in Nepal.																								The proposed meeting, which comes less than 48 hours after the Surya Bahadur Thapa governments decision to take top leaders of the alliance into custody, has surprised observers.																								The fact that Koiralas move has not gone down well with the others was made clear by Communist Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) general secretary Madhav Nepal this afternoon. He said whoever met the king at this juncture would expose himself. Koirala, however, argued that he would represent all parties in the alliance when he met the king.																								Cracks in the alliance have belied hopes of an early solution to the crisis, especially between the king and the democratic parties. Yesterday, alliance leaders who were planning to organise a rally here to mark the first anniversary of their agitation, were picked up by the police even before they could address their supporters.																								Interestingly, the decision to detain the leaders who were released after five hours came when the government decided to withdraw the disturbed area provision from Kathmandu.																								Perhaps the government wanted to give out the signal that it was tough. Or it can also be a reflection of the differences that exist between the government in dealing with the five-party alliances agitation, Hari Sharma, alliance leader, said.																								Many people felt that after the crackdown on the leaders, chances of negotiations with the king had diminished. Koiralas move therefore comes as a surprise.																								Most leaders felt that talks should be based on the 18-point agenda, including restoration of democracy, curtailing the kings executive powers and making the Royal Nepal Army answerable to Parliament rather than the palace.																								Koirala does not have many of the compulsions the other alliance partners, particularly Madhav Nepal, has in re-opening dialogue with the king. His main aim was to get the disturbed area provision withdrawn along with the release of party leaders and supporters and withdrawal of cases against them.																								Though it was not spelt out, others felt Koirala wanted a dialogue with the king to ensure that his rival Sher Bahadur Deuba was not reinstated as the Prime Minister. Koirala holds Deuba responsible for giving most of the powers of the elected executive to the king. 																								There was also talk that the alliance would put forward a common candidate for the Prime Ministers post. It has, however, failed to arrive at any consensus on the issue.

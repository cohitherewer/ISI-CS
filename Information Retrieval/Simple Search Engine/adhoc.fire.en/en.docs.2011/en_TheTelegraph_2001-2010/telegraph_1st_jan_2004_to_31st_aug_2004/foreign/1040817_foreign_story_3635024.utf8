The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Qaida meet worries Pak, US
				 	 Pervez Musharraf																								New York, Aug. 16 (Reuters): US and Pakistani officials believe al Qaida operatives held a meeting in March that could have been a key planning session similar to one that led to the September 11 attacks on US cities, Time magazine reported.																								The magazine said in todays edition that the summit was held in the Waziristan region of Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border.																								Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf told Time that the discovery of the March meeting in Pakistan had exposed the second string leadership of al Qaida and was extremely significant.																								Time said among the militants attending were Abu Eisa al-Hindi, who was arrested this month in Britain, and Mohammed Junaid Babar, who was arrested in New York in April and who admitted in court last week to meeting a high-ranking al Qaida official in Pakistan this year.																								US counterterrorism officials consider al-Hindi to be a senior al Qaida operative in Britain.																								Time also named Adnan el-Shukrijumah, who grew up in Florida, as being at the March meeting. In May, US attorney general John Ashcroft described Shukrijumah as a possible future facilitator of terrorist acts for al Qaida.																								The personalities involved, the operations, the fact that a major explosives expert came here and went back; all this was extremely significant, Musharraf said in the Time article. Babar has pleaded guilty to multiple counts of providing material support to a terrorist organisation, including trying to buy materials to make bombs for use in attacks in Britain.																								A US official has said al-Hindi was centrally involved in an effort to case possible targets in the US for al Qaida attacks, which led to the decision by officials two weeks ago to raise the alert level at financial institutions in New York, New Jersey and Washington.																								Other summit participants are still at large and are considered by counterterrorism officials to be very dangerous, Time said. The magazine said some US officials fear the meeting may have been a pivotal planning session, much the way a 2000 meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was for the September 11 attacks.																								This was a meeting of a bunch of cold-blooded killers who are very skilled at what they do and have an intense desire to inflict an awful lot of pain and suffering on America, an unnamed official familiar with the summit told Time. Officials are still unsure exactly what was discussed in March.

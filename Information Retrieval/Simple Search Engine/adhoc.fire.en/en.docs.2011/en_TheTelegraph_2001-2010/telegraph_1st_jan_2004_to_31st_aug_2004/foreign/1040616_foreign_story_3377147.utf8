 							 - Strike against privatisation blows up on homes of Prime Minister and other politicians				 	 French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin 																								Paris, June 15 (Reuters): French power workers today cut electricity to the homes of the Prime Minister and other politicians on a day of targeted blackouts, strikes and marches to stop the part-privatisation of Electricite de France (EDF).																								The cut at Jean-Pierre Raffarins country home in the Vienne area of west France was one of several commando-style operations carried out in protest at the shake-up of the state electricity utility. 																								We took the (electricity) meter away with us just now. As of now theres no power at Mr Raffarins house, an official at the CGT labour union said.																								Workers also cut power for spells at homes of other politicians, such as Centre-Right former state radio boss Jean-Marie Cavada, as well as Socialists who have not taken a stand against privatisation. They included former culture minister Jack Lang and former Prime Minister Michel Rocard. Power was also cut at the holiday home of Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, head of Frances main business federation, MEDEF.																								Finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy later presented a draft law to parliament that would change EDFs status to pave the way for selling off up to 30 per cent of the group to private investors.																								Striking workers also cut about 12 per cent of EDFs output, according to officials from the Communist-linked CGT union, but there were no immediate reports of the power utility having to reduce or cut residential electricity supplies.																								EDF said workers tried to cut off a link through which the utility exports electricity to Italy but that remedial action was taken by management and supplies were unaffected.																								The battle is another headache for President Jacques Chirac after his governing UMP party was savaged in European elections on Sunday, a second drubbing in three months for a conservative government unpopular over unemployment, reform and cost-cutting.																								Unions see the governments plan to sell some EDF shares as an attack on Frances strong tradition of public services and fear jobs could be lost. They also say household bills could rise and the service could deteriorate.																								In Paris, several thousand EDF employees walked towards parliament behind an EDF truck with a dummy electricity worker hanging by the neck. There was a deafening noise of sirens, horns, firecrackers and carnival music.																								Today is a day thatll count for our future and our lives, said Jean Mengual, a mechanic with EDF for almost 30 years. CGT officials said 70,000 marched or stopped work across France.																								Separately, some 1,000 firemen demonstrated in Paris for better pension rights and thousands across France protested against the governments planned health care reforms.																								EDF and ministers vowed to stand by the reform despite the protests. There is no going back, EDF chief Francois Roussely told Europe 1 radio of the proposed partial privatisation.

 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Hostage seeks only Pervez ears
 IMTIAZ GULIslamabad, July 9: A Pakistani hostage, released earlier this week by Iraqi militants who had kidnapped him, said today he had exclusive information that he would only share with President Pervez Musharraf.																								After arriving in Islamabad from Kuwait, Amjad Hafeez said his abductors had given him information about something that he would share only with Musharraf. 																								I have already briefed US officials on my ordeal in Iraq but would like to see President Musharraf to inform him of some serious and secret information, he said.																								Hafeez, who was employed by the American firm Kellogg Brown and Root, was kidnapped by militants late last month. They had threatened to behead him if the US-led forces did not release locals detained in Iraqi prisons. 																								However, Islamabads defiant attitude and appeals for Hafeezs life eventually led to his release on July 2.																								They (kidnappers) scared me saying that we dont let anyone go who works for Americans even it is Iraqi, Hafeez said, adding that they suspected him to be an American spy. 																								Thats why, Hafeez added, the militants tortured him during captivity. But when they came to know Im a Muslim, they allowed me to offer my last prayers, Hafeez said.																								Hafeez now faces an uncertain future after his firm apparently sacked him and also refused to compensate him for the ransom he had to pay to secure his release.

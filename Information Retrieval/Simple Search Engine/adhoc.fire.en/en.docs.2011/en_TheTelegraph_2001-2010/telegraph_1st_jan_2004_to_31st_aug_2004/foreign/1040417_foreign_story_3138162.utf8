 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Deuba held during protest
																								Kathmandu, April 16 (Reuters): Former Nepali Prime Minister whose ouster by the king two years ago set off a political crisis, was detained today as he led a protest to denounce the monarch who sacked him.																								Former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was removed by King Gyanendra in 2002, was detained by police as he led a demonstration of more than 3,000 supporters in Kathmandu in defiance of a ban on protests. My sacking was illegal and I should be reinstated, Deuba said before he was detained.																								Dozens of his supporters were held. Several journalists covering the protest were also detained, a media association said. Officials were not immediately available for comment.																								King Gyanendra fired Deuba, calling him incompetent in trying to end a bloody Maoist revolt, and appointed a royalist in his place. The king also delayed an election due that year.

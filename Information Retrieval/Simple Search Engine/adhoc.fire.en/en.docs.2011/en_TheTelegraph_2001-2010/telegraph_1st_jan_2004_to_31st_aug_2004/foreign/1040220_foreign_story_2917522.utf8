 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Sneaking a knife into jet will be costly
																								Washington, Feb. 19 (AP): Anyone trying to sneak a knife onto an US airliner could be fined $250 and a passenger with an explosive could get as much as $10,000 under new guidelines.																								Thousands of airline passengers board planes every year carrying banned items such as cuticle scissors, box cutters and guns. Tom Blank, assistant administrator for Transportation Security Policy, testified before Congress last week that the Transportation Security Administration has intercepted more than 1,650 firearms, more than 3 million knives and more than 57,000 incendiary devices shortly after the terrorist hijackings on September 11, 2001.																								Fines may help awaken a sleeping population here, said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association. We have too many examples of people inadvertently bringing a gun in their carry-on.																								When Congress created the Homeland Security Department last year, it raised the maximum fine for trying to carry prohibited items through airport security from $1,100 to $10,000.

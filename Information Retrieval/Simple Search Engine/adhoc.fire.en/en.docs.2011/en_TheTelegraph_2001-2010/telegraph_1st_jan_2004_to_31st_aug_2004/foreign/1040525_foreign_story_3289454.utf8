 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Pervez hits hawks 
Islamabad, May 24 (Reuters): President Pervez Musharraf appealed to Pakistans young people today to shun the forces of conservative Islam, warning that extremism and militancy threaten the countrys future.																								Musharraf, who critics say has not done enough to match his rhetoric against radical Islam since coming to power in a bloodless military coup in 1999, was hard-hitting in a speech broadcast live on state television. What is the biggest source of extremism? Unfortunately mosques are misused, loud speakers are misused, not all... and a few madarsas are misused to spread hatred, create divisions, Musharraf, dressed in his generals uniform, told a youth conference in Islamabad. We cannot allow that. 																								He said Pakistan was a victim of misperceptions in the outside world, where it was blamed for violence in Afghanistan, insurgency in Kashmir and nuclear proliferation. These misperceptions, what damage can they do to us? he asked a few hundred students from across the country. I will not go into details but let me tell you that they can lead to such serious consequences that Pakistan will be incapable of bearing it.

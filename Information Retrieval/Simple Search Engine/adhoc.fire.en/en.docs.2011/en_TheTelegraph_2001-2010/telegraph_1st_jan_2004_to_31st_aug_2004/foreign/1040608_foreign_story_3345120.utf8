 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Lass to lure lads back to books
																								London, June 7 (Reuters): In a bid to lure men in Britain away from TV football matches and into bookshops, publisher Penguin Books will send out a sexy model to offer 1,000 prizes to males spotted reading a selected title.																								The publicity ploy, launched today, aims to boost sales among men, who on average buy fewer books than women. Its to sex up the book industry, which probably needs it, but also to address the more serious issue that reading has fallen off the radar of younger men, said Neil Griffiths, author of Penguin-published Betrayal in Naples.																								Penguins so-called Good Booking Girl will canvass the streets this month for men older than 16 years reading versions of Nick Hornbys 31 Songs that bear a special cover sticker. At the same time, Penguin, released results of a poll in which 85 per cent of women said a man could increase his chances of getting a date by talking about a favourite book.																								By contrast, more than half the men polled said they believed that flattering a woman would suffice to impress her. An accompanying Good Booking chart of 40 books recommends such lad-friendly Penguin titles as Anthony Burgess A Clockwork Orange, Raymond Chandlers The Big Sleep and Jack Kerouacs On the Road.

 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Bavarian beer fest faces cash crunch
 ASTRID NOLTE 																								Munich, Aug. 22: The worlds biggest beer festival, as famous for its traditional legwear as its beer and sausages, faces an unprecedented absence of lederhosen after the Bavarian government refused to back down on plans to cut grants to folk groups.																								The prospect of drinkers in jeans and T-shirts packing the beer tents at the Munich Oktoberfest came closer yesterday after lederhosen wearers said that they would boycott the event.																								More than six million people are expected to attend the festival  last year tourism brought in more than 34 million to Munich and the beer festival is the highlight  but tourism officials fear that many overseas visitors, usually drawn by the colourful traditional displays, may decide not to come.																								The festival is regularly opened by about 6,000 men in lederhosen, or leather shorts, and women in dirndls  pleated smocks with low-cut blouses. They parade through the city centre as the barrels of beer are wheeled in by horse-drawn cart.																								Their distinctive costume, however, does not come cheap. The cost of fitting an average family of three is about 4,000. State grants worth 338,000  distributed for the past 40 years  used to cover 13 per cent of the cost of each garment. In return, members of about 1,000 clubs agreed to play an active role in festivals and cultural events. Last week, however, efforts to persuade the Bavarian government not to cut the grants collapsed. Edmond Stoiber, the Bavarian Prime Minister, said the subsidy had to be stopped to save public money.																								His announcement prompted an outcry among the clubs and was seen as proof of the seemingly dire state of public finances in Bavaria, normally one of Germanys richest regions. Like other states, the local economy is in recession.																								Last night, with passions running high, members of the 300,000-strong Bayerische Trachtenverband (Bavarian Livery Association) accused the state government of betrayal. Boycotting the Oktoberfest, they said, was among a range of options. 																								I just dont understand it, said Walter Weinzierl, the Trachtenverband treasurer. It will cause drastic cuts in how we carry out our duties. Adi Mueller, the organisations deputy chairman, said: We are being trodden on.																								Maria Paul, from the Bavarian Service tourism agency in Munich, said: The Munich beer festival is the highlight of the citys social calendar. Of course it would be a disaster if the Oktoberfest was disrupted. What would Munich be without its most famous attraction?					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Bush pays generous tribute to Clinton
				 	 Bill Clinton with (from left) Chelsea, Hillary and Laura Bush at the White House. (AFP) Washington, June 14: In a rare election-year political truce, US President George W. Bush today warmly paid tribute to Bill Clinton and even plugged his coming memoirs at his formal White House portrait unveiling. 																								The Bush administration has not generally been kind to Clinton since he left office, blaming him at various times for the troubled economy, the North Korean nuclear crisis, West Asia violence, and poor US defences against terrorism. 																								But in remarks that Clinton called generous, Bush banished such acrimony and lavished praise on his predecessor as well as First-Lady-turned Senator Hillary Clinton, whose portraits will hang forever in the White House. 																								Bill Clinton showed incredible energy and great personal appeal. As chief executive, he showed a deep and far-ranging knowledge of public policy, a great compassion for people in need, and the forward-looking spirit that Americans like in a President, Bush said in a speech at the ceremony. 																								Bush said that Clintons rise from humble beginnings in the rural state of Arkansas took more than charm and intellect. It took hard work and drive and determination and optimism. 																								I can tell you more of the story, but its coming out in fine bookstores all over America, Bush quipped, a reference to Clintons eagerly anticipated memoirs, My Life, which comes out June 22. The President, by his generous words to Hillary and me today, has proved once again that in the end, we are held together by this grand system of ours that permits us to debate and struggle and fight for what we believe is right, said Clinton. 																								The upbeat, friendly exchange came after a week of mourning for former President Ronald Reagan, and as Clinton seemed ready, with his book tour, to retake the spotlight he reluctantly gave up three years ago. Publishers Alfred A. Knopf paid Clinton an advance of more than $10 million for the 957-page autobiography. 																								In his remarks, the former President seemed to reach into his own doubts and worries about the war in Bosnia to offer advice to Bush on Iraq, suggesting he could find some solace on Iraq in a portrait of Theodore Roosevelt. 																								I used to look at it all the time when I felt bad and I worried: Was the war in Bosnia going to come out all right? Would the Kosovar refugees ever be able to go home? said Clinton. You look at that picture and you see heres a human being whos scared to death and not sure its going to come out all right. And he does the right thing, anyway. Thats what I saw in that picture, said Clinton.

 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 US, Israel embassies hit by blasts in Tashkent
																								Tashkent, July 30 (Reuters): Simultaneous bomb attacks struck the US and Israeli embassies in Uzbekistan as well as the state prosecutors office in the capital Tashkent today, killing at least two people and wounding five.																								An Islamic group claimed responsibility for the bombings, according to a statement posted on an Islamist website today.																								The action appeared clearly coordinated, days after the start of a trial in Tashkent of 15 suspected Islamist extremists on charges of trying to overthrow the ex-Soviet state in connection with attacks in March that killed nearly 50 people. The three late afternoon blasts in Uzbekistan, a mainly Muslim country that backs Washingtons war on terror and hosts a US airbase, appeared to have been triggered by suicide bombers, almost certainly on foot.																								The three buildings are spread across the modern city of two million people located in the heart of arid Central Asia. Uzbek President Islam Karimov, visiting Ukraines Crimea peninsula, was due to return home overnight, local officials said. 																								Israeli ambassador Zvi Cohen said two people had died outside the Jewish states embassy. A bomb exploded at the entrance to the embassy, he told Israel Radio.

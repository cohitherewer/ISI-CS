 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Spain resists US Iraq pressure
				 	 Spaniards are overcome by emotion while watching the state funeral for the victims of the Madrid train bombings on a TV screen in downtown Madrid. (Reuters)																								Madrid, March 24 (Reuters): Spains incoming Prime Minister resisted US and British pressure today to keep Spanish troops in Iraq and said they could only stay if the UN was given much greater control of the occupation.																								Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero met US secretary of state Colin Powell and British Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss Iraq, and Zapateros likely foreign minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said he had held firm.																								Zapatero told them the 1,300 Spanish troops would come home on June 30 unless radical changes gave the UN control over security policy and the democratic transition in Iraq, Moratinos said. Zapateros pledge to pull out the troops has popular support in Spain and Blair appeared to recognise that in their meeting.																								The Prime Minister said he understood that whichever way the situation moved in Iraq, Zapatero was backed by the Spanish people, a spokesman for Blair said. 																								Powell and Zapatero met for about 15 minutes.																								The US and Britain are now looking to build consensus on a new UN resolution aimed at boosting its role in Iraq and persuading Zapatero to stay on board. Powell and Blair were in Spain with other world leaders and royalty to mourn the 190 victims of the Madrid train bomb attacks, which have been blamed on Islamist militants possibly linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network.																								Many Spaniards believe their capital was targeted in revenge for their governments support of the Iraq war and it was a voter revolt that swept Zapatero to power in elections held just three days after the attack.																								Outgoing Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar was a staunch ally in the Iraq occupation but Zapatero has branded it a fiasco. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac, who both strongly opposed the Iraq war and refused to send troops for the occupation force, were also in Madrid to join grieving relatives at a state funeral mass in Almudena Cathedral. Countdown begins																								Iraqs US administrator began a 100-day countdown to Iraqi sovereignty today by hailing progress since Saddam Husseins removal, but fresh violence underlined the countrys instability.

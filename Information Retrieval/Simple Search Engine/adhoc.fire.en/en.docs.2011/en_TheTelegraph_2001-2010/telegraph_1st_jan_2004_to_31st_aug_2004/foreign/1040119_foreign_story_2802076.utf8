																								Islamabad, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Authorities have detained a key aide to Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistans atom bomb, for questioning as they investigate reports of the possible transfer of nuclear technology to Iran, officials said today.																								Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said eight people, including three military officers, and three scientists were among those being debriefed. He gave no further details.																								Pakistan has questioned Abdul Qadeer Khan, revered as a national hero for developing the nuclear device, and several of his colleagues in recent weeks after a UN nuclear agency began a probe into possible links between the Pakistani and Iranian nuclear programmes.																								A senior government official said Islam-ul-Haq, Khans principal secretary, was detained for questioning last evening in Islamabad. He was rounded up in connection with the probe of the Iranian nuclear programme, said the official.																								The detention came hours after President Pervez Musharraf said Pakistan faced serious accusations of spreading terrorism and nuclear technology. Our nuclear and missile power is for the defence of Pakistan. We have to assure the world that we are a responsible nation and we will not allow proliferation of nuclear weapons, he told a noisy parliament session yesterday.																								The New York Times yesterday quoted US law enforcement officials as saying they were looking into whether the Pakistani government was involved in a plot by a South African businessman to export trigger devices that could be used for nuclear weapons. It quoted a Pakistani diplomat in Washington as saying Islamabad would cooperate in the investigation but denied its involvement in the deal.																								Haq, a former army official, was serving as director at the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), Pakistans top uranium enrichment laboratory, set up by Khan in 1970s near Islamabad. Haqs wife, Nilofar Islam, said she had no information about her husbands whereabouts. We have had no contact with him since last evening, she said.																								Pakistani intelligence officials questioned at least three scientists working with KRL last month after diplomats in Vienna said the International Atomic Energy Agency was investigating a possible link between Islamabad and Tehran. 																								Iran acknowledged using centrifuge designs that appear to be identical to those used in Islamabads past quest for an atom bomb. Pakistan tested its nuclear device in 1998.  All roads lead to Pak																								The clandestine nuclear weapons programmes of Iran, Libya and North Korea were all fuelled by the KRL, a London weekly reported today.																								Dramatic evidence from Iran and now Libya reveals a clandestine and sophisticated network, stretching from North Korea, Malaysia and China to Russia, Germany and Dubai. Yet one country more than any other stands accused of easing this proliferation. In the network of illegal radioactive trade, all roads point to Pakistan. More precisely, they lead to the Khan Research Laboratories in Kahuta in north Pakistan, the Observer stated in a special report.																								Evidence has now emerged from Iran and Libya that Khans programme may be the source of the greatest level of nuclear weapons proliferation since the Cold War, the report said.																								UN inspectors who have recently visited a number of facilities in Libya discovered large amounts of aluminium centrifuge parts that had all the hallmarks of the Urenco designs stolen by Khan.

 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Terror shadow as Russia gropes
				 	 A woman cries in Tula, south of Moscow, after identifying her relative who was killed in the Tu-134 plane crash. (AFP)																								Moscow, Aug. 26 (Reuters): Investigators examined flight recorders today from Russias mystery double air crash in which 89 people died, but one official doubted they would be of any use.																								The tapes... did not show anything. Practically speaking they switched themselves off immediately. And so we failed to get any information, Vladimir Yakovlev, Russian President Vladimir Putins envoy for the southern region, told ORT television.																								Russian media focused on suspicion that the planes had been attacked within minutes of each other on Tuesday night, despite official statements that the crashes were most likely the result of technical fault or human error.																								Russia now has its own September 11, said a front-page headline in Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily, in reference to the 2001 suicide attacks on the US involving four hijacked commercial planes, which killed about 3,000 people. One aircraft, a Tu-134 flying to Volgograd, went down south of Moscow. Moments later, a Tu-154 bound for Sochi on the Black Sea crashed near the southern city of Rostov-on-Don.																								The planes had both left from Moscows Domodedovo airport. Investigators were deciphering flight recorders recovered from the wreckage but Yakovlev said preliminary checks indicated they would not yield anything useful and indicated he believed a terrorist act was behind the disasters. The source of Yakovlevs information was unclear and transport minister Igor Levitin, heading the official investigating commission, said it was too early to pin down the causes.																								The crew of the Tu-154 hit the SOS button before their plane with 43 passengers and crew on board crashed, Levitin said, but there was no voice confirmation. Sibir Airlines, the owner of the Tu-154, previously said the pilots had triggered a hijack alert just before the crash. The airline also said the fact that wreckage was scattered so widely indicated there may have been a mid-air explosion.

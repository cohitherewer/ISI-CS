 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Harare raises death spectre
 Harare/Dakar, March 10  (Reuters): Zimbabwe threatened today to execute some  60 suspected mercenaries detained this week and accused  US, British and Spanish spy agencies of involvement in a  plot to topple Equatorial Guineas government.																								Equatorial Guinea, which has arrested what it called an advance party of 15 mercenaries, said enemy powers and multinational companies had been plotting against the small oil-producing central African state. The two countries, some 2,000 miles apart, have put their security forces on high alert since Zimbabwe detained a Boeing 727 carrying about 60 men, most of them South Africans, Angolans and Namibians, both white and black, on Sunday. Associates of the men say they are innocent mine guards swept up in a bizarre misunderstanding.																								They are going to face the severest punishment available in our statutes, including capital punishment. We will give them all the rights they are entitled to, Zimbabwean foreign minister Stan Mudenge told a news briefing. 																								They were aided by the British secret service, that is MI6, (the) American Central Intelligence Agency and the Spanish secret service, Zimbabwes home affairs minister Kembo Mohadi said. Mohadi, whose country has been bitterly at odds in recent years with Washington and former European colonial powers, said Equatorial Guineas police and army heads had gone along with the plot against President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.																								The CIA declined to comment on Zimbabwes spying charge, but US officials denied the allegation. There was no US interest or involvement in such a plot, said one US official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Spain also denied involvement in any plot in the former Spanish colony.																								A British foreign office spokeswoman said: I have no information on whether any security services were involved at all. But we certainly wouldnt comment on our security services anyway.																								Zimbabwe state television showed a cargo of what it called military material aboard the plane, seized on Sunday after flying into Harare from South Africa. The gear included camouflage uniforms, sleeping bags, compasses and wire cutters but no guns. Obiang said in a speech late yesterday foreign countries had conspired to overthrow him and replace him with an exiled politician living in Spain.

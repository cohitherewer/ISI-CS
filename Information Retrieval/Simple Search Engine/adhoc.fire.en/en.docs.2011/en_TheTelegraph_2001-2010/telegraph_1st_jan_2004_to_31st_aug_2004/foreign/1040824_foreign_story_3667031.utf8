 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Nepal party calls for truce
				 	 An Italian couple in Kathmandu. (AFP)																								Kathmandu, Aug. 23 (Reuters): Nepals main Opposition party urged the government today to call a unilateral ceasefire with Maoist rebels and seek peace talks to end a road blockade that has cut the capital off from the rest of the country.																								The Nepali Congress party said the two-month-old multiparty government, appointed by the king to try to end a political crisis, had been unable even to secure Kathmandu.																								The government must announce a ceasefire and hold talks with the Maoists to end the blockade and their revolt peacefully, senior Congress member Narahari Acharya said. The government cannot solve the Maoist problem. It must resign immediately.																								Deputy Prime Minister Bharat Mohan Adhikary repeated after a cabinet meeting that the government wanted talks with the rebels.																								The government has called them to negotiations and the government is ready to go to any length to solve the Maoist problem, he said, but did not respond to the Opposition demand for a ceasefire.																								The Maoist blockade, which entered its sixth day today, has effectively closed all roads linking the hill-ringed city with the rest of Nepal.																								The rebels have not set up road blocks or any other obvious physical presence, but are relying on fear of violence to enforce the blockage. Suspected rebels shot dead a businessman in the capital today, police said. More than 5,000 businesspeople rallied in Kathmandu yesterday demanding an end to the blockade.

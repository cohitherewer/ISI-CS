The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 BA cancels 15 flights
																								London, Aug. 24 (Reuters): British Airways Plc cancelled 15 return flights from Londons Heathrow Airport today, stranding thousands of passengers due to a shortage of check-in staff.																								BA, Europes second-largest airline, cancelled 15 short-haul return flights, or 30 flights in total, throwing travel plans for more than 2,000 passengers into chaos as they crowded into packed airport lounges to wait for alternative flights.																								The disruption followed the cancellation of 25 return flights last night due to staff shortages. 																								We are not expecting any more disruptions today, a BA spokeswoman said.																								The airline blamed the cancellations on delays in hiring new check-in staff due to stringent security checks, which coincided with Heathrows busiest month of the year and a surge in summer travel ahead of a long-holiday weekend.																								BA expects to recruit 150 additional workers at Heathrow shortly.																								It has taken longer than normal to get them on the floor because they have to undergo criminal checks and weve had a higher than expected leaving rate earlier this year, a spokeswoman said.																								The airline offered thousands of passengers hotel accommodation last night after 22 short-haul flights were cancelled. Another three long-haul flights were also cancelled due to technical problems. The delays are the latest in a string of threats to summer holiday travel on the flagship carrier.																								On Saturday, it averted a planned 24-hour strike by more than 10,000 ground staff after reaching a pay deal with unions. Earlier this month, thousands of travellers were separated from their luggage when storms delayed travel at Heathrow.																								Meanwhile, about 700 United Airlines ground staff at Heathrow are planning to strike for 24 hours over pay this weekend.																								Shares in BA, which were buoyed today by lower oil prices, were 3.4 per cent firmer at 226-1/2 pence in a higher broader market.

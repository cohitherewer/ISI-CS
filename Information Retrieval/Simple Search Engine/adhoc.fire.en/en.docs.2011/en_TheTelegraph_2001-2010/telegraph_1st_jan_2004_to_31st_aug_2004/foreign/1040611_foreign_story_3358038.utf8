 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Once-in-a-lifetime farewell to Reagan
				 	 Mourners pay last respects to Ronald Reagan as his casket lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, Washington DC. (AFP)Washington, June 10 (Reuters): Thousands of Americans filed silently past Ronald Reagans body at the US Capitol today in an emotional outpouring of respect and affection for the 40th President of the United States.																								A steady stream of viewers  at least 2,000 an hour filed slowly past the flag-draped coffin in the Capitol Rotunda from last evening into this morning. Some waited up to seven hours in a line that snaked around the building on a hot, humid night.																								Its the first and only time Im ever going to be able to be in his presence, Jeff Riley, 36, who said Reagan inspired him to join the Marine Corps, said on CNN early today. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.																								Reagans coffin was to lie in state until tomorrow morning, when a funeral service will take place at the National Cathedral. Around 150,000 people were expected to file past the casket during those 34 hours. After the funeral, Reagans body will be flown back to California one last time for a sunset burial on the grounds of his presidential library overlooking rolling desert hills just north of Los Angeles.																								Many past and present world leaders and veterans of the Cold War struggle against communism that Reagan helped to end were making their way to Washington for the funeral. They included former Soviet communist leader Mikhail Gorbachev, formally representing Russia, and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a staunch Reagan ally.																								Reagan died on Saturday aged 93 after a long struggle with Alzheimers disease. He bid farewell to the American people in a moving letter 10 years ago and had since lived in seclusion, cared for by his wife, Nancy. Since Saturday, the US media has provided blanket coverage and glowing assessments of the historical legacy and sunny personality of a man rated one of the most significant US Presidents of the 20th century.																								The elaborate symbolism and pageantry of the week of mourning, orchestrated according to plans drawn up long in advance by the Reagan family, seemed fitting for a man whose public skills were first honed as a Hollywood movie star. Yesterday, jets swooped low over the procession and drums rolled as as the body was brought on a horse-drawn military wagon to the Capitol.

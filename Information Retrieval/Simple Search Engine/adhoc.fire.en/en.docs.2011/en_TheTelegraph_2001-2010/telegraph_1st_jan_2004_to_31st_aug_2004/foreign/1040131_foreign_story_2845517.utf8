 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Dollars chase MyDoom
																								Seattle, Jan. 30 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp. offered a $250,000 reward yesterday for the person responsible for the MyDoom worm, as the reported number of infected computers more than doubled overnight.																								The worlds largest software maker said it would pay the money for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for unleashing a variant of the malicious software code, called MyDoom.b, which is designed to attack Microsofts website in an apparent attempt to shut it down this weekend.																								The Microsoft offer follows a similar $250,000 reward offered by SCO Group Inc., the small software maker suing IBM over the use of code for the Linux operating system. The first version of the worm was designed to attack the website of SCO, which has drawn of ire of Linux advocates.																								MyDoom, also known as Novarg or Shimgapi, has infected computers around the globe by enticing users to open a file attachment that releases a programme that potentially allows other attackers to gain unauthorised access. Computer security experts got a little closer to finding the perpetrator, who apparently signed the worm with the name Andy.																								Theres no way to tell if thats the authors real name, said Craig Schmugar, a virus research manager at Network Associates Incs McAfee anti-virus unit. Schmugar said MyDoom also contained a message from the author: Im just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry.																								Computers infected by the worm can be turned into launchpads for other attacks.																								Network Associates said the number of infected computers more than doubled to 400,000 or 500,000 as of yesterday, up from Wednesdays estimate of 100,000 to 200,000 machines.																								Computer security vendor Symantec Corp. has detected thousands of attempts to contact infected computers. MyDoom, which is designed to entice the recipient of an e-mail to open an attachment with an .exe, .scr, .zip or .pif extension, are a form of spam, often with official-looking subject lines and addresses, leading many into believing they are from network administrators.																								Computers running any of the latest versions of Microsofts Windows operating system e-mail programme are at risk of being infected.

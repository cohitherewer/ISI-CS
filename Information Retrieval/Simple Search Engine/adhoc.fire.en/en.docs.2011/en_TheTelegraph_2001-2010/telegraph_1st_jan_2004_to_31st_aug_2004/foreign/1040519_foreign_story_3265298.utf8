 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Japan terms for Lanka aid
																								Colombo, May 18 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers pressed an envoy from Japan  the islands biggest donor  for more aid today, but were told the government and rebels must express a genuine interest in the peace bid to end 20 years of war.																								The meeting with Yasushi Akashi follows a string of visits by peace broker Norway that have raised hopes the LTTE and the new government can restart peace talks the rebels suspended more than one year ago.																								Mr Thamilselvan reiterated that for the peace process to be sustainable, it is very essential that the dividends of peace assured to the war-affected people in the Tamil homeland should be delivered without delay, the LTTE said on its lttepeacesecretariat.com website, referring to political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan.																								Although a Norwegian-brokered truce has been holding since February 2002, the Tigers pulled out of direct talks in April last year saying not enough was being done to rehabilitate areas of the Tamil-majority north and east devastated by the war.																								They also refused to attend a donor conference in Japan last June, where donors pledged $4.5 billion for rebuilding.																								But the LTTE website said Akashi reminded the rebels assistance was contingent on progress to end the war that killed 64,000, and that they should demonstrate the genuineness of their interest in the peace process.																								Thamilselvan said the rebels were waiting for a statement from Norway.																								 The LTTEs chief negotiator said last week Norway would announce in a day or two details on when and where to restart peace talks , but there has been no announcement so far.

 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 8-yr-olds can also wear lenses: Study
																								Washington, July 29 (Reuters): Children as young as eight can handle the responsibility of wearing contact lenses, US researchers reported yesterday, opposing conventional wisdom of optometrists that children under 12 not use lenses.																								A three-month study of 10 nearsighted children showed nine of them handled daily disposable contact lenses with little trouble, according to the Journal of Optometry and Vision Science.																								Many parents dont realise that their 8-year-old child can handle the responsibility of contact lenses, so they dont think to ask, said Jeffrey Walline, an optometry researcher at Ohio State University.

 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 BBC revamps journalism guidelines
																								London, June 23 (Reuters): The BBC revamped its journalism guidelines today in response to a bruising fight with the British establishment over its Iraq war coverage.																								Eager to protect its reputation as one of the worlds most respected broadcasters despite a judicial savaging over a May, 2003 Iraq report, the publicly funded BBC also announced the creation of its own journalism training college.																								It is a template for strengthening BBC journalism, new director-general Mark Thompson said of the recommendations contained in the Neil Report commissioned after judge Lord Huttons criticism. 																								Hutton exonerated Prime Minister Tony Blair but lambasted the BBC in his January report into the death of a British scientist who committed suicide after being outed as the source of a radio report that officials hyped Iraqs weapons threat.																								Hutton said the report was unfounded and the BBCs editorial system defective. That prompted an apology from the BBC, the resignation of its chairman and director-general, and anger and soul-searching among its 28,000 staff.																								The BBCs crisis  the worst in its eight-decade history  echoed pressure on other big western media over standards.																								Most notably, the New York Times last year fired reporter Jayson Blair for fabricating and plagiarising material.

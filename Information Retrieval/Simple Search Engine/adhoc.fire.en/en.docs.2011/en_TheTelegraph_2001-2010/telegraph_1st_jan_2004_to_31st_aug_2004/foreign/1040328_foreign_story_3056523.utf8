The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 China angered by huge Taipei protest
				 	 Opposition supporters protest near a replica of the statue of liberty in Taipei. (AFP)																								Taipei, March 27 (Reuters): In Taiwans biggest protest, half-a-million supporters of defeated presidential challenger Lien Chan jammed Taipei today to dispute his loss, and China said it would not tolerate turmoil on the island.																								A sea of yellow raincoats filled the square around the office of President Chen Shui-bian as demonstrators defied a chilly drizzle to demand a recount in last Saturdays poll, which Chen won by 30,000 votes out of more than 13 million cast.																								Dressed in black for mourning and standing in front of a huge sign reading: Democracy is Dead, Lien told the crowd he wanted a recount in the islands third ever direct presidential vote and an inquiry into the election-eve assassination attempt against Chen that he said cost him victory.																								In defiant mood, Chen vowed to step down at once if his rival could prove the failed assassination in which a bullet gashed his abdomen had been staged and challenged Lien to find the worlds best sniper to re-enact the shooting.																								If they can create the same kind of wound, A-Bian will immediately resign from the presidency, he told Lien and his running mate, James Soong.																								The re-elected President countered Liens demands, offering to agree to a retallying of last Saturdays hotly disputed vote if Lien Chan filed a lawsuit contesting the result																								The political crisis has paralysed one of Asias most vibrant economies and the stock market dipped 10 per cent last week.																								Lien taunted the President. Our common demands are very simple: immediate recount. I want to ask Mr Chen Shui-bian: what are you afraid of? Stand up!. Chen was unruffled.																								There is no need for the other side to provide evidence, he told his first news conference since winning a second four-year term, agreeing to a recount by legal process.																								Chen can agree immediately because he would be the defendant in any such lawsuit, which can now be filed after the election commission officially declared the result on Friday.																								But the Presidents voice shook with rage when he described his humiliation at suspicions he staged the mysterious shooting that many believe swung the closely fought election. I never staged this shooting incident and there is nothing to hide, Chen said.																								Chen and Vice-President Annette Lu were both slightly wounded by two bullets from a homemade gun as they campaigned in southern Tainan on the afternoon before the election. No arrest has been made but police yesterday issued grainy security video of a balding middle-aged man in yellow jacket and blue trousers who left the scene in haste on a motorcycle.

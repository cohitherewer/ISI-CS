(Reuters)																								Islamabad, June 18: Pakistani security forces killed a top tribal warrior for sheltering al Qaida militants in an overnight swoop on his hideout in a remote area bordering Afghanistan, officials said today.																								Nek Mohammad, who was described by military officials as an al Qaida facilitator, was reportedly using a satellite phone in Wana, the administrative headquarters of South Waziristan, when the house in which he was staying was hit by army rockets, officials said.																								Mohammad, who had launched an attack on Pakistani security forces in early June, was staying at a friends house in a small village about 2 km from Wana. During the past two days, Mohammad had been interviewed by the BBC which helped the security forces to track him down and carry out the precise missile strike that killed Mohammad and four of his supporters.																								Although the Pakistan army claimed credit for the killing, military analysts believed the Americans, who are stationed 24 km away on the Afghan side, may have provided Mohammads exact location for the precise attack.																								Pakistan armys chief spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan said the authorities had been following his movements ever since the pardon, that was given to him in April, was revoked earlier this month.																								We will continue to hunt down the miscreants, Sultan said. He also asked other miscreants to get surrender unconditionally or face the military.																								Mohammad and four of his accomplices had been pardoned under the April 24 peace deal signed between them and the government.																								In return, they had pledged not to indulge in terrorist activities against Afghanistan or Pakistan.																								Following differences over the surrender or registration of foreigners hiding in the tribal region, Mohammads pardon was revoked and the government vowed to hunt down all Taliban and al Qaida backers.																								Interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat told parliament that the government troops have killed at least 65 militants in the operation that began on June 9 following rocket attacks on army and paramilitary posts in the area. 																								President Pervez Musharraf had earlier claimed 400-500 al Qaida suspects, including some high-value targets, had taken refuge near the Afghan border.																								It (the killing of Nek Mohammad) is a big achievement as it will help efforts being taken against terrorists not only in South Waziristan but in other parts of the country, Hayat said.																								Reports from Wana said Mohammads body was taken to his native town of Kaloosha for burial. Reports said at least ten thousand mourners attended his funeral. 																								During the latest operation which began earlier last week, the army has destroyed at least three hideouts of al Qaida and Taliban militants in different parts of South Waziristan.

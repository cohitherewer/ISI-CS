 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Clashes erupt in Dhaka
																								Dhaka, Feb. 12 (Reuters): The Bangladesh Opposition Awami League called for another strike after a policeman died and about 100 people, including a former minister, were injured today in clashes with police during a day-long stoppage in the capital.																								Police used batons and teargas to disperse stone-throwing protesters, but Awami leaders accused authorities of deliberately provoking what they said had been a peaceful rally.																								Police said one of their officers collapsed while on strike duty and was rushed to a Dhaka hospital where doctors declared him dead. Inspector Abu Sayeed Khan died of apparent heart failure, one of his colleagues said. Among those hurt in the capital was a former minister, Saber Hossain Chowdhury, who was taken to the hospital.																								We have called for another day-long, country-wide strike on Saturday in protest against todays police actions against our leaders and workers, Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil said. The strike, intended to force elections earlier than the October 2006 due date, disrupted transport and closed offices and businesses.

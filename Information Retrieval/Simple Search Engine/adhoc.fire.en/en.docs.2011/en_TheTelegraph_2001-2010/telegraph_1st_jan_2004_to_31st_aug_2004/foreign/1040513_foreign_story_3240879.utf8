The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Spanish film opens Cannes
				 	 Aishwarya Rai during the opening ceremony of the 57th Cannes film festival. (AFP)Cannes, May 12 (Reuters): Cannes rolled out the red carpet today for Spanish director Pedro Almodovar who launched the 2004 film festival with a dark tale of child abuse by the Catholic Church.																								Critics raved about La Mala educacion, billed as Bad Education for English-speaking audiences, and fans screamed for Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal, dubbed Sex Mex by the French press for his smouldering good looks and hot performance in the earlier international hit Y tu mama tambien.																								It was the first time a Spanish film had ever opened the worlds most famous film festival and Almodovar said: My film may not be in competition here but opening the Cannes Film Festival is a prize in itself.																								The audience, usually treated to a frothy comedy or rollicking adventure on Cannes opening night, were this time served up a film noir cast of paedophile priests and drug-raddled transvestites.																								Traditionally the gala is the epitome of chic in this elegant French Riviera resort  even the paparazzi must wear tuxedos to film the stars arriving at the Palais des Festivals.																								Rain soaked the red carpet but the organisers were smiling with relief after one major black cloud was lifted  part-time French showbusiness workers called off protests planned over welfare benefit cuts. 																								Now Cannes, last called off in 1968 at the height of student-worker protests, can look forward to 12 days of fierce competition for the coveted Palme dOr. Heading the jury is American film director Quentin Tarantino who declared:To me, Cannes is just heaven.																								Cannes can look forward to a hefty dose of Hollywood glamour with Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Will Smith and Charlize Theron jetting in to publicise their latest films to a captive audience of 5,000 showbusiness reporters.																								Cannes has been criticised in the past for demonstrating a penchant for intellectual auteur movies that please only the most ardent film buffs.																								But artistic director Thierry Fremaux has gone much more mainstream this year with populist entries like Shrek 2, the follow-up to the worldwide animation hit.																								In its 57th year, Cannes fascination with Hollywood shows no sign of fading but it has always prided itself on also providing a potent mix of world cinema from Thailand to Bosnia. 																								Hollywood has acknowledged the enormous pulling power of Cannes in attracting an international audience to the big summer movies so beloved of American audiences. Over the last three years, the Hollywood big guns have rolled out Star Wars, Terminator and Matrix movies. This year it is the turn of the new sword-and-sandals epic Troy.

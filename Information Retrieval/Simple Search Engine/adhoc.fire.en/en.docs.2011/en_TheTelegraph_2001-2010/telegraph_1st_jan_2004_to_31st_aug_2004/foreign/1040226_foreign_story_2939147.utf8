 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Putin keeps Russia guessing
																								Moscow, Feb. 25 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin kept Russia guessing today over his choice for Prime Minister after sacking the government in a move that seemed aimed at reviving national interest in his re-election bid next month.																								Putin fired Mikhail Kasyanov, his Premier since early 2000, yesterday, less than three weeks before a March 14 presidential contest which Putin is favoured to win by a landslide.																								Seeking to assert control over the course of the economy, Putin said he acted to set post-election priorities. Under the constitution Putin enjoys considerable powers, leaving the Prime Minister responsible for overseeing the economy.																								Markets took the dismissal in stride for a second straight day. The RTS benchmark stock index had climbed 0.89 per cent in mid-day trading and the rouble currency was all but unchanged.																								Some commentators interpreted Putins action as motivated by Kremlin concern that the election  its outcome a foregone conclusion  could be threatened by voter apathy.																								It is said that these are not elections but a clear farce, with no point in taking part... and most of the public shows very little interest, wrote the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets.

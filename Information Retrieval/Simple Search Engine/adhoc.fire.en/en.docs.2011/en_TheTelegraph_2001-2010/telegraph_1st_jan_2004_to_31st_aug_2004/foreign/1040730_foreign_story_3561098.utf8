 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Defiant Iran resumes nuke testing
																								Vienna, July 29 (Reuters): Iran has defied international pressure and resumed testing a facility for converting uranium, a key part of the process of enriching the element for use as fuel or in a nuclear bomb, diplomats said today.																								The EUs big three  France, Britain and Germany  strongly criticised Iran when it tested the site in March, saying it sent the wrong signal and would make it harder for Tehran to regain international confidence.																								The EU three were due to meet Iranian officials in Paris to discuss Tehrans nuclear programme. The US says Iran is stringing the international community along with talks over its nuclear programme while buying time to make an atomic bomb. 																								Iran denies the charge, saying it is only interested in generating electricity.																								While Iran said in April it intended to run the tests at its uranium conversion facility near the central city of Isfahan, the move snubs a request by the UN nuclear watchdog for it not to test the site.																								The testing would produce a small amount of uranium hexafluoride, the gas which is pumped into centrifuges to obtain enriched uranium, one western diplomat said.																								They are testing the equipment. As a by-product, some UF6 (uranium hexafluoride) is produced, he said.																								The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog declined to comment.

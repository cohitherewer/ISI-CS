 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Insurers warned: Sharon threat to kill Arafat
Ariel Sharon (top) and Yasser Arafat. (AFP) Jerusalem, April 2 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon today threatened his long-time foe Yasser Arafat with assassination, calling the Palestinian President a poor insurance risk.																								The US said it opposed the assassination of the veteran Palestinian leader. The Israeli army killed three Palestinians in separate incidents in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while in Jerusalems Old City, police stormed the square outside al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islams holiest sites. 																								Israeli police said officers used rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse Palestinian stone-throwers and arrested 14 after Friday prayers. Adnan Husseini, director of the Islamic Waqf, which oversees the compound, said about 60 people were wounded, including three journalists. He said police acted without provocation and called the Israeli action a flagrant violation of freedom of worship.																								Sharon made his most explicit threat yet against Arafat in newspaper interviews 10 days after Israel assassinated Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in a helicopter strike in Gaza. He also directed the warning at Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanons Hizbollah guerrilla group. I wouldnt suggest either one of them should feel secure. I wouldnt propose that any insurance company give them coverage, Sharon told Israels Haaretz daily. Anyone who kills a Jew or harms an Israeli citizen, or sends someone to kill Jews, is a marked man. Period.																								Arafat, holed up in his battered headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, denies involvement in violence. 																								Responding to Sharons threats, deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage said in Washington: Our position on such questions  the exile or assassination of Yasser Arafat  is very well known. We are opposed and we have made that very clear to the government of Israel.																								An Israeli-Arab legislator who visited Arafat said the Palestinian leader dismissed the threat saying: Sharon has tried to kill me 13 times and failed. Im not an easy mark.																								Palestinian cabinet minister Saeb Erekat said of Sharons remarks that the alternative to Arafat would be chaos, extremism and anarchy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.																								Israels government declared in September that Arafat should be removed. But Arafat, 74, has scoffed at such threats saying he would welcome martyrdom. Sharon, moreover, has acknowledged he has promised the United States not to harm Arafat.

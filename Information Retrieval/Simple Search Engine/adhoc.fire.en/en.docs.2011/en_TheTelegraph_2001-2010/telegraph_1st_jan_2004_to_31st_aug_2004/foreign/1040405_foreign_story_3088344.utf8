 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 25 killed in Iraq clashes
 Kufa (Iraq), April 4 (Reuters):  Spanish-led troops and Iraqi police fought a three-hour  gun battle with Shia militiamen near Najaf that left 20  Iraqis and four Salvadoran soldiers dead today, witnesses  and medical officials said.																								In Baghdad, clashes between US soldiers and Shias killed at least one Iraqi and wounded many. As night fell, fighting continued in the poor Sadr City district as locals set two Humvees ablaze and hid behind walls waiting to fire rockets.																								The shooting in Najaf began after protesting militiamen marched on a Spanish-run military base in Kufa, near Najaf, to denounce the arrest of an aide to a radical Shia cleric and the closure by US officials of a militant Baghdad newspaper.																								In a statement from Madrid, Spains defence ministry said four soldiers from El Salvador, fighting alongside the Spanish, had been killed and nine wounded. Dr Falah al-Numhna, Najafs director general for health, said 20 Iraqis were killed and at least 200 wounded. He said at least two Iraqi police were among the dead.																								The violence was likely to heighten a charged mood in Spain, where 191 people were killed last month by bombs blamed on Islamists. The newly-elected Socialists have vowed to withdraw the 1,300 Spanish troops from Iraq unless the UN takes charge.																								A spokesperson for the Spanish military in Iraq told Spanish radio the militiamen had opened fire first, attacking the base with gunfire from at least three positions. Coalition troops then returned fire, he said.																								Witnesses said the demonstrators, many of them armed, had thrown stones at a military vehicle arriving at the base and shortly afterwards Spanish-led troops and Iraqi police at the base had opened fire on the crowd from several directions.																								Black-clad members of the Mehdi Army, a banned militia loyal to radical anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, returned fire at the heavily-defended garrison. Fighting continued for around three hours. A Reuters correspondent said most of the dead he saw were wearing uniforms of the Mehdi Army.																								Sadr, 30, called on supporters to stop protests. He said he would stage a sit-in in Kufa mosque and not give in until his demands were met. Terrorise your enemy, God will reward you well for what pleases him. It is not possible to remain silent in front of their abuse, his statement said.																								In Kirkuk, a suicide car bomber wounded two US soldiers and five Iraqis at a pro-Sadr protest. There were also protests in Basra and Nassiriya.

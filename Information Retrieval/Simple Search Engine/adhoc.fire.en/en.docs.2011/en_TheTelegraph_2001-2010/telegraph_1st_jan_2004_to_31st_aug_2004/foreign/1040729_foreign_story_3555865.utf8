				 	 John Kerry in a clean suit while touring the space shuttle Discovery at Nasas Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. (AP)																								Norfolk (Virginia), July 28 (Reuters): Republicans distributed a photo of Democratic candidate John Kerry wearing a head-to-toe protective suit yesterday in comparison to a famously unflattering photograph of Michael Dukakis in a tank that helped sink his presidential bid in 1988.																								Late-night comedians made fun of the picture and President George W. Bushs re-election campaign e-mailed it under the caption Earth to Kerry. Bubble Boy, read the headline on the front page of the Boston Herald, a newspaper that has not been a supporter of Kerry.																								The photograph was taken on Monday at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, when Kerry along with astronauts-turned-US senators John Glenn of Ohio and Bill Nelson of Florida were required by Nasa to wear the precautionary suits to tour the Discovery shuttle due to launch in March.																								To enter the orbiter and the cockpit area where commanders sit, Kerry, Glenn and Nelson had to go through a white room, and don the special suits. Dukakis, the former Democratic governor of Massachusetts who was soundly beaten by Bushs father, held a photo opportunity riding in a tank to bolster his image. 																								The picture of the large tank with Dukakis helmeted head sticking out of the gun turret was the butt of many jokes.

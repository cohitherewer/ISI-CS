 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 Posh smiles, Loos spills bedtime stories

(AFP, Reuters) 																								London, April 20: Victoria Beckham, clinging to her husband David, last night made her first official appearance in public since claims of his infidelity emerged.																								A few miles away, Rebecca Loos, the England football captains former PA, was being interviewed on the Richard and Judy television programme, repeating her allegations of an affair in Spain with him. 																								She blamed the former Spice Girl for what she alleges happened, saying: If there hadnt been a gap in that bed, I wouldnt have been in it.																								Last night, as ever, the Beckhams relied on pictures to speak louder than words with the Real Madrid star showing off his savagely cropped new hairstyle and sporting a large crucifix. His wife was wearing a bosom-enhancing bustier and a wide, fixed grin.																								They declined to comment as they arrived at the Royal Albert Hall, where Victoria was due to sing at a party for her management company, but they did manage a show of unity with Beckham kissing his wife on the forehead as she beamed for the cameras. It was enough to give any body language analysts present much to chew over.																								Beckham has dismissed Loos claims as ludicrous and his lawyers are said to be considering legal action over her claims and those of a self-professed earlier lover, a Malaysian-born escort girl, Sarah Marbeck.																								But like Banquos ghost in Shakespeares Macbeth, Loos, the spectre who has haunted them since her first Sunday tabloid revelations appeared a fortnight ago, made an unwanted return last night.																								Loos, who was Beckhams PA when he arrived at Real Madrid following his transfer from Manchester United last year, sported oversized shades made fashionable by Victoria and a green pashmina as she arrived to be interviewed on Richard and Judy. She said the alleged fling might actually be good for the marriage. Describing it as a mere hiccup for the Beckhams, she said she hoped the marriage would survive. Every relationship goes through hiccups. Thats what keeps a relationship strong and keeps it going in many ways, she said.																								When Judy Finnigan asked her if she agreed that the player had been vulnerable and lonely because his wife was concentrating on her music career and had not moved to Spain, Loos replied: To a great extent I would, yes. I feel that if there hadnt been a gap in that bed I wouldnt have been in it.																								Asked if she felt guilty about the alleged affair, she replied: I did play a part in it. Co-presenter Richard Madeley spluttered: Fifty per cent of it, love.																								Loos claimed Beckham had insisted to her she was the only other woman in his life. We were in bed and I said: You must have had so many lovers, she said. He said: No, of course not, Im far too much of a public figure. Loos said she had stupidly believed his claims. 																								She had never set out to kiss and tell. I didnt fall for the England captain, I didnt fall for the image, I fell for the man behind that, she insisted.																								She laughed off suggestions that she was to make 1 million for her story, claiming the real figure was nowhere near that sum. But her publicist, Max Clifford, had earlier claimed she had made 800,000 so far.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

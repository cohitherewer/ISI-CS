 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Ranil confident of mandate
																								Colombo, March 24 (Reuters): Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, facing a tough re-election fight, said today he expects a huge undecided vote to shift his way, giving him a mandate to restart peace talks with Tamil rebels.																								Wickremesinghe, who signed a ceasefire with the Tamil Tigers shortly after he took power in late 2001, said voters were caught off guard by the April 2 election called nearly four years early by rival President Chandrika Kumaratunga.																								The snap election took the people by surprise... As far as the numbers are concerned, I am quite confident that we will have an overall majority in parliament, said Wickremesinghe, who spoke to Reuters on his 55th birthday.																								Kumaratunga, who is not up for election, called the vote last month after seizing three ministries, including the defence ministry, in November.

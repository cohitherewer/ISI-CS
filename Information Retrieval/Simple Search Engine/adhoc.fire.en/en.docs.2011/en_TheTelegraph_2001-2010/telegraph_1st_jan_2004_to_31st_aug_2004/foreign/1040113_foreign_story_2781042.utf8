 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Saudi channel to boost image
																								Riyadh, Jan. 12 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia has launched an all-news satellite television channel to present a new image of the Gulf Arab state, portrayed in the West as a haven for Muslim militants, the stations director said today.																								Ikhbariya, inaugurated yesterday by the kingdoms first female news presenter, will broadcast in Arabic for 12 hours a day before stepping up to round-the-clock programming, director Mohammad Barayan said. We want to tell the world about our country, to give a new image, he said. The American media... put out things about Saudi Arabia that are not true  like Saudi Arabia is not fighting fundamentalists. 																								Saudi Arabia has faced fierce criticism from US media since the September 11, 2001, attacks in the US which were carried out by mainly Saudi hijackers. Critics say the kingdom fuelled militancy by promoting anti-western sentiment in schools, giving radical clerics a platform and failing to stem the flow of funds to extremists, charges denied by officials who say they have cracked down hard on militants. Riyadh is battling a wave of attacks by suspected Muslim militants believed linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida group. Suicide attacks have killed more than 50 people since May 2003.																								Barayan said the state-owned channel would correct false perceptions, including some about the role of Saudi women. 																								Breaking new ground in the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom, yesterdays opening news bulletin was delivered by female presenter Buthaina al-Nasr, modestly dressed in black headscarf and white jacket. Some of the things they say about women in our country arent right. This channel will have women reading the news and will also discuss social issues related to women, he said.																								Saudi Arabia already has three terrestrial television channels, including one English-language station. But most Saudis ignore them in favour of livelier programmes aired by Arab satellite channels Al Jazeera in neighbouring Qatar and Al Arabiya in Dubai. 																								Although satellite television has never been formally legalised in Saudi Arabia it is widely watched across the country. Al Jazeera is a favourite, though its correspondents have been barred by the Saudi government that was angered by some of its reports. Ikhbariya has around 25 correspondents in Saudi Arabia and another 20 abroad, Barayan said. 																								Although the new channel was likely to transmit the same government-approved news as existing channels, its slicker presentation would attract viewers  at least in the kingdom.

 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Nation mourns Reagan
				 	 Nancy Reagan in Santa Monica, California. (AFP)																								Los Angeles, June 7 (Reuters): Crowds gathered before dawn to pay respects to Ronald Reagan today at the start of a week of tribute to the 40th US President, hailed as unfailingly kind and courteous during a stewardship that hastened the end of the Cold War and revived American spirits.																								Though the skies were overcast and temperatures cool, people queued up at a community college near the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, waiting to be shuttled to the casket of the former President, who died on Saturday at the age of 93 of pneumonia and after a long battle with Alzheimers disease.																								Dozens of buses were on hand to carry a steady stream of mourners, expected to number in the thousands, from the college to the western-themed library where the former President will be laid to rest at the end of the week.																								Traders at the New York Stock Exchange marked Reagans memory with two minutes of silence after the opening bell at 1330 GMT. Similar tributes were expected across the country.																								Reagans vice-president through two terms, former President George Bush, hailed the Republican icon for reshaping the party into a dominant, conservative political force. History will show that because he was a true... conservative, Bush said on NBCs Today show. Reagan was unfailingly kind and courteous and thoughtful to the people around him, Bush added.																								Hed no more walk by the guy running the elevator without asking him how his family was than fall off a cliff. And it was that kind personal side that I think endeared him to the American people whether they were Republicans, Democrats, liberals or conservatives.																								After a private ceremony for family and close friends at the library, there will be a public viewing for 30 hours, after which his body will be flown to Washington. 																								The father of Soviet Perestroika reform, Mikhail Gorbachev, praised Reagan, his partner on the world stage, as a great leader who dared to change the tide in relations between the Cold War superpowers. Gorbachev said his dialogue with Reagan kick-started the process, which ultimately put an end to the Cold War.																								Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  dubbed the Iron Lady to Reagans Great Communicator called him a truly great American hero. She is expected to attend the funeral.

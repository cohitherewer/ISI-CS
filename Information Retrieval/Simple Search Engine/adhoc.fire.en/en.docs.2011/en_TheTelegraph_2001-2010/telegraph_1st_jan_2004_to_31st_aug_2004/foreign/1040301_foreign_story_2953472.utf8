 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 On the bench
London, Feb. 29 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair once slept rough on a bench after travelling to London in a failed bid to become a rock star, newspapers reported today.																								Blair slept in the open near Londons Euston railway station for one night in 1971, the year before he went to university to study law, the Sunday Mirror said. His wife, Cherie, told the story at a reception for a British homeless charity.																								She appeared to break away from the prepared text of her speech, one unnamed guest told the newspaper.

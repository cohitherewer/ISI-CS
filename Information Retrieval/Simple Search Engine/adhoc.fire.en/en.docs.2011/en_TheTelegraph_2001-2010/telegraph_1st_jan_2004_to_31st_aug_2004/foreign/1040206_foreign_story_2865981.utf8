 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Pervez pardons national hero
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Feb. 5: Pakistans president Prevez Musharraf today pardoned a scientist who admitted leaking nuclear arms secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea but said he still regarded him as a national hero, my hero.																								Musharraf read out the clemency order, which had earlier recommended the pardon, at a press conference that he described as historic and something on the heels of a crisis.																								He (Dr Khan) has been the hero for all Pakistanis, and my hero as well because he made Pakistans defence impregnable, Musharraf told editors and columnists gathered in the auditorium of his Rawalpindi residence. 																								There is no denying the fact that Dr Khan gave Pakistan dignity, honour and a tool of survival, Musharraf said in reference to the countrys nuclear capability. However, Musharraf added that Khan had made mistakes when he was in control of the nuclear programme which had enjoyed complete financial and administrative autonomy. 																								Admired at home as the father of Pakistans atomic bomb, Khan yesterday apologised for having indulged in nuclear proliferation in a televised statement saying it was based on good faith but an error of judgment. 																								He conceded that many of the reported activities did occur and the deals were inevitably initiated at his behest. Musharraf said: We were faced with the choice of saving a national hero or the country... had I tried to save the hero only, it would have damaged the country.

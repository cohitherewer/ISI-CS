 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Bird flu detected in China
																								Beijing, July 6 (Reuters): Bird flu has been detected in central China and the outbreak blamed on migratory birds, an agriculture ministry official and state media said today, about four months after China declared victory over the virus.																								Authorities have started culling poultry within a three-km radius of a chicken farm in Chaohu city in Anhui after the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of bird flu emerged near Chaohu lake, the official said by telephone. 																								But there have been no human infections, the official said. He declined to give further details. Anhui officials could not be reached for comment.																								Migratory birds were to blame, state television said. Poultry within a six-km radius was being vaccinated.																								We are concerned about the possible spread of this outbreak as we are with any outbreak, WHO spokesman Roy Wadia said by telephone, hours after the Chinese government informed the WHO of the outbreak.																								Thailand said today it is investigating a possible fresh outbreak of bird flu after 600 chickens at a farm near the capital died within a few days.

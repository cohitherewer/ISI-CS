 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 New bid to halt Pak clashes
																								Wana, March 24 (Reuters): Pakistani tribal elders tried today to secure the release of 14 government men as part of efforts to negotiate a halt to a bloody week-long battle between troops and al Qaida fighters.																								But even as the elders were trying to end the fighting in the wild South Waziristan tribal area on the Afghan border, militants appeared to be stepping up attacks elsewhere in an effort to divert government forces. 																								Pakistans army said it had surrounded hundreds of Pakistani tribal fighters and their foreign militant allies, perhaps including Uzbek and Chechen militant leaders, but officials acknowledged that some might have escaped. Scores of soldiers, militants and civilians have been killed since the battle erupted early last week as security forces hunted al Qaida suspects and their tribal allies.																								Elders have tried for three days to persuade the tribal fighters to surrender, hand over the foreign militants and release the 14 soldiers and officials thought to have been captured at the start of the clashes. The latest team of elders to go and meet the militants had demanded progress on the release of the detainees by 0500 GMT tomorrow, a top security official said.																								Asked what would happen if the 14 were not freed by then, Brigadier Mamood Shah, the regions security chief, said it would be up to a council of elders, or jirga, to decide how to deal with their fellow tribal miscreants. 																								Shah said the area where the 14 were being held had been surrounded and none of the foreign fighters could escape.

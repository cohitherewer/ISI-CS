 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Iran lifts freeze 
																								Tehran, March 15 (Reuters): Iran will allow the resumption of UN nuclear inspections, which it halted last week in protest at a tough resolution on its atomic programme, Irans chief nuclear negotiator was quoted as saying today. Irans decision to freeze nuclear inspections has fuelled US charges Tehran is trying to hide parts of its extensive nuclear sector because it has a secret programme to build an atom bomb. Negotiator Hassan Rohani, secretary-general of Irans Supreme National Security Council, did not specify when inspectors from the UNs International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be allowed back.																								We will definitely reach an agreement with the agency on the resumption of inspections, the official Irna news agency quoted Rohani as saying ahead of an official visit to Japan.																								However, the IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei said he spoke with the Iranians today and they told him the freeze on inspections would be lifted so they could resume on March 27.

 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Canada gets a piece of Iraq pie
																								Monterrey (Mexico), Jan. 13 (Reuters): In a policy reversal, US President George W. Bush said today that Canadian firms would be allowed to bid for some of the $18.6 billion in US-funded reconstruction projects for Iraq.																								The previous US position was that only those countries whose troops risked lives along with US soldiers would be eligible for bidding on the projects, although US officials had signalled some flexibility after an international outcry. 																								Appearing with new Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, Bush said he told Martin that Canadian firms would be eligible to bid on major projects when a second round is awarded.																								They want Iraq to succeed, Bush said of the Canadians. They want Iraq to be free. They understand the stakes with having a free country in the midst of West Asia. Martin welcomed the change. I think that the breakthrough that was made was really quite significant ... I very very much believe Canadian companies will bid and that they will be successful bidders, Martin said after his first meeting with Bush as Canadas new leader. The second round of contracts is expected to include about $6 billion in non-construction work to rebuild Iraq, likely including equipment, democracy-building projects and grants.

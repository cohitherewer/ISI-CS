The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 US rewards Libya, lifts travel curbs
				 	 Libyan Prime Minister Shokri Ghanem (Reuters)																								Washington, Feb. 26 (Reuters): The US today lifted a travel ban on Libya and will allow some American firms to negotiate deals in the country as it welcomed Tripolis progress on getting rid of illicit weapons.																								The Bush administration took the further step of allowing Libya to set up a diplomatic presence in Washington.																								The moves came a day after Libya retracted statements by Libyan Prime Minister Shokri Ghanem, who had denied his countrys guilt in the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing.																								After Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in December pledged to disclose and dismantle all his countrys nuclear, chemical and biological programs, the US has held out the prospect of fully normalised ties at some point.																								The comments from Ghanem had caused the announcement on the lifting of travel restrictions to be delayed by two days but the extent of the steps taken by the Bush administration showed the US wants to respond in kind to the pace of Libyan efforts.																								Over the course of the last two months, Libya has taken significant steps in implementing its commitment to disclose and dismantle all weapons of mass destructions programme, the White House said in a statement. 																								The US said more remains to be done but it praised Libyas actions as serious, credible and consistent with Gaddafis pledges.																								Lifting the travel ban will allow US oil companies to travel to Tripoli to negotiate deals for the day that US trade sanctions are lifted. Libya is eager to bring US companies back, especially in the oil industry, its main source of foreign earnings.																								Ghanem had angered US officials by denying Libyas guilt in the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing and saying Tripoli had only agreed to pay damages to victims in order to buy peace.																								Libya was forced to issue a retraction yesterday, reverting to their position as stated last August. At the time Libya had sent a letter to the UN saying Libya helped bring two suspects charged with the bombing to justice and accepts responsibility for the actions of its officials.																								Libyas retraction yesterday clarified that their statement of August 15 still stands, said Sean McCormack, spokesman for the White House National Security Council. 																								But the clarification did little to soothe the anger of some of the families of the Lockerbie victims, who have been outraged by talk of normalising ties with Libya. For the Bush administration, Lockerbie is just an issue to get around. It is typical of the Libyans to say one thing one day and another the next, said Susan Cohen, whose daughter died in the bombing. She accused the administration of trying to whitewash Lockerbie and of making Gaddafi into a hero.																								 African leaders gather tomorrow for a summit to adopt a common defence policy and give the 53-nation African Union (AU) the right to intervene in armed conflicts across the continent, AU officials said.																								But they said the two-day meeting in Gaddafis hometown of Sirte would reject a Libyan proposal to disband all national armies in favour of one continental force.																								With fragile peace efforts in the continents many troublespots, there is international pressure on the AU to take an active lead in peacekeeping.																								African defence ministers who met this week in Sirte to prepare for the extraordinary summit finalised a document on African Common Defence and Security policy and Non-Aggression which heads of state and prime ministers will adopt with minor changes, diplomats and AU sources said. The document says wars and civil strifes are the main obstacles to development and turn would-be consumers and producers into millions of uprooted refugees.

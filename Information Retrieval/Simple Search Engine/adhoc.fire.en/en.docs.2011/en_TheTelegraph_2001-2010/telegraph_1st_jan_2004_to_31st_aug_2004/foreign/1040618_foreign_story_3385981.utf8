 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Son plea for deal to save American hostage
																								Washington, June 17 (Reuters): The son of an American taken hostage in Saudi Arabia pleaded today to the White House and Saudi officials to cut a deal with kidnappers from al Qaida who have threatened to kill his father by tomorrow.																								I just want to ask the President of the US and the Saudi officials to please make this happen. Fathers Day is right here. Bring my father home for Fathers Day, said a visibly distraught Paul Johnson, son of kidnapped aviation engineer Paul Marshall Johnson.																								Clutching a smiling picture of his father to his chest, Johnson struggled to hold back tears as he urged President George W. Bush and the Saudi authorities to save his father.																								I am just pleading. These are the people who can make this happen. Theyve got to make this happen. He just cant be another victim, Johnson told NBCs Today show.																								Al Qaida has given the Saudi government until tomorrow to release jailed militants or it will execute Johnson, who was kidnapped last week.																								Saudi official sources have said the kingdom would not give in to al Qaidas demands and the US has also said it will not be blackmailed.																								Johnson said he was in favour of Saudi authorities releasing some militants in return for his fathers freedom.																								I know they can make a deal to make it happen, said Johnson, adding that he did not think his fathers kidnappers wanted hundreds of people released. The Saudis owe it to him to bring him home alive, he added. 																								I believe the Saudis will get my father back, he said.

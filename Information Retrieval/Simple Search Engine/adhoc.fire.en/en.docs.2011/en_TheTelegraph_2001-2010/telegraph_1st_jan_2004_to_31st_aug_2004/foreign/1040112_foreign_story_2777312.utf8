The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Showdown in Iran after poll coup
				 	 Iranian reformist MPs protest in parliament on Sunday. (AFP)																								Tehran, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Angry Iranian reformists led by the President launched a fight for their political survival today after a hardline watchdog barred thousands of liberal candidates from running in next months parliamentary elections.																								The action of the hardline Guardian Council, described by one leading reformist as a coup detat, set reformists and conservatives on a collision course and could force the government to abandon the February 20 vote.																								Outraged reformers said the bans were bound to draw international fire and vowed to resist the powerful Guardian Council, a 12-member conservative body that has blocked scores of reform bills passed by parliament in recent years.																								Around 70 reformist MPs staged a sit-in at parliament and said they might boycott the election. The situation is like a football match in which the referee sends off one team and invites the other side to score, Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi told journalists.																								Guardian Council spokesperson Mohammad Jahromi, quoted by the official IRNA news agency, said 2,033 of the 8,200 aspiring candidates had been barred, but MPs said the figure was higher.																								President Mohammad Khatami said: I dont view these methods as compatible with the principles of religious democracy.																								He said he would hold talks with the Guardian Council and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word on all state issues.																								Reformist parties dominate parliament but MP Reza Yousefian said he was among more than 80 reformists, out of 290 members of parliament, who had been banned from seeking re-election.																								I believe this kind of disqualification is an illegal coup detat, a non-military regime change, senior reformist MP Mohsen Mirdamadi told reporters, adding that many MPs might resign in protest.																								The election is already set to be a test of popular patience with the toothless reform movement. Many young people say they will abstain in protest at the lack of social and economic reforms.																								Senior officials said Khamenei had been surprised by the number of aspiring candidates who had been disqualified.																								Mohammad Reza Khatami, the Presidents brother and head of Irans leading reformist party, was also barred. He said reformists might call on the government to scrap the election if the hardline vetoes were not overruled.																								Parliament will be turned into a focal point to confront these illegal moves, he said. This could damage Irans international relations...People will only participate in elections where they have a choice.																								Political analyst Hossein Rassam said he expected a compromise to be hammered out in coming weeks in which many of the vetoed candidates would, after all, be allowed to run.																								I doubt we will go into the vote with this many barred from running, he said.																								Reformist sources said many of the MPs had been barred for signing outspoken letters to Khamenei in recent months calling for democratic reforms.																								Newspapers said other candidates had been vetoed for drug taking and association with fringe political groups.

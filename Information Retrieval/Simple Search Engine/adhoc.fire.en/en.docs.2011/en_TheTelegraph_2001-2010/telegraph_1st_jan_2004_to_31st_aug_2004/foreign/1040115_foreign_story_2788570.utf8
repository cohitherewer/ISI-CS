(AFP)																								Washington, Jan. 13 (Reuters): Defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld today called a US military trial of Saddam Hussein unlikely but did not rule it out, and said the US reserved the right to change his prisoner-of-war legal status.																								Iraqs US-appointed governing council is setting up a war crimes tribunal to try the former Iraqi President, captured on December 13. The US-led Coalition Provisional Authority said last month it has trained Iraqi judges and lawyers to try Saddam and his entourage on charges that may include genocide and crimes against humanity.																								In Baquba, central Iraq, a car bomb blew up outside a police station today, killing two people and wounding around 30, local police, doctors and the US military said.																								Witnesses and a US soldier at the scene said the explosion was set off by a suicide car bomber but a military spokeswoman later said the blast appeared to have been remotely detonated.																								A suicide bomber in a green civilian sedan targeted the quick reaction police force, First Lieutenant Brian Elliott of the US 4th Infantry Division said at the scene, adding that there were at least two deaths and a number of casualties. It could have been much worse if he had got the car inside the compound, he said.																								During a Pentagon briefing, Rumsfeld publicly addressed Saddams status for the first time since the Pentagon announced on Friday that the US had declared the 66-year-old captive an enemy prisoner of war who was due a host of rights under the Geneva Convention.																								Asked whether the Bush administration intended to conduct a US military trial of Saddam or to turn him over to the Iraqi people for trial, Rumsfeld was non-commital, saying that my impression is that the President (George W. Bush) is leaning toward having the Iraqis play a significant role. Rumsfeld said a US military trial was into the lower end of the probability range, I would think.																								The Pentagon is in the final stages of preparations for US military trials of some of the foreign terrorism suspects being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Legal activists and human rights groups have sharply criticised the Pentagons rules for the tribunals, saying the rights of defendants were not sufficiently protected. Critics also have expressed concern over a possible trial of Saddam by Iraqis, saying Iraq under US occupation lacks the people and institutions for a fair trial and calling for proceedings before an international court.																								During the briefing, Rumsfeld said Saddam could be prosecuted for crimes against the Iraqi people, actions against the Kuwaiti people and actions against Iranians.																								Saddams forces invaded Kuwait in 1990 and used chemical weapons against Iranian troops during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.																								Saddams PoW classification may not be permanent, Rumsfeld suggested. His status can be reviewed at any time, more than once. And so as additional information or as decisions are made, that may be either changed or amplified.

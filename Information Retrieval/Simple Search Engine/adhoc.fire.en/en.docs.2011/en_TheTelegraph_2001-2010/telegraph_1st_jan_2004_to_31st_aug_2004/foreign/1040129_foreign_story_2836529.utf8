 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Pak chicken cull
																								Islamabad, Jan. 28 (Reuters): All chickens affected by bird flu in Pakistan must be destroyed, a state news agency cited a government order as saying today.																								The decision reached at a Cabinet meeting came after industry officials said millions of chickens were infected with the virus in Karachi but provincial officials insisted there was no need for a mass cull. The federal cabinet also imposed a ban on the import of chickens from suspected areas and the sale of chicken between provinces. 																								These measures have been taken to avoid the spread of bird flu that has infected chicken birds in Karachi and the adjoining areas, the official APP news agency quoted an official statement as saying, referring to the outbreak in southern Pakistan.																								Industry officials said the strains of bird flu detected in Karachi were milder than the deadly avian flu that has appeared across parts of east Asia and health officials said no people had been infected.
